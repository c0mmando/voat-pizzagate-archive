<p>This is not just about child trafficking unfortunately.

This is about how much the US population realizes how much the Mossad and GCHQ controls its government through blackmail thanks to the tireless efforts of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>It\'s an exceedingly delicate situation. Trump could release information tomorrow that would immediately prompt the British people to drag the Royal Family out of their palaces and burn them at the stake in front of the Tower of London.

He could tweet any one of a thousand pictures that would immediately cause an uprising in any number of countries around the world.

            I agree FBI Anon was the real thing, but even with all that insider knowledge, he is still just human. He talked about having a suicide pact with his wife if Hillary won, or being suicided if he was caught. He was a very stressed-out individual, and that could not help but influence his conclusions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there could very well be war, but so long as it isn't a US-Russia nuclear exchange, civilization will survive and the U.S. has the forces to keep itself safe. I admit that there could be civil war in the U.S. but I think that's actually more likely to happen in places like Saudi or Pakistan. Or France.
           </p>
           <p>
            The analogy I like best is the 30-year struggle in Sicily to get rid of the Mafia. The authorities would get the goods on a top guy; so the Mafia would blow up a highway just as the armed convoy carrying the judge in the case was passing (
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXZzCQ4_6hA">
             true story
            </a>
            ). But that wouldn't get the charges dropped, and another judge would come forward. People would refuse to pay the protection money, and get their businesses burned down; but then the whole town would donate funds to rebuild whatever business was destroyed, and put up stickers saying their business would not pay either (
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiopizzo">
             another true story
            </a>
            ). It was a long, slow, heartbreaking grind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Similarly here. If it does come to war, or civil war, well, those are the breaks. We cannot let fear of that outcome stop us. But personally, I am looking ahead to a couple of decades of volunteering and donating to citizens' organizations, doing the dirty, tedious work of keeping the politicians accountable, getting past the media roadblocks, debunking the fake news, and slowly but surely taking back the big media companies, the social media, the universities, and the federal, state, and city governments. I'm trying to see past the first spasm of chaos to the long-term changes that are needed, and I encourage everyone to try and do the same. What you are seeing here today is the start of a generation of effort.
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words, folks, try to breathe, and pace yourselves. This can be done, but it's going to take longer than you're probably hoping right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Oops, I referred to a "judge" above, but it was actually a prosecutor.

             It isn't the US vs Russia that bothers me. It's Israel. If it ever comes out that the Mossad did 9/11, that it does mass organ harvesting in secret and blackmails half the US administration through pedo operations, then the country will disappear off the face of the earth, no matter what the cost is. It will be scraped off and dumped into the Med.

              While we obviously don't know exactly what is in the files, my theory is that all these various rogue agencies and their scumbag criminal allies are very opportunistic and messy in their operations. Imagine what the Washington DC trafficking scene must look like, based on what little we know. Kids are brought in from Haiti or Africa or any number of places, AND kids are snatched off the streets in Maryland and Virginia, AND they're seized by CPS and handed over to pedo foster homes, AND there is grooming that leaves the kids where they are and just uses them, like Dennis Hastert and the congressional pages. All of this has been going on for decades, leaving evidence scattered everywhere. The players include the MS-13 gang, the Saudis, the state-level child protective services, NCMEC, the DC police, the 7th floor of the State Department, high-level Democrats like Podesta, low-level hangers-on like the people on Alefantis' Instagram who genuinely like being part of the scene, and people at FBI, CIA, NSA who do what they have to like FBI Anon. No one is firmly in charge, or knows everything. I submit that no one would deliberately plan something like this. Discipline is demonstrably poor among these alphabet soup agencies, they squabble like it's 1944 and they're the SS and the Gestapo.They're supposed to keep control of a crowd of Latino gang-bangers and paid-off cops and blood-drinking UFO-obsessed sadists, and then somehow Mossad is going to keep control of them? Recall that FBI Anon had a low opinion of the NSA, saying that it had vast amounts of data but did not actually know what it had.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am certainly willing to believe that Mossad blackmails some U.S. politicians. I haven't researched these stories about organ harvesting in Israel, but I'm willing to stipulate that there is something real behind them too. But this isn't a nice neat pyramid with someone at the top, following a master plan for world domination. The Jews aren't running America; nobody is running America. It's a ridiculous, horrible, global shitshow. The story in Canada, for example, seems to be that Pierre Trudeau was a pedo who narrowly avoided being taken down by a military coup, that Margaret Trudeau was subjected to MK Ultra mind control, and that Justin Trudeau is actually the son of Fidel Castro. I don't know which parts of that are true, but does any of it sound like it followed a coherent plan?
             </p>
             <p>
              Picture the Sopranos and how completely they were ruled by their screwed-up appetites, their fears, and their mutual antagonism. If you were to hand control of global surveillance and black ops to Big Pussy and Pauly and and waited twenty years, I think the result would be closer to what we are dealing with here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, just my two cents. I'm new here, not trying to squelch anyone else's argument.

               I think what we're seeing is glimpses of multiple operations run by different organisations, some of which are in a hierarchy and some not. 800 000 children go missing in the US every year. That is a staggering amount. Just the logistics alone of moving nearly a million kids from point A to point B, let alone via a bunch of other points and in secret, boggles the mind.

                True. But then on the bright side, that may be what finally brings the whole thing crashing down. It has just gotten too big to hide.

              Yes, there is, at least in the edited transcript that VOAT has been pointing to. I can't speak for the original, unedited 4chan threads, as I haven't gone through them in detail. See the section entitled "FBI Anon's safety" in

            We are to blame.  We voted in these politicians with their distracting "social programs", ie.  Health Care Programs, abortion rights (already legal), Clean Air - anti-tobacco, environment, etc.  All this while children were being sold into slavery, sexually abused, sacrificed or sold into servitude.  Every American that successfully voted in a politician to put these issues before the public and clog our political machines, slowed down the revelation of the children's freedom issue, although they also helped bring forth, clarified and put before the public these politicians, foisting them into the spotlight so that we may know them and know the evil they do.  We are all to blame and all to credit if we realize our errors.  It is time to refocus our politics and prioritize "Life" and "children" and "the individual's rights to life and happiness" highest amongst our nation's goals.  It is time for justice, yes, and I will not speak for clemency amongst evil individuals, only for a legal, reasoned approach to protecting the world's people.  We must remember, we all slowed things down, we all interfered, and we all played the fiddle while infants were burning.  A slow and reasoned approach is the only way to refocus who and what humanity will be from this day forward.

            And all the wars they ever started and used our men like expendable bodies in, were just fucking peachy????
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sorry but this is absolutely worth starting a war over. It would be a worthy and an actually admirable war for a change and not just another some bullshit war started under false pretences and lies. This war would be truly fought for real justice, for real actual extinguishing of evil, for actual change for the better... this would be a Nobel War based on a real foundation of truth, justice and a genuine love for mankind and desire for an actual optimistic future for every child where they are not preyed upon by vultures en mass, like a fucking epidemic plague. Quiet frankly I don't know why one has not already been started. I will fight a civil war over this shit. Enough  is enough. This is not right. It has to stop. Someone has to put their foot down with these people and get the message across to them - "STOP FUCKING STEALING OUR CHILDREN AND FUCKING TORTURING AND RAPING THEM TO DEATH YOU DIRTY ASS MOTHERFUCKING VILE SCUMS OF THE EARTH!!!! THIS IS NOT FUCKING OKAY!!! THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WHICH WE CAN COMPROMISE ON WITH FUCKING PEDOPHILES!!!"

            I don't need to be reminded of what any anon said.  The fact that you're depending on what some anonymous guy on 4chan claiming to be a fbi insider is ridiculous.   You been disappointed everytime?  Why ?  Because an anonymous source is no source at all.  End of story

             In the words of FBIanon himself, believe what you will. But he:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              predicted the exact date and time of a tweet from the FBI Vault twitter account
             </li>
             <li>
              predicted that close examination of the yet to be released Podesta emails would reveal something sinister using coded terminology
             </li>
             <li>
              predicted Trump would win with a 95% certainty
             </li>
             <li>
              accurately described an awful lot of details about the Clinton Foundation which were only dug up later
             </li>
            </ul>

             This was in July last year. That's why anyone with a functioning brain cell realized he was for real.

               Hey moron, why does Pizzagate even exist? Because FBIanon got a whole bunch of us looking in the right places MONTHS before the email evidence started coming out. If you haven't bothered to actually read what he originally claimed and then checked out his claims, then nothing I say is going to help you. You've already misrepresented what I posted so I guess basic comprehension isn't high on your list of skills.

                Lol,  spoken like someone who says something without backing it up with sourced evidence, then when called out on it, gets belligerent.  Once again to everyone here claiming to be a "researcher".  It's not up the reader to "look it up",  it's up to the person making the claim to source it.  So do that or stfu.  Seriously.

                 In the link I give to the wiki, the very first paragraph explains the reasons for trusting FBIanon. Here, I'll cut and paste it because you're too stupid to follow links to sources:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  To summarize how FBIAnon's got a reputation as being legitimate, there are a few obvious reasons; (s)he gave a lot of information that seemed to line up, and on top of that, the FBIRecordsVault twitter account[1] releasing the Clinton Investigation document on Nov 1st at 11am [2] after an anon on 4chan says "Nov 1st at 11am the house of cards collapses" and Wikileaks said phase 3 was hitting on nov 1. Even if that is all a coincidence, an FBI agent still released the Clinton Investigation document on Nov 1st out of the blue. At the least, the source is someone inside the FBI. FOIA requests are supposedly not added to their records vault, indicating that someone inside the FBI was involved in the unofficial leaks.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 TL;DR Fuck off.

           <p>
            Minus the civil war. No need for that. Whatever other country wants to fight the 'New Golden Aged USA' over this scandal, bring it on. When your cause is one as Righteous and Just as saving children from being torture and killed, nothing should make you back down.

            Fundamentally if Pizzagate is what FBI anon says it is then there is no going back for the pedophiles.

           <p>
            They are at war because they have to be at war to survive.

            And they are at war with all decent human beings who would fight to stop them and fight to bring their crimes to justice.

            By keeping it secret you are only blinding disarming and weakening the forces of good and justice. Placing your hand on the scales in favor of pedophiles in a war that is already happening.

            Pedophiles are everywhere. Pedophiles lie, cheat and steal for each other and that's the problem. It's a silent sickness and you never know who is infected.  We have to beat them at their own game. Infiltrate and sabotage. Don't tell anyone what your doing except maybe one person that would die for you. Like your mom.

            The original FBIanon on /pol/ also emphasized we should focus on the Clinton Foundation and the involved wrongdoing, not the email server narrative.  FBIanon also pointed us in the direction of human trafficking before pizzagate broke by mentioning that the CF operates in countries that keep inadequate birth records and vital statistics.

Saudi money invested here is a serious problem, but Civil War would be even a bigger one given the reality that those guilty of treason are also the same people who control our MIC/Intelligence.

            From the highest perspective this involves Global Warming and a 9 foot rise in ocean levels not in some far distant future, but in our near futures.  This is why the "Russians are coming!" and why "terrorism" is being created, and why false flag events have become so common.
If the public knew the reality of Global Warming it would be the end of capitalism in two minutes.

            I'm confident US public and people around the world will always see human trafficking, especially of children, as the most urgent issue....
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This is not just about child trafficking unfortunately. This is about hundreds of very famous people, including dozens of current and former world leaders, being exposed as the murderous, child-raping filth that they are. &lt;
            </p>

             Trump could release information over the weekend that would see a third of Congress either commit suicide or hand themselves over to the authorities. He could tweet any one of a thousand pictures that would immediately cause an uprising in any number of countries around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's an exceedingly delicate situation. Trump could release information tomorrow that would immediately prompt the British people to drag the Royal Family out of their palaces and burn them at the stake in front of the Tower of London. &gt;

            It is very likely, in my opinion, that the original FBI Anon from July was deep state car crashed on the morning of November 3rd, 2016. The WikiLeaks CIA dump adds even more credibility to the aspect of "means" - (means, motive, opportunity). Therefore anyone claiming to be FBI Anon after Nov 3rd is likely a different person.  Google "fbi tesla crash" for more info. also:

            Our justice system has been broken for a long fucking time, politicians are backed by the people at the top of the prison systems, and will never see a day in one, unless they publicly disgrace somebody more important.. Kind of like Anthony Wiener did.. He's going through the ringer.

            I don't agree with these scenarios. In indictments, the details of the case are made public, not every single details someone else did. So to imply that the entire government would have to implicated is ridiculous and makes me question anything else that's said. If the Cannibal Queen and her alleged rapist husband a long with the Pedos-tas were indicted, arrested and sent to jail, the rest would duck undercover.

            That is a theory and not a fact. There probably is not a citizen who would not accept the possibility of war if we could have a chance to stop this evil cabal. Or we can remain safe slaves who allow children to be sacrificed for our own safety and peace. Such a society is not worth retaining. Even then, there is no evidence that the truth will make Americans do any more athan angry typing. That is the reality of American exceptionalism.

            Burn them all and drag the innocent from the ashes. We are all tired of the build up and then the limp dick at the end, with no explosive, oragsmic finale. We''ve been led on like a 14 year old with a hard on with promises of the "best thing you've ever had", and the disappointment of "it's never going to happen". In the words of the famous, anonymous Marine, "kill em all, and let God sort em out".

            What we want can never be exposed in public the pedos have to be killed in the darkness all at once within 12 hours worldwide a global Night of Death done by hundreds of white hat special forces teams. Soros and the Podestas and two hundred other power players all have to die in one night. Trump could order this tomorrow and it would be done but he won't. He's a coward he's afraid of getting killed or exposed with his own videos from Russia they definitely have videos of him with Russian hookers that's enough to get him to resign in disgrace. We need one of the Joint Chiefs to order these Special Forces teams to do this Night of Death including drone missiles launched form predators and all the other toys they have. If this does not happen then the bad guys win.

            The longer these people are allowed to go free, the more likely it is that they will embroil us in war to save their asses.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best way to prevent war would be a coordinated, international and simultaneous arrest or execution of everyone involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            The majority of the people will support it. The few who view it as a "political purge" will quickly come to see the truth once the footage is displayed for the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is literally no reason to be waiting around.  If the concern is preventing war, there is all the more reason to act NOW. Start at the top, with the highest players, and work down.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we find is that the opposite is occurring. Soft arrests of low-level players to gradually work up the chain. Meanwhile the higher-ups are one false flag away from causing WW3 and being free forever.

             I agree with this comment. I can see how it's a complicated mess that has to handled with care, as the OP said. But it's clear that these criminals are trying every trick in the book to distract us and wiggle their way out. This includes false flag attacks. These evil people are desperately trying to start a world war, so they can wipe the slate clean and start again. The longer we wait, the more time they have to make this happen. So I say, release the incriminating evidence sooner rather than later.

            That is an error in reasoning. The right thing to do is to IMMEDIATELY arrest and execute the people torturing kids.

            Whether war or peace is the result is NOT what's important, what's important is doing what is right.

            And so what? I'm ready for all of the above! This needs to stop NOW. We've gone to war for much less I'm sure there are millions of us that will fight for our country to take these pedos down. I'm at the point that I don't care what the consequence just put it all out there and let what happens happen. These are innocent beautiful precious children who are being raped tortured eaten and murdered and no one should be protected against these sins.

            The blackmail (and support of insiders only) cult operates in secret, and if we are to avoid global collapse, perhaps must be destroyed in secret. Some public examples must be made, but civil war within the CIA is likely where the battle will be won or lost. The cult is at disadvantage that at any time the truth can be told and the fate of the world can be put into the hands of the brave, so if they end up winning the secret war, they will still have to fight an open war. The white hats can hold that damocles sword to advantage in every conflict, daring the cult to expose themselves or forcing them to abandon their allies one by one. The hyper rich and elites in the cult may have played both sides of every war in the past 150 years, but those wars were never against THEM. If the cult is publicly exposed, they will face a world unwilling to be their slaves any longer, and totally unwilling to go along with their dream of global unification government. It may takes decades of constant fighting in the shadows to oust them from government power, and expose and collapse their support structures piece by piece. No matter how frustrating it may be to sit on the outside and watch the Clintons die of natural causes never seeing justice, the destruction of the cult is far more important than the exposure of any single member, or even the exposure of the cult at large. Keep researching, keep building the case, and eventually the white hats will win or the public will know. Never give up, never assume we've lost, never take for granted that we're winning. Fight like you're losing, but be confident victory is the only possible outcome.

             Great way to put it, I noticed when i just post and read here all day, i kind of lose sense of the magnitude of the people that are with this. But when i cover a lot of ground, sites, pages and platforms i see the true breadth of people who talk about this from everywhere and all walks of life. These deep digging researchers may not see so much of that because they focus and narrow in on what they're looking for, as they should they are hugely critical and brilliant.

            It isn't just the U.S., we have Saudi Arabia, Brussels, England, Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands), the Nato Alliance, as well as China Indonesia and of course the entire Middle East. They have all been in it right there with the USA. I get that there will be a lot of repercussions. I am okay with that. The climate is already unstable, bring it on and lets take these demons out. they are sick. People will hate us yes, but we should hate them as well because they have been just as responsible for this insanity.

            My theory. A nuclear wasteland is inevitable. One way or another the world is going to burn in a human sacrifice on a global scale. The Georgia guidestones tell you exactly what their end game is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything else is just them bidding their time to "eat the pain" of the world's poor, young, old, and weak. While riding the backs of those that work until they are old and weak. This will continue until the TPTB have depleted all resources OR the masses stand up. OR at least enough lone wolf individuals start taking out the ultrarich (which I'm surprised I don't hear more about). It doesn't really matter how we get there, the destination is the same.
           </p>

            I could be wrong after all it is just a theory.

            I humbly submit another option. Pray for God to convict the sinner and to cause them to turn from their wickedness! I have felt bloodthirsty throughout this whole process and tonight in my prayer time as I was praying for President Trump and his family I felt lead by God to hate the sin and not the sinner... which is almost impossible in this situation because some of these sinners are committing unspeakable acts  against  innocent children. God allows me to see that maybe some of these people began as victims themselves and that His will is bigger than my desire for judgement. He hates sin more than I do!!! The story of Jonah and ninhiva came to mind  and as I submitted-with a sick stomach-  to Gods will I realized that repentant sinners will sin no more. Repentant sinners will fear the Lord and rise up against sin with no more fear of everlasting death. This may be what is needed fearless, former sinners to call out sin! The will of God can not be thwarted and obedience to his word brings peace everlasting!

             When i was reading religious stuff, bible etc...I wondered why Jesus looked at the most evil people with pity. God had wrath for the wicked but with Jesus on earth it was pity. Made me think about it, why not rage, anger etc? Then i read about the left and right hand of god concepts, evil vs. good. And i realized, some people in history and in life will always have to take that role, it is inevitable bad people will exist on earth and they are damned for it. That explains the pity. They still made the choice of their own free will though. It is good people's duty to create a kingdom on earth as it is in heaven, going by the bible. And these satanists are trying to do they same for their demon, create hell on earth. This is looking through the religious lens and it makes sense to me.

              I agree that this evil is from the pit of hell! I would rejoice in seeing it judged believe me, but then I think about a child maybe like Maddie McCann who is first a victim and then maybe brainwashed into it as a way to survive. At that moment I fall to my knees and say but for the grace of God there go I. This is why I think maybe God is leading me to prayer for the sinners repentance. If our justice department will not move then it is only God who will move and so I pray for his judgement In all some to death and others to new life.  remember Paul was on his way to murder christians when he was set free and his witness and courage for Christ lead many to new life.

            i go back forth.  there are days that i'm like you and tell others don't be discouraged.  this won't happen overnight.  they have to dot their i's and cross their t's and make sure their cases are airtight.
           </p>
           <p>
            but then there are days like today when i read comments like those to the yahoo article on the repub pedo in the hotel and I become very discouraged.  the brainwashing by the media and shareblue and brock and soros is obviously working.  are there more brainwashed than there are "woke"?  that's my fear.  those comments prove that the masses cant even think critically at all about a man caught red handed with a teenage boy in a super 8 motel.  they are programmed.  they just spew ridiculous stuff.  the MAJORITY of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            there's one sane comment for every 100 of 2,000.  it's all left versus right and he's a Christian hypocrite blah blah blah and just another right wing pedo blah blah blah and I'm blown away.  I don't think this is a right vs left thing, but I'm not stupid enough to say the majority are reblicans and only republicans and trump supporters rape children.  i mean are these people living under a rock?  have they no clue about podesta, huma, hillary, alefantis, schumer etc.  raping and trafficking children is not a party thing, but the left base won't acknowledge it exists just because Hillary didn't win?!!!  it's awful!  it's not a game, but they are treating it like one.  staying blind and refusing to see just because they don't like Trump.  what kind of shallow soulless people are we dealing with?  are they rreally THAT brainwashed, or just horrible people?

            A reminder to insane conspiratards with shit for brains who suck at telling fact from fiction: Pizzagate is a ridiculous fictitious conspiracy theory and therefore nothing will ever materialize out of it. Sucks to have shit for brains.

              lol who do they think they're convincing? Aside from shills, pizzagate supporters are obvs independent thinkers and intelligent enough to weigh information for ourselves.It's real. No one told those losers to make friends with pedos and occultists and practice it, that's on them. And now we're supposed to look away because some low level paid troll tells us otherwise? haha beat it.

            I completely agree but must say I am frightened.  Today I spent about 3 hours searching emails from the Wiki Leaks Global  Intelligence Statfor Files and my heart has been racing ever since.  Just by entering key words on certain topics led me to information that has placed the Fear of God in me.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few examples:  Obama's citizenship (or lack thereof); the hoax of 911 and the Iraq War that caused millions of civilian and soldiers' deaths;  the circumstances surrounding the death of Obama's 2 month old infant girl on Christmas Day 2007; Michelle Obama's mother wanting to practice Santaria (voodoo) in the White House; and last but not least, the effect that an EMP ((electromagnetic pulse) nuclear bomb would have  which would throw our country back to the early 1800's.  Why?   Because the available technology that exists to neutralize such an attack has not been put in place.  Why?  Because the military says it's up to the power companies and engineers and IT people and whoever to pay for and change the power grid system, and they say no, it's not up to us.  So nothing gets done.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is the answer?  Is there an answer?  It's not just about us, this is about our entire planet.

            Great post...
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump doesn't even have his entire cabinet confirmed yet, there are problems with leaks, Trump is just learning the ins and outs of the game, a game he will come to master i believe. But we all must be patient, this could easily take a year b4 anything big happens, they have to be very careful on tipping their hands with investigations and arrests. And they have to have rock solid 100% surefire evidence of all crimes. It absolutely kills me to say this, because of all the children that are currently suffering in that life. I would love to say 'damn the torpedoes full speed ahead' for their sake, but that would doom the chance of taking this shit down once and for all, and to take down the people in the highest positions of power.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is a fast and furious clumsy affair, it is too easy for the MSM to spin it against Trump and his admin, too easy to blind the sheeple to the truth, when we need everyone on the same page to avoid a civil war. I think what we do here is huge and we must continue ad naseum, keep compiling everything we can, it is groundbreaking.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said I'm sure it both helps and hinders law enforcement to have so many revelations so quickly. You see organized criminals have ears on the street, so that the first sign of anything they are the first to know. It's been the practice of LE to not tip their hand when opening an investigation into something, to build as much evidence as possible unbeknownst to the offenders. The reason being is once the word is on the street that their game is visible, they close up shop, redirect assets and holdings, destroy evidence, kill witnesses, change up their game, etc. So having a few 100,000 people openly discussing this online where both perp &amp; investigators can see it &amp;... well I don't have to tell you, that can make the ole tipping of the hand dodgy at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therein lies the reason for what you are seeing now, the only way LE can do what it needs to do, is to be absolutely tight-lipped, even to the point of seeming negligent of their duties, phrasing everything as trafficking vs. SRA, or Child sex slavery etc. Which tells the people involved that they are doing what all presidents have done, bust low level guys call it a day, and celebrate...business as usual. The trick is for Trump, and Sessions to pull this off, they gotta show business as usual, and yet, still show LE, that they will have their back, so they can feel safe to investigate stuff that was off limits to the DOJ in other admins, it's a fine f'ing line. It's going to be a slippery slope to navigate and going to take some time, and it will need a lot to go right.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also need a different climate than the one going on right now, before they begin the purge. To allow the asleep to get 'woke, so they start thinking for themselves, logically. Fixing the economy is a huge first step. If more people have $ &amp; people can afford to work less, and still get their bills paid, they will have more time to live! And with more time comes, more time to listen, to research, more time to speak out, more time to confront what it is that... just isn't right... with the world we live in. And slowly people start to wake up, till we reach a critical mass of understanding, a critical mass is crucial and the most important element of getting our world back from these sick fucks!
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus with a booming economy Soros' puppets lose ammunition in their propaganda, as the lies wear past their expiration date. While the MSM is shown more and more to be full of shit, the more and more Trump does what he says he will, and when the economy is too good to be ignored.  Then we can call for a reform of the MSM, no more papers owning radio stations, TV owning radio and newspaper, one man owning more than 1 of either, global talking point BS. And an FCC that will actually fine and jail those that seek to propagandize the news. We need real accountable, substantiated, factual news. to get that we need open competition, for who gets the scoop first vs. who can copypasta the fastest. Fore without a strong 5th estate there is just too much opportunity for the elites to control the narrative, and still remain in control.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not worried about war with other countries, this is systemic, and all countries of the world have their foot fully in it, and have for even longer than we have been a country. Countries will be busy cleaning up their own backyards vs. looking at what a boogeyman the US has become. But it isn't about countries, this is about the people that control the world, those whom could give two shits about what country does what. But don't get me wrong, this IS going to be a war, a war against the elite families, and their instruments of power, a war that has been brewing for 1000's of years, a war that is going to take bravery, sacrifice and commitment.
           </p>
           <p>
            The focus must be broader than a quick strike, as this will also be a war in which the outcome can bring about a new genesis in human evolution. An outcome that has the possibility of a new world, a cleaner world, a saner world. The amount of technology that has been suppressed by the powers that be, is stunning, and would put an end to the need for fossil fuels forever. When the SHTF there are going to be alot of people, businesses, corporations, countries, far and wide that will be implicated in this, alot of people in power with control that will cease to be in control, creating power vacuums everywhere, we gotta make sure we don't end up playing whack-a-mole here.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also need to stand by our elected President as any good American should, until he gives us reason to doubt him. And as of yet I see a man under constant assault, a family man, who is rightfully concerned for his family, and is still digesting the weight of his office, yet he's doing what he said he would, and i believe in him more each day. He literally has the weight of the entire world on his shoulders, what he needs of us, is to stand with him! We have no other horse in this race, unless he PROVES us wrong, stand by him...truly believe and have faith in this...it's the best chance we have that doesn't come with widespread violence and bloodshed, &amp; the neighbor vs. neighbor type shit they want. Look at how much of the population died in the civil war, the elites would love that kind of reduction. It's either that or war with Russia, with nearly the same results...They want Depopulation!

           <p>
            So I am afraid that it will be sometime b4 the arrests we want to see will take place, and at that time everyone will need to make some informed decisions, and for that they will need some good information, that's where we come in! :) Keep on keeping on VOATers, pray for the safety of the children, continue to drop those redpills everywhere you can, cause the time will come, we just have to keep the faith.

            I don't know man.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to believe that the toothpaste is out of the tube. That this info is out and that it's only a matter of time. But I don't know - I feel like we might be getting just as played as anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            What are the real motivations of FBIAnon and Wikileaks? Are they totally altruistic? I hope so, but I doubt it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's been accomplished? A chunk of patriotic people now have significantly less faith in our government (if that was even possible). We're counting on Trump to be the outsider that can clean this up - at least to some degree. For every two things the guy does that I love, he drops at least one big deuce on our heads. I no longer hold out hope that his knee-jerk, reactionary, insecure tweets and self-aggrandizing statements are some weird kind of genius.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people that have us all stirred up have given us everything except for what we really need - hard evidence. I'm suspecting that that's no accident.
           </p>
           <p>
            I desperately hope I'm wrong. I believe powerful organizations are hurting children and I lose sleep over it.

Can you imagine you found out about this 30 years ago and had to sit back and just watch nothing be done about it.... I mean...9/11 was 15 years ago and we never got anywhere with that either. Might be just be the awful reality. I , too, desperately hope not...cheers

              Yes i regret not being this aware in years before. Maybe memes should be made, sort of like apologizing to the people who knew about this stuff and have been affected for years like the Belgian victims and families, sorry for being asleep and that we know now and are working towards doing something about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some of these people might be bitter and have given up after years of walking alone. If we humble ourselves and apologize, as good people who were sleeping but are now woke and now we will fight for you...this serves to draw their forgiveness and back into the fold of hope and also serves to shame the people that are still sleeping. if they see themselves as good, it will definitely draw a pang in their heart.

            That's what I thought at first when I read FBIAnon say that. And I do think FBIAnon is the real deal, there's no question. The problem is bringing this thing down peacefully and in a controlled fashion is impossible. FBIAnon keeps mentioning the danger of letting the truth get out on the world stage as if these people haven't been trying to fuck each other over for centuries.
           </p>
           <p>
            The international stage gets too much attention. FBIAnon and anyone who lives inside the beltway needs to start thinking of peasants with pitch forks storming the palace. I've been all over this great nation and seen it up and down. People in DC these days are the court of Louise the 16th. It ain't right. Did FBIAnon major in European History? I definitely did and we are living the French Revolution Part Deux and the "Reign of Terror" is waiting in the wings. This isn't a joke. People with assault rifles are going to wake up waaaaaaaaaaaaay quicker than the ruling class seems to think they will. I'm right right? FBIAnon if you're reading this you know I'm right. Everyone down in DC isn't thinking of the red neck with nothing to lose who's thought something wasn't quite right for most of his life and just muddled along sinking lower and lower until they finally got shat out the bottom of the Middle Class as some point in the past 5 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not that guy. I've scraped by and held on to my Middle Class birthright. But I know many guys who weren't so lucky. Well remember when you took European History in High School and you learned about the "Pressure Relief Valve of Upward Mobility" and its clogging up that precipitated the French Revolution? This time around it's the opposite. It's the downward mobility that people in DC are ignoring because if you thought robbing someone of an ever growing pay check would piss them off wait until it starts going the other way. The guys who got fucked over were too polite to complain, ignore them at your own peril. I doubt the Bonus Army 2.0 will be doing many interviews. There are ~10 million broken men with guns who got shat out the bottom of the Middle Class. Let that sink in. I'm telling you I've seen it and it's a fucking powder keg ready to blow.

            So yeah that's what worries me. There's a fuck-ton of soaking gas rags just looking for a match. Don't worry about international affairs, worry about the forgotten man and pray he's not black while you're at it because I don't think the following preview's going to go over well out in L.A. after it's translated for them. Black people seem to have a hang up about rich white people making money off their suffering:

             Yeah, you are so right.  There are so many in the South that have squirreled away ammunition and have lots of guns.  Everytime Obama opened his mouth they ran to the gun store to get more ammo.  They don't take kindly to pedos grabbing their kids especially, if they are rich and selling their quiet life down the river.  Too many of them are committing suicide because their job defined them and when it was taken away to overseas sourcing, they lost their pride and security.  Ya, things are getting dicey out there. Elite cannot build those bunkers fast enough these days.

             They think we are sheep. At least, that's what they thought until we put Trump into the WH. Now they're scared shitless and making some serious errors.  They really have no clue how well armed people are. While they were off arming ISIS and fucking over our soldiers at the VA, people were stockpiling. Any organized effort would not go well for them and they know it.

             Indeed it isn't. I don't think it's coincidental that 120 Days of Sodom, with all its striking parallels to Pizzagate, was published right before the elite heads literally rolled in Versailles.

              Yes it is no coinkydink at all that 120 Days of Sodom was the spark. 16,594 heads later and it was History. I think the reaction to the type of depravity we're dealing with goes so deep into a man's primitive brain there's no stopping whatever comes out. The primitive brain is better known as the Limbic System, it's the brain's auto-pilot. If you get some horrible emotion generated therein a man goes on auto-pilot and it takes a lot of character to pull him out of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's why they have to jail Pedophiles separately, the desire to kill them is automatic, no thought required. If the pervs weren't housed separately they'd be killed by the end of the day. I have a friend who just retired from a career as a prison guard. He told me all about it. Fascinating.

                That's the root justification these mother fucker's used. They think it's better to be feared than good. That may work at the principality level but it doesn't scale well as another Italian "prince" found out centuries later:

                 Thanks for the info. I want to see if there's a possibility that the publication of 120 Days had a direct bearing on the events of 1789 and beyond. As you point out, the lessons for today are obvious.

                You took the words right out of my mouth. As it was told to me is in the regular units the guards watch the prisoners. In the Pedo/Perv units the guards basically have to watch the pervs AND the other guards lest someone forget to lock a door or two.

             Fucking right, and with many more waking up and buying guns because of the reality it only gets worse. I'm most worried about a blood bath for damn sure. They know the people hold all of the weight.

             We have the power, they know it and that scares them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rate people are waking up to the reality heavily outweighs their means to come up with a cleanup big enough for this. Life didn't come with a manual to clean this dirty mess up. Those cunts are on their own no matter what happens. Depending on when is a better question. Weather they come out with the truth or not, we're bound to sooner or later find and connect it all ourselves anyway. Either way there won't be a good way to conclude this little bit. There are more of us than there are of them. They can suck a fat one.

             <p>
              I don't mean this sarcastically nor am I trying to be my usual snarky self but actually this shit show did come with a manual. It's any European History book that's ever been written. The problem is some people no longer study European History for some reason. I fucking hate Europe and Europeans but their impact on History can't be ignored. White people are evil and I can say that because I'm a white person lol. White people are evil pretty much sums this mother fucker up. Just think of George H.W. Bush broadcasting his warning about crack cocaine as he imports tons of the stuff into every ghetto in America. Holy fuck to say what he said with a straight face, oh lawd have mercy.

               Oh I absolutely agree with you, there is tons of literature to teach yourself this stuff to peel your eyes open to how the world is really working. But I meant that bringing down something of this scale and size isn't written anywhere in a manual. With how long this has happenened in history and how people were kept in the dark and easily lied to because they had no internet and now all of the sudden the veil is tearing open faster than they can come up with a game plan to cover it up. There will be no pretty way to handle this situation. I doubt there is a book out there that will describe how we should handle all of this in a completely civilized manner with this many people in the world, which has never happened before. And this to many many is new, even if they weren't aware it wasn't. Everyone is on differing levels of knowledge and means to act and do shit about this. I don't imagine everyone is going to follow the same rules as everyone else because everyone has differing levels of fuck to give at this point.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I do agree with you on everything except your opinion on people of other countries. I don't want to specifically say that white people are evil, I would rather say that all people are evil of every race from any place. Look at history, people have always been inclined to go to war, people have always messed with the lives of others different from them. It doesn't necessarily stem from one type of person. All people are guilty when it comes to that. Weather we were forced, tricked or made the conscious or misled choice to go fight wars. Shit still happened from all fronts at all times.
              </p>
              <p>
               Once people or most notably a group of people/ organization/ corporation reaches to heights where corruption seems to obviously to be a requirement rather than something to avoid at all costs. Either way this would need to stop, hopefully sooner than later. It's been far too obvious we needed a change for too long. While I tend to just want to treat people like they are people no matter where they're from, and everyone at this point of every nation has blood on their hands. Who has most at which point is another question. 
But George Bush said to Barbara himself I think that "if someone found out what we have done, they would chase and hang us in the streets"
Yup, what has been will be again is right, indeed there is nothing new under the sun. That's why there's never an easy way to solve the way the world works. Throughout history it's always basically man abusing his freewill to control and enslave other men. Literally anywhere you look that is the story every fucking time. One fuck head that will tear down nations over and over again until there's nothing left. NWO is not new ideology no matter what you want to call it any given time. It just revises it's mask from time to time to hide the same face underneath it.

                "a book out there that will describe how we should handle".....I was gonna say the Bible but these idiots went out of their way to kill God a long time ago so there ain't much that'll save them. How ironic is that. You could cut the divine justice with a knife.
               </p>

                About the white people are evil thing it might not make sense to you now but you've got to look at what will happen after black people learn the truth behind the crack epidemic. The government will have to pay them reparations, there is no question now. How could you not? These George Bush style psychopaths used crack cocaine as a chemical weapon to kill black people. If you think white people who got shat out the bottom of the middle class will be mad, I don't even want to think about what'll happen in these black neighborhoods. Holy fuck.
               </p>
               <p>
                So yeah, there will be a severe need compensate the victims of the crack epidemic. Part of that will need to be monetary but it'll also have to be explaining how the fuck certain white people could be so mother fucking evil as to have done what they did. I'm just glad I don't live near the hood. People in government need to get ahead of this or else it will be holy hell here for a few years.

                 Yeah I agree but the Bible doesn't necessarily tell you specifically with how we can deal with this in our time. There's no telling at this point. Only time will tell.
This isn't the first president to deliberately poison specific groups of people. Look at when Reagan targeted Hispanics and Blacks with heroin because they were easiest groups to disrupt. It's not anything particularly new. How did they pay back those communities when when heroin epidemic came?

                <p>
                 The truth is everyone is going to be mad for varying degrees of reasons. No one is going to be happy. There isn't a whole lot of ways this is going to end in a civil manner, so much shit has come out and is still free flowing like Niagara Falls. No matter what anyone decides at this point, it's going to get kind of ugly either way. Besides right now there are far bigger reasons for why people will be mad everywhere anyway globally, stuff like satanic ritual abuse going up to the elites and trafficking, organ harvesting, kids of every race implicated not just drugs which are also involved in these rituals and parties. This whole thing is snow balling too hard to be controlled anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This pedogate thing just ties in the rest of the corruption into a more coherent picture for most people to see how and why other stuff happened and how it ties into everything else, and people have stood down all types of other injustices.  But they will NOT stand for kids to be fucked with. I don't believe anyone will continue to allow this to go on now that so many others are finding out. It's completely out of their control or our control how people will react to anything. But the future is grim as fuck.

                  "Reagan targeted Hispanics and Blacks with heroin".........I read up on that and I think you'll find that decision came from Bush not Reagan. In fact there's a lot of evidence that the psychotic killer formerly known as George H.W. Bush was behind John Hinckley's assassination attempt on Reagan. I kid you not. There's evidence Bush through Hinckley tried to kill Reagan right after he took office. I guess John Hinckley was spotted waiting for a phone call every day at a certain time in the days leading up to the assassination.

                   I think Reagan's Alzheimer's wasn't Alzheimer's. After he got shot, check out which hospital he was put in. I believe it was connected to MKUltra. HW was in control after that.

                   They have been trying to control us with drugs one way or another for a while now. It's an old idea being passed down for a while now.

            Actions have consequences.  It's time to pay the piper.  I don't see truth leading to war, but if it does, I'll take my chances.  This torture, rape and murder of infants and toddlers has to stop.

            I want to start a MADD type organization but for pedos.  Do what MADD does and have a representative in each court room where pedos are on trial, MADD sends people to each drunk driving trial to ensure the judge does not go easy.
            <br/>
            I have been working on some names for it and trying to come up with a style like MADD, we dont need to re-invent the wheel as they are very good at what they do.  We need to be a voice for the children.  I am very open to others assisting.

            I don't think war would erupt, just an intense amount of protesting. I would hope that a lot of eyes would open up to the fact that these pedos have infiltrated our society for decades.

             If your eyes are wide open you will note that what Elites attempt to do with every protest is to send in provocateurs to create violence because violence helps them defeat us.  We need the courage to commit ourselves to a non-violent response.
That's the only kind of response which will succeed.

            I'm in the 'let the chips fall where they may" camp.  This administration is infested with pedophiles in every corner, and nothing will change with Flynn's tweets, a march on Washington, or any of the noble efforts here.  All these things increase awareness so they are valid and needed, but in terms of real change, i.e., household names going down, not gonna happen.  We know that videos exist  of all these fucks.   This stuff needs to be released in a way that no mistake can be made as to what's really going on here.

            Why was the search box feature removed? I posted this yesterday (and a mod pulled it)  asking why the pizzagate search box was gone...as I wanted to search for old threads.. Someone had replied that all voat search boxes were removed. Seems very odd to me. How are we supposed to find older topics?

            The problem is how do you prosecute the foxes that raided the chicken coop when the entire system designed to protect the chickens is stacked with foxes with feathers falling from their mouths.  I'm not looking for anything until at least after Trump gets his Supreme Court nominee seated.  And then I'm not sure how he will be able to pull it off.  He might have to call in the Military for some kind of mass roundup and a Nuremberg Trial/Rico Case style solution in front of the whole world.  I don't see how he will be able to pull up this massive spider web one strand at a time, especially since he would be forced to count on many spiders (to mix metaphors) to help him get the job done.  If  nothing happens after trump has time to get all his people in place, then it will start looking like the only solution is for the Peasants to take up the pitchforks and clubs

            I think FBIAnon's 3 options are wrong. There is a 4th option. Redirection of the narrative. This would require Trump to make an example of a few very high profile members of the pedo rings.  Then use the scape goats as a rallying point to gather moral support of the majority. Publicly demonize the scape goats and tie them to plausible external enemy (not an enemy with MAD capabilities). Offer amnesty to the mid and upper level managers with blood on their hands, on condition they both reform and devote their loyalty, skills, and lives to the new narrative and hunting their former compatriots (comrades?). Make terrifying examples of the first to break their oaths. Then redirect the might of all American institutions to again look towards outside enemies and the conspirators who aided the enemy. My vote is the Muslim brotherhood + academic feminism + International Socialism for the plausible outside threat and conspirators. Hillary and Huma's relationship already fits this new narrative.

             Also, 5th, or more of a continuation of option B. Get the people implicated in jail with "smaller" crimes, they're morally corrupt so guess there's plenty of options there. Once they're done with and they are replaced, come out with the truth and new charges. It's a slow process, but with the MSM failing, and more and more people starting to realise that there is something more going on behind the scenes, maybe that way the whole system won't collapse.

             There are too many questions unaddressed -- 
What exactly is the power of the British Royals and is it of this world?
Since Princess Diana there have been many questions about their "otherworldliness."
And, if so, is there any opposing power which can help us?
            </p>
            <p>
             We can probably bring much of the trafficking to a halt depending on how much information the public gets to understand about what is happening here and internationally in regard to human trafficking, including of children which is the most urgent problem.
Public knowledge is a great threat to those in control which is why they so desperately need secrecy and control of all media.
            </p>
            <p>
             But also realize that the military is involved in this trafficking as made clear by retired Detective Jim Rothstein in his interview with Jim Fetzer, pretty much at the end of the interview.
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cnT5amf6Ys">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cnT5amf6Ys
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the break in.  Earlier, LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress.   Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress for the purpose of blackmail.  Congress also knew at the time of Watergate that there were duplicates of the Nixon tapes as the Secret Service always made a duplicate tape.&gt;

             Yes! You nailed it. Wars are fought with PR today. We need to expose these heinous crimes because they must be stopped. Child trafficking and rape must be punished.

            So, what we are faced with is an actual "Too big to fail" situation. Unlike the banks that coined the phrase, which should've been broken up and held accountable. But... I'd like to propose a counter. Is there a way to separate the collusion/foreign affairs/economic/military items from the active crimes being conducted that relate to children?
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure, dropping 5,000 documents that detail what really happened in Haiti, Benghazi, Syria, UK, Russia, etc. would cause a catastrophe. But a similar expectation was built up around the Panama Papers and somewhat for Vault7 as well... and look at everyone? Tapping away on Facebook as if our nation's GDP is not tied up in Panamanian laundering services and with no care in the world about domestic surveillance capabilities that make PRISM look like a joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would it really come crashing down if the global pedo ring was shut down? I think it would empower the right people to get motivated and get involved. If* there's no way to separate these crimes from the other economic/foreign issues - that would be a concern. But, from where I'm standing? The evidence should be used to forcibly remove, prosecute and imprison/execute those at the highest echelon involved with any crime against children.

             Keep in mind that the NYPD has had three investigations into these matters stopped over the last 50 years -- and that one had actually reached the level of a NY State investigation.  Detective Rothstein points out that the investigations went on until the "names" were supplied.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings. And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the break in. Earlier, LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress. Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress for the purpose of blackmail. Congress also knew at the time of Watergate that there were duplicates of the Nixon tapes as the Secret Service always made a duplicate tape.&gt;

             If you're familiar at all with the Dutroux case in Belgium, you see how quickly the MSM was used to attack the families and the witnesses and turn around the public who had earlier been out on the streets in the White March for Children (300,000 of them!)
and yet they were suddenly turned around and engaged in a witch hunt against the families and children.
This is using MSM for mind control and very effectively.

               Well, that's why Rothstein was trying to caution us and the more we understand about these operations 
and the patterns and methods used to run them the better off our chances of stopping them.
               <br/>
               Would be interesting to see those original files of the NYPD and also the Weiner laptop files to see where they overlap.

               I'm at a disadvantage as I depend on others reviewing these emails to alert me to the most 
important ones.

               Certainly we're all aware of the damage done by "W" and Rove, by Meirs, Gonzalez, Feith.
Notorious names.

               Interesting to see Flocco's name -- an old internet friend would often refer to him
as an investigator but I've been out of touch with his work for a long time now.
Will try to take a look at what he's doing now.

             I feel you, Good. Really, this has been going on throuh hundreds of generations. For us to expect it all changes in months is unrealistic. However we now have the internet, and are PUSHING for what's right. Let's continue the push. It'll take a wee while I think, but we'll get there

            As well as the political implications there are major religious ones. The Christian Church embraces doctrines which are inconsistent with natural sexuality, hence the relatively high incidence of paedophilia in the Christian institutions. The mythos of the whore of Babylon, while it doesn't relate directly to paedophilia, does relate to incest, which is of course prohibited in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Islam has a different problem in that the Hadith describes Mohammed marrying an underage girl, which may contribute to paedophilia or misogyny in Islamic society. However this account is refuted by Mohammad's earliest biography, and the relationship between men and women in the Quran involve mutual rights and duties, rather than a purely heirarchical relationship.

              He also predicted pizzagate four months in advance. In my view, that's fucking impossible unless he had insider info.

            Too many people jockeying to save their own skins.  I say let the system implode.  In truth, that is the only way the high level pedophilia will ever be really tackled.  Face it.

             Sorry bout that. Yeah I agree, let it implode. Any system propped up on the sick fucking reality/illusion we have now is not worth protecting. Let it die, then rebuild.

             First we need public to become aware that it exists. My girlfriend has just started to accept what is going on after I showed her that Daily Mail article posted here, about that 18 year old Eton College (Prince Williams went there) member who was caught with over 1000 images of child porn involving rapes of 3 year olds and bestiality. I showed her how he got off free of jail time thanks to his wealthy father. Now this freak is loose to do god knows what! Public awareness. Spread infos such as these. I only saw one Utube blogger cover this story - Random Rants of Ryan. Not enough publicity! Expose Steven Colbert ties to Podesta - interview 2009 posted here is a good start. Public is still living in La La land.

            I know that people keep saying that if the Royal Family was executed, if there were multiple suicides, if if if ….But I continue to say "What is the harm in bringing these crimes to light?"  Is it better to let them fester in darkness, with just a small portion of the population awake? I say bring it on, bring it on

             Problem is that without public awareness, NWO king pins may pull off a stunt such as suiciding key players and using them as scapegoats before changing logos, code names and business as usual. With aware public, no stone will be left unturned!

            Or do nothing and be an accomplish to unspeakable acts!  Let children be tortured, raped and murdered.
And their organs harvested.

           <p>
            While common citizens go to jail and prison everyday...they watch us like hawks as to wring every drop of money they can from us if we do anything wrong!
We can't even go without our seat belts!!!
This HAS to stop and I don't care who is involved!

           <p>
            Let the chips fall wherever they do.
Someone should have stopped this a long time ago.
Now it falls to this generation or live with the fact that we did nothing!

             I think something will happen soon. Maybe the President is planning now. He has only had security clearance for a while.

             It will be hard to take them all down in one go. I would round up the lower levels first and watch the higher level ones until the lower level has said enough to ensure their convictions. Then he can work his way up to the snakes head.

             It was all part of the New World Order, 2030 Plan and Alinsky's Rules for Radicals rolled into one.  Make the people poorer, take away their freedoms, water and move them into smaller, urban areas (Hunger Games) and put them on govt. assistance.  Too bad, HRC lost and messed everything up!

             It's like I have a devil and an angel on the shoulder. One stands for the strategic, realist side of my brain and the other is my heart that wants to say FUCK IT, burn it all fucking down! Expose everyone, let's commence the war, and we'll clean up afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
             My realist side is about the strategy involved in building cases and planning for each eventuality as best as possible to try to avoid certain pitfalls, like a global war. The other big problem is that we don't know if the FBI has handed over any info to DOJ. We still have so many Bathhouse Barry plants within govt trying to obfuscate the entire govt (and most definitely trying to block ANYTHING having to do with HRC or Barry) that it's hard to know how much actual evidence will make its way to DOJ and we all know those criminals are scared shitless of Sessions. On top of that we have cocksuckers within the DOJ itself trying to block justice.
            </p>
            <p>
             With all that said I keep trying to preach patience to myself and also just stay prayerful for truth and justice. I do believe that all of us praying/meditating actually DOES make a difference. I'd love for everyone to start visualizing the endgame. Arrests, trials, jail, execution ect.

              I am not for Civil War, but neither am I for doing nothing.
I certainly believe these things should be done strategically, I'm still hoping that this is the plan.
I don't know what to do if all are involved.
This has certainly shattered my faith that there are honorable people leading our Country.
I voted Trump hoping he really loves this Country. He seems to...but the devil on my shoulder says...will he take action on PedoGate?
I feel for the guy...what a mess!

             Bring the traitors and child molesters to justice. If it comes with war that's the bargain earlier generations set us up for but atleast we wouldn't have made the same evil deal they did of "let it slide, live another day".

             You are forgetting the quote in the same FBIanon dialogue where he says 1) civil wars last A LOT longer than you realize 2) there is ALWAYS foreign intervention. I know we are all in "bring it on" mode where were ready to massacre every black/leftist/chinese/jew in America but it would still be a lot less damaging to America if we brought these people to justice. It hasn't been 2 months yet. I give Trump around 1.5 to 2 years before I start getting really worried but posts like these does put pressure on his administration to start arrests sooner rather then later.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kellyanne as of 1 week ago tweeted about child sex trafficking so its not like Trump is just trying to bury and ignore this issue. Be patient. If you rush pedogate you might let some of these people get away.

             If global order and my quality of life is based on the fact that lawless psychopaths are murdering, torturing and raping kids then let it fall. Since PG broke, how many innocent kids have been raped to the point of brokeness, why just do things can stay stable?

            <p>
             This is the same mentality of the olden times and people allowing kids to burn to molech just so they get good crops. I mean, if a few thousand kids are mutilated so the whole tribe can have a good crop season so be it right?/s

             This supposes that 7billions people who arent psychopath child rapists are unable to figure out how to build a society not structured in the suffering of the few so the many can have Super Bowl parties and chipotle.

            <p>
             They divide and conquer us based on our differences to make us feel like we need them for order.  Fuck these people. I'd rather hold arms with BLM and KKK at the same rally if it means saving these kids. Sadly, that kind of unity is what it will take.  As someone whose seen a survivor suffering with nightmares every day of her life and feeling helpless.  This suit needs robbery revealed and stopped ASAP.
We're all adults, we'll figure it out in the after math. Fuck the media corps and anchors for the cover ups.  Keep digging, never give up

              Why do they have to do these crazy things to innocent kids? Power. They have money. They need something else besides money to get them hard. They can't just be into submissive whores, because its just an act. They need someone to truly fear them to get off on the power trip. They feed on it. These are demons tht can't be fixed or reformed. You can only destroy it before it can reproduce or teach another its sick ways. My first wife was abused and died broken. Her grandfather died before i met her, but he destroyed her entire family while grandma made excuses for him. Her own mother, who was one of his victims too, would drop her off every day over summer at their house. She knew what he was, and, in her state of denial, allowed her daughter to be ruined inside. I wanted to drive over and beat her ass when i found out. The woman let her 2 sons be violated by this sack of shit, who then tried to abuse my wife whem she wasn't even 10 years old. They both have kids now, daughters unfortunately, but i don't know if anything has happened. She died in 2008 and i havemt spoken to anyone in the family since. People who are abused become distorted if they aren't helped. They sometimes become the very monsters that they hate. Not always, but it's like being possessed by a demon. For all the survivors out there, I am truly sorry for what happened to you. Find help so you can help others, and any life you help save, will help you save yourself.

               Gonna get all wild and spiritual here. But read Carlos Casteneda. Native American shaman believe when the body is under trauma the soul leaves temporarily. During that time a different t "energy" can attach.
              </p>
              <p>
               They perform rituals called soul retrieval. Abuse is a cycle many times familial. Because if the person saw it as wrong they would have to face what happened to them.  Many survivors refuse to talk about what happened so it's pushed down into the subconscious. As we've seen with Jungs writings, that's not a good thing.  When American medicine starts to listen to Native American, African and even Asian spiritual practitioners we can't help these people.
              </p>
              <p>
               Native Mexicans called them flyers, arabs call them Djinn, shipibo tribes, matzes tribe, Australian aboriginals, Russian siberians shaman, same story different names. Intense human emotion bleeds over to interdimensional beings. The more intense the emotion the more energy.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's the perfect crime, victims can identify and become abusers. Others will never speak again on the subject. Worst, many won't believe.

               You're post is heartbreaking. I'm so sorry for what your wife and her family went through. I can confirm the feelings you speak about and I thank you for caring. Your last sentence really touched me because you get it, most people don't even though they try.  I've never heard the words spoken quite like yours and I thank you. It's something that never leaves you no matter how hard you try!

             You echoed my sentiments. I believe that by now the evil has consolidated itself to such an extent that it has become - THE SYSTEM! Basically nothing short of ranger justice + civil war would change much. Even if they go after Podesta - by now we know that vitually hundreds of places have been onfiltrated, every institution that supposedly deals with children's well being has been compromised. Just look at the ties between NCMEC, Clintons, Podestas, Lockheed Martin, James Comey, Mccain, Steven Colbert, CPP - Jacke Tapper, Maccobys, Laura Silsby - amber allert (I have to pinch myself) ..... Pegasus Kill Room - bought from a couple who were members of Moonie Cult (Korea)...., All these children foundations, orphanages, UN Chief - orphans initiative Charles Desantis - pedophile couple, .... psyops with Kutcher and Demi Moore (molesting under age boy on camera), whole Hollywood satanic pedophile network, organ harvesting, setting up fake orphanages before creating wars in those countries - foreign policy makers are chosen from the same group. All those secret socities such as Skull &amp; Bones through which power elites communicate away from public eyes... 
So, we can see that the only way to victory is through 3 steps 
Step 1) Information dissamination, that leads to public awakening (critical mass 20 - 30%)
Step 2) Dismantling old world order (Civil war, vigillante justice, etc)
Step 3) Build a new government, brand new constitution. 
For now keep researching and keep finding jigsaw pieces. We need public awakening, without it white hat agents are vulnerable. Good news, pedo-gate deals with the root of NWO, while at the same time it taps into primal parental instincts that no cover up can silence!

               They are being outed, they have lost their secrecy. They already lost. We are waking people every day. All they can do is pump fake news via clownls like Megyn Kelly or weaponised comedy via Stephen Colbert and sellouts like Alec Baldwin. Desperate times ahead for the pizza lovers.

                That is why the censoring has been brought up several notches in the last month or so.  Rememberr, control the media you control the masses.  If they shut down sites where people share news, etc., it takes away the ability to form unity and awaken the masses.  The media has controlled the masses for a very long time.  The internet blew that up because suddenly there are alternative news sites and this past election showed what liars MSM are.  People know they can no longer trust them for the truth and it is pissing these MSM psychos off in a bigway.  It is no longer just Drudge, Breitbart and Rush Limbaugh.  Alternative news sites are popping up everywhere the masses are being awakened.

                 By sensoring they simple force truth seekers to change platform. They banned pizzagate on Reddit, so they went to VOAT. They banned Honeybee's resarch from Utube she went to Bitchute. Free market is their enemy. For them to actually sensor pedo-gate is to annul the 1st ammendment and declare USA a comminst state like China. What do you think millions of patriots are gonna do. So they have to ban guns, but in order to do so they have to keep engineering Sandy Hook hoaxes, then covering up - which means sensoring alt media which driven by free market cannot be realized and we are back to square 1. Trump needs to move in now. Let white hat agents do their job.

               Needs changes. It says that 'congress shell have the power to create money' - What it should say is that ONLY Congress shell have the right to create money. You see, according to the current constitution Federal Reserve is legal! I wonder who thought of that linguistic loophole?!

             it's up to us as citizens. the laws don't matter to them. so why should they matter to us. we take our govt back by force and we do it sooner rather than later. I have nothing to lose. I'll fight for who can't or for who won't. my question is, when is enough actually enough. are we not tired of being treated as the enemy by the same people we pay with our hard earned backed by nothing funny money!

              Any revolution has to be most of all NON-violent.
We do have everything to lose, especially in regard to losing a potential revolution and having torture/sexual abuse of children continuing on.
Those in control would welcome our violence and opportunities to put the nation under lock down.
And they have control over our MIC/Intelligence - drones.
Non-cooperation with capitalism which keeps them in wealth and thus power is a better place to begin.

               you forget that the button pushers and force they will try and use are still human beings. The same human beings that won't sit idly by and let that sort of evil rule the land. These evil fucks can't bomb everything back to the Stone age because there will be nothing to rule over. They are about power and control. they will lose both if it comes to a violent revolt. Locking them up won't make an example out of them. Public executions will.

               I agree with you.  The bad guys have been preparing for and promoting a civil war for awhile. They want us to fight against them. We may have more heart in the fight but they are better prepared and have more weapons. If violence starts, that could be all the distraction needed to assassinate the good guys and put all of us in fema camps. We need to have faith in good people like trey gowdy and patience to let them do this the right way.

              Yeah i'm thinking these guys are lawless so can't beat them using the law. I'm an innocent, not a child abuser and if i die in the crossfire during some revolution, i'm willing to be an innocent casualty. The kids are worth it, they are the innocent beauty of the future for humanity and deserve to grow without being corrupted en masse by subhuman derelicts. I don't care what designer clothes and jewelry they have on or what castles they live in. Degenerates of humanity.

               We are all going to die anyway(at least in the flesh... energy can't die). 
Why not go out like we are supposed to? 
Slavery should have never been allowed to go on for five minutes on this earth despite what any god or book says.
              </p>
              <p>
               But in those days, people really just couldn't do anything because the Elites and their paid enforcers had all the weapons and unity.
              </p>
              <p>
               The founders of this country were those sick freemasons who believed they could buy off their karma by giving people a chance to escape the evil they plan for them. And some good .
That's what the right to bear arms is about. The bastards are always looking ahead. They meant for us to free our world even as they hoped and did/do everything they can to prevent it.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are the first people in known history who are more powerful than any elites in the world because of all the guns.
              </p>
              <p>
               Although the Russians, French and Haitians, did manage to do it in their lands,  as the U.S. goes, so does the world.

               No Napoleons are going to rise up to strip us of our victory. We will have the world if we just unify with a just, righteous cause.

                This is why the elites are building mansions/bunkers underground in record numbers for this very reason.  There is some rich person that even put a 12-stall barn underground! I guess he didn't  want to lose his expensive horses in the battles that might be coming.  Things could get a bit crazy before they get better. Too many people have redpilled to go backwards now.

                 Yes, the phrase "the darkest hour is just before the dawn" keeps running through my head. Good thing there is easy technology to detect underground anomalies :p. I love how technology and the internet is removing their secrecy capabilities day by day.

            I'm not frustrated.
I'm seeing in the news everyday of some pedo ring getting arrested.....
With all those arrests comes interrogation/info on the whole ring.
over 1500 arrests made since President Trump got in and more everyday, just look at the reports of all the pedo's getting caught and arrested.

              I heard Col. Schafer say on Infowars YouTube yesterday that there are now over 2500 pedo arrests.  Its coming, folks.  Taking out the small fish first.

              Agreed. I heard Alex jones mention 2500 but he may have pulled that out of his ass. That was when he spoke to Col Schafer.

            Enjoyed your post and I agree the FBIAnon last summer was the real deal.  I go back now and then and read his comments.  I believe the pedo arrests are coming.  More and more people are redpilling and I notice that Drudge Report, almost every day, has some satantic ritual piece or child trafficking, etc.  It is almost like we are getting pumped and primed slowly so when it all spills out we are ready for it.  It is the waiting I hate just like watching water boil.  Schumer and Pelosi are high on my list with hanging by a noose and of course, the Clintons are always a fav!
