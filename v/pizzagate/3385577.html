<p>Next Model Management, founded in 1989 by Faith Kates, has grown to become one of the top agencies in the world.

The executive management team also includes Lorenzo Pedrini, formerly one of the top male models in the world, whose association with Next goes back to 1989. Lorenzo significantly increased Next\'s European business by opening Next Paris in 1996 and Next London in 1999. Today, Next represents over 200 female and male models, including some of the top names in the industry such as Yasmeen Ghauri.

<p>Agency boss allegedly gave Epstein models for orgy</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The boss of a hot New York modeling agency supplied Jeffery ­Epstein with underage girls for an orgy with Prince Andrew, court documents claim.</p>
<p>Jean Luc Brunel — credited with discovering Christy Turlington, Milla Jovovich and other famous faces — is accused of recruiting aspiring young models for sex with his powerful pals, The Times of London reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Epstein — who allegedly pimped out 17-year-old “sex slave” Virginia Roberts from 1999 to 2002 — brought teenage girls to his private Caribbean island and ordered them to have sex with Prince Andrew, a lawsuit claims.</p>
<p>There, the fashion-industry honcho staged a topless photo shoot with young models from Russia, Roberts told the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>Brunel scored US passports for girls as young as 12 — then passed the minors off to pervy pals like Epstein, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Roberts claims Epstein forced her to have sex with Brunel, co-founder of MC2 Model Management, at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla., in New York, California and several other spots.</p>

           <p>
            This is extremely widespread &amp; so dangerous.
           </p>
           <p>
            I posted a story a while back on PG about my trip to Japan in 1994 with a modeling agency. I went out there with another female model &amp; 2 Male models.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other girl and I were given our own apartment to stay at and the guys had their own, completely across town from us. The agency paid for everything and everything was great for a while.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a really long story, but basically, the agency ended up being involved with the Yakuza (Japanese Mafia).
           </p>
           <p>
            At one point, the situation started to change and it did NOT feel right, at all. They didnt show us how to make a phone call, basical things we never thought about at first.
           </p>
           <p>
            I told them I wanted to go home &amp; they did NOT like that one bit.
           </p>
           <p>
            They had broken into our apartment and wrote things on the walls with red paint to scare us.
           </p>
           <p>
            We shoved our passports down our pants and took off to find a way to make a call.
           </p>
           <p>
            The phones out there in 1994 were very different and you had to buy calling cards and use a certain color payphone to make an international call. And it wasn't like the U.S. where you could speak English and the operator would help you. There were green payphones and black ones. One was for international, the other color wasnt.
           </p>
           <p>
            We had to sit for hours and watch people, and beg anyone who spoke English to help us.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was finally able to make a call and called my Mom and Stepdad to tell him what was going on. My Stepdad got in touch with the American Consulate and informed them what was going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            They literally came and saved us. They explained to us that the Japanese Mafia was deeply involved with the modeling agency and that we were lucky we got help. They explained that a blue eyed blonde goes for a LOT of money and that they get the girls hooked on heroin and basically they never return home.
           </p>
           <p>
            We had round trip tickets and were supposed to be leaving back home in 3 mos. The main guy at the Consulate told us they had even tried changing our tickets.
           </p>
           <p>
            This company we were with was, at the time, a well known, supposedly, "legit agency".  Now that I know better, I dont think there are any legit agencies", not even one.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thank GOD for those men at the consulate. I owe my life to them. We were 19yrs old and I had braces still, I looked 16.
           </p>
           <p>
            I cant tell you how terrifying it is hearing these stories, knowing how close that other girl and I were to never coming home.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's all too real, it turned into a literal nightmare. To this day, I've never wanted to leave the country again.

             Brunel, Jean-Luc: Model scout.
            </p>
            <p>
             Name found in Epstein’s black book and on Epstein’s private jet log.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brunel was accused in court testimony of having used his agency to supply Epstein with girls. Brunel scored US passports for girls as young as 12 — then passed the minors off to pervy pals like Epstein, according to court documents.pagesix.com/2015/01/09/modeling-honcho-allegedly-gave-epstein-young-models-for-orgy/
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein used the agency to lure underage prey. In  court documents, one alleged victim accused the billionaire of “deliberately engag[ing] in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.
            </p>
            <p>
             (He was not charged.) He also has a long history of allegations that he had abused his fashion-world position. In 1988, he was the subject of a 60 Minutes investigation alleging that he and a fellow agent sexually assaulted nearly two dozen models. He denied the claims but later told Model author Michael Gross, “You get laid tonight with a model, is that a crime?” In 2005, Brunel co-founded the Mc2 modeling agency; Epstein invested $1 million in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             , Brunel purchased it from the original owner. As owner, Brunel established a global network of affiliate agencies and became a worldwide force. Brunel and the agents at Karin Models scouted and launched the careers of familiar industry names like Estelle, Kristina Semenovskaia, Monica Bellucci, Estella Warren, Angie Everhart, Sharon Stone, Christy Turlington, Rachel Hunter, Jerry Hall, Rebecca Romijn, and Milla Jovovich.

             i didnt much like their models on their website. guess its just not mu type idk. "Skinnier and younger every year".http://www.mc2models.com/ I dint find this site informative or interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Diane Sawyer interviewed nearly two dozen models who said they had been sexually assaulted by Brunel and/or by his fellow agent, Claude Haddad. Brunel had a reputation as a man one could go to to procure a “date” with a young model. CBS spoke to five models who said that Brunel and/or his friends had drugged and raped them. Brunel  knows exactly what girls in trouble are looking for. He’s always been on the edge of the system.  They’re with Jean-Luc because he’s the boss. Jean-Luc likes drugs and silent rape. It excites him.”
