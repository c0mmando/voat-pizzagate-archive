I read the Anon posting from the supposed Surgical Resident who scrubbed on his trauma. Sounds like someone with a medical background, but it doesn\'t make sense. Is this purposeful disinformation?
OK, so Anon Surgical Resident states that SR had survivable injuries to bowel and segment 3 of liver which were controlled and he was stable intraop and postop. Since he was found by Police within minutes (according to multiple reports) and the presumed hospital (MedStar Washington Center) is a nearby Level I Trauma Center, he was probably brought there quickly as an emergent trauma and was probably in the OR quickly after the injury. I assume he was intubated in the field or quickly after arrival, but diagnostic workup was unlikely to be done and he was probably brought to OR for laparotomy immediately. So far, so good, just as Anon Surgical Resident stated. 
Laparotomy for diagnosis and damage control/control of bleeding for the injuries described should take 1-2 hours, more or less depending on details of the injuries. So lets say that he went into the OR quickly after the injury. Police report (CCN #16113797 – PUBLIC INCIDENT REPORT - <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/320691960/Event-16113797-Public-Incident-Packet-1">https://www.scribd.com/document/320691960/Event-16113797-Public-Incident-Packet-1)</a>) states that the incident occurred at 4:20AM on July 10,2016. For the sake of argument, lets say he is in the OR at 4:30 or 4:40AM. If the procedure takes 2 hours, lets say he is done at around 6:30AM. As Anon Surgical Resident states, he then goes to rounds (around 7 AM is typical) and is told not to talk about VIP patient and is barred from rounding on him. I\'m assuming that he stays intubated postop and is brought directly to ICU postop with sedation/pain meds. He then states that the hospital is flooded with LEOs around 8 hours later (around noon) who prevent all but a few from seeing SR. Sometime later that day (?), SR presumably dies but no code is called to resuscitate him. 
This is where it doesn\'t\'t make sense. The police report, which was filled out at 7:10 AM on July 10, states that he has already expired and the time of death is listed at 5:57AM July 10. Time of death given by Attending Physician. 
Either the Police Report is wrong or the the Anon Surgical Resident narrative is wrong. They cannot both be right. If he died in the OR, as implied by the 5:57 AM time of death, it also implied that the injuries were much worse than those described by Anon Surgical Resident. Perhaps major vascular injuries (aorta, vena cava, renal vascular injuries or much worse hepatic injuries that were more difficult to control). If he died in the OR or shortly thereafter in ICU, it is very unlikely that he wouldn\'t have been involved or at least known about it. 
The other possibility is that the Police Report is not accurate, but if that is so it would be purposeful and not accidental. I\'m not sure of the provenance of the Police Report that I have referenced above. I assume it was actually posted by DC Police. While the Anon Surgical Resident story sounds good at first, I\'m not sure its not some kind of disinformation since the times don\'t match. 
All I\'m saying is to take &quot;facts&quot; about SR with a grain of salt and to keep digging for more facts.</p>',

            Here's something a little strange about DocAnon's post, something which doesn't seem quite right.

           <p>
            At the end of his post he signs off by saying...

           <blockquote>

             Alright anons it's been swell but I'll be gone for the next few hours for regular residency meeting/ journal club BS.

            Really... isn't this just TMI ?  It sounds scripted to me, as if he really wants to sound legit. Maybe because he is legit and was scared people would doubt him?

             , but this surgical resident just came forward, almost a year later after Seth Rich's death.  During the past year, this resident very likely was following news, social media, discussion groups, and 4 chan and would have picked up info and lingo. When the new news broke, it prompted him to come forward.

             You mean like the LARPers who are feeding us the Seth Rich story? You know those guys don't you AreWeSure don't you? They're the ones that told you how Seth Rich died despite an autopsy, oh wait, there was no autopsy.

            , I am a nurse, old-school, the best school. Worked 20 years in a hospital, adult med-surg; hemodialysis; ICU; and ER.  After that, worked 18 years in a law firm as a nurse paralegal and now as  legal nurse consultant.  Way too much info, I know, but frankly, I don't give a damn.
           </p>
           <p>
            This surgical resident 100% sounds like the real deal to me.  It doesn't make sense for someone to make this up.  The information he provided (or she) is 100% on target when it comes to medical lingo and chain of events.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I see happening in the last week or so is that many of us have gotten to the point that we no longer know who to trust and what information to believe. 
Understandably so, but  lack of trust will lead to more and more confusion.  Common sense always and knowledge has to be our guide throughout this investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the past few days  i have emphatically believed that this surgical resident is the real deal and consider it a major factor in this case.  If others and I are proven wrong, I say,, so be it.  We move on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Setting-up Seth Rich was a beautifully orchestrated plan from the beginning to the very end, including the predicting of possible scenarios/outcomes that could go awry and  implementing the next plan of action immediately.
           </p>
           <p>
            IMHO, Seth Rich was murdered in the ICU postoperatively.  No Code Blue was called, no death certifcate, no post-mortem, no medical records.  We do have a surgical resident, but he is in his fcurth year of residency and likely will be on his way the end of June when his residency requirements come to an end, probably saying as he walks out that hospital door for the last time, "Fuck you, DC."

               I would be with you 100%, if this wasn't the one and only piece of information we have to say that he was taken to hospital. We can't use an anon source as a factual source, we need more.
              </p>
              <p>
               There's nothing, no information at all, not one piece of factual evidence which tells us SR went to hospital.  Any hospital.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was on 4Chan/pol last night to see what info they had about the hospital. It's the same there, they have nothing.
              </p>
              <p>
               So it's all looking a little strange... as are many other things, but if we continue to question
               <em>
                everything
               </em>
               and keep digging, hopefully we will find something factual to back up DocAnon.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's the 4Chan thread re no hospital information, from last night, for anyone interested -

                Perhaps you have seen this video, but here is the link anyway.  It is done in narrative form  reciting everything the resident described to 4chan.

               </p>
               <p>
                If only that resident would come forward again,
even just to confirm the hospital, but he probably is in fear for his life.  Can't blame him.
               </p>
               <p>
                I feel 99% confident that Seth Rich was transported to the Medstar Hospital where Sava worked.  Howard Hospital was ruled-out, and those 2 hospitals were the closest ones.

             So I order a hit - I am not so devious that I have the nearby hospitals on standby in case my shooters miss the target.  But there again, I know the body is going to end up at a hospital, so I guess I have to have someone on the inside.

            <p>
             Am I going to be dealing with the janitor or nurse evil? No - I'll be dealing with the Director - I'm a big shot!  Or will I?  How many people have I got on the payroll, in the Club, blackmailed or threatened.  One policeman?  The whole DC Metro.  One hospital Director, or enough firepower in all DC hospitals?
            </p>
            <p>
             Would I arrange for a LEO who is on the payroll or in the club to be nearby to make sure the shooters get away and divert any awkward questions?  That looks like a sensible precaution.
            </p>
            <p>
             Presumably the police chief [or someone who can control the "investigation"] is in the club - done his baby sacrifice and been filmed - do I involve him before the fact?  Probably not.  Don't want to pay, don't want to owe him one, don't want to have to use the baby film, don't want to threaten his job [and the goodies] - may cause grudges and resentment with other placemen and don't want to bump another person off - besides, I then have to get another LEO to run the "investigation."
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't I wish I'd had this Seth guy drugged in Joe's Bar, loaded into a cab and fed to the pigs - obviously after nailing his testicles to a chair and making him run a mile to the pig farm.  Less mess - more fun.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or I could have had some hooker pick him up at Wonderland and smother him during sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why did I hit him?  I've already done [what's the body count now?] and people still aren't getting the message.
            </p>
            <p>
             Money is no object - I've got the drugs, sex slaves, gun running - those Saudis are always good for commission!  Blood and body parts is looking promising.  And the people at the Fed are Club elite - so no problem with the money!
            </p>
            <p>
             But I knew he was going to spoil the party.  So, another hit - not like it hasn't happened before.  There is always a bit of mess and it has always been cleaned up before - so no worries.

              Setting-up Seth Rich was a beautifully orchestrated plan from the beginning to the very end, including the predicting of possible scenarios/outcomes that could go awry and implementing the next plan of action immediately.

             Actually a beautifully orchestrated plan would simply have killed him in the street.  If was supposed to be dead it would have taken no more than 5 seconds to shoot him again in the head.   You could have even spent another 45 seconds and made sure to take his wallet.

              Too bad they can't find those body camera's the "police" were wearing. Or any video from any of the numerous cameras in the area. Or an autopsy report that actually says he died in the hospital and not in the street.

              Hey AreWeSure why do you always take the party line? You actually don't know how Seth Rich died BECAUSE THERE WAS NO AUTOPSY DONE.

               Yeah, that's your problem.  Magical thinking.    If that actually happened, once this story hit the papers, many people would come forward if this kid was doing fine and then just died.  You wouldn't have this one medical LARPer coming forward months later.   Just as if Kim Dotcom had the good last year, he would have shouted them from the rooftops.   The people who LARP like this depend on your magical thinking to get traction.

                First of all, I never heard of Kim Dotcom until he "magically" reappeared.
               </p>
               <p>
                But there is nothing magical regarding the surgical resident and him coming forward close to a year later.
               </p>
               <p>
                This resident was directly involved in Rich's care from the very beginning up until the time Rich went to ICU when he was barred from following his patient.  This is a big red flag, because ANY surgical resident who operates on a patient or assists in the operation on a patient, follows that patient immediately, starting the minute he comes out of surgery until the time of discharge.
               </p>
               <p>
                This resident knew something wasn't right.  He took notes in order to maintain his recollection of events, just in case he needed them in the future.  This is NOT unusual for any doctor or nurse to do, because a few years down the road, they may be faced with a medical malpractice lawsuit as a plaintiff, or at the very least, as a witness who will be deposed and possibly testify at trial if the case isn't settled beforehand.
               </p>
               <p>
                This resident, more likely than not, was told to keep quiet.  He  followed news media after Rich's death and soon, all became quiet.  Until a few weeks ago.
               </p>
               <p>
                The narrative video I provided to another commenter on this submission makes complete sense.  It is accurate and specific in terms of chain of events, medical terminology, and the treatment provided to Seth Rich for the duration of time that this resident was actively involved in the care and treatment of him.

The magic is you ignoring all the real workers who would know about this once Seth Rich's name hit the papers.  And yet, we have one anonymous person claiming out this with no evidence to support it.

                  Rich comes into the ER in the middle of the night on a weekend with a couple of bullets in his back.  The ER figures out pretty damn quick that Rich needs to go to the operating room.  Once the surgery is completed, Rich goes directly to ICU.  Nothing magical about this.  Rich didn't hang-out in ICU very long before he was dead.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Hospital Intensive Care Units are "closed" units, meaning 2 things.  They have a door in which to enter and exit, and therefore an ICU does not "flow" into another section of the hospital.  If you are working the night shift, and let's use the hours of 11 pm to 7 am,  there are 50-60% less staff working as compared to the hours between 7 am and 11 pm.  The 60% range is far from unusual on weekends and holidays.

                  Also, someone dying after surgery in an ICU environment is not unusual and equally so that nobody would be suspicious about a sudden postop death EXCEPT for the person who had his hands inside of Seth Rich, exploring, looking for damage done to vital organs, hoping he could save this guy's life, not knowing or caring who was on that operating table, and who expected Rich to live.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is not magical that Rich's death in ICU would have to be a red flag to anybody except for the person who expected him to live.

                   Seth Rich being identified as VIP.   No way this happens.  No way the rest of this happens either.
Staff being told not to talk about him and not to check on him
Hospital being flooded with law enforcement who prevent people from seeing him.
Sometime after 8 hours Seth Rich dies

                  <p>
                   AND when his name hits the papers, no one says boo.  None of this is discovered by the news reporters on this case, no staff comes forward and says, "ya know there was some weird stuff the morning that kid died."    Just one anonymous person months later comes forward on a political conspiracy site.

                    IF you believe that the 4th year surgical resident is for real who recently posted on 4chan, you will discover thast he had NO IDEA who Seth Rich was when he came into the hospital and had no idea that Seth Rich was A "VIP"  until after the operation.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You are beating a dead horse. 
Seth Rich would have been classified as a trauma case before he even arrived to the ER.  With a trauma case, nobody is concerned or gives a rat's ass to who or what you are, even if you are Jesus Christ himself.  Identity means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING when you are working to save someone's life. In addition, It's not like Seth Rich was making news headlines before he was murdered.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    When his name hit the papers after the murder, BFD.  He was shot by an unknown assailant in what appeared to be an attempted robbery and died in the hospital within 2, 4, 6, 8, or whatever # of hours it was.  Nothing strange about that except maybe a few hospital employees saying later on,  "Oh, wow, that was the guy who was shot and  died here the other night."
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also, Seth Rich wasn't a "VIP." in that sense of the word.  Just because you work on the Hill, doesn't classify you as someone important.  And again, I stress, hospital doctors and nurses everywhere do not give a damn who you are or what you do.  It does not matter to them.  And that is the way it should be.

               Agree -- the "planners" and those carrying out the plan aren't the same people.
              </p>
              <p>
               If Seth Rich was actually given a drugged drink at the bar, it might not have worked just the
way they thought it would as obviously Seth Rich fought back.
That could have been surprise #1.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe they were just supposed to bring him in?
              </p>
              <p>
               And, as we see from all of the murders -- even on higher up's.... there's a back up plan to be sure the
victim is dead, or the victim is then killed at the scene of the event whatever it is -- auto crash?
Princess Di?

              <p>
               But, they always rely on the power to murder witnesses and disappear evidence after the crime.

            How do we know this is the report, other than the information on it? I have seen 1000s of police reports and while the format is like this, they're usually longer. There no evidence log, potential wits, suspect info etc sections. If this is a portion, we need to get the rest.

            I agree OP. Why we don't have answers to basic questions is very frustrating. I thought I read that a roommate accompanied Seth in the ambulance. I would have expected the girlfriend to have called the roommates when the phone call was interrupted by the shooting. Have these roommates been identufied? Why hasn't George Webb located them. His reporting is likewise frustrating, he is always straying off topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            The crime occurred on a Sunday did it not? Usually a slow day for crimes and we should be able to  learn of all the deaths that occurred that day in DC which might help give context to other records. For instance  the number of victims received by the coronors office office  for a given date should be a matter of public record even if the identities remain private. Need a FOIA request here. If DC relies on a public ambulance system those records should be public but for the identities of victims/patients.  The statement of the resident surgeon sounds like I would expect such a professional to say  given my experience with medical records. Whereas police incident reports often contain errors since they are compilations of hearsay evidence from a variety of sources.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does  the Metro police department  have its own ballistics lab or does it use an FBI lab?  Since there was no exit wound for one of the bullets, the cops already know about the ammunition and weapon used (assuming  1 weapon). Lab reports on alcohol levels and other drugs in SR's  system are known by now.  Even if the family is content with the murder being a botched robbery why aren't they concerned about possible medical malpractice?
           </p>
           <p>
            The private detective is in desperate need of  redemption. How come George Webb hasn't caught up with him by now? The DC Metro police had a terrible reputation for corruption  that  Chief Cathy Lanier  was supposed to have remedied. Did she really succeed? Even if she restored integrity there are some issues of incompetency here. Failure to obtain all security camera coverage, failure to interview staff and patrons at the club's SR visited that night and so forth. Is that what is really being covered up?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think when there has been a top ranked employee, one who had almost exclusive technical knowledge about voting registration in the midst of a highly contentious primary  with bonafide issues of voter fraud, then the public has the right to know the circumstances of this death and the status of the investigation. We are being deprived of that right by the same cast of  characters :  the DNC, the MSM and law enforcement. So damn frustrating!

             The call with the gf was not interrupted by gunshots.  (This is from memory) Seth Rich said he had to take care of something and ended the call.  I think he said he'd call her back.  It seems that he recognized some sort of situation.

             You seem to be exaggerating his position.  What does "almost exclusive technical knowledge about voting registration" even mean?   I would guess there are many folks dealing with election law with more knowledge than him. There's election lawyers in every state. Both parties employ them. What would he have to do with voter fraud?  His job had to do with voter turnout. Specifically he worked on "voter-expansion project aimed at making it easier for people to find their polling places." Wikipedia said the project was "a computer application to help voters locate polling stations."

              Seth was topped ranked within that org and his computer skills went beyond making it easier to get to polling places. And  I have no trouble accepting the argument of others that he had to have been aware of the voter suppression tactics being employed by the D.N.C.  and it's affiliates especially if he were a Bernie supporter. And leaks were occurring before his death.  So if someone like that is walking home in an affluent neighborhood and is shot 2x in the back without there being any signs of an attempted  robbery, yes I think the public deserves to hear more. Look at the details we got on Prince' s death wherein illicit drugs were possibly involved. This is not the only forum demanding more disclosure. The case is of vital public interest especially if it has the potential to undermine the Russia narrative and the public is being shortchanged.

Whaaaaaaat?     Where do you get the idea that Seth Rich lived in an affluent neighborhood?  The term I heard was "rapidly gentrifying," i.e. becoming safe enough for kids from Nebraska to live in when they get to DC, but be careful at night.   When I just looked up 
Bloomindale DC
The first suggestion was for crime.  If you look on this real estate website, you see the neighborhood goes from green to red in terms of safety.  There's a safe end and a less safe end.  And it borders two high crime areas.

              <p>
               That's what you want to happen.   But it does not have that potential because the "Russia narrative" as you call it, is not really a narrative and it goes waaaaaaay beyond the DNC.   The hacking groups that attacked the DNC have been known for years and the evidence of this two groups being the culprit has been confirmed by multiple cyber security outfits.   Hackers were first discovered to be attacking  the DNC in 2015 and they were nation-state level hackers. No single person could have done it.  They were sophisticated enough, that they couldn't even kick them out of their network even after discovery.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also the "Russia Narrative" includes things like the private citizen Jared Kushner asking the Russians to set up a secret talks at Russian facilities in December 2016 and then lying about such conduct on his security clearance.  That's a felony.  The President has admitted he fired the FBI director because of the investigations into Russia.  That's obstruction.  They are going to fill a lot of books with this "narrative."

             Whoa, everyone who is here has had  their  first post and you have no idea how long he or she may have been lurking. Furthermore, lurking may have been satisfying up to a point and then a prefect opportunity presents itself to become more involved, to do your civic duty so to speak  and jump in to help anyway you can. True we all "know" how the dots connect but I need to see someone go to jail before I can go back to my former life. All newbies need to be made to feel welcome. If they are not bonafide, their true colors will show up soon enough.

             I remember the time when I was new here. Simply wanted to get something off my chest. So I signed up and said what I wanted to say. There will always be new members, and you, too, were a newbie at one time. Peace.

              No, I get that and totally understand that....but to come up new and immediately in to what seems more like to discourage things- we've seen much activity from PG__IS....whatever username he can create to troll threads...just being a little skeptical of the motives, which is where my comment came from.

               Ok, but you'll agree PG_is usually very brief brief and sometimes vulgar, our newbie here isn't. And criticism is ok, it should makes us think harder .

                I don't know either personally and don't dismiss anyone's ability to use any type of tactics....PG_IZ is not the only one around trying to shift focus, they're just the most obvious. Again, I already stated where I stood in relation to my initial comment and also noted that I understood the point you're making. I don't think it's necessary to agree on who is who or who does what,keep in mind it's an anonymous forum. Though I'm willing to look at both sides of the coin. I already know which side it lands on for me and am watchful otherwise. That said, I'm also not here to get into circular arguments or circular discussions. Time is better spent digging exposing truth. keep up the good work, all.

            Interesting. That raises the question why would they fake Seth Rich's death?
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing I can think of is it allows them to say look "The Russian's Did It!(tm)". Seth discovered the Russians hacked into the DNC and then they killed him before he could go public. That would dove tail into everything quite nicely. No muss no fuss, one and done, that would fit this being a "school play".

            This is better than every Thriller I've ever read combined and I'm worried I'm going to wet my pants because I can't stop reading it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go either way at this point. Fortunately this entire shit show will be wrapping up sooner rather than later so I guess we'll find out then.

             The photo at the scene also only has what looks like 2 LEOs when we were told there were at least 3 or 4 (unless they had not all arrived/?).  There seem to be about 3 DCFD there and maybe 1 EMT attending.   So much unanswered.  And I  think 1 not mentioned above that has really been nagging at me is the camera across the street at Flagler Market.  I believe the camera was strategically placed  on purpose to only take the feet of the attackers.  This, as some may remember is what happened at CPP when the shooter stormed the shop.  They are masters at this.  Also, I believe they left and ran through the cemetery at the end of the street. No problem with a car.
