<p>So, who is Iran’s Lobby in the Washington, D.C.?<br />
 It is an organization called NAIC, National Iranian American Council and it is very controversial for its involvement in terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>“The pro-American, Iranian freedom activist Hassan Daioleslam  “documented over a two-year period that NIAC is a front group lobbying on behalf of the Iranian regime.” The National Iranian-American Council (NIAC) since was recognized as “Iran’s lobby” in the U.S. despite the link between Iranian improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and the Iraq War, with some of those Iranian IEDs killing Americans fighting the insurgency.”</p>
<p><a href="https://conservativebase.com/iranians-expected-to-donate-more-cash-to-hillary-for-president-campaign/">https://conservativebase.com/iranians-expected-to-donate-more-cash-to-hillary-for-president-campaign/</a></p>
<p>How is NAIC associated with Hillary Clinton and money transfer? 
  Consider this from the link below:</p>
<p>“Hillary Clinton is expected to attend a fundraiser being hosted by one of the nation’s most powerful businessmen, social media giant Twitter’s executive chairman Omid Kordestani and his wife Gisel Hiscock. Kordestani was born and raised in Iran. Also participating will be National Iranian American Council (NIAC) board member Lily Sarafan and Noosheen Hashemi, who serves on the pro-Iran advocacy group Ploughshares, a major funder of the pro-Iran agenda.”</p>

<p>Why Omid Kordestani  is the person to host a fundraiser with NIAC and what is his work history.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, Omid Kordestani is an Iran native who has experienced a meteoric rise to power among the tech giants, from Netscape to Vodafone to Google to Twitter, and is one of the wealthiest residents in Northern California with a net worth at $1.9 billion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.4-traders.com/VODAFONE-GROUP-PLC-4006195/news/Vodafone-Group-plc-Vodafone-Appoints-Omid-Kordestani-as-a-Non-Executive-Director-16369917/">http://www.4-traders.com/VODAFONE-GROUP-PLC-4006195/news/Vodafone-Group-plc-Vodafone-Appoints-Omid-Kordestani-as-a-Non-Executive-Director-16369917/</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kordestani is a co-founder of PARSA Community Foundation whose ‘mission is twofold: to strengthen entrepreneurial individuals and nonprofits that serve our community; and to mobilize national resources to take on initiatives that go beyond the domain of local organizations.’  If you click on their blog tab you will see the Iranian organizations that participate and what appears to be the “hands on hands” pedo symbol with the slogan “it’s in our hands”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parsacf.org/Page/75">http://www.parsacf.org/Page/75</a></p>
<p>PARSA assists NGOs, non-government organizations, in gaining funding.  NGOs are called into question by this Daily Caller article which outlines why they are most likely corrupt, fraudulent, and worthless for fighting child trafficking, but great for self-enrichment.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/05/time-for-the-trumps-to-rethink-the-global-fund-to-fight-human-trafficking">http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/05/time-for-the-trumps-to-rethink-the-global-fund-to-fight-human-trafficking</a></p>
<p>More from the Daily Caller (remember Kurdistan used to be with Google).</p>
<p>“The history of the current Global Fund is interesting because it raises some ethical questions and something about how this fund became targeted for the benefit of a few NGOs to the exclusion of many of the groups that have been major sources of information and intervention in this arena.  A couple of years ago, this Global Fund plan was put into motion after Senator Corker went to the Philippines on a junket with  Gary Haugen, CEO and President of International Justice Mission (JMI), who today brags about his annual budget of $60 million. Years ago, Google donated $11 million to IJM.”</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with Pizzagate?</p>
<p>After Kordetani joined Twitter in 2015, twitter introduced the Twitter Translation Center where translators can sign on using their Twitter account and help translate various blocks of text for the company.  The sign-up page clearly has pedophile images such as swirls and triangles and other symbolism in the mix.   This discovery was made by this poster in this submission with links to the Translation Center below and spurred me to try to find a connection between Twitter and pedophilia.  I think it is entirely possible that the translation center is used as a form of communication for child trafficking rings.</p>

           In summary,  “The Obama administration laundering some $1.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars to Iran through a complicated network that included the New York Federal Reserve and several European banks as indicated in the following:

           However, I don’t believe that the reason for the money laundering was to get the hostages back.

The hostages were only the pretense for the scheme.  A common player in all of this is Omid Kordestani.  He has knowledge of global networking in communications as well as business, in addition to his Iranian connections.   It is no wonder Twitter shuts down pizzagate.  It is no wonder Iran has risen to No.1 in child sex trafficking. It is no wonder Trump is trying to isolate Iran from the other Muslim countries.

             I do not know what they mean, but this was my interpretation of the image which I posted on the original submission about the Translation center:
            </p>
            <p>
             "What immediately caught my attention is that in the image with the islands, there is one with a yellow structure. A house, that looks like a face. If you look at the houses on the land to the right of that, they are shorter and squatty and look like faces, too. Notice the swirls and lollipop swirls on mixed in with these houses (faces).
If you look at the land to the left, the structures are tall, with some ribbing and red on the tops. Some tops have an additional extrusion with red. There are square swirls on this one. The structures do not resemble faces.......but some look more like dominoes. 
Looking directly below that land to the small island is a combination of the long with the short faces.
Below that island, on the left is land with red/fuschia structures that look like faces too, although a different kind of face. Is it an elephant?
My gut tells me that the short houses are females and the tall structures represent males. I also notice the jet plane and the boat. Lolita express and a drug boat?"

               I believe this post is about the same translation center page, although I can't confirm because I am not able to open the links for some reason.  You might be able to get some answers there.

            Granted, I don't post often, but the shill activity in this thread is a great example of how they work. Notice how they attempt to discredit the name and then sing their song. Be DISCERNING people! Don't just believe everything that (((everyone))) is agreeing with! Look for yourself!

            <p>
             After Kordestani joined Twitter in 2015, Twitter introduced the Twitter Translation Center where translators can sign in using their Twitter account and help translate various blocks of text for the company. The sign-up page clearly has pedophile images such as swirls and triangles and other symbolism in the mix. This discovery was made by this poster in this submission with links to the Translation Center below and spurred me to try to find a connection between Twitter and pedophilia. I think it is entirely possible that the translation center is used as a form of communication for child trafficking rings.

            Its possible Tweets could be private and sent to a 3rd party translator on twitter for the translation.

            Now why would you need a human translator?...because bot translations are just not reliable and prone to error.

            Other than the 1.7 Bill in one year, is Iran in any way controlling US policy or getting preferential treatment even during obama's admin?  Embargo since 95.  Bush says they're part of the axis of evil.  They're always discussed as far as regime change.  There's been us military operations in Iran and funding of insurgents. etc etc  So if they're knee deep in p/g (or p/g type activities) they're doing an awful job of using the compromised politicians.  Was Iran involved in any of the p/g related incidences like the Franklin coverup, the Finders, comet pp, dyncorp, clinton foundations and others abusing Haiti annually?  So i don't see that HRC being in bed with an apparently sleazy Iranian businessman (based in the US) and one year of large aid as being incredibly significant to p/g.  However, the info about Iran's bad child trafficking is disturbing (tho again, of all the child abuse stories that have been posted here on voat i don't recall any iranian victims or perpetrators most were western with many victims from SE asia, haiti, and similar countries.  My $ is on the biggest high level perps being western and zionist (read not just jewish) at the top levels.  As for zionism, israel gets the most $ each year from the us in aid. they get the most preferential treatment in all ways.  also, billions have been siphoned off thru the fed and international banks and banksters many of whom are zionists. there's also information implicating zionists in all kinds of terrorism and false flag events (not all of which can be unfounded).  what about all the multi national companies that have huge contracts with the us - dyncorp is just one?

            I have no doubt that prepaid debit cards are used in the network in some fashion.  It would be great to have a way or the access needed to follow those cards to see who is loading them up.

              Just how twitter is pretty much a platform for pedos!  They have some other part where "translators" can sign up and then go on to translate pages for others. The main page for it has the exact same boy lover triangle and then swirls all over it!  One may assume this is where pedos  from all corners of the globe can sign up and discuss their sick shit without concern.  Sad sad place....

             Iran is the prime NWO target which is becoming painstakingly clear!! This OP is designed (debatable sources) to now use PIZZAGATE/PEDOGATE as the

              lever
             </strong>
             to put it to work to advance their primary agenda of eradicating Iran, which yet again is part of a bigger picture narrative:

             <p>
              There are multiple factions at play:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Khazar Sphere (what is known as Babylonian Judaism / Azkenazi / Ukrainian / Rothshild / Rockefeller angle)
                </strong>
                : These have gained in power across the anglo-sphere over the past centuries under the watchful eye of the Vatican.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Sphere X
                </strong>
                : This is what I have learned to be a must-exist-by-inference faction. Initially it was just dark-side of The Vatican. But it is an actual faction / sphere. It is known as
                <strong>
                 Black Nobelty
                </strong>
                .
               </p>
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              Sphere X has remained low-key over past centuries (other than catholic emissionary influence across the globe). They let the Khazari faction do their dirty jobs, working together out of necessity.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are rumours that the Khazari faction is about to be effed up by them with constructs being developed to take down Soros and Rothshield. BUT... no mention of the Vatican itself. Since this faction has donned them with Judaism and are by most known as Zionist Jews, one can, in light of current developments see an affirmative pattern: The set-up of Jews against Muslims.
             </p>
             <p>
              With the opening of the Gotthard Tunnel, it is clear that the Vatican has a huge role in the satanic ritual (the pope figurine worshipping the rising morning sun (Lucifer)).

              is the key into Sphere X: The Black Nobelty. VOAT has somewhere a thread that outlines all these connections deep into South European "untouchable" nobelty that eventually ends up with the Vatican.

              . All roads lead to Rome. The core of the Empire has never fallen. It is still present and operating today. And determined at taking the world. When graphing a "religion v.s. pdeophilia settlement cases" graph, Roman Catholism by far tops them all. Samantha Powers is catholic. There are many more high-profile Catholics scattered around the world in places of modern power.

              The passing of the soul manifests in our biology as DMT accumulating in the pineal gland at death. When this happens, and the gland is extracted at the 'right' moment, one could see this as the "Capturing of the soul".

                  My motive is that I am identifying you as a SHILL who is trying to question and deflect attention away from highly useful information. I care not how long your "long history" here, as Voat has only been around very briefly and it is packed full of SHILLS such as yourself.

                   You're a fool. Knee-jerk reacting and calling someone a shill just because I've taken the time to peruse his account and find him suspect is foolish.
