<p>But few people know (and the MSM doesn\'t publicize this) that his family has been involved with US intelligence since the days of George HW Bush:</p>
<p>Everybody is also aware of the strange fact that Democrat politicians &quot;hired&quot; the Awan brothers in what looks like scams, and that <strong>most of the Democrats involved were Florida politicians with connections to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, or members on Intelligence Committees</strong>:</p>

<p>Looks bad already. Makes you think that the Deep State had some reason for these guys to be there.</p>
<p>But did you know that the senior Awan: Amjad Awan, oversaw a notorious CIA-connected money laundering operation called BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International,) and was in charge of US operations for the bank from his office in <strong>Miami</strong> (yes, Debbie Wasserman Schultz\'s district includes Miami-Dade county.)</p>
<p>This was all going on when George HW Bush was Vice-President under Reagan, previously Director of the CIA.</p>

<p>So to everybody who was wondering why the junior Awans got cushy jobs that paid well and gave them access to congresscritter\'s computers, and the fact that they obviously have Deep State protection, look no further than the fact that the Awan family has been involved in the intelligence community since the 1980s.</p>
<p>Have the Awans been involved in intelligence agency entrapment programs as well?</p>
<p>I think if you lift up the Awan rock, you will find a lot of elite pedophilia connections scurrying out like cockroaches. After all, George HW Bush was implicated in The Franklin Scandals, that the FBI were directly involved in covering up . . . and that goes <strong>waaay</strong> back!</p>',

            Hang on a minute. This is the plot to the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto 4 - the biggest selling video game of all time.
           </p>
           <p>
            You start out as a Serbian human trafficker Niko Bellic, who wants to start a new life in a fictional NYC (reminiscent of Clinton/Dyncorp involvement in Yellow House organ harvesting in Kosovo/Albania). You work your way up through th criminal underworld - selling the organs of a dead former hispanic gang member Manny Escuela (MS-13) to a hospital doctor on the way up. Towards the end of Niko's story you work as an assassin for a mysterious oufit out of a downtowm Manhattan office called "U.L.Paper". In the UK where the game is made the is a company called Dyno-Rod which specializes in inblocking drains - what blocks drains? Used lavatory paper!
           </p>
           <p>
            U.L.Paper is a fictionalized Dyncorp. The game was written and produced by Sam and Dan Houser,  a couple of Jewish brothers from Britain who were given an Edinburgh game studio in the 90's by a record company they were working at. They called it Rockstar games.
           </p>
           <p>
            After GTA4 was released they published some downloadable content (DLC) set in the same "Liberty City" gameworld called The Lost and Damned. This followed the story of a lieutenant in a biker gang called Johnny "The Jew" klebitz, who among the drug and gun-running prostituted women to the mafia. He appeared in GTA 5 briefly, but was killed off by one of the protagonists - a Canadian called Trevor Phillips.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a play on the Montreal biker gangs who trafficked women to NYC, who met their end on Long Island, which was mentioned in the Clinton Ratlines videos by George Webb as being fictionalized by Frank Giustra in the movie Coyote Ugly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then towrds the end of 2009 Rockstar released another DLC called The Ballad of Gay Tony. This time you play the Hispanic bodyguard of a nightclub owner who has links to MS-13-like gangs. Much of this story revolves around you working for a Middle Eastern playboy called Yusuf Amir. This is a fictionalized Imran Awan.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am pretty sure that the game Grand Theft Auto is pushing Obama and Clinton's criminal (((deep state))) agenda of organ harvesting and human trafficking, and putting a satirical twist on it. Reinforcing and normalizing these activities through mind-relaxing gameplay. There's just too much "coincidental" material in the games for this not to have been made by insiders.

            Directly south is the area where Awan and crew operated (Springfield/Lorton VA).  Almost all of their properties were within 2 miles of this site.  It has been rumored that Awan ran his own kidnapping/trafficking ring in that area.

            very possibly were coaxed via social media from DC to the Metro station on the middle right of the photo.  The destination would be to meet some boy from the high school just off the map to the north.  All walking distance.  Snatch them out of the parking lot at the mall.  MS-13 territory.
