<p>Ok guys.
I was going to make a thread on how great of a <strong>REDPILL</strong> this movie is for normies, but I found something odd.... Hold on,...first let\'s talk about </p>
<p>that movie and the story of Barry Seal.</p>
<p>For people that do NOT know the connections of the <strong>CIA to international (drug)trafficking</strong>, this movie is a really good starter.
This all ties back to the &quot;iran-contra&quot; affair, the medilin cartell, the contras, clinton and bush.
The movie seems <sub>&gt;
</sub>to be quiet accurate on most parts, but of course it\'s not a doku either.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think this hole case around Barry Seal is too Big to discuss here now, since google will hit you with a storm of info if you wanna know more.
But in one sentence:
Barry Seal was one of the biggest players in drug-trafficking in the past. For the CIA he was bringing weapons to the Contras ,and for the medilin </p>
<p>cartell, he was smuggling drugs on the way back. Later he heavily expanded and even got his own airport where the CIA trained militants to fight for </p>
<p>their cause. He hired several other pilots and even had and military grade transport plane at the end,a Fairchild C-123, because he could not keep up </p>
<p>with the high demand of all sides. He had so much money he did not know where to put it. Banks, Boxes; Bags,...the soil in his garden was in big </p>
<p>parts made of paper...lol.
And all the players knew exactly what was going on.
There is tons more, but long story short: Right before he was to testify in front of a grand jury, he got brutally killed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just for starters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The real-life Seal seems to have joined up with the CIA much earlier. The late investigative journalist Alexander Cockburn contended that &gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Barry)Seal first came into contact with the CIA in the ’60s as a special forces helicopter pilot in Vietnam and maintained links with them &gt;throughout </p>
<p>his TWA years. Other accounts suggest his links might have gone back as far as the Bay of Pigs. Moreover, although the film &gt;suggests Seal was just </p>
<p>an excitement-loving pilot who got swept up into espionage at the time, eight years earlier he had been attempting to &gt;fly 1,350 pounds of plastic </p>
<p>explosives to some anti-Castro Cubans based in Mexico when he was arrested by the U.S. Customs Service. And &gt;far from resigning from TWA in </p>
<p>1978 to pursue this new, more exciting career in spying, he was fired in 1974 for falsely claiming medical leave &gt;when actually he was absent due to </p>
<p>weapons trafficking. He escaped prosecution only because the CIA intervened, stating a trial would &gt;threaten national security.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Needless to say, such a scene would have been highly controversial, considering Bill Clinton\'s involvement in the affair has never been &gt;proven. </p>

<p>The movie balanced the political scales, however, as the original script also implicated the complicity of George H.W. Bush, then Vice &gt;President, in a </p>
<p>scene that was also cut.&quot;

<h2>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::MAIN::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</h2>
<p>NOW some weird stuff:
As watching the movie I thought to myself:&quot; Damn that dude looks like Stephen Paddock and behaves like him/his brother!
This William Cooper is supposed to be dead quiet long.
I just wanna check where they both lived. My intuition always leads me to this strange things.</p>
<p>link to screenshot from movie:
<a href="https://ibb.co/mgi3eb">William J.Cooper in the movie: -jpg</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>William J.Cooper:</h2>
<p>He was one of the pilots that got hired by Barry Seal. Of course he made a fortune as well.</p>
<h4>Article from 1986!</h4>
<h4>http://articles.latimes.com/1986-10-10/news/mn-5214_1_air-america</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In Reno, where Cooper has lived off and on since 1949, a friend displayed a 1973 newsletter distributed to Air America employees that had a </p>
<p>photograph of Cooper in uniform and identified him as the head of a training program for the Laotian air force.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>RENO.</h4>
<hr />
<h2>Stephen Paddock:</h2>
<p>We all know the story of Stephen Paddock until now, which was also a pilot, which amounted an immense fortune for him and his family,...with </p>
<p>ähm...video poker. Wasn\'t he also suspected to be involved in child/drug/weapons smuggling for the Deep State?
Ok lets check where he lived:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paddock lived in Mesquite for several years with his Filipino-born girlfriend whom he met at the Atlantis in Reno, Nevada.[36] According to </p>
<p>neighbors, they also lived together in <strong>Reno</strong>.[34] Many Mesquite residents recalled only seeing him around town; those familiar with Paddock </p>
<p>described him as someone who did not speak much and kept a low profile.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Paddock">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Paddock</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really Reno?? what where the odds? While watching the movie I did not know these 2 cases where geographical that close, but the same fucking </p>
<p>small city?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Reno,_Nevada">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Reno,_Nevada</a></p>

<li>2000 – Population: 180,480.</li>
<li>2010 – Population: 225,221</li>
</ul>
<p>I really suspect that paddock and/or his family was somehow involved in that shit.
At first everybody suspected that Paddock was a arms dealer working for the FBI, but I think it\'s clearly CIA. Just google both.
The FBI is only used to cover up for the big boys.</p>

            I have said many times on here that eventually Paddock took the place of Barry Seal.  When that exactly happened I don't know the exact year, but slowly he took over, and probably after Seal's death.  and YES  I strongly believe his father was DB Cooper.  Whenever I think about Mena I just can't get those two boys out of my mind.  Killed and then Thrown on the RR Tracks.
