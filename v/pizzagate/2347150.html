            Won't be able to watch the full interview until tomorrow ...
But I thought the preview was very difficult for Dylan who is probably still feeling the suffering of her 
time with Woody Allen which began before she was 7 years old.  In many ways, she was being
abused by Woody Allen before she was 7 years old and penetrated digitally.
           </p>
           <p>
            Woody Allen's lawyers immediately made clear he and they understood immediately that this 
was causing "a hit" on his movies.  This is about money in large part for him and prestige.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also find the idea that Mia reacted as a "spurned" lover when she saw the naked and 
pornographic photos of Soon Yi which Woody Allen left out for her to see.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mia reacted as a Mother concerned for her daughter appearing in naked and pornographic
pictures taken by a man she was in a relationship with.
           </p>
           <p>
            MORE CONVINCING, however, is the likelihood that it was Woody who was acting out 
his anger with Mia as he was beginning to realize that the son he thought he had with Mia Farrow
was actually the child of Frank Sinatra.
If you haven't seen Ronan Farrow -- take a look -- you are looking into the face of Frank Sinatra.

            Woody Allen is married to his step daughter, that's all I need to know. What sort of sick society even lets that happen?  This insanity has been accepted by many just as rapist Catholic priests have been accepted by many. Of course I believe you Dylan Farrow.

             More accurately he married the adoptive daughter of his ex-partner. There wasn't a father-daughter relationship between them that could be the basis of anything like incest.

              Actually, he was seen in the Farrow household as a step-father and he had exposure and 
access to Soon Yi immediately upon the beginning of his relationship with Mia Farrow and
the beginning of his visits to Mia's apartment.
Originally, Moses had commented that he had observed Woody making overtures to Soon Yi
which could only be called "grooming."
              <br/>
              Originally, Moses also refused visiting rights with Woody Allen and the Court refused to force him to accept visits with Woody.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Court -- Justice Wilk -- also made clear the earned distrust of Woody Allen in the family
as having tried to turn one member of the family against the other.
             </p>
             <p>
              Much later, we see Moses support Woody Allen ... but there are many questions as to what happened
in between that time which may have had to do with money.

                Woody was seen as part of the family, very involved with the children.
Taking them on European vacations.  Spending time at Mia Farrow's homes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Woody had also adopted Dylan, Moses and Satchel ... in fact he was believed at one time
to be Satchel's biological father.
               </p>
               <p>
                He was a father figure to the children.
And since he had a 12 YEAR romantic relationship with Mia as her lover, he was 
aware of Soon Yi long before she was 16.
               </p>
               <p>
                Soon Yi was adopted by Previn ... Mia's ex-husband ... but she lived in a 
household where the current "uncle" or "Step-father" or "lover of her Mother's" was Woody Allen.

               Friends and relatives can often help raise a child but a father - daugter relationship is more than that, at least in functional family. Allen does look dodgy, especially with Dylan's testimony, but saying that he married his step-daughter doesn't fairly reflect the facts.

                He helped raise that child from when she was a small infant.  Ergo he is her step father.  At the very least he was a strong father figure.  But he decides he wants to start a sexual relationship with her.  As Donald Trump would say WRONG!

                  She would say that though wouldn't she? This is a child who has  been brainwashed from a young age to believe being married to her father is "right" and because of people like you accepting it instead ofbeing disgusted, the idea is "normalised" well its not, put in it whatever terms you want to make yourself feel comfortable but the fact is this is wrong

                   If it was true then she would say that. Being married to your father is incestuous, you are wrong to say that I accept it.

                    I just find it weird how you’re arguing with myself and others about whether he was a stepfather/father figure or not.  I would say he was a father figure at the least.  So would majority. So in my eyes that’s weird.  But whatever

                     Any ideas why he would adopt the other two kids and not Soon Yi? I realized that yesterday while writing a response to Carmencita from Wikipedia on here. He adopted the other kids but not her.

                      Probably so he knew he could get away with marrying her, or to use the same argument that random101 puts forward, that he’s not her real father or even a father figure because she’s not his adopted daughter.  It was, I bet, a very well thought out plan, one that would require years of brainwashing and grooming.  It obviously has worked, especially when the commenter above seems to think it’s normal

                       Sick. I remember hearing about their relationship and thinking it was a bit creepy but I had NO idea he helped raise her and was the dad. They don't want people to know that.

                       Looks like he is a pro-pedophilia, I just tested him and it came back positive.

                         Yeah, he came off as wanting to know the truth but when presented to him, he opted to take the definition that would support a justification of pedophilia on Allen's part.

                          Yea the connections are huge with these Hollywood types.  Look at Roman Polanski, the theories even go so far as to say he knew his wife would be killed - the baby was a sacrifice.  You can go far down the rabbit hole of Hollywood and connect everyone I’m sure. The entirety of Hollywood is a satanic cult which needs to be brought to light.

                 A common law marriage is not the same as a de facto marriage. Common law involves a lawful union of a man and a woman, there's an exchange of vows etc.

                     That article is utter bullshit. Common law is not subject to the dictates of the state, the only way that real legislation can negate it is by identifying a a remedy for a mischief, eg a statute to prohibit illicit marriages, eg those involving incest.

                           Getting screwed over via taxes doesn't mean that they understand the common law. I'm not suggesting that they're lying, only that there's no reason to believe that they know what they're talking about.

                            As I said think what you want, I don't really give a shit. I know several people that are common law, same story. I've proven it through a law website and personal experiences. I'm not wasting anymore time.

                              Common law marriage is a marriage that results from the actions of a couple, independent of the state. That is, a couple that fulfills the requirements to establish a common law marriage becomes legally married even though they have not obtained a marriage license or fulfilled the requirements of a state's statutory marriage laws, and have not had a marriage ceremony. Under common law requirements, that typically involves a relationship in which:

                             <pre><code>Cohabitation - The couple lives together as a married couple,

Mutual Agreement - The couple agrees that they are married, and

Cohabitation - The partners hold themselves out to the world as a married couple.

                       I'm adamant about it because I've been studying the common law and it's history for years. There's a lot of wikipedia-style bullshit out there about common law. The incest angle is related to Christianity's ideas about Adam &amp; Eve. It's a long story.

                        There’s the “common law” and there’s also the morality side of things.  And morally, it feels off.  Like I said tho use whichever argument you want to feel better about the situation but marrying your adopted daughter is wrong.

                         Common law goes to the heart of ethics. Also, Woody Allen didn't marry his adopted daugter, he married Mia Farrow's adopted daughter.

                          Either they covered up that she was adopted or he planned to marry her when she was a kid. There is no other explanation why he adopted the other kids not her. ITS SICK!!!
