<p>Today\'s 11/20/17 Blind Items - Long Time Coming
When I started putting out feelers to former child actors who had worked on his movies, I was surprised how many people wanted to tell their stories about working for this permanent A+ list director. They come from all different backgrounds and sexes. Most have never worked as adults as actors, but a couple continue to make an effort and a couple have succeeded.</p>
<p>I started reaching out to them through an old friend. A friend who once had a large role in a hit movie for the director. A friend who until recently, never told me about the dark side to filming a movie with the legend.</p>
<p>One thing he said resonated with me and I asked each of the others the same question. Most responded in the affirmative. Some said they wished they could remember but it had been x number of years or others said they really didn\'t want to think about it too much because it triggered them.</p>
<p>The query was whether the &quot;back story&quot; of the character they were playing had molested. Their answer was yes.</p>
<p>One actress who responded yes, said as an adult, when she looks back, she realizes how ludicrous it was that the back story of her character would involve being molested. It doesn\'t make sense in the story line sense. </p>
<p>She was only in first grade when she made the movie. It had a lot of young kids in the movie, although they were older than her.</p>
<p>She remembers a cast &quot;bonding&quot; experience. All of the young actors and actresses were loaded on to a tour bus. Everyone was impressed because each seat on the bus had a DVD player waiting for them as a gift to take home. Back then, those things were expensive. The trip took about two hours from LA and they were served all kinds of kids food on the bus. She remembers the all you could eat candy.</p>
<p>So, they get off the bus and arrived at this huge ranch. Who was there to greet them with the director? This permanent A+ list singer. </p>
<p>There were also other men there who she remembers hearing were studio executives. She doesn\'t know if they were.</p>
<p>She does remember walking around this carnival as she put it and seeing the executives pairing off with a couple of the actors or one on one. She says they later told her that most were molested or groped. </p>
<p>For her part, she says she was just repeatedly groped. There was a carousel ride and one man insisted on putting her on a different horse each time and would lift her and grope her each time. She says she freaks out whenever she hears carousel music.</p>
<p>My friend from so long ago says his experience differed slightly. There was no tour bus. There was just him and a studio tour. He was older than our actress above. </p>
<p>He was in that sweet spot our director loved.The director kept telling him his back story and talked about being molested and wondered if my friend had been molested. </p>
<p>The director then started touching our actor and did so throughout the entirety of the movie like it was perfectly normal.</p>
<p>Another actress who was a teenager when she made a huge movie for the director says that she wasn\'t given a ride on a tour bus, but instead, was given a ride on a helicopter with her younger actor co-star. They ended up flying to that same ranch north of Los Angeles. </p>
<p>When the helicopter landed, that permanent A+ lister was waiting there with the director. Also there was another actor from the movie who is probably B list today. </p>
<p>The actor was sent off with a group of men to the carnival while she was followed by this B list actor who asked sexual questions one after the other and excused himself multiple times. She assumes now he was going off somewhere to pleasure himself and then come back after. It was hot that day and she remembers him drenched in sweat and just a pig in so many ways.</p>
<p>She said she has talked to actors who didn\'t even get to act in a movie directed by the director but were still hired to help develop the back story of the adult actors because they might use some flashback shots. </p>
<p>All these actors added to the totals molested by the director and his friends. Every movie seemed to have any kind of reason they could to find teens boys and girls that could be molested under the guise of developing their character.</p>',
