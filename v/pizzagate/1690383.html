            That is a good point, who can forget the glee of Hillary Clinton when she found out that Muammar Gaddafi had been dragged through the streets and murdered?   It is very rare to see HRC delighted by something:

            One of the major problems I want to point out
60-80 percent of foster children end up in sex trafficking.
Only 33% of AZ Foster Children graduate high school 
Most never get a shot at something
Hard to find actual stats, range in reports I research

            Mentor is one of the for profit corporations that deal with foster care,, group homes etc.  This article shows how they are a billion dollar business and it stands to reason if children weren't "fed" into the system their profits would plunge.

            I'm newer here at voat bcuz it was the only place I could find real info on Pizzagate &amp; I'm shawdowbanned everywhere else. Thank you to all the people researching and sharing. I was a CASA volunteer &amp; I know many of the CPS calls come in from schools. Just FYI. I quit volunteering because the court systems &amp; CPS is screwed up royally. I just couldn't do it anymore.

            I agree we need to focus more on CPS and foster care. I posted this a few weeks ago with a few leads. Also notes that Foster Care in the US is a MULTI BILLION dollar industry. There are sick people getting filthy rich off of children and teens being trafficked from foster home to foster home.

            Maybe in some areas they are corrupt but to broadly stroke CPS has some horrible agency is really grasping at straws.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have two close relatives that work with CPS.
           </p>
           <p>
            **A kid will not be taken from a home after one call just like that. They'd come out and investigate and the child would have to be visibly hurt. They aren't just going to waltz out and say "welp someone called and said you are abusing your kid so hes coming with me!". Maybe theres a few isolated instances but as with EVERY field there will be mistakes made
           </p>
           <p>
            **Most parents will claim their kids were unjustly taken. Remember, CPS is dealing with the shittiest parents in the country. The parents aren't usually going to admit they deserved to lose their kids. Think how criminals usually act. They typically always claim they are innocent
           </p>
           <p>
            **The gap in which they save kids VS kids who are somehow hurt by CPS is INSANELY large. I know my TWO relatives would've helped hundreds-thousands of children alone so to think how many kids are helped across the nation by CPS would be immense
           </p>
           <p>
            **I'm sure they do get extra funding the more children they help. That would make sense without it meaning anything sinister

            All the; jails, psych-wards, CPS, all of the little institutions out there make profits stolen directly from the taxpayers to do whatever it is they do...
           </p>
           <p>
            County Jails get so many dollars per night per inmate. Identical scenario with the Psych Wards, Public Schools are real similar..... And the other thing they all have in common {except jails}, they all want to figure out what's "wrong" with you, put you on some mind altering drug, and pretend they aren't getting kick-backs from that shit.....
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course then again I feel like the Military Industrial Complex and all it's various dependent industries are the biggest
            <strong>
             COMMUNIST
            </strong>
            scam in the country, and just a means of robbing from the average citizen to funnel money to the CEO's of the corporations making military products and tech. Oh but it has the added bonus of "creating" jobs, and "defending" a country that could be defended by simply securing borders and points of entry such as airports........
            <strong>
             Which is relevant
            </strong>
            because all those other institutions are a real similar scam.

             That makes me SO ANGRY. The parents obviously OD'd because whatever drugs they got hold of weren't what they were used to or what they were told it was. The kid looks healthy - they were probably good parents if it wasn't for the addiction. And if drugs like heroin were legal and controlled, they would not have OD;d and would have likely been more able to get over the addiction because it wouldn't be admitting to a criminal offence to seek help for it. And they post this picture to shame them, and of course this will shame the kid too one day. Yeah the parents were irresponsible and fucking awful for doing drugs they weren't even sure of in the car with their child, but the whole way the system and society is set up was massively skewed against them and anyone who happens to get addicted to anything. Unsurprisingly, a huge majority of drug users are actually attempting to self-medicate some kind of mental disorder such as anxiety, depression, OCD, ADHD, etc. Because our society is set up in such a way that it literally drives people mad while making them think the problem is all on them and they have to just find any way to keep going.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then they take a picture of this whole complex interplay of laws and pressures and prejudices and human fallibiity and present it as a single judgemental snapshot of an open and shut case of simple depravity. Sick.

              Totally. It's even worse when you know the CIA and others have been profiting from heroin addicts' misery. The one silver lining in this case is that the kid was sent to live with relations rather than being farmed out to CPS

             Wow that guy is pretty inspirational, I love people like that, basically like  most of the people here, people who won't just shrug and claim they can't do anything about it or just tut and shake their head, say 'Oh i know, it's terrible' and then change the subject.

            We need to make a database of EVERY CPS employee in every state... Every parent out there that has had a child taken by CPS... KNOW THIS: They WILL be caught, they WILL be brought to justice, and EVERYONE will KNOW what they did for ETERNITY. There is no cave deep enough, no place on this Earth remote enough for them to hide from what is coming. A sleeping giant is awakening... but it is not lucifer... THAT age has ended.

             Hey, I'm all for justice, but you have to appreciate that even if the CPS is inherently corrupt, there are nevertheless well-intentioned altruists out there who work for such agencies and are not in on the conspiracy. In fact, they are probably in the majority; you do understand compartmentalization, don't you? This is the sort of fascistic pitchfork lynch mob rhetoric that will get our boards taken down. Let's do our research and catch who's responsible and not tar and feather every employee of a large supposedly benevolent organization, shall we?

              IF there are "good" CPS agents they MUST be aware of what the majority of agents are doing... THEY MUST BE AWARE that they are taking children out of homes for PROFIT... Are these employees aware of these bonuses? Would a normal person with "altruistic" intentions not be concerned that there is profit to be made from taking children from their parents? I say SHAME THEM ALL.. FORCE them to turn on each other and IF there are "good" CPS workers they MUST expose those doing evil... Separate the wheat from the tare... ALL CPS agents are complicit with this tragedy. We MUST point our fingers at ALL of them and force them to turn on each other...

               Why MUST they? Because it would make our work easier? Because you can't fathom otherwise? Again, compartmentalization likely means that 90% of the employees perform actual "in the job description" type of work. The other 10%  are probably comprised of people who are themselves compromised, members of the very intelligentsia which profits from this arrangement, or so career-minded as to be ethically unscrupulous. In any event, I doubt it's like being a cop where you can't go to work without seeing peers breaking the law and, on the contrary, I'd expect that the profit structure is something obscured from the average worker there.

            This link explains the business.   The pedo elites basically have done everything they can think of increase the supply of kids for foster care and adoption, because then there are many more opportunities for parents that make their kids available for sex.

              That is a really good question - you'd think they would want more at-risk children to go into the foster-care/adoption machine.

              Because it destroys the middle class family unit. Makes young middle class women feel like they have infinite choices rolling off into the future, until they don't anymore. Same with the welfare system on the class flip-side. If you're from a poor, unstable background, you're essentially paid to shit out kids as a single mother.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also may be worth asking: How rich in stem cells is the garbage they suck out of the women at clinics? Pizzagate has pretty much shown the abuse network "uses every part of the animal". If they can't fuck it, maybe they can farm the raw flesh and sell it for medical use.

              If you saw those videos from the brave people who taped Planned Parenthood employees undercover they make a fortune selling baby parts to big pharmaceutical companies. It's a huge business. One woman said she was going to buy a Ferrari with all the extra money she made. They get paid to kill the babies then they make more money selling baby parts. But instead of arresting the Planned Parenthood criminals the feds arrested the people who made the videos! They were prosecuted for exposing all the wrong-doing!

              it stems from this: imagine if child protection services are given cash bonuses for every child they take away from their parents and put into the foster care system
             </p>
             <p>
              how do you imagine that incentive might affect their decision making judgement as to which children are in need of their 'protection' ?

             <p>
              Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA):
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               <p>
                ASFA encouraged a take-the-child-and-run mentality on the frontlines of child welfare. Thousands more families, overwhelmingly poor and disproportionately families of color, were destroyed by wrongful removal of the children.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Instead of reducing the foster care population, ASFA increased it, trapping thousands more children in a system that, according to one major study, churns out walking wounded four times out of five.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                ASFA effectively turned the child welfare system into the ultimate middle-class entitlement: Step right up and take a poor person’s child for your very own.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                And when the army of childless yuppies didn’t show up to adopt in anywhere near the numbers predicted, ASFA created a generation of “legal orphans” with no ties to birth parents and no adoptive homes either — probably at least 100,000 more such “legal orphans” than had ASFA not become law.
               </p>

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               It happened because ASFA was built on a foundation of false premises:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <p>
                 False premise #1: Any parent who loses a child to foster care is a sadist, a brute, or a hopeless addict who “puts drugs ahead of the children.”
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Fact: Far more common are cases in which family poverty is confused with neglect; other cases fall between the extremes.  So it’s no wonder that two massive studies involving more than 15,000 typical cases found that children left in their own homes fared better even than comparably-maltreated children placed in foster care.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 False premise #2: An earlier federal law, passed in 1980, requiring “reasonable efforts” to keep families together supposedly led to some children being left in dangerous homes and other children languishing in foster care.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Fact: The law did nothing to change the federal financial incentives that encourage foster care and discourage better alternatives. So the number of children taken from their parents kept right on increasing in almost every year after that law was passed.  And though known cases of child abuse peaked in 1993, entries into foster care still kept going up.  The reason children languished in foster care was the failure to make reasonable efforts to keep families together.

               </li>
              </ul>
