            The term Fake News was first said by then President Obama while on a stage with Mark Zuckerburg who repeated it as the Podesta emails were breaking.

            There was no "fake news" before Podesta's emails,CPP, and this board...we ARE the fake news they are trying to stop.  Fake news="you are getting close to the truth" when uttered from MSM..

            this is a message that needs to be spread far and wide.  we need to crack the #fakenews shield they skillfully deployed, otherwise #pg may never reach the general public.

            Fake news, Pizzagate, and "deep state" all peaked at the SAME TIME.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am fairly certain that "deep state" is a bullshit term that the CIA released into the vernacular -- for obvious reasons.  I also am fairly certain that there is no "Trump-vs-deep state" war going on; that's a psy-op.

             The term "deep state" orginated in 1996, but like OP said fake news was the corporate media response to pizzagate.

              I didn't say when it originated. I merely stated that I believe it's BS and a CIA meme.
             </p>
             <p>
              It peaked in 2017.  Your WikiSpooks link confirms it.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I neither stated nor implied that "fake news" was not a corporate media response.  Corporate media is controlled by the CIA and has been since the 1950s (Operation Mockingbird).

               Deep State is associated with Turkey going back to the 70s so i assume it originated there. Presumably thats why its the only red part of the map; conspiracies is their normal
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: i guess they didnt coin the term as early as the gladio days but the wikipedia article on pizzagate says:
              </p>
              <p>
               In Turkey, the allegations were reported by pro-government newspapers (i.e., those supportive of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan), such as Sabah, A Haber, Yeni Şafak, Akşam and Star. The story appeared on Turkey's Ekşi Sözlük and on the viral news network HaberSelf, where anyone can post content. These forums reposted images and allegations directly from the since-deleted subreddit, which were reprinted in full on the state-controlled press.[12][29] Efe Sozeri, a columnist for The Daily Dot, suggested government sources were pushing this story in order to distract attraction from a recent child abuse scandal and from controversial pending legislation on child marriage.[29]
              </p>
              <p>
               I dont know how publicing a US child abuse scandal distracts from a Turkish one LMAO

                Thanks.  I saw the Turkey info but didn't want to get into the entire history of it.

                It appeared here in print in 2013 (NYT) and as a book title that same year -
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 <strong>
                  "In 2013 the New York Times defined the deep state as "a hard-to-perceive level of government or super-control that exists regardless of elections and that may thwart popular movements or radical change. Some have said that Egypt is being manipulated by its deep state."
                 </strong>
                </strong>
                [6] Since the Times (like the rest of the commercially-controlled media) is more or less a under the control of the deep state, such a mention is very interesting. The implication of the second half of their definition is clear:- other countries are not being manipulated by a deep state. A 2012 blog post at the World Bank takes the same line, "You think your country has undergone a transition to democracy... You realize that there are powerful elite formations bequeathed by years, even decades, of authoritarian rule still able to block progressive change and protect their interests." The statement that "deep states that exist in many youngish ‘democracies’" avoids discussion of nation states which have long claimed to be democracies.[7].
                <strong>
                 <strong>
                  A 2013 book entitled "Deep State" would soften the term, making no mention of false flag attacks and bemoaning 9-11 "conspiracy theorists".[8]
