            Yes The NCMEC and ICMEC are probably the biggest corrupt government "funded" agencies in the world, They don't report proper statistics which is a red flag, only some numbers in their annual financial reports... and 25 people working at the NCMEC trying to look at 250,000 images a week? Not just pictures guys, how about videos that may be hours long?

           </p>
           <p>
            And let's do some math...
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2015 alone, NCMEC recieved 4.4 million reports of missing and exploited children. Now lets average that out since 2015 yeilded almost 300% more than the years prior, so lets say, on the low end, 2.5 million a year over 30 years equals 75 million reports, and all they have recovered in 30 years is 218,000 children????
           </p>
           <p>
            THAT IS A 3% SUCCESS RATE PEOPLE!
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "I watched over three decades, as NCMEC built a coordinated national response to the problem of missing children and assisted law enforcement and families in the recovery of more than 218,000 children" -John F Clark

            Lets look at ICMEC where you have "kitty" porn artist Jeff Koons as an acting boardmember, you know, the guy who glorifies pornographic sex alongside naked children and kid themed art peices, whose exwife  absconded with their kid because Koons was caught showing his penis to his child?

            Nope. I caught him lying! Soon after they contacted Noreen Gosch with dental records as proof they found her son. The only problem was that the dental fillings where in all the wrong teeth according to Johnny's actual dental records.
They have been trying to get rid of the case fraudulently for years! It unravels all the pizza everywhere!

            Would encourage you to add a section with TheHoneyBees work with Vid.me and reporting to NCMEC...in particular her research which indicates a gent named Brian Podesta is employed with NCMEC.  This particular piece of information caused a twitter melt down and got many people banned from twitter..in fact just saying NCMEC and BP in the same tweet would get you shut down for a day or two...think on that real long and hard in the context of the above...

            I didn't realize until just now that Ernie Allen founded both the NCMEC and also the ICMEC (international organization). To any degree we are focusing on the NCMEC, we should also be taking a closer look at the ICMEC.

             They are one in the same.  Longer tentacles, anyway.  Share all the same info, etc.  Pretty messed up when you realize there is no govt oversight of this government information.

             What's up with Ernie Allen? I tried to figure out how he became involved in the NCMEC to begin with given he didn't seem to have much history in that area. Tried to figure out who he knew in DC or college (fraternities,  etc) and can't find anything.  Best I can do is link him to horse racing where he worked as a kid.  Assuming that's a pretty shady business but I don't know anything about it.  Anyone have info about this??? (It's always curious to me when the Internet had no info on this type of thing. )

             When i contacted Ernie Allen back in 2007 he claimed to never hear of Johnny Gosch! The feds keep trying to pass off they found a decomposed body as her son to close his case from missing to solved at the NCMEC. I caught him lying so bad the president at the time called me back. She fawned "of course I'm familiar with the Johnny Gosch case"! She had to clean up Ernie Allen's lying azz!

             Allen has ties to THORN and serves on McStain's Institute, too.  His bio there should raise red flags for anyone paying attention. Excerpt follows.
            </p>
            <p>
             "In 2015 he was appointed by then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron to serve as Chairman of a global initiative to combat online child abuse and exploitation. He is also an advisor to the Ethisphere Institute, the McCain Institute for International Leadership, the End Modern Slavery Initiative Foundation, Shared Hope, and Thorn in the US, Il Telefono Azzurro in Italy, ECPAT International in Thailand, and others
            </p>
            <p>
             Thirty years ago the problem of child abduction and victimization was unrecognized and unreported. Mr. Allen led the effort to create a comprehensive response to address the problem. He was the architect and a founder of the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, served as first Chairman and then as President and CEO for more than 28 years. During his tenure, more than 180,000 missing children were recovered and the recovery rate increased from 62% to 97%.
            </p>
            <p>
             He created the national 24-hour missing children hotline; brought age progression, facial reconstruction and other forensic resources to law enforcement; and provided training for more than 300,000 police officers. He established the national CyberTipline for reporting child sexual exploitation; the Child Victim Identification Program to analyze millions of child pornography images to rescue child victims; and helped U.S. Marshals track 100,000 fugitive sex offenders.
            </p>
            <p>
             To extend the effort globally he founded the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children and served simultaneously as its President and CEO. He built a global missing children’s network that included 23 nations, trained law enforcement in 121 countries and worked with parliaments in 100 countries to enact new laws.
            </p>
            <p>
             He brought global attention to the risks of unregulated virtual currencies and the anonymous “Dark Web” and created a task force whose policy recommendations are being implemented worldwide. He also created a coalition involving the world’s leading financial institutions which reduced commercial child pornography from a $30 billion industry to virtually zero; created a coalition with leading technology companies to address child victimization; and formed a global health coalition with major pharmaceutical companies to address child sexual exploitation as a public health crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
             His work has been widely recognized and he is the recipient of numerous awards. He was called “one of America’s foremost social entrepreneurs” by President George W. Bush, named “Executive of the Year” by NonProfit Times and named one of the “Most Influential People in Security” by Security Magazine. During his tenure NCMEC was named one of “America’s 100 Best Charities” by Worth Magazine."
