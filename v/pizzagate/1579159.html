            Something defintely is weird going on with this. First the whole Moonie cult connection and now this? This stinks of a cult of some kind. I was browsing Morgan Wests instagram/facebook can't remember and they have a picture of about 7-8 arms forming a circle and on their wrists are pentagrams. No lie. A comment said cvlt cvlt cvlt. I'll try and find it again.

             Makes one wonder why all these, seemingly, well-to-do young people spend so much time engaging in this crap, rather than focusing on their careers or family. I truly feel there's an entire population of "people" out there with a sickness I can barely comprehend, coming together to share with one another. It's horrifying to know they operate without fear of consequences.

            At 2:37 in the video there's a symbol scratched on the ground... a comet with an eye-ball in the middle. They know we are watching. This stuff has all been produced by JA's friends who still believe in his innocence. JA is trolling us. I'm sure he put the kid at the end of the table then told his vegetarian friends that we thought they were all part of a cult that eats children. Typical narcissism.

            From going through her instagram it is nearly all filled with occult imagery and symbolism...you have to understand all the occult symbols and hand signs from the middle finger to the peace sign to understand what they are doing.  All the places she visits and food she eats and jewelry she takes pictures all have to do with the occult.  She is like a reviewer of occult places for her followers.

            They are generations of occultists growing up to be occultists...just like people grow up in Christian families and they are raised in occultism.

            They refer to us as "basics"...they think they are better than us because they know all these "magical" secrets.

             There's an address on one of the last images, I googled it, and there's an "&amp;pizza" next door with a "666" address. Not much of a find, but then I scoured the &amp;pizza website, very weird company. They call their employees "the tribe", tattoo themselves with ampersands, and there are some strange phrases in the careers section as well.

            Okay, it's stuff like this that makes me wonder if there is not an element of psyop here.  CVLT is really CULT, right ? How original.  I only got through half the video because the people in it are so uninteresting and clearly airhead hipster types.  However, the targets on the backs of the people, with the eye, the circles..etc..it's all meant to evoke the stories of rituals, children chased in the woods by sickos for fun, etc.  Maybe this is simply what bored young people do in Washington DC.  It's too contrived.  I wouldn't bother with this lot.

             You could be right. Still the fact remains that Alefantis seems to be close to some of these peoples. And as Pizza-related-sap pointed out, this obsession with some random construction site also seems weird.

             Notice the last shot of the boring "film" was that of the moon coming up overhead, as if to imply the REAL fun was about to start and cameras were no longer allowed.

            DEFINITELY worth browsing through, my guys! Check out the earlier, pre-Buck's pictures too. They're making a big deal about the construction of some type of building or compound. I got really creeped out, but am going back for more. The Buck's picture of Alefantis is bone-chilling, randomly.
