            I'm 50/50 on the OP's Q&amp;A session.  My experience tells me that guys like this are running a pretty compartmentalized operation in some shithole.  They are/were likely in a non-official compound like the Benghazi operation.  They probably run a couple of safe houses nearby and rarely leave the compound.  His/their worldview is fairly narrow.  So I am not sure he would have access to all of the information to "answer the questions" he did.  All remains TBD.
           </p>
           <p>
            He did mention one thing which piqued my interest: "Everything can be explained if you understand the technology behind media".  This fits into a theory I have been working for a while.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Persinger says brain processes can be "circumvented by direct induction of this 
information within the brain. . .the basic premise is that synthetic duplication of the 
neuroelectrical correlates generated by sensors to an actual stimulus should produce 
identical experiences without the presence of that stimulus." He is saying that virtually 
any mental state can be artificially injected into a human brain. . .from an exterior source. 
The most frightening thing is that the means for doing this already exist in a fully 
operational form on a worldwide basis. "The power levels for these amplitudes are 
similar to those associated with the signals (generated globally by radio and 
communication systems). . . Within the last two decades a potential has emerged which 
was improbable but which is now marginally feasible. This potential is the technical 
capability to influence directly the major portion of the approximately six billion brains 
of the human species. . .by generating neural information within a physical medium 
within which all members of the species are immersed." Persinger' s message, minus the 
jargon, is that the entire human race can be mind controlled through the use of television 
and radio networks. (Kieth 207)"

             I agree on the "injection" of thought. However, there are things they are not considering other science involved in their narrow POV they are missing and their "plan" is going to go badly awry.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is something completely out of their control, they can't manipulate it or even work with it as the effects on individuals is so dramatically different. I'm uninjectable..there are many who are uninjectable, and many who are becoming MORE susceptible and many others who are becoming LESS susceptible. There is literally no way for them to control this as there are other elements they have not paid attention to or dismiss. However the science is sound on this. Their "control" concepts MAY have been true at one point in time, but there are outliers now that were not present before...and largely unstudied...So what I was expecting to happen due to the outliers IF the scientific theory on them was sound, is actually happening.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was expecting an increase in mental instability, people doing and saying sheer insanity--things that make those unaffected think..WTF? IF the theory was correct the insanity was only going to INCREASE in the susceptible and decrease in the non-susceptible and that has proven to be the case. But long story short I've been following this development and theory for many years and it is playing out in a way the susceptible are never going to be able to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most people have zero concept of the interconnectedness of humans and the environment. And until we actually started regularly experiences issues in the magnetosphere the only way to test the effect of it on humans when it was removed, was via experiments which are well documented. Currently (and in the past year) we are experiencing more and more interruptions of the magnetosphere..and more and more prolonged interruptions. This is hard science.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you want to get started understanding how the magnetosphere works in general I strongly recommend Astral Travler's youtube channel. It's hard science and very complicated. There is also a Siberian scientist who had been conducting experiments for years to prove his theory that the magnetosphere had direct implications on human behavior. But sadly there is not much in English available.
            </p>
            <p>
             What is currently happening WITH the magnetosphere (dramatically weakened and often non existent) has basically proven his theory...it affects human/animal behavior. There's way too much to go into here about it, and way too much to explain to layperson who never even thought of magnetosphere before...but I've been studying this and working in my own way with it...and am shocked to see the decline in human behavior, logic,common sense, ability to connect with others, just a complete and total decline of "civilization" that will continue. There's literally no way out. They cannot control nature. Especially an aspect of nature so understudied and so sidelined...if they don't believe anything from nature affects humans they're going to dismiss it....perhaps on purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
             The very idea that something beyond their control is happening to/on earth makes people fearful and puts them into a state of denial.
            </p>
            <p>
             Based on the continual fluctuations in the magnetosphere I expect human behavior to decline on mass scales, to become uncontrollable...for the susceptible.

              Excellent stuff.  A bit above my pay grade.  I should have added that my theory also incorporates that some people are not subject to some times of influence.  Just like some people cannot be hypnotized.

              Alas, I'd be curious to see a study on the TV viewing habits between liberals and conservatives.  I also think that video games and SSRIs are another "Deadly" combination when added to the subliminal messaging.  It would certainly go a long way to explain the inexplicable behaviors of the public as of late.

               One of the issues I've found that UNHELPS the susceptible and HELPS the unsuceptible is I can watch something and immediately spot/hear the programming. I CAN be hypnotized if I CHOOSE. I worked for years with self-hypnosis and and a few times with hypnotists. I know how it works. Also I know my weaknesses and tend to be on guard in situations that may well challenge them.
              </p>
              <p>
               However I believe it is a combination of the "messages" and the magnetosphere reduction. But I fully expect an UPTICK in mass actions of violence, inexplicable behavior...sort of like the zombie apocalypse :) there will be no controlling them. They cannot control themselves. The same way we witnessed birds committing suicide last week in TX because they lost their "radar" during a magnetosphere flux..we will see humans acting the same.
              </p>
              <p>
               I tend to be more quantum physics oriented...meaning I may have "mystical experiences" but I never ever believe that said experiences cannot be explained scientifically. Some call this science Quantum Woo. I prefer to think that in many ways science has a LOT of catching up to do.
              </p>
              <p>
               The results of the Siberian chaps experiments on removing humans from the magnetosphere were profound. I was blown away and it really cemented in my mind that biological/intellectual and spiritual constructs are one and the same. The individuals had experiences when removed from the magnetosphere influence that were radically different and that can only mean one thing, humans are NOT equal in biology or the experiences would have been the same.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the moment the flux in the magnetosphere is "baffling" MSscience...LOL it's not baffling. Why would we think that humans would be less affected than birds, or other animals? Life is frequency, frequency is life. When that changes life changes. That being said, the magno issues have other long-term implications. When we get hit by solar winds/flares CMEs etc and the magnetosphere is in it's normal state it protects earth from the plasma/cosmic rays that can damage us so much. If you get curious you can see actual videos of the magnetosphere being hit by solar events. It's pretty damn cool...however...because there is some as yet unknown force acting on the magnetosphere when there IS NO solar activity (again "baffling scientists) depressing it, and at times eliminating it entirely...guess what happens when we get earth directed solar activity during a downturn in the strength of the magnetosphere? There is also talk of the Shumman resonance changing...and I have not studied that enough to speak confidently on it regarding theories...but I do know that the earth and humans resonate (if my memory is correct) together at about 7.5 hrtz. I have seen it spike up to 16hrtz and on the surface of things...that's insane. That means humans and the earth are out of sync.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a lot of asshattery about both of these things...so I don't recommend that rabbit hole. I DO recommend the awesome Astral Travler's channel to learn about the Magnetosphere if you can tolerate the science. It's not a "casual conversation" sort of topic (and neither is Shuman) and as it is such difficult science these are two aspects of science that are easily twisted into asshattery by nutters.

              <p>
               SSIRs are absolutely a part of this and may never be addressed because of the financial consequences. If you go back and look...many of the young killers like the Aurora theater...were on psychotropic drugs. These are not studied well enough and the fallacy that all brains are alike is incredibly stupid.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you look back at my posts..I strongly advise people to get off the video games, cut the television cord and get out in Nature. However the allure of AI and VR is very strong.
              </p>
              <p>
               One thing I did notice..I started streaming Black Mirror...and I'll tell you this for free...I strongly believe in "truth in fiction" and the concept of creation and collective consciousness (example..how much "imaginary" tech from original star trek is no longer imaginary?) and just based on what I've seen so far...whomever is writing that show is tapped into some serious shit. That's a wakey-wakey show if I've ever seen one. Also Mad Men...wakey-wakey...there's more..and then there are some pretending to be like Stranger Things...fake wakey-wakey.

            A well regarded mainstream reporter revealed that McCain was involved in covering up US POWs left behind in Vietnam.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end of the war a certain number of POWs were released, including McCain. However the Communist Vietnamese held back more of them pending US payment of reparations. No such reparations were forthcoming, so the POWs remained, left behind to suffer and die in obscurity.

            Look into his history as a war hero and POW.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was basically highly protected as a serviceman, connections got him a plumb gig, he was a terrible pilot, got captured, got ransomed...buuuut, chose to "stay with his men" in the POW camp even with bad injuries. The suspicion is that his captors guaranteed his safety after conditions were met, so his people could manufacture a war hero image with the express intention of mining it for political popularity afterwards, perhaps with an eye on the Presidency at some point. Eventually he and the other guys were released together. So now he looks like Mr Awesome, his mediocre-to-shitty history in the service gets suppressed and supplanted by "the legend", and he goes into politics with the support of his family network as "The War Hero Politician".

             WRONG
            </strong>
            . What he's implying is that VIPs are not part of any Satanic Cult and that they are mainly offered the children as 'gifts' or whatever (which may be a tool to blackmail or bribe them at a later time if needed), but that these people aren't actually looking to sexually abuse kids. In other words, he's saying that Pizzagaters are wrong about 'power corruption' and that the Clintons, the Podestas, Epstein, Savile, Hastert, European Royals, Prince Andrew, and so on, never
            <strong>
             INTENDED

            Some of what he said sounds believable, some of it doesn't. His way of wording things is odd, and isn't written the way you would expect from someone who claims to be who he does. Same as the FBI Anon stuff, it's interesting to see if the predictions they make actually come true, but it isn't like either of them really gave us any info that is particularly useful.

             One thing FBIanon told atleast, was to look for "cards" and maybe some other terms from the Clinton e-mails, and to focus on the Foundation itself. In the case that he was not a roleplayer, maybe he didn't know or didn't bother checking that how badly the e-mails were censored.

             Either way, interesting read, have to see if anything comes through.

              It just reads strangely...why would she be so obsessed with the card inside the program by saying "please make sure the card is inside"? It feels like code. Thoughts?

               Hey anon, I looked it those at the time, as there were several of them.  IMO, they are not code....I think they were actually index cards for her to study before doing phone calls/meeting people or speeches.  There were tons of emails regarding her speaking schedule and call list. Remember that she is "often confused" and had some pretty serious health scares and the plane crash in Iran (2012?) that almost killed her (verified in Colin Powell's emails).   Just my take when I looked over them...but when you are dealing with HRC, everything is suspect.  Keep digging though...maybe I missed something...

                Great investigation there and I agree, they probably ARE just index cards. But again, HRC is so off the charts sketchy that I start to question every single thing she talks about. As you say, dealing with her, everything is suspect. Will take a look further...

               So could be that some of the older "speechboxes", teleprompters(?) could use those still.

               Gonna check the fbianon threads again, can't remember for certain if it was cards that he was saying people should look for.

            Stopped reading at trump doesnt need money. Why is he still trying to run a global empire? Cause he wants more money. He might as well be homeless compared to the real wealthy people of the world. Also no one in the CIA is that inarticulate. Being able to write clearly and concisely is a basic requirement to get even an entry level job.

             Kerry also mentions "blood sacrifice" (about 49:00 on video 2) - And humans taken away and used as slaves. Tomkins says it is a "far worse problem re whole blood situation. How to say that to the public?"

             Kerry connects this to "Pizzagate" -- pedophiles starting to be exposed everywhere.

             Tompkins comments that Bob Wood is a "genius." And that he wants it all exposed. But, Tompkins thinks it is "too heavy" and would prevent more people from getting involved in subject. And he very much wants the public to be able to know as much about the subject as possible so they will get involved.

             CIA is trained to lie about the DRACO reptilian rule. Notice how its the only subject that cannot be ratted on.  They will expose a drug launderer, illegal arms dealings, but not draco reptilian shit. It is the one lie they are comfortable telling over an over again because it it is all connected to the pedophilia. The reptilians eat babies on the reg they don't use them for sex they eat them more often. CIA officers when theyre heads are not surgically tampered with know they would get tortured and dragged as a slave to some other planet cuz all their shit is fucked up.

              OK -- so where does that leave us with Pizzagate and saving children?
Where does that leave NYPD?
Should the public know?
If we do know what can we do about it?
This would be a very sad ending to offer researchers after coming this far -- 
But think nothing can really happen until public knows?

American oil will not be needed in america, you guys will be shipping it out by the boatload and russia will be pretty upset but you guys agreed on a price floor or will and countries which american oil cannot be sold and russian old can.

            In my mind, it is virtually impossible for FBIanon to predict the massive FBI investigation into the CF, and the #pizzagate child trafficking stuff, 4 months in advance (FBIanon wrote on July 2, Podesta emails triggered #pizzagate in October), unless FBIanon was actually looking at #pizzagate evidence back in July. He was legit, one way or another. Even if he wasn't FBI, he was part of a private/government investigation that knew everything 4 months in advance. I don't see any way out of that conclusion. He's the reason I went down this entire conspiracy theory rabbit hole and have been laughed at by my girlfriend and family. I was just a normal Trump / Ron Paul fan. Now I think most of the government is corrupt and we're on the brink of some kind of civil war/expose.

            Interesting...but here is my observation, his assertions regarding pizzagate are in direct contradiction to FBI anons regarding organized human trafficking and the Clinton Foundation.  Considering that FBI anon  was pretty much proven to be legit, I'm not so ready to believe this guy.  Plus, he was talking about HRC beholden to the chinese...what about Soros?   And the Bush's being clean?   Not so sure about this one....

             My take was that he was keeping the pedo stuff hidden but letting on other shit. Also he only had an hour before his boat took off and wifi was cut off. FBI anon answered questions doe 4 hours

              Compartmentilizing could explain as well....his Mattis/Trump stuff seemed believable...but mentioning leaving on a boat is OPSEC fail unless it was a misdirection.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here is the thing...since Nov 2016, I now no longer trust anything/anyone CIA related...and the fact that he is jumping ship now, might very well mean that he is rat.  However; I do agree that his focus was other shit.  Point is...who the hell knows at this point.  I just wanna see HRC going down on Huma in a reality show based on Orange is the New Black.

            I read through most of it. A summary is that someone alleged to be part of CIA (or other agency) corruption did an ~hour AMA on 4chan, similar to FBIanon. He said that lots of people in the intelligence community are jumping ship, including himself, and he will be moving around regularly. He said that people in the corruption owe each other favors. He said that all of the Middle East problems involve the deep state and big corporations making plans in advance to topple countries for various reasons, including profit. He said that Trump is focusing on immigration first before corruption. He said that Trump and Mattis are relatively safe because the military will side with them. He said that Mattis is really really eager to clean out all of the corruption, but Trump is waiting. He said that the United States will slowly devolve into chaos in roughly seven months time. He said that #pizzagate is somewhat correct, but not entirely. He said the Bushes are clean.
           </p>
           <p>
            He statements about the Bushes being clean and pizzagate not being real make me think that a lot of this was bullshit.

             He said Bushes are clean, but I interpreted that as a cabal debt rather than debt of justice, meaning Bush did what was asked of them. With the  close but no cigar thing,  maybe he's talking about how it all got centered on the pizza shop, which, and I know nuffing, might be more of showroom sort of thing or advertising (yes, I know, George terminology has infected my brain... be warned!).

             Its not that he said pizzagate isn't real. He said a lot of it involves VIP's who may use the 'services', but they aren't the ones making the scary shit happen.  Don't ask don't tell policy

Pizzagate is close but no cigar, it turns out alot of these guys are pedos but not in the way you think. They have a lapse in judgement on a personal level it isn't organized. people get paid off all the time or they travel to places where there supports "offer" these things to them

             The context of the statement that the Bushes are "clean" is that they don't owe any debts to some certain group, he wasn't saying that the Bushes were clean in the sense of not being guilty of various crimes.

             That being said the post seems like pretty lame bullshit to me. Badly written. Uses imageboard terminology ("NPC").

             Yeah that seems sketchy.  Bush 43 was either a puppet or evil.  Either way, there's blood on his hands.  Maybe he's clean now, but to pay his debt, he had to what, get 250K thousand people killed?

               Google Laura Bush killed ex boyfriend :) No one gets into the white house until NOW that could not be blackmailed and controlled. Georgie boy roomed with a notorious gay man (ASHE) at college in a time that no straight man ever would have. Hello. He was also a cheerleader..and like Obama had his boy toys. Good people my sweet ass. Selling us a false image so the hidden hand can stay in power. The man/people behind the curtain. That's why they're going after Trump....his kids, and Melania, they have NOTHING on him, no way of controlling him..and they are all absolutely terrified.

                I've worked hard to redpill them. It won't happen until/unless they are exposed. Bush 41 seems like "such a sweet old man"... seems to be the reply from most looking from outside in. The people I know who know them are connected but very clearly kept "out of the loop". Long time family friends type thing.

                 Many people lack the mental capacity to be redpilled. That's truth, painful...but human behavior is only going to decline in the susceptible over the next two-three years.

A: Pizzagate is close but no cigar, it turns out alot of these guys are pedos but not in the way you think. They have a lapse in judgement on a personal level it isn't organized. people get paid off all the time or they travel to places where there supports "offer" these things to them

            He may be scared for his own exposure, but  he's   lying to produce shit and distraction too.

           <p>
            These guys are trying to  put out  disinfo to shut it down.   Shill alert.

            He would have to explain what the WikiLeaks  Stafor,  weiner-huma-clinton and podesta leaks mean.  Strafor discussion is pretty obvious.

            You don't do a headcount to know how thin to cut a slice of pizza.  You don't do an hour of pizza and thelema favors, abramovic dinners and Hillary's leaked coven associations as per Bill's description, and Seth Rich's and Guccifers  info.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nope,  there is pedo and there is masonic ritual,  not to mention bohemian grove god-knows-what for the upper groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is  Clinton Epstein Lolita island with a temple on it for god-knows-what he's worshipping.
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS IS WHY THE RITUAL INFORMATION IS AN IMPORTANT  part of the pgate documentation.

            Detailed rounded information is a platform to clear up shit-shills  like these distractors.  Conveniently he logs off in an hour so he doesn't have to ask the detailed questions that nobody thought to ask him.

             IF one were to assume any truth in the guy's PizzaGate statement, I would guess that he was implying it is bigger than just pedophilia, as in child trafficking and organ harvesting (where the money is) as George Webb has also stated. This would lead me to believe that PizzaGate is very much real, but far deeper than most believe. Just my thoughts...

              I've always believed that pgate was broader,  (organ harvesting, blood genetic harvesting etc),
             </p>
             <p>
              In that case,  this forum does a real disservice because it likes to delete those threads claiming that they
              <strong>
               aren't
              </strong>
              pgate related.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem with this  forum stance is that it's defined pgate in such a narrow way that   people like the 4chan anon might think  it's only about sex with children re the  wikileak emails.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is much broader than that. 
The narrow forum acceptance  of topics is a real disservice, which is the reason many think this forum is a controlled opposition format. I realize the limited bandwidth and focus on investigation  and the necessity to curb random meta discussion, but these narrow definitions aren't good and this is why.
             </p>

              I'd head to steemit, but they ask for a phone number and charges may be applied -- so  registering there isn't an option for me.

             I agree on this entirely. And I'm curious about what I know is always used in intelligence communities. It's called "need to know (NTK)". I found much of his information too broad to work in the NTK construct. For instance, an agent working in Iraq would have zero knowledge of PizzzaG (beyond what is public or available via interagent gossip) said agent would ONLY have access to Intel from other areas that applied ONLY to his/her assignment and access point. The idea that all agents know all is so far out of touch with how these agencies actually work...literally the right hand never knows what the left is doing. Compartmentalization is a very huge part of the intel community process. It's likely a LARPER with some intel/knowlege, but the entire post is way beyond the scope of what one agent working the way he/she claimed would ever have access to. That's just how it is.

             The most interesting and viable part of that entire post was Elon Musk and his close relationship with the Trump administration. I have my own ideas about that and if I could...I'd buy Tesla stock :D In fact that entire larp might have been for that sole purpose. Otherwise, with personal knowledge on how intel communities REALLY operate, unless that was the DIRECTOR or some big boss (HAHAH) that was a Larp and would only convince people who don't understand NTK.

Pizzagate is close but no cigar, it turns out alot of these guys are pedos but not in the way you think. They have a lapse in judgement on a personal level it isn't organized. people get paid off all the time or they travel to places where there supports "offer" these things to them

             so.. DB's social media strategy plan leaks.. nek minute "CIA" shows up to confetti 4chan with intel... tests public waters on basic gov. issues.. then assures us all pizzagate is "just a misunderstanding"..............
            </p>
            <p>
             that explanation = lapse in judgement
            </p>
            <p>
             nice try but.... no cigar.
            </p>
            <p>
             whatever DB paid for that performance... should've spent it on a dictionary and grammar lexicon instead.... hiring folks right off the street to plant as disinfo intelligence specialists who cannot succeed to "appear intelligent" is just bad form...
            </p>
            <p>
             i think the moral is that now, in this hyper-psychological-warfare-arena, we have to be able to separate logic... skeptical of everything even if it sounds alluring.. like... how would this guy even know about "most of them"?  so... probably getting fired for real now

             That's the only thing I didn't like, but every one of these guys is not gonna know everything (that's my hope). Besides, many things stay compartmentalized, esp. with contractors.

             I was vaguely curious until he started talking about Musk and secret flying cars coming out in a few months. Sorry, I love a good sci fi story, but that's a LARP, and not a particularly good one.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, why leave a whole fucking laptop, which is very hard to sanitize and hide, rather than a hard drive or USB drives, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then leave some sort of location code on a public (and surely monitored) board? And assume that the 4chan Power of Autism would find it (if real) before a leigon of professional cryptographers?

              Actually the ONLY viable bit was Elon Musk and Telsa, but not in relation to flying cars...that was an flying bone toss. Otherwise, it was bullshit. Completely unlike FBIanon.

             Writers are instructed to shoot for 8th grade level. That's how Trump won the election. Just making a point. When I was writing for a 'celebrity' alternative doc (whom I cared not a whit for) he told me the same thing, but I ignored it (and lost some assignments).

               Actually yeah it is 9th grade, that's what I should've said, thanks. (No fun writing like that!). 
And this intel guy actually is 'talking,' not 'writing.' Do we think he speaks legalese w/ his wife, or w/ perfect grammar? 
I guess some robotic military folk would.

                Military/ Gov. agency writing is completely different than normal written communication. I can tell immediately if someone is writing or has been used to writing "report style". That guy wasn't dumbing down anything, it's impossible for those people to "turn the communication switch" completely off...and this one never slipped at all...so my guess is he's lying. That was NOT the case with FBIanon. That person does at least have some experience in gov. communication style.

               <p>
                The key to 9th grade is short short sentences. I would be writing for a book and run my score...FUUUCK still too high...go back, edit some more, run the score again...FUUCK...sometimes it took me longer to write stupid than it did to research and compile info on what I had to write about. I even had to dumb it down for the TE wrap...and that's fucking saying something.

                  I listened to a compilation of things he said during the election cycle. And I was wowed at his skill in communication. When speaking to a large group of people from varied backgrounds it is useful to distill and communicate to the lowest denominator. His entire language/body language...was to communicate he said what he meant and meant what he said, it was patently honest and earnest and without a single element of "talking down to" and yet it was not a message that could ever have been seen as indirect/secretive/ or you're not smart enough to get it. He knew what people wanted was the same thing he wanted, he knew that if he kept his message simple and direct to the point and....finally...TRUTHFUL people would respond to him.

                  If one wants to touch base with the intellectual class, I strongly recommend reading poor Chelsea's emails. That poor thing is dumb as a fucking post. To cover their stupidity people string big words together into sentences. I can ALWAYS tell when a black "intellectual"  is writing because they try too damn hard to sound smart. I was reading some of the BLM material and LMAO at the ineptness of the communication. Even when there is no visible link to "black" I can always tell. Chelsea writes like that...only even worse. I had to reread some of that shit a few times...I'm like WTF is she even trying to say.

                  Donald Trump has the communication skills of a master. Listening to Hillary in comparison you get the idea that she's saying "you won't understand what or how I'm going to fix things, just trust me, and my vagina"...

                    HAHA copywriting. I have done some of that, however...I do not find it easy to lie. I also tried being enthused about shit in commercials...didn't work out for me either. I'm in a state of being now that makes it impossible. And this state is also making it nearly impossible to work in EdPub as the decline in textbooks is so horrific and designed to fuck kids that ethically if some other way for me to eek a living doesn't show up for me in the next year or so I may mentally explode.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Example
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I had a MMS due the 8th of November...the 8th...election day. I about fucking (pardon the explicit language but no other way to explain) lost my mind. Not only was the AMERICAN HISTORY book nearly devoid of any real...American History...the book was so biased...it devoted long paragraphs extolling the virtues of our first female president. It included graphics of how badly she beat the competition. The civil rights section had a "feature" on Ferguson that while it did have footnotes IN the feature, there were NO ACTUAL FOOTNOTES...and that feature was so horrifically inaccurate and with ZERO facts in evidence cited (he called it a peaceful protest and the murder of an innocent good boy). Facts in evidence that should have been cited would have been the court case (for academic purposes that's the ONLY acceptable sources)...it was like reading wikipedia...srlsy. Also there were literally zero demographics for white people. Literally in this book white people not only didn't exist, they didn't count. So in the education system the explanation for the white snowflakes is simple. These white students are being continually told they 1. don't count, and 2. are responsible for all horrible things that ever happen to anyone not white. Reading the civil rights section left me with 2 thoughts. 1. White kids have no civil rights because their life is always perfect because...white. and 2. Anything that ever goes wrong in the lives of black Americans is because white. That's a summary, but accurate. THAT is exactly what we're seeing on the news almost every day.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    A book on the formation of the American Government (this was a college text) that had four pages...on the actual formation of the gov. A sentence or two on (ok a paragraph) on the Rev. War...and the rest of the book was so skewed to the left one would think that our founding fathers (white demons of course) were actual fucktards who did everything they ever did to actually suppress the real founders of American gov. the black man. I kid you not. I've been forced to edit out truth from features on Lincoln (because we can't teach black kids this)...and how many students actually do independent study...they are literally NOT getting any education at all and they don't know that.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So all the so called "college educated" people we see on the Internet, reddit, voat, anywhere you get a combination of "scholars" and gamers...are actually not educated in any way shape or form. And they have NO IDEA they are not educated. I tried to explain how JQAdams left home at 14 and went to Russia as an interpreter...and traveled for a few years...and brains exploded. People can't wrap their heads around that type of real world education. I advocated LIBRARIES...book, endless reading from all perspectives. Reading about WWII from US perspective, the pick up a book and read from Japanese perspective. It's all about balance. And we are seriously out of balance.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The professor who wrote that pile of shit (I also was tempted to upload that to WIKILeaks) is an absolute fucktard. Dear college kids..&gt;WTF are you paying for? Learning should CHALLENGE you, not make you feel safe.

                   <p>
                    Re the milk article, it's good. But it's the other side of the coin. OMG RAW MILK BAD&gt;...OMG RAW MILK BEST...two stupid positions. Humans are the only animal on the planet that continue lactating past infancy/early childhood. MANY humans lack the gene to digest any form of milk. I personally don't touch the stuff. I'm not a cow, nor an infant. I believe that for those humans for whom lactating past infancy/childhood was NOT a genetic tribal/cultural practice, that drinking that shit in any form (raw or pasteurized) is a contributor to gut issues. IMHO the only "dairy" products nongenetic milk drinkers should ever intake is fermented products like cheeses, kaffirs, butters and yogurts. It's not a popular opinion because the programming from the dairy industry is so ingrained in our society.  I do agree that raw grass-fed hormone-free is best if you're going to drink it. But it's a matter of genetics if a person can tolerate it raw or not. Pasteurizing came about to1. make things a bit more hygienic, (milking a cow can be a filthy business, it's a damn cow) and 2. possibly make milk easier for more people to tolerate.I do not recommend anyone to use dairy. Some blacks from genetic  milk cultures can do well, but I personally think many of the health issues, in particular gut issues have been growing in "occurrences per thousand" due to the increase and acceptance of dairy as an everyday part of life rather than the historical fermented uses or occasional drinking.

                      LOL it's a read. Sometimes I get so damn furious that people cannot recognize they're being fucked with! When the MMS was submitted to the publisher on Nov. 8th it went with a note that "you might want to edit this"...LOL but I shouldn't have. Let them publish a book with Hilldawg as prez. Talk about proof/facts in evidence of horrific bias in education!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      HAHA I let another one slide completely. Normally I'll put in a note like "is the author aware that Donald Trump is the President?" But I'm not doing that anymore. Let the fucktards publish...the snowflakes are so sheltered they may not realize who actually is president...and why. One I just finished had my brain leaking out my ear was regarding the author's attempt to be PC....so in the begining of the book she's like..for the purpose of this book gender is a feeling, and sex is a biological construct...and LOL then she goes on throughout the rest of the book using normal terms Man/Woman and gender exactly they way they are supposed to be used in science. A man has Y and a dick, a woman has X and a vag. a Hermie has a dick and a vag, and a chimera can have a dick, but enough X genes to fuck the mind. Being Hermie (aka middle sexed) used to be a HORRIFIC thing. Sex assignment was done on parental preference not SCIENCE. Now they run genetic tests prior to assigning sex. Being assigned female genitalia when you are biologically a Y was horrible. Chimera's are not as well understood, but it is entirely possible to give birth to a baby and have zero genetic connection to the child if they only do basic DNA testing.  But one thing is clear. Science says tranny's are mentally imbalanced (genetic aberrations aside) period. Johns Hopkins is no longer doing sex change operations because SCIENCE has proven that that doesn't help and they have PROVEN that this is a MENTAL disorder that can be treated. This does not mean we get to be mean to people who are men but think/feel they're women or vice-versa. No one deserves to be treated like shit over stuff like this, but at the same time we do not need to be normalizing the behavior as people cannot then get help.

                     <p>
                      There is a great novel called Middle Sex, strongly recommend. Reading on the chimera syndrome is harder to find. It came to scientific light when a woman was petitioning for custody of her child in a custody case...I forget why they made her do a DNA test but the case fell apart when she came back as not genetically related to the child. Science dug deeper (yay) when there was countless eyewitness testimony and depositions stating that she indeed did give birth to that child. Seems with humans Chimeras are going to be very interesting. It is entirely possible that a person can commit a crime, leave DNA evidence and then have the DNA tested evidence prove that person did NOT commit the crime...when in fact they did.

                    If they have fish genes in them I'm not impressed. That's just nasty science.  These particular  pink Cara oranges were delicious,  but   a lot of the fruits and  vegetables that I eat  have no flavor at all.  Did you notice that?  You don't need to add synthetic crap to them to make them taste good.   The traditional way of growing food tasted much better,  without introducing unnecessary fish genetics into the body.   Maybe your schlong will turn into a fin!  Imagine how well you'll swim then?

             Thread was heavily shilled by ctr on GLP. Anyone live by rock port that can grab the laptop it has every fucking bit of treason on it. Able to put hundreds away and have them hung without a trial.

               I have personal knowledge that the very first foreign service officer test for members of the public has an extensive  (maybe an hour) section to prove written English skills. This fuckkng loser would have failed badly. I expect a typical stoner idiot would have more fun dreaming up this larp than proofreading

                I have mixed feelings. But what you're saying means nothing, they may have to 'pass' on English but then you can get sloppy as you want, plus he was in a big hurry.
I'm a writer and once you know all the rules of grammar you're free to break them - so long as you keep the reader engaged - the maxim is "write like you talk."
And now it's down to one-word paragraphs just to try and hold the reader's attention in this faceless digital age.

                 Spelling errors man. They'll make you correct comment placements etc too.  You think those ingrained habits are dropped in "casual" typing? Get real.  I saw a guy today on this very sub say "..to ferment uprisings."  Govt workers do nothing but read and write brief professional memos all day and almost certainly write better, as they come from the  educated class.

                    Good point. I wrote this before I saw the larpy laptop part too. No way does some contractor leave a laptop somewhere with obvious clues like that. Every intellegence agency in the world would be there.

              LOL.  I literally just refreshed the thread to point out he must be talking about Rockport, TX  (oil rigs and redfish = Gulf of Mexico).  So if this wasn't a LARP, find a pool hall on/near the beach, there, and you'll find a laptop anchored to a jetty among a "stash."

             For sure, no one who gets tortured is able to function at the levels McCain does everyday. Either that or McCain has some great fixers hiding all of his emotional issues that would occur if he was really tortured.

              McCain was never tortured he gave up everything like the little weasel he is. Mixed gave him the death penalty for giving up all our aerial flight patterns helping us lose the air war in Vietnam. He also gave up some key strategies platoons were using to help hide in the brush. Fuvking traitor is what he is. Deserves to rot.

               Fascinating. I didn't know how bad it got. Can you rustle up a decent source for this stuff? I only ever got the general overview of his shitty service record. Not the deep cuts on the POW camp stuff, only how they probably manufactured his release to make him look like a hero.

                There was an interview with someone who was a prisoner at the Hanoi Hilton at the same time he was. This is where we got all the information about his stay there. I wish I could remember the name of the interviewee, and the interviewer and all that shit.

                I'm not the OP, but I have seen this info years ago and would have to go digging. Will do it if I find the time. Basically the story is, he was shot down and when he ejected he was pretty badly injured.  That's where we get all the hopsital pictures of him and his life long injuries which are what got morphed into the supposed torture. Apparently, torture wasn't needed with him, and everyone and their dogs knew he was leaking all the secret info he could remember. This was particularly bad embarrassing for his dad who was one of the top admirals at the time, which is why they worked super fast to get him out of there.

                The interesting thing about McCain being a "war hero" is that he's always been one of the top

                of releasing records of POWs left behind in Vietnam. Even to the point of yelling at family members going to congress to ask for them to be released.  The thinking on this, is that it would lead to him being exposed as a fraud. We'll never know until they get released, but I honestly can't think of an actually

                 The only real power we have is investigating and trying to spread the word until it catches fire. Some people have talked about this for decades and no one paid attention, so this may go nowhere too. Anything physically involved is risking your life and the lives  of your loved ones.

                  Agree completely.  But as I continued to think about this last night, I realized -- wait! ...
There's a fairly recent Kerry Cassidy/Camelot Project interview with Wm. Tomkins
                  <a href="http://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?94992-Project-Camelot-interviews-William-Tompkins-Selected-By-Extraterrestrials/page4">
                   http://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?94992-Project-Camelot-interviews-William-Tompkins-Selected-By-Extraterrestrials/page4
                  </a>
                  **(Just to re-emphasize, Tomkins and Kerry discuss Pizzagate.)
**And if you go to that page at Project Avalon you'll see TEXT of the two videos which might be helpful.
Tomkins describes the Nordics as our "cousins" and suggests that they may be able to rescue us... so to speak.  Also says the "blues" are good guys, as well -- and have "hairy legs."
If you do decide to scan the TEXT, let me know what you think.
The "hairy legs" comment reminded me of a story by John Mack in one of his books on his exploration of ET's/UFO's via interviews of abductees.
He related that one abductee said that she woke up in her bed to find an alien standing at her dresser and trying on her high heels.  Have to say no one in their right mind would relate a story like that if it weren't true!  John Mack/Harvard Professor who worked with Budd Hopkins who had a hard time talking him into it, but finally succeeded.  Of course, Harvard did all they could to kick Mack out when he actually got into the work and book writing.  Mack was killed while on a trip to London while walking home -- first report was hit-and-run-driver, but story has been changed at least once.  Shirley MacLaine said there were TWO John Mack's killed that evening by being hit by car.
                  <br/>
                  Kerry Cassidy reports sudden cancelation by Tomkins of additional interview

             Considering some of his strongest support comes from Military and LEOs, I think it's safe to say that they would more than likely die for him.

             All Obama ever did for LE was declare open season on cops and put a target on their backs.

             Obama fired the best generals and got rid of people with morals so he could degrade the military.

             So I can definitely see what those folks would be pro-Trump.

              the conspiracy theory at the time was that all upper brass were interviewed/questioned at one point..and one of the questions was would they be willing to follow orders and fire on the American people. It is claimed that the generals who said no, were subsequently fired. Obama certainly fired a LOT of generals.
             </p>

              One thing of GENERAL interest is that Petrayus visited the Trump admin a few times. There are many missing emails between Hill and Petrayus...and I have wondered if Petrayus was being interviewed to see how far he was willing to go in outing Hill. After all, they did toss him under the bus for some reason. What he did in his emails to his gf reporter was certainly unethical, but NOTHING compared to the scale of what Hillary has done. So there's that.
