<p>Matt Forney, more than being an opportunistic bandwagon jumper, is a dangerous Trojan Horse.  Recently he\'s made some anti-pedo statements, and a Pizzagate podcast, but if you look deeper into his past it is a very different story.</p>
<p>I\'ve already noted his association with his fellow Chicagoan, Peter Sotos. But now I want to draw your attention to his review of the documentary &quot;Are all men Pedophiles?&quot; </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/PbUJ7">http://archive.is/PbUJ7</a></p>
<p>Amazon reviewers described this documentary as &quot;Disgusting and creepy. . . . This entire movie is about justifying sexual relationships with teenage girls and using questionable history and &quot;science&quot; to arrive at their conclusions.&quot; 
And. 
&quot;Horrible: As a single mother, I thought this would be interesting and tactful documentary... boy was I wrong.... after watching this I felt like I just spent an hour listing to the justification of a pedophile (frankly, I felt disgusted). The film ends by talking about love and saying age is just a number... I\'m all about light and love, but associating sexual desire for a child with love, is not love... sorry. Protecting and wanting the best for a child (or anyone), is love. Are pedophiles (or categories listed) seeking true love? No, they are looking for victims. Having a sexual relationship with a child is about power and control, not love. It is about the pedophile fulfilling their needs, not the child\'s.&quot; </p>
<p>Forney comes to a different conclusion, calling it an &quot;unflinching look at male sexuality&quot; that addresses &quot;important issues in our modern culture.&quot; Perhaps most tellingly, he says, &quot;The hysteria around “rape” and “sex offenders” truly is a modern witch-hunt, a Satanic panic for the 21st century.&quot; </p>
<p>He also makes an impassioned case for sex with underage girls, saying &quot;it was a necessity throughout most of human history. Prior to the dawn of civilization, in the Hobbesian world of the Stone Age, human beings had ludicrously short lifespans and extremely high infant mortality rates. Because of this, men and women had a motivation to mate and bear young as soon as possible in order to get a few babies out before the Darkness consumed them all. Henceforth, men have an inborn attraction to young, post-pubescent girls, one that an arbitrary age of consent law cannot overcome.&quot; </p>
<p>Apparently, Forney has advocated for the age of consent to be lowered to 10.

<p>Forney is a self promoter of exhibitionist levels, so he has a large internet footprint. But I\'m more interested in what his friends and associates have connections to. Any help would be appreciated.</p>',
