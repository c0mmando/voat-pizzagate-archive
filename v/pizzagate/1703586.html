            Very simple. I don't care if people disagree and bitch, but pedophilia is mental disorder. Just like how killing people is a mental disorder for serial killers. Just like how transgender is a mental disorder. There's nothing you can do about it. That's the way they were born. However, pedophiles and serial killers are a huge threat to society. Transgenders can do whatever. I feel bad for trans, but chopping off your dick isn't bothering anyone. Now back to pedophiles, yes you were born like that and you can't control your urges. It sucks, but it doesn't suck as much as the life you are destroying of a little kid that has absolutely no fucking clue what's going on. Just because someone has a mental disorder doesn't mean they should be treated nicely. Murderers and pedophiles are a huge threat to society. You have to understand that people are born fucked in the mind. That's how the world works sometimes. You can't be nice and just be like "Oh it's okay you have a mental disorder." Nope it's more like, "well shit you are fucked in the head, something is wrong with you and  you are danger to society." If you make a mistake and slip up, you well get fucked up. Which will happen because you have a mental disorder that isn't controllable. You're not gonna let a serial killer fulfill his urges, would ya?? So why would you let a pedophile fulfill his urges by ruining a little kids FUCKING LIFE?? Very, very simple.

            Lol  well according to some that could mean you're gay... Emma Stone is a transsexual. Check out her shoulders. Her ratios don't line up for a female.
I try not to allow lust of Hollywood stars or TV stars. But I think the current recognized rule if our government is that if she's 17 it's wrong but tomorrow when she turns 18 it's alright. Check out this guys YouTube MRE3000. He discussed the clandestine transexuals seem to be everywhere! A
At first I thought it was a joke, but after I watched a few days f his vids, it began to sound feasible. 
In your case if nothing else it might strike you as an amusing YouTube channel:

            Adults whose predilection is a sexual attraction to children and when i mean children im saying 17 and under know that what they are attracted to is frowned upon in society and illegal so it basically makes them predators .

            There's a difference between a child abuser and a pedophile. The difference is the former acts on the desire while the latter simply has the urge. Not every pedophile is a child abuser.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, I believe that pedophiles are still evil by nature of those impulses but can live decent lives

             so long as those urges remain forever unanswered.

            Jesus dude are you high? Youre disproving yourself without even realizing it.  Of course men desire unavailable women, and have decided various solutions from legalized prostitution to polygamy.  They're WOMEN like Emma stone no matter how much she hypothetically hates you.  You haven't defined any terms either.  Age of consent differs between countries.  Child means prepubescent means no sexuality means an adult initiating early sexual contact will fuck them up.  Read about longitudinal studies on age of loss of virginity.

             Asking a question is not the same thing as proving something. You can't disprove a question. I wonder if you're even able to look at yourself and your "dude are you high?" reaction. I think people are afraid to ask tough questions, even around here.

              Uh you set out to frame an equivalence that was totally absurd because there's no comparing an unavailable adult you desire with a child which is not even a legitimate sexual target. And I am high

            Intentionally or not, you're completely avoiding the question. We can focus on the direct claim you are making some other time. I'm sure you'll find this can be structured as an argument which doesn't carry the emotional baggage that you've decided to use.

             Your whole post is a straw men that hangs on consent from a grown woman being comparable to a child's postulated consent which does not exist becsuze children are a asexual by definition.

              This is simply not correct. The point is neither have given consent, but everyone wants to say the preferences in one case are totally fine but in the other case they're evil and fucked up. So if that's logically consistent, then there must be an argument which can say that certain types of intentions are evil while others are not. In other words, pedophilia as a sexual preference is being treated like a thought crime by people who regard them as evil merely for their preferences, and I wonder how that's justified.
