            It bothers me that more people aren't even aware of this angle...The group that supposedly hacked the restaurant and found CP (and fucking posted it) was never really discredited.
           </p>
           <p>
            It IS weird that Andrew Kline is associated with both of these restaurants; it IS weird that these two Pizza Restaurants host THE VIPs of the VIPs. Don't stop looking.

            Even if he isn't related to the DOJ Andrew Kline, is it not weird that the SAME guy is registering all the restaurants?  I guess we could
see if he registers a LOT of restaurants. If he only registers pedo-related restaurants than that would imply WeThePizza could be connected. 
I'll see if I can find others.

             It's been proven that all is same person, Veritas Law firm is a false front for Andrew Kline, there is only one Andrew Kline.

            <p>
             Never forget also "We the PIZZA" and the Pizza-APP, another investigation that was destroyed by MOD's

            <p>
             Fuck anybody who say's "This is NOT the KLINE your looking for"

            <p>
             Remember RENSE.COM had a story and showed that all the klines were the same person? That Veritas was a fake firm, the entire Rense story has been removed, and google has erased all. The Japanese investigator who had written a series on pizzagate has had all his stuff purged.

            Andrew Kline is DOJ, DOJ's job is to normalize pedophilia.

             The JOB of the MODS here was always to keep people on the NYT narrative so that pizzagate was associated with a witch-hunt and insanity.

            <p>
             What is the NYT narrative?

            <p>
             That Clinton is a witch, that she had a secret world headquarters at CPP, where 1,000's of other witches would meet every night and cook 'childs pizza', e.g. children were the topping on the pizzas.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who had the logo that said "I FUCK BOYS"? Besta Pizza, who set it up Andrew Kline-DOJ
            </p>
            <p>
             Snuff videos the pizzz app, ,the arab-owned pizza blocks, that H. Gill transferred the blocks to the arabs in 2003 for free.
            </p>
            <p>
             That H. Gill just so happens to be an Israel front for dual-citizens to retire on Palestine beach front property, huge real estate trust.

            <p>
