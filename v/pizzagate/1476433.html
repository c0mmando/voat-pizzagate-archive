            It's a shame that the traffic camera facing down CPP's block was repositioned for a couple of days just in time to miss the "incident" before being returned to its original useful angle.

            It's not absurd at all. I never said that was the only reason. Actually I explicitly said the opposite.

            It's no more absurd than thinking they staged a false flag and destroying the computer had nothing to do with it.

            I think you underestimate those who move against you. They just needed to plant a seed in people's minds that "fake news" is "dangerous". The definition added to wikipedia for "fake news websites" includes the following three:  hoaxes, propaganda, and disinformation. All of which include the element of intent. Therefore "fake news" shall be considered a deliberate effort to cause danger, simply via those three items. And the pieces are already in place to strip those accused of being "terrorists" of their rights. I don't mean to be demoralizing or anything like that, but I think it is important for people to see the bigger picture as far as where the agenda is really going with this.

            Does anyone know how long the police shut down CPP for? Maybe the false flag was from them to get in and "clean up"or see if there is any proof to pizzagate...they didn't need a warrant this way.

            I think it was partially to destroy the computer at CPP. It might be this too though.

             It seems absurd that you'd think that they'd have to stage a shooting to get rid of a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no investigation or judge's order to preserve evidence so they don't need to concoct some kind of elaborate excuse to get rid of a computer. They are 100% free to just unplug it and destroy it, if they so choose.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, if there was any illegal activity on that computer, I'm sure it was already removed and cleaned up weeks ago.

              Well the shooting serves multiple purposes. And it still looks more sketchy if they just destroy it. Court orders mean nothing to most people investigating this.
