<p>A friend once went to discuss possible rental of one of the buildings for a small business in the &quot;down town&quot; area of honolulu also known as &quot;Chinatown&quot; near the Honolulu community college.

<p>There in the &quot;basement&quot; were hallways going <em>as far as the eye could see</em>, with many rooms connected along the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Where do these hallways lead to?&quot; asked friend.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn\'t know? This entire area is connected underground. But no one has used these pathways since the <em>1800\'s</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This <em>entire area</em>? You mean like this block of buildings that I would be sharing this basement with?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All of Chinatown. The entire downtown area is connected underground.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, there\'s a <em>catacombs</em> underneathe Down Town Honolulu.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you this, I grew up and lived my entire life there and have never once heard of this from any source. But I have heard stories from people who were around in the 50\'s and 60\'s of literal shootouts taking place in down town between rival gangs and police. This place is certainly run by drug cartels, maybe not as powerful as the Italian Mafia but certainly some badass mofos you don\'t really want to mention in public. Where were these gangs residing? In apartments? I doubt it. There is a possibility that the downtown underground has been used for trafficking drugs and even children for a long time.</p>
<p>Maybe someone interested can do some searches for the buildings at or around the place and find any links or suspicious logos...</p>',

           A friend once went to discuss possible rental of one of the buildings for a small business in the "down town" area of honolulu also known as "Chinatown" near the Honolulu community college.

          <p>
           There in the "basement" were hallways going
           <em>
            as far as the eye could see

           , with many rooms connected along the way.

            Also grew up there, can confirm that historic (early 1900s) Honolulu is celebrated all over in photographs (the Royal palace being electrified before the white house is a common factoid for ex) but I never heard of tunnels

              Oh my, he might have been raped by that psychiatrist that raped and abused for 27 years.  It is a terrible story.  This whole mess has so many turns and corners and the story never ends.  There is always another chapter.  Also is this John Podesta's dream
"hot dog" stand?
