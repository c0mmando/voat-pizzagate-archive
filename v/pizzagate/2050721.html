            Zachary's whole schtick is about predicting professional sports outcomes and even scores according to gematria/numerology.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know what percentage of his predictions actually came true, so I'm kinda leery of him as well...

            Fuck me dead, this is actually painful to listen to. These ACFAU blokes are just idiots and really should not be considered an accurate example of a genuine pizzagater, please, do not associate those arrogant, biased pricks with people who are giving up a lot of their time and putting their safety on the line, in order to in whatever way possible, get to the bottom of this fuckery.

            Hubbard's right, a major reason this has been allowed to go on, is that it does indeed serve as a honeypot.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I don't yet think that it was something they have had control over from day-dot. At this time I'm more of the opinion that they're pulling the usual "hide in plain sight" and damage control tactics - pointing our fingers at CPP or even at Clinton et al, is only going to get the investigation so far, as they most certainly are not the ringleaders... anyone here with a brainstem knows that, or with an open mind can grasp it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think where your posts are getting a lot of flak, is the implication that there's nothing coming from pizzagate which is genuinely worth investigating. That's an unfair indictment, especially if you're also discrediting the pages of legitimate research here, which has shed light on a great many nodes(or potential nodes) in the international trafficking network.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot has and will continue to come from this thing we call pizzagate - it's just a bit of a minefield being this far behind enemy lines(so to speak), all sorts of punches are being pulled, including a very obvious infiltration of this here subverse - whether it's a few or all moderators, or your average user shills, it's clear that whatever pizzagate is, a great deal of effort is going into controlling it - this raises questions in and of itself which warrant investigation - albeit that we should be very discerning of so-called traps being set for us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Indeed, one of the likely traps is to convince pizzagaters that they've been duped entirely, so as to demoralize and neuter the investigation.
Seeing as how spinning the "fake news" and "deranged shooter" narratives hasn't killed the impetus.

            I'm still not convinced. I think it's possible they want us to think they secretly gave us the info on purpose, so we could run around chasing our tails, then come to the conclusion it's a psyop and ditch this year's worth of investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            But why give us so much info that will lead us to their legit crimes? Why would the Clinton's agree to make themselves look even more guilty than that which they truly are? Just for the purpose of discrediting us for believing in a crazy conspiracy? If they hadn't provided the information to begin with, we wouldn't have know about it, so what would be the purpose in this scenario?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems possible in theory, but when you put it into play in real life, I don't see where thats a good move. Unless the people above her chose to sacrifice her (not in the physical sense).
           </p>
           <p>
            But believing this, means we also believe assange was either a) knowingly complicit and willing to throw away all his credibility, or b) was duped just like the rest of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Summary: I think calling pizzagate a psyop is a psyop

             However, you want to talk the same shit about Seth rich, I'll listen. How did this story come back into light the second time around? Not saying, yet, that he's not real, just saying too many conflicting accounts and coincidences. It's almost like 3 bad authors trying to write a story together.

            Never heard of Zach Hubbard before.  He is spot on!!  ^
           </p>
           <p>
            His "mistake" is trying to have a rational debate with a Christian (Call for an Uprising).  All Christians are brainwashed by definition. so they are devoid of critical thinking skills right outta the gate.

            I just subscribed to Zachary's channel. I'm sure I dismissed him earlier because I sounded just like the Jeff C. guy up to about last week.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've got to understand people like Jeff C. and me couldn't understand exactly how diabolically evil the US government is. So when you and people like Zach Hubbard told us the truth we shot the messenger. It was classic.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same thing happens all the up the way across the truth curve. The people just entering shoot the next layer over because they just can't handle knowing those at the top are so psychotic.
           </p>
           <p>
            But they are. I'm now at the point where I think literally EVERYTHING about the past year was engineered as a psy-op. The whole fucking thing is rotten. It takes a while to process that. Even George Webb is part of the deal. He's just the shallow learning curve to pull people in.
