The email OP linked, Says they were with Podesta Close to his 72nd, a Month to the date.  Relatively speaking, That is close..

<p><strong>But I have the invitation the David Brock book party, sep 2015 at 5:00PM...</strong></p>
<p><strong>I know the invitations for the Rothschild David brock book party, on sep 14th...</strong></p>
<p><strong>And I know the invitiatioN From Dan And brook For the brock party on sep 16th..</strong>.. </p>
<p>But I never saw anyone Post the email To the Biggest Book party of them all... The One On <strong>sep 24th, 2015</strong>, at tony podestas house... Including all of the people mentioned above and more. </p>
<p>Here\'s that email <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56681">With the Invitation and all of the people Mentioned above included as Hosts\'</a>  You wouldn\'t find the email by searching any Code words- But I knew It had to exist, Based On some other information.  And I found It. So I\'m gonna be annoyed If someone already found it and posted it,  because The way in which I found it retardedly over complicated... But nonetheless, I found It. </p>
<p>I also have a detailed Time line of The popes moves for september 24th... It\'s to much to post in a voat comment.</p>
<p>But basically From 2:00pm We lose the pope Until he arrives at the airport to head to NYC...</p>
<p>At 3:00pm there was a live stream from outside the Vaticans Embassy... He was allegedly Inside. We never saw him go in the embassy, Or leave the embassy. We never see him again, Until he arrives at the airport. </p>
<p>It\'s confirmed the pope Left St Patricks Church at 2:00 oclock. He was said to have Blown off meeting with memebers of congress... To meet with the poor.... In a session closed to media.. under a tent. we never see the pope once he leaves the church. </p>

            Rule 3:  This post is a confusing, rambling mess. Please finish your post before posting it.  You have two links. One is an email that doesn't mention the Pope.  One is the Google Maps locations for Catholic Charities in DC and the Podesta Group.  So what is evidence that the Pope met with those people? Please make a new post and avoid the rambling.  (No offense intended.) Thx.

             lol. You're a moron. I laid it down perfectly. Considering you can't say I'm wrong about a single aspect, and suggest an alternate theory. How often do you consider killing yourself? At least Try to shill better.

              Ok I read it again. I see a lot of claims, and claims of having info you didn't post is what I see. Basically it says "what i say is true but I won't post all my info."

              Maybe you are sincere, I dunno.
