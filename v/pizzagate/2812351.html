            wow .... i'm from australia and i can verify all of those stories are very possible ive been to darwin and its crazy there the white people are terrified of the long grass people and the pedophilia in the sixties here was rampant its not accident they took the children away from their parents they separated them for easier access in institutions

            Hi there

            . Thanks for digging this up. Because it's a personal account with no corroborating evidence, I'm going to give this our "Unconfirmed" flair. If documentation of these events actually happening turns up, please add those links and ping me, and I will switch this flair to "Potential Lead". :-)  It's still a potential lead...just an unconfirmed one. Happy digging!

             You're welcome, and sure.  As for the 4chan thread, this information is old, and the judge and politician named by the AFP are dead now.  Stuff like this helps me see the historical background to pizzagate though, and also to realise Australia is much more corrupt and controlled than I had previously realised.  It's possible or even likely aboriginal children are still being trafficked here.

             As for Renee Emmanuel's blog, she does post quite a bit of evidence supporting her story.  Also there is a lot of detail on how the satanic cults work (for those interested in generational satanism).  Her family was also connected with the Salvation Army--just imagine! 
 She seems to suffer from poor health and hasn't posted in her blog at all this year, so I hope she is still okay.

            Bumping my own thread, this guy’s memories somewhat match events recalled by Australian blogger Renee Emmanuel (birth name Maureen Farthing) who was born into a multi-generational family of satanic ritual abusers in Victoria, Australia in 1962.
The following remembered events are copied from the forensic report on Renee, authored by Anna Macpherson, a radiographer from the Queensland University of Technology, which is reproduced on Renee’s own Wordpress.com blog
            <a href="https://escapingritualabuseinaustralia.com/">
             https://escapingritualabuseinaustralia.com/
            </a>
            and on Cathy Fox’s blog,
            <a href="https://cathyfox.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/evidence-and-forensics-of-ritual-abuse-in-australia/">

            (also trigger warning):
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             •	From approximately age 8-12 years Renée was also taken to many places and shown how the black bible was covered in human skin by the skinning alive of the blackest of small Aboriginal children/babies
            </p>
            <p>
             •	The global satanic network would use an Aboriginal tracker and Renée was travelled interstate and saw the roundup of many Aboriginal children who were herded into cattle trucks and brought back to the state of Victoria at night
            </p>
            <p>
             •	They also had specific exchange spots (towns, trading posts) on the route for the trafficking of small Aboriginal children to different occult districts and states in Australia
            </p>
            <p>
             •	The tracker with Leyland semitrailers with cattle crates would then go out to Aboriginal campsites and round up all the women and children, the men were hung up in trees and hung after they had been castrated
            </p>
            <p>
             •	Many women were raped and pregnant women were strung up in trees and the unborn babies ripped out of them and eaten on the spot as sacrifices to satan
            </p>
            <p>
             •	The teenage girls were kept for experimentation e.g. breeding by artificial insemination with animals, slave workers in coal mines, raped and tortured as well
            </p>
            <p>
             •	Young children and babies thrown into the cattle trucks with teenage girls to look after them along the occult trade routes to go to different regions in Australia and to other region’s queens and all classes of queens within districts
            </p>
            <p>
             •	The trucks would leave from Port Augusta, South Australia and travel to Mildura, Victoria via Renmark and then through Bendigo, into Melbourne and South Gippsland etc…
            </p>
            <p>
             •	Also during this time in Woomera, South Australia Renée had to sit naked on troughs with other girls while they tested her for her period and then tried to impregnate her

              Is it not common and predictable that these trauma victims will have MPD and other memories implanted to obfuscate the real ones? They apparently will have a replace-with vocabulary so that when they speak of real things, other nouns are substituted to make them sound wrong or crazy. (I recall this also with a case in Argentina, not monarch/MPD, but deaf children abused by clergy who were taught fake words to refer to the awful things that were done to them, so that when they tried to tell others it would come out as nonsense.)

               Yes I am fully aware of this but this is not what this attention seeking woman is doing. Have you heard of people who claim to have cancer and don’t just to obtain sympathy and attention, same idea with “Dr.” Sue Arrigo.

              </a>
              , I remember that you posted a comment like this before - didn't you also allege that Cisco Wheeler is a fraud? Imo there has never been a post about these allegations, would you maybe consider doing one?
             </p>
             <p>
              You could post to

               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              first, and ping me and

               @Vindicator

              into the thread, we can then decide whether it can be crossposted to the main sub, or whether it would need some editing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for considering.

               Hi, no I never mentioned Cisco Wheeler, only “Dr.” Sue Arrigo. She posts under her various websites Cathy Fox and Gail Allen. This person is disinformation 100%. It is that woman Sue Arrigo who claims to be a doctor and is not. She writes regurgitated claims with her own twisted take on them making them really outlandish for attention. On one site under her name she claimed to be a Presidential Model MK Ultra sex slave and that Obama raped her repeatedly at the White House etc, however, I found her real Facebook and email address and she is a 60+ year old obese woman with 1980s style glasses and long straggly gray hair. She posts these things on multiple conspiracy websites and her sister wrote in to one apologizing saying her sister is sick with schizophrenia and doesn’t take her medication and that none of what she says is even remotely true, she reads stuff online and reposts these accounts as her own stories. Time lines don’t add up on them either. I went down her rabbit hole with her claims a while back on her site, noticed a lot of inconsistencies and researched to find out who she really was. Sue Arrigo is her name but she uses so many different aliases even on here she posts with multiple accounts. Every time I call her out on this I get bombarded with rude messages from her accounts. It’s bizarre. Please do not fall for this story above, it is regurgitated info and made up accounts in her fictional story.

             Oh God.  This is one of the most horrid things I have read.  Do I believe it?  You bet.  Their crimes and evilness have no boundaries.  They seem to always have to go to the limit and they beyond.  It seems that when they think of what we hold to be one of the worst crimes they have to go beyond that.  They become so taken over by their own evilness they cannot stop.  Not Ever.  This will continue until people finally realize that humans can be this evil.  Many do not believe and that has been the problem.
