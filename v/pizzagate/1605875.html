            Excellent find. This is important information. It also plays on the "immigration" issue as well. US immigration policies actually create brain drains in developing countries...arrogance. Just like the "save the poor children" construct in the paper you linked.
           </p>
           <p>
            I worked on a PhD analysis of the TPP (which is still secret for and you can't read it) and I was horrified. Not only was it going to descimate US, it was going to end up harming the societies (I'll use Malaysia as example) by attempting to force them onto the world stage. That is not something their society as a whole was ready to participate in and forcing it would have disrupted their entire social evolution process. Societies evolve in their own time. We need to let them the fuck alone. I was so horrified at the TPP that I almost did the unethical and uploaded it to WIKILEAKS so people could read for themselves. Thankfully DT put an end to that and every single person on earth should be grateful. It was a horrific, really bad plan. And the actual damage to developing societies would have been long-term and created horrific social problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was a really bad idea. Just like the immigration brain drain (how can societies develop if developed societies suck the intellectuals away? And how can families and children develop in these societies if we continue to "rescue" them for whatever reasons (pedos) or do gooders.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look how missionaries destroyed entire cultures around the world. The most blatant and recent in US history would be the indigenous Hawai'ian culture. Having lived there and witnessed first hand the damage, I am against missionaries of any religion going into cultures and destroying them in favor of their own.

             These people in power are arrogant and as it is revealed daily they all worship the same thing. They are satanists and they are not pretending. Whether it is the moonies, Thelma, Crowley, And others including yes the Vatican. They are false religions just like the fake charities we see. They disguise their evil under a social justice face. That is why people do not believe in a loving God I think because these monsters have abused their power from the beginning. The time is coming though. All things will be revealed.

            Academic papers are a good way of getting the PG information out there, because to be published in a reputable journal they have to be reviewed and checked and they have to back everything up. And there isn't the same kind of censorship even if a paper says something controversial - that's not what the publication criteria is based on at all. Even a paper on media censorship of Pizzagate would be a good one.

             This happened in Spain on a fairly large scale and just came to light last year I believe. Uncertain of Yugo, but wherever any "church" is, expect this issue. They believe they know best. Hundreds of babies were stolen from mothers the "church" decided were unworthy and given to other families. To this day I have no idea where a great uncle came from. He was literally handed to my ggramma in the hospital and told he was her child now. (She had several still births)...no one has a clue where they got this baby. It was a catholic hospital.

               That's a whole bloodline asshattery that is a conspiracy about a conspiracy that isn't a conspiracy but an evolutionary handicap. In Spain it is typically the Basque who carry the RH-. Rh- is used by people as some sort of specialness gene. It's not, it's actually an evolutionary stop-gap that we have by passed with modern medicine. Once that mutation shows up in a family group over time that family group will die completely out UNLESS...they breed with each other. Otherwise Rh- is a death sentence. Literally..for both mother and child.
              </p>
              <p>
               If the apocalypse came and survival were an issue, literally Rh- would die completely out UNLESS they interbred. it's not an asset, it's a survival handicap. I was studying one European family that has a lot of Rh- showing up now. It's easy to pinpoint when the family started to thrive. It's when they figured out, likely by accident and subconsciously that their offspring lived, their families grew...when they married a close relative.  Now they can survive with a rogram shot. If you've ever known an rh- woman you  know she is an literally an abortion machine without that shot. (UNLESS she breeds with another Rh- person.) It's also very hard on the mother. I have a friend who, when her BC fails she lets her body kill it off and dispose of it rather than get the shot but it is very hard on her physically and I keep telling her to get a more reliable BC because it's not helping her health to keep getting pregnant with what is essentially poison to her body.

                Fucking shifty way to try to discredit the notion that rh- organ donors are valuable because the ability to use the organs any person with any blood type.  Thinking that this is about the perfect race is conspiracy but the harvest of organs from rh- people has scientific backing.

                 No I'm saying RH- blood has zero to do with some fuckard bloodline theory. Rh- negative organs would be rarer and of course more in demand. But the whole fucktard "RH- is special" shit is flat out asshattery and fucking stupid. It's not special re-powers or bloodlines, it is in FACT (you know, facts, scientific FACTS) that having Rh- blood is NOT conducive to survival. PERIOD. It's a genetic fuck up, there are probably fewer organs available for Rh- so yeah, there is probably higher trafficking for those people who have RH- and need a transplant and have the money to pay for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you're trying to push the OMG Rh- so spechial...fuck off. It's literally a genetic detriment and without modern medicine those people who are not married to relatives do NOT have children who survive. Fact. Not some stupid ass conspiracy.

                  The Rh antigen does not function as a "transplantation antigen," because it is only present on the surface of red blood cells and not on the parenchymal cells of the graft.  Patients who have type AB blood are considered universal recipients because they can receive blood or blood products from any other blood type. However, these patients may only donate their blood to patients who have AB blood. Patients who have O blood are considered the universal donors because they can give blood to patients of any other blood type. However, they can only receive blood from patients who have O blood.   If the D antigen is absent, the patient is Rh-negative.
                  <strong>
                   Therefore, if you are Rh - you are a universal donor.

                  I am saying that these fucks are targeting ethnic minorities to exploit the rh- universal donor characteristic of the rh- blood having no antigens.  Further bolstering the benefits of individuals who have rh - blood they have higher concentrations of ceruloplasmin in their blood.  This notion does not jive with your bold claim "It's a genetic fuck up" as ceruloplasmin deficiency is actually a problem.

                   Oh lawd. It's a genetic fuck up. The Law of Nature..survival of the fittest. If this group of people had not figured out that interbreeding helped their kids live and the family lines to survive, they literally would have died out. It's an aberration that people who have it say " I so special"  no, it's luck. It is impossible for the Rh- to be a "fittest gene" as they are only able to reproduce offspring AND survive amongst themselves.

                   Rh- are often immune to things like AIDS but they're immune to AIDS because they have other disorders. Look, you can dance around the special ring all day long and it's never going to be anything more than a dance. The reason there are so many rh- people on this earth right now is because ROGAM. Not because it's a fit gene of survival. Fittest can reproduce with ANYthing.

                  <p>
                   I have no doubt that targeting ethnic minorities is useful. Look at how many people Bayer/Baxter killed in Croatia? with their faulty vaccine. But fuck if I'm not sick of reading RH- gives me special powers....dude if it were 1900 you wouldn't be here unless your mom married another RH- by LUCK or a family member. Also rushing to Internet research something you BELIEVE but not really KNOWing or understanding the issue at hand isn't helping your case.

                   In reality rh- has proven not to be the universal donor they thought it was. Strong genes need neither transplants or any machinations to carry the line. Strong genes survive. We have created, via c-section for instance, the SURETY that thousands of women will indeed die in childbirth because we have depended on C-section interventions for women with inadequate pelvises who would have normally died, in childbirth with their child. Our c-section interventions have allowed those mothers to live and pass that gene on to their children. Nature would have taken that gene out had we not intervened. Thus, without c-section technology THOUSANDS of women who unknowingly carry the inadequate pelvis gene are literally going to die. Talk about Children of Men.

                   So imagine if you will..the apocalypse is here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Who is going to survive? The fittest. That's nature.That's what humans have been running from. It's what we don't want to believe is true. Without technology the Law of Nature, not natural law...is what dictates who lives and dies. That's all, there's no other magic, it is what it is. Rh- would be minimal in the population without technological interventions because it is a genetic fuckup. If aliens gave it to you...so fucking what, again, without technology, they die. That's all.

                     Thanks for the donkey factor. This isn't going to help Rh- people survive if there is no access to rogam. Rh- is not a "survival of the fittest" gene. That's all.

                       No, ..what it is...is "the truth hurts the Rh- is special snowflakes" and I tend to ignore stupid. Look you can't fix it, it will kill you without modern technology. Now, explain to me how that statement is incorrect? In a low/zero tech world, rh- is NOT survival. It just isn't. Sorry.

                         The anti AIDS aspect of RH- is only kicked in if the person already has a horrible killer disease. There's a girl whose case was "baffling" but they sorted it.  Look, I realize this is a slam on a sacred cow...but the survival rate of people who have had medical interventions to live (re c-sections for inadequate pelvis or rogam) are not going to live. Those traits only survived due to medical interventions. In societies such as the Basque as a culture they tend to live and marry together and have a high rate of rh-. Their culture will survive. But in cultures in which RH- is rare, I'm sorry, they cannot survive. I don't know what part of they won't live and neither will their offspring without rogam you don't understand. It's a fact. Without other Rh- people to marry RH- women are going to die. Rh- men are going to kill their wives. It is what it is. That gene is not a "fit" gene. A fit gene works with everything, a fit gene is one that strengthens the pool.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I get the whole RH- sacred cow thing, I get that people want it to be true, but I've been in the den of the bloodline families and trust me, they are inbred tools. That's all. That's the only way their dynasty can survive. One of my Merovingian buds is having a surrogate...guess what? He's having trouble finding a surrogate that will deal with the Rh- he carries. Rh- does not make anyone special. It makes them evolutionary expendable. Just like inadequate pelvis. If you can't get the baby out, both you and the baby die, as well as the gene that causes inadequate pelvis. We are in a epidemic of c-sections in the US for a lot of reasons, but an uptick in women who literally cannot give birth is part of it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Dyncorp is trying to find the reason the rh- protects the girl from AIDS, but the reason less RH- but likely a combination of what she already has and how that antigen works. The kid is fatally ill. Just not with AIDS. They're looking to see if RH had anything to do with the protection. FACT even if it did, you can't just go adding that antigen to people...WTF kind of....stop telling me I don't understand fitness to survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         If the lights went out (EMP) in the US probably half of the population would die in the first three weeks, and declining but continuing rates for months after. That's all, that's the truth. Anyone who depends on ANY electricity to survive will die the first week. People who depend on insulin will die as soon as their supply runs out...the list is endless. MOST modern humans are technologically dependent healthwise.  The prescription industry in the US alone is mind boggling. Anyone who needs medication for survival, blood pressure, heart pills, ANYTHING...you're screwed. Genetically strong lines that do not need those things are going to survive.

                           I think our method must be straight forward and easily understood by all...  I am having difficulty accessing the thread, as the comment system is fractured and laborious to scroll through.

                          <p>
                           Surely our findings are at critical mass by this point?

                           writes like a adolescent. Make that a dumb ass adolescent who has no critical thinking skills. It is like reasoning with a rock. As far as the thread goes have not read the full paper but if there is Harvard is writing a paper on you in this manner you think being put in charge of the amber alert system would not be a good idea. 
Now that the connection has been made to the CIA for Silsby include HRC involved with her throughout the years seems like she might just be an operative.

            So one again to clarify a person charged and arrested in Haiti for child trafficking, then represented in court by a known child trafficker, wanted in I believe four different countries for child trafficking was personally freed by Secretary of State by HRC....is now working for an agency in the US that tracks kidnapped children (amber alert) under a different name.
           </p>
           <p>
            And to top it off a Harvard paper was written about this case openly naming Laura Silsby who has now been connected to the CIA because of the tireless work of citizen investigators. What is wrong with our government besides corrupt, evil, heartless, perverted and many other expletives?

             She was not personally freed by the Secretary of State.  She spent about four months in prison. She went to trial and was found guilty and sentenced to time served.   The prosecutors were only seeking six months in jail.

             don't exclude the MSM because propaganda and deception there perpetrates all the corruption. We have gotten to a point were the MSM has discredited itself but Trump better get an AG and act quick on getting the evidence out or he will lose credibility. A lot of people sense that shit is going on but aren't seeing the source material. They complain about Trump and spread false info on FB and I say have you read the podesta emails written by HRC proving that Qatar and SA knowingly fund ISIS and they don't even know what I'm talking about. I don't even broach the CP.

              Yes I agree. The MSM are nothing more than propaganda. They always have been to a certain level since at least 1948 when the CIA came into the US from the SS of the NAZI party undercover in a black budget. They did not have to answer to the American people or really anyone except themselves. We have to have faith though and everyone does their part. Believe me many people on Voat and Reddit and releasing videos and other ways are American heroes on the inside that are giving clues to the citizens so we can investigate our own government and take it back. That is the essence of the Constitution. We all have to do our part. Keep the faith. They are prolonging Trumps AG  Sessions because they are paralyzed in fear, caught and they know it.

                They have probably been doing a lot of extra majick to make this all go away. This is how they have made others feel especially children at their pleasure trapped. I am sure they do not like being on the receiving end.

            The paper says that the Haitian judge lowered the trafficking charges to illegal travel because the parents willingly gave up the kids, ignoring the fact that the parents were lied to by Silsby of her intent. In a proper world, the lies would be additional charges of fraud.

             They were seriously lied to. Showed fake brochures of the lovely place in DomRep that the children would be living...everything was fake. They are not dealing with top tier intellects here..simple people who were tricked by the most vile of people/orgs into handing over their kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also people from "comfortable" societies have the luxury to become attached to their children. This is not the case in struggling societies. They have endless children who often die in early childhood and this fact of life makes them less attached so to speak. Back in the day in the US people lost children at very high rates. Pioneer cemeteries are full of child graves..one near me has 10 infants buried in one family plot alone. It was a condition of their lives just as it is in developing societies today. Having 15 kids and 3 survivals would have been normal...if you weren't able to let it go you were going to suffer to death. So it became a part of life...(more in tune with nature actually as the law of nature does not discriminate..some live some die). Thus parents in developing societies may love their children but not have the "attachment" to them as developed society parents mostly because they EXPECT their children to die. So the idea that they could save one would be very attractive.

              I can imagine that the number of kids a family has isn't even the issue. These people were traumatized by the earthquake and their homes, jobs and communities were destroyed and wanting even basic amenities for their kids seems like a reasonable motive for anyone. The whole pizzagate/CIA tactic is to destabilize and exploit, so I believe that this is just another sick instance. I'm still not unconvinced that the Rodham mining operation may not have some contributing factor to do with the earthquake, where fracking operations are cause of earthquakes in places like Oklahoma and Ohio.  Certainly the destroyed orphanage looks mighty suspicious as detonated when no other surrounding building has damage. It truly is vile. I hope they all got kuru and die a painful death. 
At the time, I knew a kid who was on the Mass Maritime Academy training ship that immediately headed toward Haiti to offer help with the earthquake recovery but they (the ship) was turned away, told not to help. I'm thinking now that this was to keep eyes off the corruption, prevent any credible witnesses

               It's the number of SURVIVING kids and the "survival expectation"..meaning parents have them but they have an onboard "OH WELL" mechanism to protect them from eternal depression because they expect to have 12 kids and 2 survive (as an example) so it seems logical that those people are way easier manipulated into handing over their kids because they feel it will increase that child's chances of survival. We keep forgetting humans are biological entities. We want to survive, and we want our offspring to survive.

               Have you seen the "the US navy cause the Haiti EQ"? story? I'm thinking that one might not be so crazy. That's a rabbit hole hard to follow at this time because the photos posted by the tourist are all gone...but one can get an idea that we can and do set them off or try to set them off...the emails commented on a NZ earthquake as being "right on cue"...hello.

                no, haven't seen the navy caused the earthquake story. Obviously underwater activity could be causing all sorts of crap with no one noticing. What does the Haiti Rodham mine produce? is it functional and profitable, are they deep drilling? 
Have NZ children disappeared after their earthquake? Italy has had earthquakes lately, are children missing? Tracking this is beyond my skills

                 I don't know about correlation. I just recall how very strange it was in the emails when they were discussing "say did you see the NZEQ" and the response was "right on cue". I'm sure you can find more in depth info on that  email, but it said what it said. Some hypothesize that if a country gets "out of line" something will happen to distract...say for instance if a KP scandal was about to hit in NZ, the EQ would take focus off that.

                <p>
                 Re Haiti...I happened to be online when it happened and "early reports" or real person comments were mentioning the Navy ship off the coast, a tourist posted photos that were basically damning as you could see some puffs of something coming from the ship just prior to the EQ. Everything, every discussion etc that happened in real time is gone. I tried to find the photos and cannot. Speculation was Navy was testing scalar weapon and "accidentally" Haiti. But that's conspiracy world...still upon reading the email I did indeed rethink my position. Who the fuck responds to a devastating earthquake as "right on cue"?

                  Another thing was that events all hit the news in when polls showed HRC numbers down or low points in the campaign. I noticed this at the time of Orlando nightclub (no further news of that either), and all the cop shootings etc. It is so obvious when you are paying attention.

                   Things happened with regularity to take our focus off what Hilldawg was doing. I about shat my pants when I saw that asshole's father on stage with Hillary. Are you fucking kidding me? Never let a good crisis go to waste. I did see that they found the missing wife...

                   I approach the CT community with...great caution. You can see the tard arguing the Rh- factor with me...fucking so far behind the science curve...shivers...however I firmly believe that there are incidents of the ridiculously sublime injected into REAL issues...like 9/11. I know what my eyes saw, I cannot unsee it or UNKNOW what it meant...but the media worked overtime for years to tell me I was nuts. And then when people started getting onto the right track...what happens? We have scads of REAL EVIDENCE that PROVES no planes hit the towers...you see what I mean? Narrative switching. Inserting stupid into real to make real seem stupid. An amazing movie that actually shows you what this looks like is called Mirage Men. If they do it to the UFO community, they DO it with anything that is truth...and might leak out. That movie is a bit of a mind fuck because it's so easy.

                    I don't think its always fair to blame people for being ignorant tards, look at the evil they are up against. If they are not actively conspiring then they are probably victims and don't even know it. I don't know where you are finding these flat earth tards. I've never met one but I don't go out much lately. Do they really think the earth is flat? what do they think they are looking at from a boat or the window of a plane? actually its funny, maybe they are just fucking with you, adding another level of CT...

                     Oh...no...I wish I could say the FEtards are just kidding, but they're not. Because this particular Voat is so rigid about what is posted here, you don't get too much FEtardness leaking...but it has...leaked, even here. Oh they're not kidding...and they have very well-thought-out presentations, productions, and, what to them is logic. One evening, just poke about on reddit for the FEtards. If one can ever tell me the answer to my question "so?" I will be happy, but it throws them. Having a "fat one" and trolling the FEtards used to be fun...but now it's just sad. I never argued with them...I just asked..so? Ok the earth is flat. Is there any reason/way this massive conspiracy changes my life in any way? LOL I'm mean...but I'll tell you this...if someone has the intellect to compile the well-presented "proof" then they have the intellect to understand they're missing the science boat.

                     Perhaps it's not "blame"...so much as OMG...shhh. Don't run for office, don't talk...shhh. In my ideal world everyone is valuable...intelligent or not. Every job is as important or valued, the trades are not denigrated, lack of college education is NOT denigrated into = stupid, and the pressure to conform and to be the same...is nonexistant. What is happening now is this deep, simmering anger/resentment because trufax... no matter how much I study, or how many trophies I get for failing, I am never going to be a rocket scientist. Ever. In fact if I built a plane you should run and never get on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But what if throughout my entire education I was told I was equal to actual rocket scientists, that I WAS a rocket scientist? I think once I got out there and realized..WTF? I'm no rocket scientist...I would be angry and bitter. WHAT? You mean getting a trophy does not=brilliant? Kids do not know how to fail, how to figure out what they're good at, and we still cannot accept that many people are just gonna be failures in life and that's OK. And we're making it OK to pick on anyone who doesn't go to college...when in fact some of our most brilliant minds in the world, ever..never darkened a college doorway or dropped out. We have black people who cannot speak or write full sentences, because rather than actually teach them and let them succeed and fail, we passed them anyway. THAT is racist.

                    <p>
                     We are all as individuals as snowflakes. (HAHAH only now being a snowflake means being fragile and a group-thinker) and there is no ONE way to educate, to draw out the best in individuals. Now, it's go to college or you're worthless. We have spent so much time pushing people who are intellectually unsuited for college INTO college as a boilerplate for success, that we've created a generation of miserable people eternally in debt.  We have people best suited to auto repair...trying to be gender studies professors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We have devalued and decimated the trades in favor of stupid shit no one really cares about...like how butterflies feel when they fly, or how caterpillars mate with same sex partners. We don't have people who know how things work anymore. College is never going to teach how things work, not in the same way as tearing things apart and rebuilding them. We are no longer a culture of inventors because there's no time to actually INVENT. The people you see on youtube making videos on magnets and power are NOT college professors, they're guys in the workshops/garages tinkering, wondering, building, tearing down...inventing. That I fear is an American lost art.

                      Don't worry so much about all that, people will follow their hearts and find their way, having faith in their intelligence is the best way to respect someone, they will learn, especially if its the hard way, school doesn't always teach the skills you expect. Its the corruption that is the problem because the more smart and successful you are, the more it will ruin your life.

                       I think we have so much anger AND corruption because of how we force the kids...how we don't teach them how to fail and try again, or to fail and try something else. JAYSUS the recent protests scared the fuck out of me because I'm seeing the results of my "work" aka textbooks...on the streets. It's discouraging. Also instead of teaching truth...tranny's have mental issues and that's OK...we lie and teach them that tranny is an option. Why can;t we teach the truth and at the same time, teach that just because someone's different or has issues is no reason to be cruel, bully, or shut out from society. It's never ok to treat people that way. I'm struggling with the "best moms" because they're doing so much damage. If it had not been for my mommy mentoring I could have lived the rest of my life happy not knowing about mommy boards where ring slings are status symbols instead of indigenous baby carriers and the slamming/flaming/competition of miserable women "besting" each other because they somehow managed to spring a baby from their loins...because THAT's never been done before. LOL

                        my theory is that the tranny issues are probably from dairy loaded with growth hormones and plastics food containers leaking endocrine disrupting chemicals and pesticides in all our food, that anyone turns out relatively normal these days is a miracle. 
 seems that nobody likes happy people to stay that way.

                         Oh you did hit the nail on the head there. I wouldn't feed my family altered food having grown up on old tyme farm food...and I never truly understood they bullying one of mind got until I saw the classmates. FUCKING HELL...I was like WTF do they eat? The onset of earlier puberties, and other issues means more phytoestrogenic compounds have entered the system. Is this the pussification of men? I don't know but I was mystified why I was in combat with doctors about the size of my creature...until I saw the classmates. There is a reason the Millennials all look like small cows...both male and female. The doctors hadn't seen a normal weight kid in so long they were flummoxed.  I actually had to fight to get a nutrition panel run (kid had PFO caused migraines but at the time they were claiming it was anorexia...despite my wee self sitting right in front of them) to prove it was not malnutrition. At least the doctor apologized.

                         I hear you on the money. I left politics/lobbying/fund development..which is why Trump made me jump for joy. But I'm happy as a clam. I'd like to do more dula or mommy mentoring, but I admittedly have little patience for the "best moms"..I'm poor as dirt and happy as a clam. A good name, reputation, integrity and ethics are priceless.

                           OH...now food...aggression.. There is a very interesting paper that got accepted for journal publication that had originally been published on the net. The theory is really good and the research was great. It's called Left in the Dark. You can probably find it on the net...I know the author scrambled to remove it once it got accepted for publication, almost unheard of for a non mainstream scientist.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           It's a good theory, makes one think about the progression of aggression...but there's a lot more meat in the book. He also doesn't enter the DNA tampering zone, or any other possible explanation...that and there's literally no real way to measure aggression in the time frame he's studying except minimally via exterior evidence. Still I thought it was a banging good read. I think that all hormones need to be aggressively avoided. And I do and did, and although having lived in a third-world country and am advocate for old tried/true vaccines, there's literally no way in hell I'd ever agree to today's modern vaccination schedule. It defies common sense. I also don't advocate for flu shots..srlsy...a new one each year? No. And...Sadly I've seen the results of "vaccinations" experiments on our troops. The mom decided on a extended vaccination timeline as he will be traveling to 3rd world countries.

                           HA doctors are the third leading cause of death in the US. I have little to no respect for the profession as it now stands. I remember when aspartame first came out...there was no way in hell I was putting that in my body...safe safe the paid doctors at the FDA tell us...and then? OOOPS sorry. LOL we are teaching that fat is bad..and heart disease increases...fat is good, good fats are best. People freak out that  make bullet proof coffee...and literally drink 2 tbs of grass fed organic butter along with MCT oil every day. (tasty! I add coconut sugar, choc. coconut milk and cacao) it's like gas in the tank. We need good fats to lube our joints, we need salt, we need boron (due to factory farming our soils are boron deficient!) basically if they say not to eat it...have some!

                           Trump was making a statement not about fat people, but about what's in DIET COKE...he's never seen a thin person drinking diet coke...well yeah, neither have I because that shit is toxic and makes you worse which makes you drink more..but it's safe. Fuck that shit. (and HFCS) if you want a soda, have Mexican Coke as long as it's made with real sugar. I was loving all the trumptards boycotting all that junk food...:D Excellent. If you've a strong stomach visit r neckbeardnests. JAYSUS I feel sorry for those guys because you've got to be so sad on the inside and lacking any hope of anything to live that way.

                               I love that bulletproof. It's my morning cuppa. But do go easy on the MCT oil, one has to work up to two table spoons. TRU story...I made my partner a bullet proof one sleepy morning and he'd not been having that regularly. And I accidentally tipped MY dose of MCT into his blender cup. I saw it but there was no way to get it out..so I blended it and he drank it. About an hour later I get this text "WTF YOU TRYING TO POISON ME? and I'm like "so, you got the shits eh?" Up the MCT about a tsp every so many days until you get to 2 tabs. Just sayin'.

                               I know...no one really needs to study the FE evidence, it's enough just to say "so?" and then let them try to explain to you, why, exactly, in the big picture, it matters if the earth is flat or round. I've never gotten a good answer.

                  Oh didn't realize from your comment that it was an email... that all sounds like a real possibility. Countries punished for not participating, same as a mafia shakedown on larger scale, also demonstration of power, to intimidate other nations into compliance. This explains why countries like morocco give back $12million directly to HRC of the $59M given in USAID. That all fits the protocol. I don't doubt it for a second.

                   It's a real email...but what it actually means...could be some evidence we can indeed trigger earthquakes, or just some random odd comment.

                  <p>
                   But you're correct, who the fuck says "right on cue"...it's either true...or mental, either way it's disturbing. This bit has slid right on by most emailtards. There may be some discussion about it somewhere on reddit and with the right duckduck terms you should find it. I'm sure the conspiracytards had a ball with that one.

             On it, thanks! I remember reading something that they lied to the children's parents as well, not to mention they didn't have permits to take them to the Dominican Republic either like they claimed.

              The judiciary was obviously compromised for letting her off so lightly. How is the wiki going? I've haven't looked at it lately, is the fake law suit threat still simmering?

               Thankfully the lawsuit crap went away with pizzagateDOTcom to my knowledge. No significant figure in the community, at least, has approached me any more on lawsuits. The Zippa auction was taken down, though, and now what they do is more-or-less out of my hands. We're all now well aware their intentions towards the community are dubious at best, and that's pretty much all I can do.
