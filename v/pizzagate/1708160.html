            With your rudeness you project even more disrespect; this time upon someone who sees things differently than you do. What you fail to appreciate, is how all this disrespect from Americans for their own President sends a message to our ever-ready enemies, always on the alert for an angle to exploit so as to defeat us, destroy our nation and our way of life. It is a deplorable weakness that is not productive of anything that might go on to be superior to what we have. It is corrosive to our entire Body Politic, turning individuals against one another and injecting a tone of dismissive disrespect into the most benign of conversations. It kind of feels like fun when you do it, I know, like Beavis &amp; Butthead "sticking it to the Man." But if I could only slip you one tiny little nano-redpill? It would be to broaden the scope of your perception so you can appreciate the nature &amp; consequences of your actions. Not just to the President of the United States, but to suchlike myself, a civil citizen who is worthy of respect by default.

            There's a big difference between a person calling President Trump "Trump" in a casual conversation and the RNC chair refusing to call him President Trump in a fundraising letter. That is a more formal communication and was sent out by what's supposed to be his party. It should obviously have referred to him as President Trump.

             Please just stop for a moment and recognize it is the THEY behind Pizzagate who orchestrate and perpetuate the hatred between parties, dividing us all and conquering from within. You are not a Republican or a Democrat. You are a person, with political views. Those views will likely shift with time, as they should. They will evolve. Like you do. You can dislike and respect someone. You can love and hate someone too. Remember it is WE the PEOPLE, not the PARTY who own this republic. Be a PERSON.

            Good. The thinking it takes to conclude the president is a mere popularity contest winner isn't all that critical. We should understand that a president who uses social media essentially to win his campaign is most likely either smart enough to fit in, or annoyingly self-absorbed enough to already have been good at it.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that being said, people should always be skeptical of political dichotomies. There truly can't be one right way and one wrong way to solve
            <em>
             anything.
            </em>
            The two party system is itself resemblant of a false dilema. A spectrum being forced on us should
            <strong>
             always
            </strong>
            come with heavy scrutiny.

            People don't communicate with secret coded body language.  For anyone wondering why people don't take pizzagate seriously, it's because of page long walls of text about which picture someone decided to stand in front of and how it's a secret message.  If people want to send a secret message, they'll send an encrypted email.

            And let's not forget most billionaires would NEVER put themselves thru what Trump has, not to mention he &amp; his loved ones are in harms way. You don't have to love the guy, but let's leave the insults out so we don't dilute the mix with polarity. I disagree with a few of his policies but let's give him a chance and see where we are headed. These pedos are gonna be the toughest to nail in a legal court, they have deep pockets and armies of lawyers, I'm hoping weiners laptop gets leaked and the pics hit the court of public opinion.

            Well whatever it means. From what ive seen so far NOTHING happens by accident in Trumps chess play. And definitely not a staged "Trump meets kids in WH" event.

            Sandusky is valuable but on a much lower level local to pennsylvania there was a district attorney who mysteriously vanished his body was never found but they found his laptop in the river with the hard drive removed or badly damaged. This DA wanted to prosecute Sandusky and I think the Governor of Pennsylvania told the DA to back off. That is a criminal conspiracy to cover up the pedo ring but I don't know if it rises to the highest levels it is probably local to Pennsylvania.

            And lion = Tribe of Judah = Js.  It could be just that.  Or merely a coincidence so of no consequence.

            Orange Monster, that made me laugh, and think of the honey monster, who is cute and would definitely also be up for vanquishing pedos. I think it's ok to not like Trump and to call him names, he is not everyone's cup of tea, and in a free society if you want to call the president an orange monster then you should go ahead and do that. Presidents, politicians, leaders etc, should never be above that kind of thing, because that's when you're in danger of idolising someone and becoming blind to their faults and failures.

            President Trump is so busy I find it unlikely that he would go to all the trouble to pose and stage a snapshot in order to send an encrypted message to one person. There are real negotiations and investigations going on and there are real messages being sent through channels. Those are the messages that matter. And Sandusky being transferred most likely means nothing; the conditions of incarceration involve a whole world in itself, separate from the crimes that put them into the custody of the DOC. And many many factors that cause a transfer are irrelevant. So it's a huge flying leap from knowing he's been moved, to attributing a significance to it.

            "transferred OUT of a maximum security prison"............Yep. There are no coinkydinks in this demonic clown pageant. The only question is whether he was transferred to make him easier to kill OR transferred as a reward for turning state's evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going with a reward because for him to be transferred for the kill there'd be an audit trail. These people don't have time for audit trails. Their world is about to fall apart around them as it is. An audit trail right now would be a giant flaming arrow of bonfires visible from space.

            Interesting to think about for sure even if it's not a Penn State shirt, the innuendo is plausible enough.  Some people obviously made the association as illustrated by this very thread topic.  The kids hand gesture may very well him being the funny guy but it's a very specific thing to come up with during a spur of the moment photo-op of this nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            The white power, pepe, 666 is associated with it because that's what's spread around the Internet to get people talking and provide yet another way to attack someones character.  The kid has been accused of throwing a 666 or a white power hand symbol.....that's absurd, for real.  We are left with a reference to everyone's favorite frog at the moment "PEPE", or "OK".  In either case, why?  Surely his teacher or parents asked why he did that.
           </p>
           <p>
            My rational side say's it's all coincidence and the kid was just being funny.  Kids and the Internet these days, am I right?  My other rational side say's "Well, that IS kinda weird, what if.....?"  Annnnnd conspiracy born.  (yeah, a guy can have two sides, lol)
           </p>
           <p>
            Some may argue the hand gesture symbolizes the Eye of Providence and the kid was tipped of ahead of time to do it.  He was sitting right in the front to make him easy to spot by the President.  Then, Trump just had to pick the kid with the Lions shirt.

            This is not a Penn State sweatshirt.
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Penn State goes by the Nittany Lions.  I go to Pitt just a couple of hours away and I've never heard anybody refer to them as the lions.   If somebody wants to shorten the name,  they simply say "State".
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Those are not Penn State's colors.   Penn State's colors are blue and white.   No gold.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) That's not Penn States logo.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are plenty of high schools and small colleges out there who have Lions as their mascot.   Here is one example:
            <br/>
            <a href="http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201703/f_trump_whtour_170307.nbcnews-ux-1080-600.jpgJPG">
             http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201703/f_trump_whtour_170307.nbcnews-ux-1080-600.jpgJPG
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can find one example of a Penn State sweatshirt being sold online referring to them as they lions,  having gold as one of their colors,  or having that as their logo I will agree with you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until then,  please stop claiming this is a Penn State sweatshirt.

            Trump won't win me over until arrest start. Until then, this is all a show to me. However...I like the idea that he might be sending esoteric signs or coded language to the same people that use that as their  calling card. Like saying "read this one while your at it", but we can't be sure.

            Or Trump could have been sending a message about Frank Giustra, billionaire founder of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp / Lionsgate Films. Giustra is a big Clinton donor, on the board of the Clinton Foundation, and partner of Bill Clinton in the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership. Giustra is discussed quite a bit over at the Pizzagate discussion at Voat, as he has his hands in many different ventures and international charities. According to researcher Nabob_bob a few months ago (here:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1445370">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1445370)
            </a>
            ), Giustra "owns Gold Wheaton Gold Corp. which between June 2002 and April 2008 was named "222 Pizza Express Corp." Interesting.

            The kids at the White House tour were from the Briarwood Christian School in Birmingham, Alabama. This is the school that was in the news in September 2016 after its football team came onto the field running through a huge banner saying, "Make America Great Again. Trump the Tigers" (their opponents). This caused a controversy in the media, which made a big deal that this was particularly offensive since the opposing team was predominantly African-American, and the school apologized.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if this school was invited to be (or be among) the first White House tour group during Trump's presidency and got a special visit from Trump because of this support. There might even be other relationships between the school and the Trump administration that got them this special visit, though I'm not aware of any. It just seems unlikely to be random given the school's notoriety during the campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Lions is the name of their school's football, basketball, and possibly other teams, so it's natural some of the kids would be wearing Lions apparel and that might be all it was. However, if the team was invited, Trump would have known the team name in advance. It does sound a bit out there. However, as we've seen, these people communicate in coded messages, memes, and images, and often go through some trouble to do so, so it's quite possible the Lions sweatshirt wasn't just random.
           </p>
           <p>
            The name of the 10-year-old boy is being reported as Jack Cornish. He flashed either the 666 sign or the a-okay sign at the end of his photo op with Trump. I'm not sure whether Trump chose him to come up or he invited all the kids to come on up and this boy was the only one who responded. I've heard it reported both ways.

             Spin is its own dimension, the mind can make anything of anything. This was clearly a staged event, not inauthentic, just calculated, so your details are key to understanding the spin of their intention. Everyone's interpretation is fascinating, however.

              Thanks, SecondAmendment. I thought the information about the school was interesting even if the Lions sweatshirt was unplanned. But the more we learn about how these people communicate with one another in code, hand gestures, postures, imagery, symbols, numbers that are meaningful to them, etc., the more notice we take of things that stand out.

            This is investigative 101. A scared opponent makes dumb moves that may expose more evidence. And a skilled investigator NEVER reveals his hand until the trap is entirely set. This isn't a game of playground tag. This is HUGE if Trump does this right.

             That's what he's saying. That it's possible they were able to convince Sandusky to work with them in taking the rest down. It's possible they got Sandusky to realize he was abandoned/scapegoated and has a chance at revenge. Although I will say I know for certain that is not the Penn State logo, so, point is moot.

              Not creepy. He's just looking at HRC portrait, supporting the evidence that the location of the president at that exact moment was not an accident. Looks like the guy really wanted to have clinton portrait in the shot

            Good insight,  for sure, but I  wish you'd spare us your gratuitous slander of President Donald J. Trump,  the only elected President since John F. Kennedy with the fortitude and integrity to fight the Satanic pedophiles around whose alleged sadistic, criminal behavior this website and half the Internet is exploding.

             Thank you. I'm getting really tired of people referring to our ONLY President as "Trump" or "Drumpf" or "Monster" or other disrespectful terms. The contest is over. We have a winner. This disrespect is corrosive to the very idea of our political system. Everybody is in such a state of anxiety about how to properly refer to a transsexual or otherkin; let's shift some of that sensitivity over to an issue that affects us ALL, because it is tied into the very stability of our way of life. It's PRESIDENT TRUMP.

              . I'm just a simple, law-abiding citizen who thinks the President deserves respect.  When President Obama was in office I was not a fan, but I spoke of him with respect simply because he was our President.   I recently received an email from RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel, even though I'm not a Republican.   In her fundraising email she kept referring to "TRUMP."   Repeatedly.   She wouldn't call him "President Trump."  So I wrote back and told Ms. Romney McDaniel that her blatant disrespect for her own party's President was so off-putting that I would donate directly to President Donald J. Trump directly, rather to her RNC.

              How is this Pizzagate-related?  Let's never forget that President Trump is the only President since JFK (flawed, though he was) to have the stones to take on the alleged pedotards running our shadow government.   President Trump, I firmly believe, will take or order lawful action to bring the perps to justice.   President Trump and his administration are our only hope, and without them millions of innocent victims will remain vulnerable.  I don't think we ever need to get political with each other here.  Gosh, since most in here are the good guys, let's support each other and the administration that may finally make a difference.

             JFK must have been doing something right, because he got shot, but it's worth remembering that it was organized crime that got him into office in the first place (voter fraud in Chicago).  He also probably had Marilyn Monroe murdered.

              She reminds me of many celebs today, when their "programming" starts to break down and things start to piece back together in the mind.  She could have exposed the CIA sex slave program and what she went through, what their techniques are (read about the house of mirrors she lived in), could have been thrown from the freedom train by her CIA handlers and not JFK.

               Exactly...and this is coming from a Trump supporter.  IMO, a good portion of the people that support Hillary are lifelong Democrats that aren't really paying attention...in fairness, the same could be said about many Republicans.  The problem with either position is that there is no such thing as Democrat or Republican anymore.

               The lines are now globalist/progressive vs. nationalist/populist....that is what the idealogues on both sides need to realize.

              Destroying the Satanists and immigration ban/wall are like the only things I agree with him on at the moment. Everything else is like... c'mon man. Still support him 100% in the fight against the Satanists until they're all in jail for life or dead though, once that is done we need him to ease up a bit on his 'Rich Guy' tendencies. Also will say about 6 months ago I never thought I would be uttering those words in my life.

               I'm really torn.  In terms of fighting the deep state and fighting controlled media the guy is a bit of a patron saint to me.  But I can't get passed the very beginning when his arguments against people were that they were short or had big hands or little hands (only his hands are the correct size of hand).  Maybe I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

               All I know is I'd prefer his side to win vs tv news entertainment, marxists, and corruption.

                Let go...use the force Luke.  The hand size thing was brought up by Rubio.  Trump only responded.  It was Marco Rubio who stated Trump had small hands with the insinuation his penis was also small.
