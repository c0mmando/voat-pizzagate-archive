<p>Defense Lawyers Claim FBI Peddled Child Porn in Dark Web Sting 
January 8, 2016 // 12:00 PM EST </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Motherboard reported that the FBI had carried out an “unprecedented” hacking campaign, in which the agency targeted at least 1,300 computers that were allegedly used to visit a site hosting child pornography. </p>
<p>While it looks like several of those already charged will plead guilty to online child pornography crimes, one defense team has made the extraordinary step of arguing to have their client\'s case thrown out completely. ***Their main argument is that the FBI, in briefly running the child pornography site from its own servers in Virginia, itself distributed an “untold” amount of illegal material. ***</p>

            George webb hypothesized that it is the CIA infiltrating the FBI through the JTTF Joint Terrorism Task Force and try to corrupt and push these types of agents. The ones they can send to gang rape girls and try to program into an assassin. Not only that but it just seems that there are a lot of pedophiles in the government period.

             Totally agree with you. But I also personally know a lot of completely corrupt police officers. I've caught a female cop blatantly lying on the witness stand. I wouldn't really trust anyone but I know that good cops are out there... somewhere. According to the Amber Alert / Alert Sense website it's mostly thanks to police officers that kidnappings are foiled when an officer spots their car.
