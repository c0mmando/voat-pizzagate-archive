<p>&quot;I would have never thought in a million years, but today while at the mall, I witnessed a kiosk vendor with abusive sexual lingo about children. I was horrified at the language I saw. After reporting to the security department, I was told he was creating 6 t-shirts for a paying a client to use at their pedophile convention to be held this week in our area. This was said to me from a Douglas county sheriff deputy. The screen I saw, passing through the mall read &quot;human rights...bluff pedophile&quot; And then &quot; PINK Prostitution&quot; The deputy alluded what that meant, but honestly I can\'t comprehend it. The kiosk had to do with video imaging, which was also alarming. The kiosk operator claimed he had no clue what he was printing. We were told concerning personal rights, the only thing the security could do would be to monitor his products and request him to not do that any more in this family setting. Legally their hands are tied. What do you think about that? The only thing I suggest, is that responsible people keep their eyes and ears open and take action when you can.
I won\'t be back at that mall too soon. Hope everyone else had a better day.&quot;</p>
