<p>Formation - <strong>The original meeting resulting in the formation was held on February 20, 1911, by Shriners in the Captain’s office of the S.S.

It was organized June 25, 1917, at an informal meeting.[1]
<strong>&quot;Whereas most Masonic bodies are dedicated to charity, The Royal Order of Jesters is a fun &quot;degree,&quot; with absolutely no serious intent. The motto, &quot;Mirth is King,”</strong> is sufficient to give voice to the purpose of the organization. The Royal Order of Jesters feel that there are times, after our hard work and dedication to family and mankind, when everyone should remember to laugh and appreciate the good work one has done.&quot;[1] <strong>The icon of the Order is the Billiken.[2]</strong>
Membership -<strong>Local &quot;courts&quot; are limited to thirteen initiates yearly and membership is by invitation only. In fact, asking to join will almost certainly result in the individual never being accepted.</strong>
Museum - <strong>The Royal Order of Jesters owns a museum in Indiana</strong> On display are items relating to the Order and some items related to <strong>William Shakespeare and other historical people who focused on humor in their works</strong>.</p>

<p>ABOUT THE BILLIKEN - CHARM DOLL CREATION, IN MOVIES &amp; SONGS, ST. LOUIS UNIVERISTY MASCOT <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiken">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiken</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Billiken is a charm doll created by an American art teacher and illustrator, Florence Pretz of Kansas City, Missouri</strong>, who is said to have seen the mysterious figure in a dream.[1] It is believed that Pretz <strong>found the name Billiken in Bliss Carman\'s 1896 poem Mr. Moon: A Song Of The Little People</strong>. In 1908, she obtained a design patent on the ornamental design of the Billiken,[2] which she sold to the Billiken Company of Chicago. The Billiken was elephant-like with pointed ears, a mischievous smile and a tuft of hair on his pointed head. His arms were short and he was generally sitting with his legs stretched out in front of him. <strong>Billiken is known as &quot;The God of Things As They Ought to Be.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The Billiken <strong>sprang from the height of the &quot;Mind-Cure&quot; craze in the United States at the start of the twentieth century.[5] It represented the &quot;no worry&quot; ideal, and was a huge hit.</strong> Variations appeared, such as the &quot;Teddy-Billiken Doll&quot; and the Billycan/Billycant pair (to drive petty problems away). The Billiken helped touch off the doll craze of the era.[5][6]
<strong>At least two Billiken-themed songs were recorded, including &quot;Billiken Rag&quot; and the &quot;Billiken Man Song.&quot;</strong> The latter was recorded by Blanche Ring.[7]
The Billiken, as a good luck charm, <strong>appears multiple times in the Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor movie Waterloo Bridge</strong>. It is employed as a device that both prompts recollections of the male lead, Robert Taylor, and that links several scenes within the movie as the plot unfolds. <strong>Wizard of Oz author L. Frank Baum kept a Billiken doll on his piano.</strong>[5]
The Billiken made its Japanese debut in 1908. A statue was installed in the uppermost level of the original Tsutenkaku Tower as it was opened to the public in 1912. When the nearby Luna Park was closed in 1925, the tower\'s Billiken statue disappeared. In 1980, a replacement statue made its appearance in a new Tsutenkaku Tower that was built in 1956.
Sports mascot[edit]
<strong>In its heyday, the Billiken enjoyed worldwide celebrity. In America he became the athletic mascot of Saint Louis University, because the figure was said to resemble coach John R. Bender. The school\'s athletic teams remain the Billikens to this day.</strong></p>

              Yes, I agree.  What do you propose then?  Perhaps we need another Reformation.  It is funny that I suggest that since I am an Atheist.

            Why would it surprise anyone that the Jesuits/Jewsuits share a diety with crypto Jew Freemasons?
           </p>
           <p>
            PAN is the original JEW.  This was clearly demonstrated in the JEWISH character Mr. Spock on Star Trek, whose "Vulcan" hand sign is the same one used by JEWISH priests to bless the congregation.  Also see his lack of empathy, etc.  -- all JEWISH traits that are highly prized by them.

             to be fair, the reason why St. Louis always comes out near the top of such rankings is because, unlike most other metropolitan areas, the City of St. Louis and the County are completely separate entities.  all of the suburbs and roughly 80% of the population of "St. Louis" reside in St. Louis County, which skews the crime statistics in a major way.  Thus comparing "St. Louis" to other mid to large cities is apples to oranges.
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said, SLU (and St. Louis) definitely needs to be looked at more closely by #pg researchers.  Perhaps we can begin by looking at St. Louis' very own Masonic branch,

            Random thought: Is it possible that J.R.R. Tolkien was a jesuit or in the Shriners/Jesters? I'm starting to think the entire Bilbo ("Billiken" Baggins) + Lord of the Rings anthology is some sort of masonic metaphor.
           </p>
           <p>
            A quick Google search reveals I'm not the first to speculate...

            He obviously used a lot of Nose mythology, but what else?

             Quite the opposite. Tolkien was a member of the Inklings, a secret society that exposed these groups through allegory. If you're familiar with Freemasonry, you know there are two towers, Jachin and Boaz. You can start there, and have your mind blown progressively as you dig deeper into something like the Silmarillion and its veiled references to true history.

             Bilbo Baggins has shown up here on pizzagate before. I don't remember the context, I think you can search it. I'm thinking it was possibly the name of a "relative of James Alefantis" on one of the background search sites.

             EDIT okay, found it, relative of Brian Podesta NCMEC

             don't confuse the idol with the Japanese toy company that produced the windup robot toys. two different things.
although it is interesting that the idol goes for so much money.

            The Black Nobility own and run the Vatican, SMOM, Jesuits, KOC, and La Cosa Nostra. The European Monarchies like the British Crown are branches of Rome and they manage secret societies like the Freemasons which infiltrate government agencies and run corporations for the monarchs. The SMOM is the top military council and it works closely with the Orders of St John ran by Protestant monarchs. The Knights of Malta are the engineers of war. The royal and noble bloodlines are all working together as a global crime syndicate and part of the modernized Roman Empire. The Greek royal House of Glucksburg run the Greek fraternities and sororities and use initiates as their agents. The British Crown controls universities like Yale and Harvard and use them for recruiting Crown agents. Jesuits are Roman intelligence and infiltrators and use their universities for recruiting and training Vatican agents. Many Knights of Columbus are police officers, mayors, lawyers, and judges and they protect the Italian Mafia. The Italian Mafia are enforcers for Rome involved in extortion, money laundering, murder, and drug trafficking; and they pay their dues back to the Sicilian Mafia which pay dues back to the Black Nobility. Court Jews like the Rothschild, Walton, Wallenberg, and Dreyfus families serve the Roman Curia and royal courtrooms like Buckingham Palace and Stockholm Palace. The Holy See is the All Seeing Eye and operates as an intelligence network. The Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum means New Order of the Ages and is on the US dollar bill and US Great Seal. The Vatican uses Latin as an official language and for documents. The Black Nobility and other royal families have been concealing trillions in private banks in Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. The Swiss Guard protects the Vatican. The Swiss Cantons have been in contract with the Vatican for centuries and Switzerland is basically a papal state. Some top families in the Black Nobility include the Pallavicini, Colonna, Ruspoli, Aldobrandini, Odescalchi, Torlonia, Gaetani, and Massimo families.
           </p>
           <p>

             The Jesuits are involved in the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandal, which is really a blackmail scandal. They also have a long history of running drugs and spying for the CIA under Operation Gladio.

              YUP, it's become painfully obvious at this point.  I'm sure there are all sorts of clever ways to infiltrate for the bold ones.

             Walter Vieth has many videos about Freemasonry, the Jesuits, and the Vatican.  The Freemasons are the Prorestant arm of the Catholic Church.  This is because Protestantism is so fractured and disorganized.

             A short understandable synopsis of the vatican coat of arms the keys to the kingdom. To me... it explains CERN. They are trying to access or do something worse with those portals using that "machine" (the movie Contact is sort of what i think CERN is but the operators of CERN have a much more sinister desire). But that is just my opinion but now the puzzle pieces are all falling into place. but like senateANON says, we gotta start with the bottom feeders to choke off the top. they have been doing this for a long time

               They are too intertwined I believe  It is nearly impossible without a combo of the FBI Elliott Ness type Op and the National Guard.  This involves an army of Mafia Connections.  Maybe we will have to play some of that D Chess.

                 Well have started  something.  My way of fighting back and work with kids at the school near my house.  All I can do right now.  But I keep in the know and up to what is going on, by being on here.  I think if people are doing that, it is maybe all some can do.  But we need to figure out how to expose them big time when we connect some dots.  Maybe someone has a plan.

              Secret societies are secret because they do not want to be exposed.  We need to expose them.

               YEP.  I believe we should get a team together and dig dig dig and post post post.   When a couple of us work on something for a day or two the digging does not go deep enough.  We need to connect the dots.  But then how do we expose them.  Expose them where and to whom?  We are only preaching to the choir on here.
