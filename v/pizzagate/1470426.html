            Ahh, yes.. I have no idea what a private company is, even though I am a co-owner of one. In my case, a LLC, where I own a rather large portion of it, with one partner, and 12 minor investors. The government has not invested. If we decide to take the company public, and get it listed on some exchange, this means anyone can invest in it, and then have a say at our board meetings, and vote on various directions we should take (if such actions are needed).
           </p>
           <p>
            You don't think the big pension funds have a say at the board meetings? They are enormous investors in these companies, and tell the companies what they can and cannot do. 75% of Microsoft is owned by large funds. Many of these are from State, Federal, and local municipalities. Some have estimated that as much as 50% of Microsoft is owned by various government institutions. If those various government funds tell Microsoft to spy on their customers, they kind of have to.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if Google was 100% owned by the government? Would that be a "private company" in your eyes?
           </p>
           <p>
            Your uninformed opinion and lack of argument can go fuck itself, as can you.

            Except that these companies are no longer private - they are public. As they are publicly traded companies, the Federal, State, and local governments invest much of our tax dollars into these companies for their pension funds. Our tax dollars also helps put in regulations that keep their competitors out of business. Should my tax dollars be used to shut me up in addition to making sure I can't compete with them?
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also note that the cozy relationship these businesses have had with the government in recent years. Members of the Council on Foreign Relations (which includes Google, Facebook, and many others) are actively directing foreign policy. This was proven in Hillary Clinton's emails. If we're not going to arrest them for sedition, and co-opting portions of the executive branch, then we have to acknowledge them as another arm of the government. Government has no right to censor my free speech.
