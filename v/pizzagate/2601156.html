            Are-we-Sure is correct, this is a civil case and the summons is the method by which you are served notice of the lawsuit and given so many days, usually 20,  by which to file your answer. Subpoenas are used to compel the appearance of witnesses or to produce records. It is not uncommon for broad sweeping legislation like the RICO law to provide for both civil or criminal remedies.

             I find it highly unlikely, considering the Judge was appointed by none other than Bill Clinton himself. I still have hope that these evil people will be held accountable, however, I don't think this case will bring about any real justice, even if the judge recuses himself. Just speculating, I'll be interested to see how this all "plays" out.

              Yeah.. this is just a civil case. My hope is that additional details will get made public, then investigators can crowbar the lid off of a few more secrets.
             </p>
             <p>
              It’s a case of throwing stuff on the wall to see what sticks. Discovery in a court case can have a powerful result in unforeseen ways, as long as it isn’t bound by a gag order or dealt with ‘in camera’. I’m no expert, mind you, my comments come from my experience with ‘Law and Order’ n stuff... Also, I’m betting that the results of a civil trial with major players line this will be sealed from the public when the dust settles.
             </p>
             <p>
              It’s SUPPOSED to be that exposed crimes get turned over to states evidence in these kind of things, but I don’t think that happens very much.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just hope something gets exposed in this process.

            Nobody's been charged with anything.  This is not a criminal case.   A guy has filed a lawsuit, a completely insane lawsuit.  I don't think he intends for the case to go through.   I bet he starts asking for donations real, real soon.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not a lawyer, but I think a summons just means, this is to notify you a lawsuit has been filed against you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then this folks will ask the lawsuit to be dismissed based on its obvious deficiencies and insanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then this guy will talk about how the cabal shut him down and he needs more money for a real lawyer to file.

              This case is no where need that stage and you are thinking of a summons in a criminal case, not a civil summons.  There are different types of summons.  You can summoned to jury duty.
             </p>
             <p>
              In a criminal case, you can be summoned in lieu of arrest to appear before a judge, but that  is not called a summons, that is usually called a subpoena.  You can ignore a summons, you can't ignore a subpoena because a subpoena is a court order.  A summons is an invitation.
             </p>
             <p>
              A civil summons is usually to notify you that someone sued you.

             <p>
              A subpoena and a summons are similar because they both give notice about a court proceeding. Differences between a subpoena and a summons include:
             </p>
             <p>
              who they are given to
when they are given
what they are used for
              <strong>
               What is a summons?
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              A summons is an official notice of a lawsuit. It is given to the person being sued. If you sue someone, they need to know about it. This way, they can come to court and fight the lawsuit. When you serve the defendant with a summons, you officially tell that you are suing them. You must follow the rules for giving the summons to the defendants to properly file your case. For helpful videos on filing court papers, see the Law Basics Video Series.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               What is a subpoena?
              </strong>
              A subpoena is a court order. You can use a subpoena to require a person to come to court, go to a deposition, or give documents or evidence to you. You must serve the subpoena on the person.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Can I ignore the subpoena or summons?
              </strong>
              You should not ignore either a subpoena or a summons. You should talk to a lawyer if you get either one.
             </p>
             <p>
              A summons is an invitation to come to court. It is not an order, so you do not have to do what it says. But, if you ignore a summons, you will likely lose the case against you. The court will usually decide the lawsuit in favor of the person suing you. The court could decide that you have to pay money or that you must stop doing something. You will have to obey the court’s final decision even though you did not take part in the lawsuit.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is one kind of summons that you cannot ignore. You cannot ignore a Citation to Discover Assets. If you lose a case and owe someone money, but do not pay it, you could get a Citation to Discover Assets. If you get a Citation to Discover Assets, you should talk to a lawyer right away. You should not ignore the Citation or fail to appear on the court date. If you do, you could face penalties.
             </p>
             <p>
              You cannot ignore a subpoena. A subpoena is a court order to come to court. If you ignore the order, the court will hold you in contempt. You could go to jail or face a large fine for ignoring the subpoena. Subpoenas are used in both criminal and civil cases. They can be given to anyone that might have helpful information about the case. This can be testimony or documents and evidence. If you get a subpoena and do not want to testify or turn over documents, do not just ignore it. Ask a lawyer to help you figure out what to do.
