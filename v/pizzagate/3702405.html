<blockquote>
<p>We describe a stochastic virus evolution model representing genomic diversification and within-host selection during experimental serial passages under cell culture or live-host conditions. ..For parameter values representative of RNA viruses, the likelihood of observing adaptations during passages became negligible as the required number of mutations rose above two amino acid sites. We modeled the specific adaptation process of influenza A H5N1 viruses in mammalian hosts by simulating the evolutionary dynamics of H5 strains under the fitness landscape inferred from multiple sequence alignments of H3 proteins.  </p>

<p>I\'ve tried to explain (very badly here) the ties between the mathematical modelling Epstein was involved with at Harvard, the modelling of the financial markets as well as virus simulations, backed by people like George Soros and Bill Gates. More work to be done..</p>',

             I've tried to briefly explain (very badly here) the ties &gt;between the mathematical modelling Epstein was &gt;involved with at Harvard, the modelling of the financial &gt;markets as well as virus simulations, backed by people &gt;like George Soros and Bill Gates. More work to be done..

            They've shut down all schools in the Seattle area, now, "sending home" 600,000 children. Gatherings of over 250 people have been outlawed. Adults are being told to work from home if possible, but many parents who still need to go to work are scrambling for someone to watch their kids.

             Societies today face daunting challenges: population growth, rapid urbanization, ecological and environmental disturbances, and an unpredictable global marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>
             To address these complex and interrelated problems, a new brand of science is needed, led by an emerging generation of scientists steeped in the study of interconnected systems and comfortable in the methods of many fields — from math, physics, and biology to the social sciences and the humanities. The Omidyar Fellowship at the Santa Fe Institute offers a select group of early-career scholars the opportunity to join a collaborative research community that nurtures creative, transdisciplinary thought in pursuit of key insights about the complex systems that matter most for science and society.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Omidyar Fellowship program started in 2009 and is supported by Pierre and Pam Omidyar.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Moderna was founded in 2010 and the name was originally written "ModeRNA".[3] It was based on basic science work by Derrick Rossi at Harvard, whose lab developed a method for modifying mRNA, transfecting into human cells, and dedifferentiating them into stem cells, and then causing them to differentiate into desired cell types.[4] Rossi approached fellow Harvard faculty member Tim Springer who had started a company before, about starting a company and Kenneth R. Chien; they brought in Bob Langer and then all of them met with Noubar Afeyan, the CEO of Flagship Ventures.[4][5] After some further validating experiments, the company was founded.[4] Stéphane Bancel, left his job as CEO of bioMérieux to become CEO in 2011.[4] It operated in stealth mode until December 2012, with a vague website and all employees working under strict confidentiality agreements;[5][6] People thought Moderna was a stem cell company until it emerged from stealth mode in 2012, by which time it had raised $40 million from Flagship Ventures' VentureLabs unit and other private investors.[2][4]
            </p>
            <p>
             In March 2013, Moderna and AstraZeneca signed a five-year exclusive option agreement to discover, develop and commercialize mRNA therapeutics for the treatment of serious cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases as well as selected targets in oncology.[7][8] The agreement included a $240 million upfront payment to Moderna, a payment that is "one of the largest ever initial payments in a pharmaceutical industry licensing deal that does not involve a drug already being tested in clinical trials."[7]
            </p>
            <p>
             In October 2013, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded Moderna a grant worth up to $24.6 million to research and develop its mRNA drug technology to fight infectious diseases and biological weapons."

             Hotspot Shield is a public virtual private network (VPN) service, was formed and until 2019 operated by AnchorFree, Inc.[4][5] and is today operated by Pango. By establishing an encrypted connection with the Hotspot Shield servers, the service protects its users' Internet traffic from eavesdropping.[4]
             <strong>
              Hotspot Shield was used to bypass government censorship during the Arab Spring protests in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya.

             Hotspot Shield is developed and operated by Pango (former AnchorFree Inc.), a company in Silicon Valley with offices in the Ukraine and Russia.[4][8] The first Hotspot Shield client app was released in April 2008 for Windows and macOS operating systems. It was expanded to include support for iOS and Android in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..In February 2018, a security researcher discovered an information disclosure bug in the app that results in a leak of user data, such as in which country the user is located, and the user's Wi-Fi network name, if connected.

             In an interview in our New York newsroom, David  Gorodynasky said that the company doesn't make money off its customers' data, instead opting for a "zero knowledge" approach to ensure that governments cannot request data on its customers that it doesn't store.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that isn't the case, says the CDT in its filing. It's accusing the company of logging connections and using third-party tracking to serve targeted advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Hotspot Shield engages in logging practices around user connection data, beyond troubleshooting technical issues" by using a user's location and IP addresses to "improve the service, or optimize advertisements displayed through the service," the filing says.

             While attending a local Palo Alto school, Gorodyansky met Eugene Malobrodsky.[11] Malobrodksy had a similar background and the two became close friends.[12] The two would later found multiple companies together.

             Gorodyansky is an investor in GlobeIn, an online exotic arts and crafts marketplace, and job matching site Venturerocket. He has also invested in Modern Meadow, a company that aims to grow leather and meat from primary cells.[23] In 2013, Gorodyansky served as investor and executive producer of #chicagoGirl, a documentary that follows a Syria-born college student that coordinated a social media campaign to help protesters during the Syrian Civil War.

             INET was founded with an initial pledge of $50 million from George Soros. It has since been supplemented by donations from James Balsillie and William H. Janeway, together with other philanthropists and financiers, including Paul Volcker, David Rockefeller, the Malcolm Hewitt Wiener Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and Stiftung Mercator. Later funding has come from the Keynes Fund for Applied Economics and the Isaac Newton Trust at the University of Cambridge.

             <p>
              Lord Turner – the man who wanted to be the next Governor of the Bank of England – is to work alongside George Soros, the man who famously broke the Bank two decades ago.
             </p>

              Lord Turner, the outgoing chairman of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), is to join a New York-based think tank founded by Mr Soros.

             <p>
              The regulator, who stands down from his role at midnight tonight when the FSA is split into the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, is to join the board of the Institute for New Economic Thinking. The body was established by Mr Soros – who made a profit of £1bn betting against sterling in 1992 – in 2009 with an initial endowment of $50m (£33m).

            <p>
             The synthetic path to investigating the world is the logical space occupied by Gell-Mann, the biologist Stuart Kauffman, the computer scientist Christopher G. Langton, and the physicist J. Doyne Farmer, and their colleagues in and around Los Alamos and the Santa Fe Institute.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Santa Fe Institute was founded in 1984 by a group that included Gell-Mann, then at the California Institute of Technology, and the Los Alamos chemist George Cowan. Some say it came into being as a haven for bored physicists. Indeed, the end of the reductionist program in physics may well be an epistemological demise, in which the ultimate question is neither asked nor answered but instead the terms of the inquiry are transformed. This is what is happening in Santa Fe.

             If you google “The Third Way” you will come across two names already mentioned in this blog. One of them should be well known to doctors since
             <strong>
              he is currently the Chief Executive and Registrar of the General Medical Council.

             ..Tony Blair’s “Third Way” may well not have materialised without the other Tony. You see, Anthony Giddens has been hailed as “Tony Blair’s favourite intellectual” or “Tony Blair’s guru.”
            </p>
            <p>
             My Black Cat immediately spotted an intertwinglement in the preface of this book which we have both read. It appears that during the gestation of this publication, Anthony Giddens had several informal meetings with Goeff Mulgan and Ian Hargreaves. Intitally they were going to be co-authors but this didn’t materialise however Gibbens acknowledges that he has drawn much information from them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Goeff Mulgan was of course a co-founder of Demos along with Julia Middleton, founder of Common Purpose, and Martin Jacques, editor of “Marxism Today” from 1977 to 1991. These, of course, were the Strong Intertwinglements that excited my Black Cat so much that she tangled herself into knots.

             ..So, Anthony Giddons, the other Tony, intertwingles not only with two of  “The Triplets” i.e Demos and Common Purpose, and in addition seems to have had considerable influence on the policies of Tony Blair. He is also strongly intertwingled with the London School of Economics. From 1997 to 2003 he was Director of the LSE.

             ..There is now The Third Sector, and The Third Way. My Black Cat is sure  they are both closely intertwingled into The Big Society. There is also The Third Culture. You can read about what Anthony Giddens is saying on The Third Culture website. You can listen too him too.
