            This is absolutely beyond outrageous. This destroys the myth that trafficked kids only come from poor countries like the Philippines or India.

            What can we do about this?  How can we stop CPS from being the go between for the pimping of our children?  That is what they are doing.  Handing out kids like Free Lollipops to Pedos and turning them into Cash Cow Kids.  There must be a Bill or Something that can be enacted to quit the Foster Program at least temporarily until this Pipeline of Kids is Cut Off.  This Program Has Run Amok.

              This is the problem.  They have set things up to almost make it so bad that there is no solution.  I am sure there are people way smarter than us that could fix it, but they are not the ones in power nor with the money to back them up.  I believe there is plenty of money in the coffers to take care of it all, they just spend it on their own whims.  Taking care of their friends and investments.  It makes you want to hurl to think about how they treat our children.

             A Medina County man accused of sexually assaulting five former foster children, including several in Bexar County, took in more than 180 young girls over a five year period, officials said.
            </p>

             That leads investigators to believe there could be numerous other victims who have yet to come forward.

             "It's not a question about whether there are more," said Medina County Sheriff Randy Brown. "It's just about how many."

              Former foster daughters react to arrest of S.A.-area man accused of sexually assaulting 5 girls
             </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
             One additional victim has already come forward since news broke Wednesday of 58-year-old Miguel Briseno's arrest, Brown said, bringing the unofficial total to six victims. A charge has not been filed in the sixth alleged case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Briseno, who is currently being held in the Medina County Jail on a $500,000 bond, was a licensed foster parent from 2005 through 2010, Brown said. During that time he lived in both Bexar and Medina counties.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over the course of the five years, more than 180 girls passed through his care, Brown said. At various times, Briseno was reportedly taking care of up to 12 girls at once.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brown said Child Protective Services contracted with a third-party company, who has not yet been publicly identified, to place the girls in Briseno's home.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Those girls were taken from some environment and then you have some jackass like him abusing these girls that already have troubles," Brown said. "I'm aggravated at the whole system. I'm aggravated at the company that placed these girls. It was a money-making deal, the way they were running those girls through there like livestock. It wasn't about making a better world for them. They were making a profit off them."

             Defenders of the 58-year-old man arrested on five charges of child sex assault are adamant he was a loving father figure who took pains to avoid even the appearance of impropriety while his alleged victims say he led a double life and abused for years several of the more than 180 children he was assigned to care for as a foster parent in Bexar and Medina counties.
            </p>
            <p>
             A representative of the agency that placed children in his care say Miguel Briseno was lauded by foster children and won awards. Law enforcement officials said that as they closed in on filing charges, Briseno threatened victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             The two stories being told about Briseno reflect the disagreement among the women who passed through his home - and the surprise expressed by many in the community who interacted with him.

               The sheer number of girls sounds like it IS in fact something bigger. I cannot believe that he is himself an illegal and had access to these girls. I used to say "i cannot believe this" pre PG now nothing shocks me anymore.

               So to try and help clear up the middleman stuff: some states/jurisdictions use state/public agencies to perform the CPS functions but will contract with private or non profit agencies to handle the foster care placements of the children that CPS removes. Some states handle all of that themselves, while some states like CA use outside agencies to manage the foster homes and placements. I'm not sure what Texas does, but it could be this type of situation.

                I know in the bigger cities, the caseworkers are so overwhelmed with cases, they can't properly handle them
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe this could be a reason too

                He lost the license, then was going to put license in wife's name?

               Not just how does an illegal immigrant get foster kids, but why would a tax funded government service be allowed to let third parties contract what they are supposed to do? I have a feeling this can of worms is going to be opened and the many good people of Texas are going to be extremely angry.

             <p>
              When it comes to the children, you will find it's not just White children
             </p>
             <p>
              Pedophiles have there preferences
             </p>
             <p>
              Sex, age, ethnicity , if you think about it
             </p>
             <p>
              Even the way a kid looks and speaks
             </p>
             <p>
              I think if you look at the stats of the children in foster care, the majority isn't going to be white kids
             </p>
             <p>
              And frankly, does it really matter the color of these children's skin?
             </p>
             <p>
              If it does, you shouldn't be here
             </p>
             <p>
              You will find brown and black skin are missing in major numbers
             </p>
             <p>
              As for your last thought, that was something that gave me pause
             </p>
             <p>
              Wonder just what went on there
             </p>
             <p>
              Wonder also just how many of those kids are still alive

               I know my single experience isnt the majority but I was in a level 14 lock down facility and most of the kids were white with mexican being 2nd and black being last.

                I only did a weekend stint in Juvie back in the 70's.

                They called it " uncontrollable" back then
               </p>
               <p>
                I suppose the numbers would depend on where you are at
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember looking into what I call Social Services months ago
               </p>
               <p>
                It comes up a lot in here, maybe my numbers were from the city I was looking up
