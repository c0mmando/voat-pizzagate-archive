<p><strong>He apparently is friends with Prince Phillip, husband of the Queen, and Raila Odinga, Prime Minister of Kenya from 2008-13</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deya claims he was influenced by American televangelist Morris Cerullo, whose dressing he liked. He rose to be an influential preacher. Deya claimed friendship with various politicians and famous people, including Daniel Moi, Kalonzo Musyoka, <strong>Raila Odinga</strong>, Reuben Ndolo, Kijana Wamalwa, <strong>Prince Phillip</strong>, King Mswati and Mwai Kibaki. </p>

<p>Kenyan Prime Minister Odinga has close ties to Obama </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who is Raila Odinga?</p>
<p>If the name is not familiar to you, Raila Odinga was the opposition leader who lost the election for Kenya\'s presidency in 2007 to Mwai Kibaki by some 230,000 votes. 
Odinga ran as the candidate of &quot;Change.&quot; Sound familiar? That should send a chill down your spine, especially when you see the kind of &quot;change&quot; he had in mind .</p>
<p><strong>Is the connection between Obama and Odinga a cause for concern among American voters? It certainly appears to be.
Obama made campaign appearances with Odinga and raised nearly a million dollars for Odinga\'s bid to be president of Kenya</strong></p>
<p><strong>Raila Odinga is from the Luo tribe, as was Barack Obama\'s father. He claims that Obama Sr. was his maternal uncle, making him a cousin of President Barack Obama.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And connections to Hillary Clinton,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton, the former US Secretary of State who is embroiled in a scandal over her email account, received an email including an article about Raila Odinga, the CORD party leader.The email in question dates back to 2009. Odinga was then serving as Prime Minister of Kenya. The email was sent from the Eleisson, a consulting firm within the US Democratic party to Clinton. The email highlights an article about Clinton in Africa with talking points about Clinton\'s trip.

<p><strong>There is also strong indication that his ministry/church is involved in devil worship</strong></p>
<p>His church was regarded as a satanic cult in the UK.
