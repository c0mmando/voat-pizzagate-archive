<p>In 1979, with help from the Dia Art Foundation, Judd purchased a 340 acre (1.4 km²) tract of desert land near Marfa,[13] which included the abandoned buildings of the former U.S. Army Fort D. A. Russell.</p>

A book, Donald Judd Spaces, offering a glimpse into his living and working spaces (ranging from the 1870 classic cast-iron SoHo building he bought in 1968 to a 40,000-acre ranch bordering the Rio Grande), will be published in a few days. .. The Marfa Municipal Airport recently lengthened a runway to accommodate private jets...“We turned up the volume on Marfa, but it wasn’t immediate,” admitted Fairfax Dorn, who, with Virginia Lebermann, founded Ballroom Marfa in 2003.</p>

<p>Alefantis also mentions Donald Judd in a Kill Room Instagram photo but I can\'t find it. (But there\'s a Voat post about it below.)</p>
<p>Donald Judd\'s daughter is a featured artist at Standard Hotel in West Hollywood.</p>

<p>Apparently Marina Abramovic runs with the set. .. A colony of artists on an old military site, aye? Time to go tunnel hunting again..</p>
<p>Marfa Ballroom is run by Fairfax Dorn and husband Marc Glimcher of Pace Gallery</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Glimcher">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Glimcher</a></p>
<p>Marc Glimcher (born September 16, 1963) is an American art dealer who is the President and CEO of Pace Gallery, a modern and contemporary art gallery founded by his father, Arne Glimcher, in Boston in 1960. He is regularly cited among the top 25 most powerful people in the international art world, according to the annual &quot;Power 100&quot; list published by ArtReview.[1] In 2012, Glimcher made international headlines for selling a Gerhard Richter painting for more than $20 million at Art Basel in Basel, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Glimcher was born in New York City the second son (his brother is neuroeconomist and neuroscientist Paul W. Glimcher) to Mildred “Milly” and Arnold “Arne” Glimcher, an art historian and art dealer respectively, who together founded Pace Gallery in Boston in 1960. He graduated from Harvard University in 1985 with a degree in biological anthropology, and from 1989 to 1991 studied biochemistry and immunology at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Glimcher">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Glimcher</a></p>
<p>Paul W. Glimcher (born November 3, 1961) is an American neuroeconomist, neuroscientist, psychologist, economist, scholar, and entrepreneur. He is one of the foremost researchers focused on the study of human behavior and decision-making, and is known for his central role in founding and developing the field of neuroeconomics which takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding how humans make decisions. Glimcher also founded the Institute for the Study of Decision Making at New York University, which he currently directs.</p>
<p>Glimcher holds the Julius Silver, Rosyln S. Silver and Enid Silver Winslow Chair of Neural Science at New York University (NYU) in the School of Arts and Sciences where he also holds professorial appointments in Economics and Psychology, and in Neuroscience and Physiology in NYU\'s School of Medicine. He is also the founder of the HUMAN Project, a large-scale interdisciplinary longitudinal study, and Datacubed Health, a start-up company focused on developing and marketing new Software-as-a-Service (PaaS) technologies in the healthcare industry and biomedical/behavioral research domain.</p>
<p>The HUMAN Project</p>
<p>After starting up the Institute for the Study of Decision Making in 2014, Glimcher––working with Miyoung Chun of The Kavli Foundation––also began the development of a new interdisciplinary longitudinal study sponsored by The Kavli Foundation, called the Kavli HUMAN Project. One of his signature achievements, the Kavli HUMAN Project is a “big human data” research platform that took its inspiration from big data surveys in other disciplines, in particular the astronomy community\'s Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3452848">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3452848</a> Relevant post regarding the Kavli Foundation. </p>
<p>Of course George Church is one of the Epstein related scientists.</p>
<p>George Church + IARPA + Edge <a href="https://www.edge.org/memberbio/george_church">https://www.edge.org/memberbio/george_church</a></p>
<p>He has also pioneered new privacy, biosafety, ELSI, environmental and biosecurity policies. He is director of an IARPA BRAIN Project and NIH Center for Excellence in Genomic Science.</p>
<p>Optogenetics is of interest because of their brain experiments which can be seen to potentially be leading to modern forms of mind control. And as Epstein is involved...</p>',

          <p>
           Marc Glimcher (born September 16, 1963) is an American art dealer who is the President and CEO of Pace Gallery, a modern and contemporary art gallery founded by his father, Arne Glimcher, in Boston in 1960. He is regularly cited among the top 25 most powerful people in the international art world, according to the annual "Power 100" list published by ArtReview.[1] In 2012, Glimcher made international headlines for selling a Gerhard Richter painting for more than $20 million at Art Basel in Basel, Switzerland.
          </p>
          <p>
           Glimcher was born in New York City the second son (his brother is neuroeconomist and neuroscientist Paul W. Glimcher) to Mildred “Milly” and Arnold “Arne” Glimcher, an art historian and art dealer respectively, who together founded Pace Gallery in Boston in 1960. He graduated from Harvard University in 1985 with a degree in biological anthropology, and from 1989 to 1991 studied biochemistry and immunology at Johns Hopkins University.

           Paul W. Glimcher (born November 3, 1961) is an American neuroeconomist, neuroscientist, psychologist, economist, scholar, and entrepreneur. He is one of the foremost researchers focused on the study of human behavior and decision-making, and is known for his central role in founding and developing the field of neuroeconomics which takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding how humans make decisions. Glimcher also founded the Institute for the Study of Decision Making at New York University, which he currently directs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Glimcher holds the Julius Silver, Rosyln S. Silver and Enid Silver Winslow Chair of Neural Science at New York University (NYU) in the School of Arts and Sciences where he also holds professorial appointments in Economics and Psychology, and in Neuroscience and Physiology in NYU's School of Medicine. He is also the founder of the HUMAN Project, a large-scale interdisciplinary longitudinal study, and Datacubed Health, a start-up company focused on developing and marketing new Software-as-a-Service (PaaS) technologies in the healthcare industry and biomedical/behavioral research domain.

          <p>
           After starting up the Institute for the Study of Decision Making in 2014, Glimcher––working with Miyoung Chun of The Kavli Foundation––also began the development of a new interdisciplinary longitudinal study sponsored by The Kavli Foundation, called the Kavli HUMAN Project. One of his signature achievements, the Kavli HUMAN Project is a “big human data” research platform that took its inspiration from big data surveys in other disciplines, in particular the astronomy community's Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

            Check this out a Scottish PRIVATE ISLAND (Isle of Eigg pop;100) is being set up to be " Something like the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas "

           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Marfa is situated in the high desert of far West Texas in Presidio County, located between the Davis Mountains and Big Bend National Park, with a population of  about 2000 – twenty times the population of The Isle of Eigg I know, but I think there is a model here to look at.

             Donald Judd
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1971,minimalist artist Donald Judd moved to Marfa from New York City. After renting summer houses for a couple of years, he bought two large hangars and some smaller buildings and began to permanently install his art.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1976, he bought the first of two ranches that would become his primary places of residence, continuing a long love affair with the desert landscape surrounding Marfa. Later, with assistance from the Dia Art Foundation in New York, Judd acquired decommissioned Fort D.A. Russell, and began transforming the fort’s buildings into art spaces in 1979. Judd’s vision was to house large collections of individual artists’ work on permanent display, as a sort of anti-museum. Judd believed the prevailing model of a museum, where art is shown for short periods of time, does not allow the viewer an understanding of the artist or their work as they intended.
            </p>
            <p>
             Donald Judd Marfa Texas
            </p>
            <p>
             Since Judd’s death in 1994, two foundations have worked to maintain his legacy: the Chinati Foundation and Judd Foundation. Every year the Chinati Foundation holds an open house event where artists, collectors, and enthusiasts come from around the world to visit Marfa’s art. Since 1997, Open House has been co-sponsored by both foundations and attracts visitors from around the world. The Chinati Foundation now occupies more than 10 buildings at the site and has on permanent exhibit work by artists such as Ingólfur Arnarson, Dan Flavin, and Claes Oldenburg.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course what works in Marfa won’t necessarily work on Eigg, but there is something to be explored about the relationship with individual artists and remote communities. I have absolutely no doubt that Eigg Box will be an extraordinary place to visit and I hope to be there myself one day soon. We, who are engaged in the debate about the role of arts in the community should look at the Isle of Eigg with great interest. I think we will all learn a lot from the way they are creating space for people and art.

             At the center of the Chinati Foundation’s permanent collection are 100 untitled works in mill aluminum by Donald Judd installed in two former artillery sheds. The size and scale of the buildings determined the nature of the installation, and Judd adapted the buildings specifically for this purpose. He replaced derelict garage doors with long walls of continuous squared and quartered windows which flood the spaces with light. Judd also added a vaulted roof in galvanized iron on top of the original flat roof, thus doubling the buildings’ height. The semi-circular ends of the roof vaults were to be made of glass.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each of the 100 works has the same outer dimensions (41 x 51 x 72 inches),

            So what is the connection between art and science for the military?
           </p>
           <p>
            Art is used to foreshadow events (think of the 'what you think, you will become' movement, the law of attraction, etc – eg
            <a href="https://youtu.be/UygnXqoKrC4">

            )
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also used to influence culture and perhaps to continue feeding energy to events unseen... think tunnels.

            Frank Malina became a kinetic artist after being a scientist and this art movement had very specific connections to the technocrats of the scientific community of the mititary-industrial complex

             Xaviera Hollander (born 15 June 1943) is a Dutch former call girl, madam, and author. She is best known for her best-selling memoir The Happy Hooker: My Own Story …
            </p>
            <p>
             Hollander was born Xaviera "Vera" de Vries in Surabaya, Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies, which later became part of present-day Indonesia, to a Dutch Jewish physician father and a mother of French and German descent.[1] She spent the first years of her life in a Japanese-run internment camp.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1968 she resigned from her job as secretary of the Dutch consulate in Manhattan to become a call girl,[1] making $1,000 a night ($7400 today). A year later she opened her own brothel, the Vertical Whorehouse, and soon became New York City's leading madam. In 1971, she was arrested for prostitution by New York Police and forced to leave the United States
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1971, Hollander published a memoir, The Happy Hooker: My Own Story. Robin Moore, who took Hollander's dictations of the book's contents, came up with the title, while Yvonne Dunleavy either transcribed the book[3] or ghostwrote it.[6] Hollander later wrote a number of other books and produced plays in Amsterdam. Her book Child No More is the story of losing her mother. For 35 years she wrote an advice column for Penthouse magazine entitled Call Me Madam

              Robert Lowell Moore Jr. (October 31, 1925 – February 21, 2008) was an American writer who wrote The Green Berets, The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy and, with Xaviera Hollander and Yvonne Dunleavy, The Happy Hooker: My Own Story.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moore also co-authored the lyrics for the "Ballad of the Green Berets", which was one of the major hit songs of 1966. The song was also featured in the 1968 film The Green Berets, based on Moore's book which starred John Wayne. A new edition of The Green Berets was published in April 2007 and his last book, Wars of the Green Berets, co-authored with Col. Mike 'Doc' Lennon, was released in June 2007.

             </h1>
             <p>
              Thanks to connections with Harvard classmate Robert F. Kennedy, Moore was allowed access to the U.S. Army Special Forces to write about this elite unit of the United States Army. It was General William P. Yarborough who insisted that Moore go through special forces training in order to better understand "what makes Special Forces soldiers 'special'." He trained for nearly a year, first at "jump school" for airborne training before completing the Special Forces Qualification Course or "Q Course", becoming the first civilian to participate in such an intensive program. Afterwards, Moore was assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group on deployment to Vietnam. His experiences in-country formed the basis for The Green Berets, a bestseller that helped secure him international acclaim (see United States Army Special Forces in popular culture).

             <p>
              Katarina Hudson has fifteen years of experience in virtually every facet of the Creative Fields; Art, Advertising, Marketing, PR and Promotion with extensive knowledge of the Fashion and Film industries. She has been involved in a number of major organisations as a trouble-shooter and market analyst in order to establish suitable frameworks for innovative, lifestyle-lead market and product/profile development...
             </p>
             <p>
              Following her degree in Economics and Business studies and postgraduate diploma in Fashion, Graphics and Design, W Ortmayer (one of the most renowned pioneers of advertising) adopted Katarina as his protege.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Confident and popular, Katarina found herself in demand from leading event organisers for VIP receptions for major international events like golf, tennis and concerts, press conferences, promotions and campaigns, and
              <strong>
               looked after prestigious brands/profiles (Bruce Springstein, Ute Lemper, Prince, Billecart Salmon Champagne, etc.)
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              A passion for fashion led Katarina to move into that industry, starting with product and account management (Harrods, M&amp;S, HoF) leading to become marketing director of various companies (Steilmann Group, Pamplemousse, Red or Dead, etc.). ..
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsequently in the last few years Katarina has worked as a profile/brand consultant across different fields from private clubs to
              <strong>
               raising the profile of polo as a sport (Hurlingham Polo Association, Royal Festival Hall, Krug, Lifetime Records, Jadran Film Studio, Winchester Films, etc.).
              </strong>
              However her main activities still are amongst the creative industries, especially film. She was even asked to write a column on trends in the movies for WRAP (film trade magazine, now Brtish Cinematographer) establishing a different kind of critical criteria on the movies released.

            Centerpiece of the weekend was the other-worldly dinner piloted by Jens Hoffmann, director of the Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco and co-curator of the 2011 Istanbul Biennial. The evening began at dusk with a performance choreographed by LA-based artist Kathryn Andrews in conjunction with composer Scott Benzel in which a handful of nude performers romped through an open field summoning alien beings from distant planets. Then it was on to dinner...

            'Real' UFO Connection to Marfa:
           </p>
           <p>
            Marfa Lights and Related UFO Phenomena Explained
           </p>
           <p>
            UFOs have been observed throughout human history in all areas of the world from time to time, but there is one area where they are seen on a nightly basis. This is the area of Chihuahua Desert east of Marfa, located in extreme west Texas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Called The Marfa Lights, they are appear shortly after sunset and have become such an expected event that a viewing site equipped with telescopes and information about the lights was built east of town.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Marfa Lights or Ghost Lights as some call them, appear as luminous balls of light which have all the characteristics of UFOs seen in other parts of the world. They suddenly appear out of nowhere to the viewer and some will move along the ground at high speeds. Some perform fantastic aerial feats as most UFOs do while still others, seem to hover on the ground stationary. Similar to UFOs seen elsewhere, the MLs can suddenly disappear and reappear before the eyes of the observer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The MLs have been seen in this area since the middle 1800s, when settlers reported seeing them there on their way west.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been many investigations into the phenomenon by both scientists and the curious but so far nothing conclusive has been discovered. The only thing anybody really knows about them is that they exist. As to what they are, where they come from or what causes them to appear remains a mystery. This is exactly the same conclusion made with all other UFO sightings in the world. They are viewed, photographed, and analyzed yet nothing more than the sightings themselves is proven.
           </p>
           <p>
            There may be a connection to be considered with the MLs and other sightings of orbs of light or plasma balls. MLs are seen in this area of desert, which is very close to a climate transition line. Marfa is located in an arid climate and not too far away there is a semi-arid climate in Pecos.

            More stuff regarding Mariana Abramovic.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Count On Us (Tesla) Marina Abramovic holds what looks like an office-grade fluorescent light-stick to a sci-f Tesla coil, an image that is part Planetarium laser light show and part 1930’s Frankenstein. In a work pregnant with political imagery, Count On Us (Tesla) is suddenly giving us something else—science and technology, displayed as art, the former almost 'charging up' the latter. Nicola Tesla, 'Master of Lightning,' the man who put the AC in the DC, was a Serbian engineer who moved to New York at the age of 28, where he died, penniless and alone, in 1943. Lauded for the alternating current and the 'Tesla coil', a transformer for receiving and generating radio waves that would be used in radio and television communications, Tesla was one of those fabled visionaries who produces both world-changing inventions and a whole lot of crazy crap. He was obsessed with the idea that electricity could be transmitted wirelessly and looked forward to a world system created and connected by wireless technology. He described a means of tapping the sun's energy with an antenna, thought that the weather could be controlled with electrical energy, and gave Mark Twain spontaneous diarrhea with his ‘healing machine’. He had to prove to Edison that alternating currents were safe, only to be accused later of having contributing to the invention of the electric chair, for which he has achieved a near-cult status. Tesla had strongly pacifst views and sought throughout his life to develop a technological means of making war impossible. In the 1930s he was working on a charged-particle ray The New York Times referred to as a Death Beam, which would be so powerful as to “bring down a feet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 250 miles. Should every country have one of these ‘peace beams’, war would prove impossible. Despite some funding from the USSR, Tesla’s peace beam idea never came to pass, though his dream of wireless technologies is becoming more real all the time.«War cannot be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removed and this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the planet on which we live. Only through annihilation of distance in every respect, as the conveyance of intelligence, transport of passengers and supplies and transmission of energy will conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of friendly relations. What we now want is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth. Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment.» ~ Nicholas Tesla.
           </p>
           <p>
            Add a little dose of ‘transgression through pain’ and it’s easy to see why Marina Abramovic is interested in Tesla. Abramovic, like Tesla, not only wants to change the world but seeks to do so through transcending the political altogether. She has often claimed in interviews that she feels herself to be a bridge between the East and the West. Tesla, however, is not talking about bridges; he’s talking about eliminating that distance between people and nations completely, ‘annihilating’ it and the objects which maintain it. Still, Abramovic has her own version of the complete annihilation of distance. ~ Stefany Anne Goldberg.

            George Church is professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and director of PersonalGenomes.org , providing the world’s only open-access information on human Genomic, Environmental, and Trait data (GET). His 1984 Harvard Ph.D. included the first methods for direct genome sequencing, molecular multiplexing, and barcoding. These lead to the first commercial genome sequence (pathogen, Helicobacter pylori) in 1994. His innovations in “next generation” genome sequencing and synthesis, and cell/tissue engineering resulted in 12 companies spanning fields including medical genomics (Knome, Alacris, AbVitro, GoodStart, Pathogenica) and synthetic biology (LS9, Joule, Gen9, Warp Drive) as well as new privacy, biosafety, and biosecurity policies. He is director of the NIH Center for Excellence in Genomic Science. His honors include election to NAS and NAE, and Franklin Bower laureate for achievement in science.
