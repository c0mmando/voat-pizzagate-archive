            This is a great idea, herbvendor. I am very active on Twitter and am constantly spreading stuff about Pizzagate, but I'm sure it gets shadowbanned as often as not. I tend to drop juicy items into the reply area of tweets with people who have a lot of followers where others will stumble across it. That seems to get fairly good traction from time to time.

             Yes thats what I did too. My point with steem is our community can promote and keep our content from getting shoa'd, maybe make a few $.

            The term pizzagate needs to be abandoned in favor of something more trendy. Right now, if people know about it, they just associate PG with that crazy fake shooter at comet ping pong.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd go with a variation of #metoo and spam a bunch of articles on twitter...always ride the wave of popularity, don't try to reinvent the wheel. Just my 2 cents.

               Anyone on Twitter can as well. Search the Pizzagate and Pedogate hashtags, and retweet all the tweets with hashtag KidsToo. Then reply to all the MeToo tweets with it. Hmmm...maybe with a link to this great post here yesterday:

            Some websites I'm familiar with have a ban on "Pizzagate" stories as "fake news" ...
           </p>
           <p>
            In two other cases -- one where you can post Pizzagate and where it's very active --
and in another where you can also post Pizzagate, but you don't get replies -- posters are kind of frightened of it,
or don't really know what to think of it.

                Many here do not understand the concept of blockchain, Steem, etc., or even the relevance of what you are talking about.  Stop being a twenty something and step into the real world.

                  The issue I always had with Steem is that you might get $ for your articles.

                 <p>
                  Which means you have to identify yourself for money transfer - or do you get bitcoins? ;-)

                   It all through your profile. So just dont use your name with your profile. You jsut get a bunch of digit-keys which work as your wallet ID to move adn transfer funds.

                     YOu get your $ from content 7 days after post. Then you redeem what the balance is at in steembux, you use steembux to promote, vote, other content. You get interest on saving it though. You can also turn it into STEEM, to buy BTC or something too.

                       Not necessarily, you can play the system with enough people to make money, or keep content ciruclating. You can either use your steem bucks to power up and promote/post more content, or promoting others contnet. If you cash you, you cant manipulate the sphere of posts and info as effectively.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       That's why I think if like 50 people here got steem accounts, crossposted relevant stuff in tags like news, familyprotetion conspiracy corruption pizzagate pedogate, etc. It will expose more people and since we are all upvoting each others content, then it will have exposure!

             GREAT idea! Can you make a how-to thread on this? I would love that. I've never dabbled with that app, but I've heard it's amazing.

            I've always thought that creating a very thorough/objective and compelling POWERPOINT presentation on pizzagate would be very helpful way to consolidate all the PG info and use it as a means to "guide others down this rabbit hole".   Once said info was compiled and completed export to hundreds of cheap thumb drive, label it "The Redpill" and tossing it into the proverbial wind.

             Brilliant. I have read in some social engineering books, people are inherently curious, if you leave flash drives around places, people will pick it up and look through, especially if you label it as a "crypto cold wallet" hahaha

             Great idea.
FWIW, this Voat Pizzagate site is being described on MANY platforms as the "go to" site to be redpilled in these matters.
One observation, even if unpleasant ...referencing graphic images - such as the little girl taped to the table on Alfantis' Instagram account, or the horrific story of Heather O'Rourke is the type of approach that can 'grab' people, emotionally charging them and prompting immediate engagement in our efforts to end these abuses ASAP.

               Agree.  And I think that in the beginning Tony Podesta's "art" did appear in some
mainstream news articles.  Gradually disappeared?
But, imo, if it doesn't frighten people off right away and they give it some thought and attention,
it's a sure bet to get them involved in discussion and details about Pizzagate.

              Lots of zionists on there though censoring posts about Israel and Jewish Conlftrol/Supremacy. Ironically enough, it is censored by self-admitted Jews! its quite hilarious. I cant wait until more like us start showing up and crash their little parade.

              Honestly, they dont even try to disprove things, they just flag posts they dont like.
