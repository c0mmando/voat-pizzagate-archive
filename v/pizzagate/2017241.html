<p>Dear Mr. Sandler:</p>
<p>I did just speak to Mr. Wyss and let him know your arrival and departure dates on Martha\'s Vineyard. He will arrive back on the Vineyard on August 16 and will depart on August 24 but will be back on the Vineyard at the end of August and would love to get together with you at some point during your visit. His home number on the Vineyard is 508-693-7895.</p>
<p>Best regards,
Debbie</p>
<p><strong>PS: Thought I would send some photo updates on the granddaughters - I now have 4 granddaughters -looks like there will be no grandsons - oldest two are just turning 5 and were in a ballet recital together and the other two are 18 months and youngest just turned 1. Hope you grandchildren are doing well.</strong></p>

<p>I will be at Martha\'s Vineyard, arriving August 23, departing September 2. My daughter, Susan, her husband Steve and a family friend will be with me. Will you be at the Vineyard at any time during that period, and, if so, would you like to get together?</p>
<p>So....
This is the section i wanted to discuss.</p>

<p>1/ Who says they have 4 granddaughters when they actually have 5!!!! It may be a legitimate mistake but could it be because they are not her grandchildren. Easy to forget when they are not yours.</p>
<p>2/ The oldest two are just turning 5 - THIS MAKES THEM TWINS!!! If they were actually related she would have said the twins are turning 5. I am guessing these are two unrelated little girls who happen to be 5 years old and NOT her granddaughters either.</p>
<p>3/ The other two are 18 months - ANOTHER SET OF TWINS!!</p>
<p>4/ The youngest just turned 1. Doesn\'t name them. Is that because she doesn\'t know their names!!?? Oh and she said she had 4 granddaughters yet mentions &quot;5&quot;. Does she not know how to count or is it possible they are not her granddaughters AT ALL!!!</p>
<p>5/ Looks like there will be no grandsons - in other words there will be NO BOYS on the menu tonight. Just girls hope that\'s okay!!</p>
<p>No word about being a grandmother to two sets of twins and a one year old. Just their AGES!!!!! and NO NAMES.</p>',

            What?   Risked everything?  Are you kidding?  These were private emails that were stolen and released as Wikileaks as part of political operation.
We know that the Russian were behind the Podesta emails. We know how exactly how they got them.  And we know that Podesta was one of just thousands who got similar spearfishing email.  The spearfishing email was fairly sophisticated.  Here's the email sent to Podesta

            The hacking groups behind this widespread attack have been known to security researchers for years.  APT 28 and 29 are known to be nation-state actors, using tools and techniques far beyond private groups.  They are known to be part of the GRU and the FSB. These emails used the same command and control servers used to hack Podesta, the DNC, Colin Powell as well as Nato, the European Parliament, the Polish government, Germany and multiple others.

            So our budget number is currently at around 4.4m for pa including the pmusa transfer. And I think based on upon my convo with debbie fine the pa and capaf budgets are full but of course we will keep going. She would prefer that all c4 checks from now on be split between capaf and mman. Not written to pa.
           </p>
           <p>
            We should try and be creative about what we sell in the next 5 weeks to make it be as time sensitive as possible.

            I don't think that's a typo, just awkwardly phrased.   She also could have made a typo when she said 4.   That would be a genuine typo if she meant to type 5.

           <p>
            It's basically an illegitimate investigative technique to read all documents/emails with maximum suspicion.  You can't determine guilt first and then try to find the evidence.  It's especially nefarious with regards to pedophilia, where something completely innocent like a proud grandmother sending photos of her grandkids can get distorted.  Can you imagine how people would react if Podesta said, "The little girls are adorable."

            I think she meant to write:
"The other two are: 18 months
            <strong>
             <strong>
              <strong>
               AND almost 1
              </strong>

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally have twin grandsons and I sometimes say 'the youngest boys are turning 5'  too. Which infers to those who don't know.... that they are twins. But many people in my circle (even causal acquaintances)  know I have twin grandsons so no need to be redundant.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think some of you make more out of nothing than need be (although there's absolutely no doubt there's an enormous global elite pedophile ring on our planet). So speculations like this are really pointless and honestly?......annoying to read.

           <p>
            The four granddaughters are (5 and 5) + (18 months and 1 year) = 4.
           </p>
           <p>
            5 and 5 does not equal twins.  It doesn't even equal siblings.   This easily could be the daughter of her son and the daughter of her daughter.  You don't know how many children the grandmother has.   The granddaughters could be four separate one child families.

               IMO, The mere fact that John Podesta is included in an email correspondence where children are mentioned is reason enough for suspicion.  For further thoughts, see my original reply to whatgives in this thread.

                  That's an admirable quality to have.

                  I think most folks in here are simply unaware of the cognitive biases that people have and how easy it is to fall for something that doesn't hold up logically.  Basically we are far, far less rational than we think we are and our brains have certain things that make us believe.....not what is objectively true, but what we are telling ourselves.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Two things are brains love is making connections and finding patterns and making up stories/being told stories.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If I give you three random pieces of information, you can easily connect them into a story that feels "right."  Even if they have nothing to do with each other.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Look at this.  What is this a picture of?   Look how fast your brain made connections and filled out the rest of the image.

            At least tax dodgers they are. According to their about page
            <a href="http://www.twirltaos.org/about/">
             http://www.twirltaos.org/about/
            </a>
            it says "was founded in 2007 as a for-profit play space and toy store"
then at the bottom it says "Twirl, A Play and Discovery Space, Inc. is a not-for-profit corporation exempt from federal income tax as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Donations to Twirl are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law."
           </p>
           <p>
            I am no tax genius but those seem to me to be conflicting statements.

            Whoa!  The whole tone of the correspondence is off--first a real formal itinerary/invitation and then to tack a pseudo-friendly "by the way here's my grandkids" at the end seems WAY off -- this is just not how people who are friendly enough to meet up at the beach talk with each other.  The "ballet recital" doesn't sit right with me, either. Indeed odd, too, not knowing whether you have four or five grandchildren--just does not happen.   And yea -- if the five-year-olds were twins, she would have said so.  Likewise with the 18-month olds.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I will point out that is possible to have two five-year-old grandchildren who are cousins, not siblings, and two 18-month old grandchildren who are cousins, not siblings. For example, in my own family we had four grandkids born within nine months of each other, and we do not call them the "quads".  Just four grandchildren who are _____ age.
           </p>
           <p>
            But yea, I would certainly know at any given time how many grandchildren I have, including any that might be on the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Definitely a high-radar find.  Good job!

            very perceptive, OP!  i've come across this email several times, but I don't think I would have ever caught the error in arithmetic!  definitely gives credence to the assumption that this is some sort of coded language.
