<p>Hastert Inc article from 2005 - <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-29/news/0505290316_1_dennis-hastert-jack-abramoff-delay/3">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-29/news/0505290316_1_dennis-hastert-jack-abramoff-delay/3</a></p>
<p>Hastert\'s son hired by Podesta/Mattoon: As a lobbyist, Hastert worked on, among other specialties, technology issues. Piggybacking on that, his older son, Joshua, hit Washington soon after Denny became Speaker in 1999. Voila! The pierced-tongued owner of a record store in DeKalb called Seven Dead Arson became a lobbyist focusing on technology and defense issues. Josh started his new gig, working for mp3.com’s lobbyist who had been an aide to former House Republican Minority Leader Bob Michel, a close colleague of Josh’s father.</p>
<p>Josh then moved to a small firm, Federal Legislative Associates, that lobbied on tech issues. Moving on up, he was soon hired by lobbying firm, Podesta Mattoon, headed by two old friends of his father’s—Tony Podesta, a fellow Illinoisan, and, with Hastert, a student government leader in the 1960s, and Dan Matoon, a close friend/advisor of Hastert’s who ran his first congressional campaign. In 2006, while his father was still holding the Speaker’s gavel, Josh was hired by Google as part of a team of Podesta Matton lobbyists. - <a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/June-2015/Dennis-Hastert/">http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/June-2015/Dennis-Hastert/</a></p>',

            The NACSA mentioned in the email has to do with Charter Schools.  Again, we see children's issues as part of Podesta's interests.  John Podesta stated to Daniel Mattoon in the email that he would handle this personally.

            The podestas knew Dennis Hastert for 50 years.  Went to camp with him in Japan (Camp Nose).  Photos and multiple references in the podesta emails. A goldman sachs director even joked about it in on email ("maybe we should send denny back to a certain island in japan").
