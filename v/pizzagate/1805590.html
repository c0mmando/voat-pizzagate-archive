<p><strong>&quot;The Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome&quot; by Roland C. Summit, M.D.</strong>
[<a href="https://archive.is/Ue6dX">https://archive.is/Ue6dX</a>]</p>
<p>Every so often the mighty Wurlitzer plays a familiar tune - Famous TV personality found to be a child sex predator. Sometimes a story only gets attention from the independent media, the establishment media choosing to downplay or ignore it - Former Speaker of the House prolific pedophile. </p>
<p>A couple years ago two children from Hampstead England, a young girl and her younger brother claimed to be victims of ritual sexual abuse. Their story has since almost faded away completely.</p>
<p>Currently trending on social media and independent media is the latest flavor of this familiar tale, being branded as “Pizzagate”. In both the Hampstead and Pizzagate cases, the controversy isn\'t over the seriousness of the crimes or the social status of the perpetrators, but whether any crimes even took place at all.</p>
<p>The claims of the two Hampstead children were officially investigated and ruled to be false. The children had evern recanted their claims. Pizzagate hasn\'t been officially investigated as there aren\'t any known victims, and the claims don\'t relate to any specific crimes.</p>
<p>Despite this, many people (<em>including myself</em>) still strongly suspect organized child sexual abuse has occurred. But there is a large contingent of people who believe one or both cases are bogus and no sexual abuse took place.</p>
<p>From my initial investigation of the Pizzagate evidence, I find there to be strong indications that the public\'s concerns are warranted and an investigation needs to be conducted. Mostly extraneous evidence has been uncovered after the initial flurry of citizen investigation. In the Hampstead case, little new information has emerged in many months.</p>
<p>But I\'ve got some evidence to share about both cases that\'s been sitting there all along.</p>
<p>In my ongoing research, I sometimes return to cases or topics that I feel are unresolved. Rarely do I find anything significant enough to reignite an investigation. Often though, I find information that supports an existing theory or provides greater context.</p>
<p>I found a research paper entitled, <strong>&quot;The Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome&quot; by Roland C. Summit, M.D.</strong> It was written in 1983. <strong>UPDATE: Please ignore the obviously biased criticism of the paper from legal professionals and experts for the defense, at least long enough to read it.</strong></p>
<p>The first piece of evidence lies within the syndrome outlined in the paper, the child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome.</p>
<p>The five categories of the syndrome are...</p>
<ol>
<li>Secrecy</li>
<li>Helplessness</li>
<li>Entrapment and accommodation</li>
<li>Delayed, unconvincing disclosure</li>
<li>Retraction</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two categories, secrecy and helplessness are conditions under which the abuse occurs. The next three categories are sequential events and behaviors related to the abuse.</p>
<p>Note the last two categories, Delayed, unconvincing disclosure and retraction. These behaviors were both seen in the Hampstead case. But let\'s focus on number five, retraction for a moment.</p>
<p>Both Hampstead children retracted their allegations in recorded police interviews. Many people argue that the retractions alone are proof enough that the allegations were false. Others view it as the natural progression of events given that the allegations were false and in light of a thorough interrogation and the children being made aware of the implications and consequences.</p>
<p>Let me quote from the paper…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whatever a child says about the sexual abuse, she is likely to reverse it.&quot; &quot;Unless there is special support for the child and immediate intervention to force responsibility on the father, the girl will follow the \'normal\' course and retract her complaint.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In just these two statements we learn that retraction is &quot;likely&quot; and the &quot;normal course.&quot; That means that, more often than not the child will retract the claims.</p>
<p>For some additional perspective to help understand this behavior, I quote again from the paper...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the chaotic aftermath of disclosure, the child discovers that the bedrock fears and threats underlying the secrecy are true. Her father abandons her and calls her a liar. Her mother does not believe her or decompensates into hysteria and rage. The family is fragmented, and all the children are placed in custody. She is held in custody with no apparent hope of returning home if the dependency position is maintained.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;...bedrock fears and threats underlying the secrecy&quot; reference takes us back to the first category of the syndrome, secrecy. About secrecy, the paper states...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Virtually no child is prepared for the possibility of molestation by a trusted adult; that possibility is a well kept secret even among adults. The child is, therefore, entirely dependent on the intruder for whatever reality is assigned to the experience…The secrecy is both the source of fear and the promise of safety.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The syndrome and the related information shared in the paper are claimed to be from research conducted within an extended network of child abuse treatment programs and other clinical settings as well as from hundreds of training symposia and feedback from thousands of individuals with personal or professional involvement in sexual abuse.</p>
<p>However, the syndrome itself and other information apply to the most typical female victim, as far less research involved male victim cases. This is largely because males are extremely reluctant to admit to sexual victimization experiences. And when they are abused, it is often outside of the nuclear family.</p>
<p>I found the paper to be well written with arguments well presented. I got the sense that the little-understood phenomenon of child sexual abuse is a passion of the author. He presented many reasonable findings I had never seen elsewhere or considered previously.</p>
<p>It seems that the children retracting their allegations in the Hampstead case is typical of children who have been sexually abused. However, the fact that the British legal system, medical and child welfare system didn\'t act in consideration of this understanding doesn\'t surprise me.</p>
<p>Now, let\'s look at the fourth category of the syndrome, Delayed, unconvincing disclosure in relation to the Pizzagate case. In the Hampstead case, there are only two children who only confided within the family. In the Pizzagate case, there are no known victims. What can account for this, if there\'s been actual abuse? Wouldn\'t older children who frequent the Internet have learned about Pizzagate? Would that not be enough encouragement to come forward?</p>
<p>The paper states…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Most ongoing sexual abuse is never disclosed, at least not outside the immediate family. Treated, reported or investigated cases are the exception, not the norm.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, recall that this information is based on the typical female victim. Continuing, it states…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Disclosure is an outgrowth either of overwhelming family conflict, incidental discovery by a third party, or sensitive outreach and community education by child protective services.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there\'s already a statistical resistance on the part of children to claim abuse. Add to that the environment society presents outlined in the paper...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The identified child victim encounters an adult world which gives grudging acknowledgement to an abstract concept of child sexual abuse but which challenges and represses the child who presents a specific complaint of victimization. Adult beliefs are dominated by an entrenched and self-protective mythology that passes for common-sense.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the reason why a possible network of child abusers could traffic in children without the children disclosing the abuse, the paper states…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When no adult intervenes to acknowledge the reality of the abuse experience or to fix responsibility on the offending adult, there is a reinforcement of the child\'s tendency to deal with the trauma as an intrapsychic event and to incorporate a monstrous apparition of guilt, self-blame, pain and rage.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another clue to this lack of disclosure may be found in the following statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is very little risk of discovery if the child is young enough and if there is an established relationship of authority and affection…The healthy, normal, emotionally resilient child will learn to accommodate to the reality of continuing sexual abuse.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we\'ve just covered in only a few minutes points to the legitimacy of the claims in both the Hampstead and Pizzagate cases, if only based on statistical probability. But I encourage you to read the entire paper. Reading it in full gave me possibly greater insight into the actions of the child victims, the perpetrators, law enforcement, the media and the general public.</p>
<p>Speaking of the actions of law enforcement; the Hampstead children\'s case was purportedly officially investigated and no evidence of abuse was found. In Pizzagate the MSM has been more dismissive, even ridiculing the people who merely think it’s worthy of looking into. I found the following statement from the paper illustrative of what the MSM coverage and that investigation was actually intended to be, a cover-up...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What everybody doesn\'t know, and would not want to know, is that the vast majority of investigated accusations prove valid.&quot;</p>

           It seems that the children retracting their allegations in the Hampstead case is typical of children who have been sexually abused. However, the fact that the British legal system, medical and child welfare system didn't act in consideration of this understanding doesn't surprise me.

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Again, recall that this information is based on the typical female victim. Continuing, it states…

          <p>
           Another clue to this lack of disclosure may be found in the following statement.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "There is very little risk of discovery if the child is young enough and if there is an established relationship of authority and affection…The healthy, normal, emotionally resilient child will learn to accommodate to the reality of continuing sexual abuse."

            So that means the doctors that examined the kids and found evidence of sexual abuse on both children are lying too. Um, ok. And Aaron Dover who was just murdered and came out and talked about abuse at same place was a liar as well.

            An excellent paper. Thanks for bringing it forth.  Regarding his comments on retraction, the Hampstead Children were removed into "care" for the period between disclosure and retraction.  During this time the fear of the overriding consequences of their disclosure would have set in; familial fragmentation and maternal/paternal abandonment will have played its part here, I feel.  I have also seen many times and the mother also states that clinical examination did in fact reveal evidence of abuse.

            Why are there no victims?  There are many victims.  The no victim meme is getting ridiculous. Victims have written books, made films, testified in court, gone on television, started organizations. Why are the victims silent?  They're not. They have been speaking out for a long time. The mainstream media used to even cover some of this material back before virtuous pedophiles somehow became "mainstream" while non-pedophiles were turned into bigoted fringe "conspiratards."  Ultimately the advertisers will probably have to decide whether they want to promote pedophila and have their products associated with child molestation.  The media has already made its choice.

            There is definitely an accomodation on the part of the child victim. I asked the question in a Sociopathic/ Narcissistic forum "Why did you allow yourself to be abused as a child" Almost no one wanted to engaging in the discussion and the only one who did said "Fear".

             Maybe I'm miss reading this but if the way I read/understood your question, I can see why no one answered. "why did you allow yourself to be abused as a child?!?!" Do you honestly think a CHILD can prevent abuse from an adult?

               I'm speechless.  You are clueless. That's like asking a 5 year old that gets beat by an adult, why didn't you beat them back. They are CHILDREN. They are smaller and defenseless against predators. You can't be this dumb, right? Blaming the victim is pretty pathetic

            Yes, I am going through those to see what they are of.  There is just a lot of information to process here.

            I just sent you another message with links to the news articles I mentioned.  I cannot link all the news articles because it would take too much time.  I linked a few, then gave you some search terms to use.  You will then see all of the articles I saw.

            Those kids weren't being "tortured" in any way by the people they were with. They were too comfortable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obvious anxiety when telling their story, but not consistent with anyone forcing a narrative (they looked at each other more than they did the camera.)
           </p>
           <p>
            A few obvious embellishments but kids their age generally don't like to admit when they don't know something, so they fill in the gaps.
           </p>
           <p>
            All in all that video was two kids telling a truthful,story to the best of their ability.

            Do you see the newspapers?  I did not link directly to them, but they are there.  One is dated in 1972, and the other is dated in 1983.

            There is an information overload...  I can't process it fast enough.

               It's worst. I've viewed the 5 hour video and listened to their entire accounts and, let me tell you, they have been through hell. Those poor kids never stood a chance. Plus, the mother has been harassed and had no other choice but to leave England and go into hiding. She's fighting for her kids from abroad, sending requests and all. Also, their Russian maternal grandparents are fighting alongside her for full custody, but so far, no luck. I don't know if they ever will be in safe hands again. I couldn't imagine a worst fate than theirs...

                I am looking through the link you sent me.  It looks like it is a lot of really good information.

               <p>
                Have you seen this video?  I just want to make sure you are aware of it.  He starts to talk about child sacrifice at about the 20 minute mark, but I recommend watching the whole thing so it is in its proper context.

            This analogy sure makes a lot of sense.  When a child trusts in their caretaker, that being a parent, teacher, grand father, etc.  and that trust is seriously broken by something as serious as sexual abuse, the pain is compounded by being broken a second time when they deny it. Also when the other parent stands with the abuser..   People do not realize how much a child loves their parent. Their heart and spirit is completely broken and yes that can cause anger.  You are so right.  I have also heard that the child many times gives in to more abuse in order to please the parent.  This is so very sad.

The child is, therefore, entirely dependent on the intruder for whatever reality is assigned to the experience…The secrecy is both the source of fear and the promise of safety

             Also the things that one describes as a young child CAN ONLY be described by  someone that experienced it first hand! Children discussing sexual things or things about murder and such are things that a young mind cannot possibly make up. Believe the children!

             True..I read that Chris guys SRA cult members list on the wayback machine last night and not only was Hampstead mentioned there there were some truly eyebrow raising names on the list as well! England is chock full of abusers and cult rituals. Its truly scary!
