The link is to Scott Gittrich\'s bizarre you tube video about Toppers Franchise.  Scott Gittrich used to be a nobody until he became a somebody.  There is extensive online praise and adulation about his rapid rise to success in the pizza franchise world he started in Wisconsin.  In my mind, there is definite pedophile and occult activity going on in these franchises.  Many bizarre and sexually-suggestive you tube videos are available.  I recommend, &quot;Toppers After Dark.&quot;  Look up Toppers images/pictures, and you will get an eyeful.  Lots of pictures of children eating pizza and other strangeness.  Look up Toppers memes, and you\'ll get more.  This has been far-reaching from Illinois to California.  One of the memes I saw was a picture of a really tough-looking and angry dude and the caption was, &quot; What if I told you Toppers Pizza is sponsoring a SBE event.&quot;  Not knowing what &quot;SBE&quot; was, I looked it up.  SBE is a large American international hospitality, real estate, and entertainment company with its headquarters in Los Angeles.  Sam Nazarian, an Iranian-American, is its Founder, Chairman, and CEO.  The kicker is this guy also owns many restaurants throughout the country called, &quot;800 Degree Pizza.&quot;  I did not check-out 800 Degree Pizza.  Toppers was enough for me.  The latest news on Gittrich (love the name ðŸ¤”) from an article I read dated March 8, 2017, is that he suddenly and rapidly closed all five of his Chicago-based Toppers.  He gave no notice and just shut them down saying only that he and Toppers plan on being back to Chicago someday.</p>',
