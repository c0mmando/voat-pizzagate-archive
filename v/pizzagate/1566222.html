<p>Learned Helplessness (LH) is defined as “the condition in which a person suffers from a sense of powerlessness, arising from a traumatic event or persistent failure to succeed.” This term was coined by Dr. Martin Seligman, the CIA torture expert who discovered the phenomena while electroshocking dogs. He observed that some dogs became unresponsive and lost all apparent will to avoid the torture. LH was the basis of the CIA’s torture program from 2001 onwards. Seligman met with top CIA psychologists and agents at his house in the same year and that meeting was known as “the start of the program”. The meeting included at least one Mossad agent and happened only months apart from when Kidman met with Seligman at The University of Technology, Sydney.</p>

<p>---&gt; Nicole Kidman’s Father dies amid pedophile, child murder ring allegations

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday Barnett released her own theory about Kidman’s death,” The main perpetrator of my child sexual abuse, Antony Kidman, is dead after I filed formal complaints accusing him of the rape, torture and murder of children in an exclusive Sydney pedophile ring. As a child victim of mind control I feel he’s been sacrificed for failing to adequately program me.”</p>
<p>“Kidman was responsible for ensuring that I never disclosed pedophile ring activities that I witnessed as a child,” she continued. “He failed. News of Kidman’s death impacted me, someone who has undergone intense treatment. I know that there are other victims of Kidman’s crimes out there who are perhaps not as far along the healing path as I am. I anticipate that news of Kidman’s death may have a serious impact on these victims. A perpetrator’s death can even trigger suicidal ideation.</p>
<p>“My complaints last month to the Australian Child Abuse Royal Commission detailed two incidents in which Kidman subjected me to horrific physical and sexual assault” Barnett said. “But there are even more serious crimes against children that I witnessed Kidman commit as a member of the elite Sydney pedophile ring. Those complaints have gone to the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels.”</p>

            Fiona Barnett is absolutely the real deal. She is a brave woman and anyone doubting the existence about ritual abuse can eat my shorts. I too have encountered, face to face, people that as children were exposed to this. It is terribly real. Just so you know, Victoria Canada is crawling with this stuff and forget Michelle Remembers(an old book from the 80's written by a psychiatrist named Dr. Pazder) many others from that area have come out. Ritual abuse is so sick and crazy, no wonder people can't believe it. I find Fiona however, very creditable. So you have it around the world. US, Canada, France, Australia, Belgium, Portugal, all these countries plus more, are being exposed.But if the scum at the top of the governments and corporations are trying to keep a lid on it, no wonder those willing to testify are dropping like flies

            Yeah cool, don't burn yourself out looking for it lol. I just remember the article had a photo of him in his (I assume) office, sitting at a desk I think. Also I remember that there is a podcast Fiona did/does called Pedophiles Downunder and if I recall correctly she actually mentions it within the first half hour or so of the first episode. It's on YT, I might give it another listen later if nobody beats me to it. And wow on that Gittinger connection.

            He also believes that traumatic incidents should not be repeated in talking therapies, like the traditional methods would go over them.  His connection with the CIA, leaves this particular nuance of approach, odd.

            Gee that Fiona sure gets around. Abused in Engadine, then Orange, then Sydney? Funny how she moved so far and still managed to bump into these 'elite' pedos, wherever she went. Cos only the Elites would be good enough for Fiona, no common or garden abusers for her, she is special don't you know? 
This woman  is sooooooo full of shit, and I hope the Kidmans and others with the means, go after her, and hard.

             Going through your history, it's sure funny how you seem to have such a hard-on vendetta against this woman. All the people that have been accused or make accusations, all the names and places mentioned, yet this is the one that seems to strike at your nerves the most by quite some margin. Whatever it is, it's almost a certainty that it's personal, so I ask what is your exact gripe with this woman? You would be going after more well-known names if it was a general angst towards PG like Juanita Broaddrick or Cathy O' Brien as we do against Podesta et. al, yet you've singled out Fiona Barnett in particular. Unless you live on the Australian continent, what she does or says should be of no concern to you, so it's pretty fucking obvious that on top of the British slang you've been using that you're from Australia.

             Well the Kidmans haven't done shit! Won't even comment on it let alone sue. I know if these claims were out there about my dead dad I'd be doing everything in my power to prove she's full of shit and shut her up straight away. I know her stories are far fetched and tbh I even am not 100% sold on her, though taking everything into account it would be foolish to write her off. I give her the benefit of the doubt for the time being.

             She certainly was
             <em>
              trafficked
             </em>
             around as a child.  She was
             <em>
              trafficked
             </em>
             around to politicians for sex.  Also Engadine is a suburb of Sydney so your post doesn't make sense.  Her Polish grandmother and former Nazi stepgrandfather also exposed her to satanic ritual abuse.  She describes one such ritual as taking place in Bathurst, not Orange as in your post.  You are very hazy both about her evidence and geography.  Also why wouldn't you believe the evidence of Fiona and other victims of child sexual abuse.  In Fiona's case she's not doing it for financial gain.  She wants to get the truth out.

              She wants the attention, and she is disgusting. I hope she gets what is coming to her. Bathurst is right near Orange and I know where Engadine is - I have been to all those places. Even if I hadn't she is still full of shit.
Bruce Spence did NOT decapitate ten children in front of a large crowd, get serious. Anyone who would believe that is as demented as Fiona is. What hospital staff - a smallish regional hospital what is more, would not be alarmed and call the Police if an unconscious  child was brought in REEKING OF DECOMPOSING CORPSE!??
Fiona claims she was put in a grave on  top of a decomposing corpse, shut in there til she passed out, then taken by her murdering captors (why? when they killed so many others?) to Hospital to save her life. Then she was discharged by medical staff  into their care? Do you idiotic brain dead PG numpties actually think Drs and nurses would not NOTICE the smell of rotting corpse all over this young girl? And ask questions?  I don't even believe anyone would put a person into their car to transport them, if they were covered in rotting corpse smell, get real! GROW A BRAIN people,  the story is 1,000 percent FICTION and pathetic fiction at that.

            Poor Nicole's been hit from all angles, as we discussed in the other thread, Stonedalien: Pedo-dad, L. Ron, Kubrick, Tommy Girl....and have we talked about the "unexpected and sudden" death of her 43 year old brother-in-law, Angus Hawley, in 2015?? Apparently he just dropped dead "while on a business trip in New York."

            Hmmm. Nicole has so many skeletons in that closet
            <s>
             as well as Tommy
            </s>
            its at bursting point. Angus' death came a mere 7 months, after the "unexpected and sudden" death of pedo dad, Anthony, too. One has to wonder what the brother-in-law knew....
           </p>
           <p>
            Also as previously mentioned, Nicole is well on her way to being discredited by liberal Hollywood. Who would believe her at this point, even if she chose to 'speak out.'

            There was an article of an interview with Kidman where he spoke of how he was working on a kind of mind control drug for unruly kids. If anyone comes across it they should share it. I saw it once but didn't bookmark it and havnt came across it since. May have been scrubbed, I don't know.

              thats the old stuff. Anti nausea drug masquerading as 'truth serum.' There is some new stuff floating around somewhere.
