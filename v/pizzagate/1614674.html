            As I heard some one say on vid.me do not be guilty of doing the same thing to David as those denying PG have done to us......if you can not comprehend the Illuminati then find out about it through research, instead of attacking David.....Illuminati means Light/ Enlightenment, Illumanated One, they worship the Light/ The Morning Star ( Lucifer).....to understand this you have to go back to The Garden, Adam and Eve and their Fall, and to the Fallen Angels ( Sons of God) mating with the daughters of man, therefore creating a hybrid race/bloodline, the Nephilim.....because these fallen angels waged so much havoc on the earth God brought the great flood to destroy them, all except Noah and his family because, they were the only ones who had not had their dna corrupted by the going on of the fallen angels.....it resurfaced again in Babylon at the Tower of Babel and the worshipping of Baal (Lucifer) this time God destroyed the Tower and confounded the language of the people,...now I will skip to today......the elites/globalist believe they come from the race/bloodline of Lucifer, leader of the fallen angels and, their offspring the Nephilim.....they worship Lucifer because he desires worship and, he also desires sacrifice,  children are his preference because they are the most innocent , and the more horrific torture brought upon the child the more he is pleased, in return his followers are given favors such as success, wealth, power fame etc..they believe Lucifer is the good guy, and God is the evil one because He tried to destroy them in the flood,... they believe they are the superior race/bloodline and, will rule over mankind, and enslave them....there is much more to this, but here is the readers digest version......it is a great study......some people take the ancient astronaut theory.....I chose the biblical teaching studied along side with extra biblical text such as the book of Enoch R.H.Charles version....Book of Jaser, and several other things.....there are some men on you tube I follow....Chuck Missler, Timothy Alberino, Steve Quayle, Gary Stearman...... Antarctica is another area the elitist/globalist have become very interested in as of late..... I hesitated to write about this because, people as you see humiliate that which they don't understand.....but then I thought....Oh what the heck. :o)

            There's more evidence to support the theory that Aliens are a 'backburner' Psyop fabricated from Aleister Crowley when he worked for MI5 -- British Intelligence -- look it up. There's is absolutely no
            <strong>
             <em>
              proof
             </em>
            </strong>
            of aliens no matter how deep one goes -- never any proof. It is imperative that we look at
            <strong>
             <em>
              when
             </em>
            </strong>
            these things started showing up in historical literature.

            Um yeah. If you want pure biblical truth that doesn't rely on religious tradition that is steeped in paganism, just go to JW.org. They're advocates for exposing lies and the truth without sugar coating it. They have a biblical search engine that you can just type in a topic and find info on here:
            <a href="wol.jw.org">
             Biblical Library
            </a>
            . They're doing what the religious leaders would have had them killed for in the early 1800's. Many people died for just trying to translate the bible from Latin to something people understood. Make no mistake, All religions of the world were in on this corruption. They were also in on the conspiracy of removing God's true name from the bible. Doing so caused so much confusion in the scriptures it made people only rely on religion and they're leaders for answers. Does anyone get satisfying answers from a religious leader who are dressed in they're costumes? Really ask yourself that. When was the last time you were at a funeral and heard a preacher say something that made you feel better about the situation by giving everyone a biblical hope. No, they say "Your child died because god needed another angel in heaven." That is the biggest and most heinous lie ever told about God. If that teaching were a true statement, why would anyone want to worship a God that takes you children. That kind of teaching actually sounds a lot like something Moloch (Molech) would ask of you. Have fun on that Biblical library, and contact me if you have any questions.

            That absolutely are. The Nephilim were hybrid humans who were have angel half human. See this info below. This is going to be post 1 of 2 regarding the Nephilim and the demons.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Nephʹi·lim) [Fellers; Those Who Cause [Others] to Fall Down].
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a transliteration of the Hebrew word nephi·limʹ, plural in its three occurrences in the Bible. (Ge 6:4; Nu 13:33 [twice]) It evidently stems from the causative form of the Hebrew verb na·phalʹ (fall) as found, for example, in 2 Kings 3:19; 19:7.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Bible account describing Jehovah’s displeasure with men in the days of Noah before the Flood relates that “the sons of the true God” took for themselves wives from among the attractive daughters of men. It then mentions the presence of “Nephilim,” saying: “The Nephilim proved to be in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men and they bore sons to them, they were the mighty ones [Heb., hag·gib·bo·rimʹ] who were of old, the men of fame.”—Ge 6:1-4.
           </p>
           <p>
            Identity. Bible commentators, considering verse 4, have offered several suggestions as to the identity of these Nephilim. Some have thought that the derivation of the name indicates that the Nephilim were ‘fallen angels,’ angels who sinned. Others, using a remarkable line of reasoning, conclude that the designation Nephilim itself indicates that they ‘fell from heaven’ in that they were ‘begotten by heavenly beings.’ Other scholars, focusing their attention particularly on the statement “and also after that” (vs 4), have said the Nephilim were not ‘fallen angels’ or the “mighty ones,” since the Nephilim “proved to be in the earth in those days” before the sons of God had relations with women. These latter scholars hold the opinion that the Nephilim were simply wicked men like Cain—robbers, bullies, and tyrants who roamed the earth until they were destroyed by the Flood. Still another group, taking into consideration not only the meaning of the name Nephilim but also the context of verse 4, conclude that the Nephilim were not themselves angels, but were the hybrid offspring resulting from materialized angels having intercourse with the daughters of men.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same as “gib·bo·rimʹ.” Certain Bible translations adjust the location of the phrase “and also after that,” placing it near the beginning of verse 4, thus identifying the Nephilim with the “mighty ones,” the gib·bo·rimʹ, mentioned in the latter part of the verse. For example: “In those days, as well as afterward, there were giants [Heb., han·nephi·limʹ] on the earth, who were born to the sons of the gods whenever they had intercourse with the daughters of men; these were the heroes [Heb., hag·gib·bo·rimʹ] who were men of note in days of old.”—Ge 6:4, AT; see also Mo, NIV, and TEV.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Greek Septuagint also suggests that both the “Nephilim” and “mighty ones” are identical by using the same word giʹgan·tes (giants) to translate both expressions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reviewing the account, we see that verses 1 to 3 tell of “the sons of the true God” taking wives and of Jehovah’s statement that he was going to end his patience with men after 120 years. Verse 4 then speaks of the Nephilim proving to be in the earth “in those days,” evidently the days when Jehovah made the statement. Then it shows that this situation continued “after that, when the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men,” and describes in more detail the results of the union of “the sons of the true God” with women.

             Post 2 of 2.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who were the ‘sons of God’ that fathered the Nephilim?
            </p>
            <p>
             Who were “the sons of the true God” that were involved? Were they men who were worshipers of Jehovah (as distinguished from the general run of wicked mankind), as some claim? Evidently not. The Bible implies that their marriage to the daughters of men resulted in whipping up the badness in the earth. Noah and his three sons, along with their wives, were the only ones in God’s favor and were the only ones preserved through the Deluge.—Ge 6:9; 8:15, 16; 1Pe 3:20.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hence, if these “sons of the true God” were merely men, the question arises, Why were their offspring “men of fame” more than those of the wicked, or of faithful Noah? Also, the question might be asked, Why mention their marriage to the daughters of men as something special? Marriage and childbearing had been taking place for more than 1,500 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sons of God mentioned at Genesis 6:2, therefore, must have been angels, spirit “sons of God.” This expression is applied to angels at Job 1:6; 38:7. This view is supported by Peter, who speaks of “the spirits in prison, who had once been disobedient when the patience of God was waiting in Noah’s days.” (1Pe 3:19, 20) Also Jude writes of “the angels that did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place.” (Jude 6) Angels had the power to materialize in human form, and some angels did so to bring messages from God. (Ge 18:1, 2, 8, 20-22; 19:1-11; Jos 5:13-15) But heaven is the proper abode of spirit persons, and the angels there have positions of service under Jehovah. (Da 7:9, 10) To leave this abode to dwell on earth and to forsake their assigned service to have fleshly relations would be rebellion against God’s laws, and perversion.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Bible states that the disobedient angels are now “spirits in prison,” having been ‘thrown into Tartarus’ and “reserved with eternal bonds under dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.” This seems to indicate that they are greatly restricted, unable again to materialize as they did prior to the Flood.—1Pe 3:19; 2Pe 2:4; Jude 6.
            </p>
            <p>
             Increased Wickedness. “The mighty ones who were of old, the men of fame” that were produced by these marriages, were not men of fame with God, for they did not survive the Flood, as did Noah and his family. They were “Nephilim,” bullies, tyrants, who no doubt helped to make conditions worse. Their angelic fathers, knowing the construction of the human body and being able to materialize, were not creating life, but lived in these human bodies and, cohabiting with women, brought forth children. Their children, “mighty ones,” were therefore unauthorized hybrids. Apparently the Nephilim did not, in turn, have children.

             The World’s Secret Ruler Exposed
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            “THE ruler of this world will be cast out,” said Jesus to the people on one occasion. Later, he added that ‘the ruler of the world had no hold on him’ and that “the ruler of this world has been judged.” (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11) Of whom was Jesus speaking?
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering what Jesus was saying about “the ruler of this world,” it is obvious that he could not have been referring to his Father, Jehovah God. Who, then, is “the ruler of this world”? How will he be “cast out,” and how has he been “judged”?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             “The Ruler of This World” Reveals Himself
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as a master criminal often takes pride in boasting about his power, so did the Devil when tempting Jesus, the Son of God. After showing Jesus “all the kingdoms” of the world, Satan made him this offer: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.”—Luke 4:5-7.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the Devil were merely a principle of evil, as some have suggested, how could that temptation be explained? Was Jesus being tempted by some evil thought or by some inner turmoil that possibly followed his baptism? If so, how could it be said that “there is no sin in him”? (1 John 3:5) Far from denying the Devil’s power over mankind, Jesus actually confirmed it by speaking of him as “the ruler of the world,” describing him as “a murderer” and “a liar.”—John 14:30; 8:44; The New Jerusalem Bible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some 60 years after Christ’s encounter with the Devil, the apostle John reminded Christians of the Devil’s powerful influence, saying that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” That one, John also said, “is misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (1 John 5:19; Revelation 12:9) Clearly, the Bible speaks of an invisible spirit as “the ruler of the world.” But what is the extent of his influence over mankind?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The World Ruler Delegates Power to Associates
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Writing about the Christians’ fight for the faith, the apostle Paul clearly identified their worst enemies. “We have a wrestling,” he candidly said, “not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (Ephesians 6:12) Thus, this fight goes beyond the human sphere, since it is carried out, “not against blood and flesh,” but against “wicked spirit forces.”
           </p>
           <p>
            According to most modern Bible translations, “the wicked spirit forces” here refer, not to an abstract principle of evil, but to powerful wicked spirit persons. Some versions offer such renderings as “the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (Revised Standard Version), “the spiritual army of evil in the heavens” (The Jerusalem Bible), and “the superhuman forces of evil in the heavens” (The New English Bible). Thus, the Devil has been exercising his power through other rebel angels who forsook “their own proper dwelling place” in heaven.—Jude 6.
           </p>
           <p>
            The prophetic Bible book of Daniel discloses how these “world rulers” have been exerting control over the world since ancient times. Deeply concerned about fellow Jews who in 537 B.C.E. had returned to Jerusalem from their Babylonian exile, the prophet Daniel prayed in their behalf for three weeks. An angel, sent by God to reassure the prophet, told him why his arrival had been delayed. He said: “The prince of the royal realm of Persia was standing in opposition to me for twenty-one days.”—Daniel 10:2, 13.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who was this ‘prince of Persia’? The angel was obviously not referring to Persian King Cyrus, who at that time looked with favor upon Daniel and his people. Moreover, how could a mere human king resist a spirit creature for three weeks when it took one angel only one night to destroy 185,000 mighty warriors? (Isaiah 37:36) This hostile ‘prince of Persia’ could only be an agent of the Devil, that is, a demon who was given control over the realm of the Persian Empire. Later in the account, God’s angel stated that he would once again have to fight against “the prince of Persia” and another demon prince, “the prince of Greece.”—Daniel 10:20.
           </p>
           <p>
            What can we conclude from this? Simply that there really are invisible “world rulers,” demon princes who share control of the world under the authority of their chief, Satan the Devil. But what has been their aim until now?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The World Ruler Shows His True Face
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the apostle John relates how Jesus, as Michael the archangel, defeats the Devil and his demons and tells of the disastrous consequences resulting from their expulsion from heaven. We read: “Woe for the earth . . . because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.”—Revelation 12:9, 12.
           </p>
           <p>
            How has the Devil shown great anger? Just as many desperate criminals follow the policy of ‘rule or ruin,’ the Devil and his demons are determined to bring the earth and its inhabitants to ruin with them. Knowing that his time is short, the Devil has been using one of the key elements of human society under his control—big business—to promote a frenzied spirit of consumerism, which leads to depletion of natural resources and destruction of the environment worldwide, thus threatening humanity’s survival.—Revelation 11:18; 18:11-17.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the beginning of human history, the Devil’s thirst for power has also been reflected in politics and religion. The book of Revelation depicts political powers as wild beasts to whom the Devil has given “great authority.” It also describes the shameless alliance between politics and religion as disgusting spiritual adultery. (Revelation 13:2; 17:1, 2) Think of the oppression, enslavement, wars, and ethnic conflicts over the centuries that have resulted in the loss of millions of lives. Can anyone honestly say that the shocking and horrifying events that have tainted the pages of human history were the normal activity of humans? Or were they the result of manipulation by unseen wicked spirit forces?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Bible unmistakably identifies and unmasks the one who has been maneuvering human leaders and world powers. Whether consciously or not, human society reflects the personality of its ruler and his ‘rule or ruin’ policy. But for how long will humankind suffer under the Devil’s rulership?

             Yes, I'm aware that David "debunked" Flat Earth people, but we have to realize what role he plays here.
The truth we seek is much wider than Pizzagate/Satanism and people mustn't cherry pick what they like when it comes to Truth.
David surely knows that Flat Earth theory isn't a psyop, he surely knows it's been around for YEARS and that it has been backed with good scientific approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
             David calls himself 100% truther and sadly, most people think that he really is, BUT, he NEVER informed about TONS of new leads on Pizzagate.
He demonizes millions of FE people who have researched FE and Pizzagate topics for decades, it's really that obvious that he tries to label and divide people...

              How do you know it's not a psyop? When I told a friend about pizzagate they rolled their eyes and said "you're probably one of those flat earth guys too". If it didn't start as a psyop it sure ended up as one

               Well, if people really want to check the evedince about FE theory, it's all around us.
Not so long ago, it took me a solid three weeks of looking into what I used to think was total BS (Psyop). Then I came around.
No one can look into this for you, find out why so many people are wanting to share this information. It doesn't come easily if you think it's in competition with your other beliefs..
              </p>
              <p>
               People who call this a psyop have not put in the time on research and are unqualified at this moment to 'debunk' this.
That's why I'm sure David Seaman 'the truther' is playing a shill role and his timing is quite telling.

PG researchers moods to elevate and researching slows/stops...
AJ and DS make big online info moves then disappear...
Podesta camp becomes all but done for...
Last second "fact" shows that big names are innocent just before an "atrocity" occurs...
PG research blamed for misinformation &amp; Tied to election... 
Trump impeached...
Hillary instated...
Fake news and Pizzagate become grounds to pass anti-first amendment legislature.

            Talking about blue aliens and adrenochrome is not the best way to get out the message of child trafficking and ritual abuse.  And he shouldn't keep tweeint that Podesta is a paedophile.  There's no hard evidence and until a judge or jury convicts him, it has to be assumed he's innocent.

Pls don't expect anything from this guy.
He brings this Flat Earth/Alien/Antarctica subject for suspicious reasons and he NEVER informed on new leads on Pizzagate.

             The problem is, he hasn't... In a completely unrelated podcast - Jo Rogan and Alex Jones (who I cannot stand) brought up the exact same things... Far too specific to be a coincidence...
            </p>
            <p>
             Let alone David Icke (who I also cannot stand), who has been ridiculed for SO LONG about all the "crazy" shit he came out with - turns out there could be a lot of truth in his claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             To the uninitiated, this all looks unconnected and messy - therefore David Seaman is crazy and has "taken all the pills". However, he hasn't - he has just come to the same conclusion that many have - ALL of these outlandish conspiracies are one and the same, 100% connected - governed by the same people and for the same means.
            </p>
            <p>
             It sounds crazy, yes. It sounds stupid, yes. But cast aside your "OH THAT DOESN'T EXIST" attitude and look at the connections... Stupid and outlandish, perhaps... But connections like that do not come from the "ether".

              law of one, hidden hand insider post, primer fields on youtube, nasim haramein and holofractal theory... I think when you get into this stuff its so far out there that it is hard to decern which direction to look. The idea of evolved consciousness groups existing in other dimensions, black vs evil, galactic federation. I mean this shit gets really crazy but the craziest thing about all of it is the the deeper into all the research you get, it comes full circle and things just kind of make sense. Whether you believe it or not is another story, but try to look at it from a number of different persepectives with a completely open mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just find it weird that I picked this as a username (forgot my old one when the first reddit exodus happened and made this when the pizzagate ban happened), and now all these big names are starting to drop variations of Icke's original reptialian/draconid/saturn cult shit in a way that they are finally understanding the deeper picture.
             </p>
             <p>
              The palaidians, venetians, etc. I mean this is like real-life religious science fiction. I recommend everyone follow their own path of research and what interests them. It's all connected and you will work your way around it all eventually.
             </p>
             <p>
              edit: not to mention when you look at all the old religious in an alegoric sense they all tell the same story of infinite energy/stillness becoming aware of itself and then wanting to experience itself. It's the first vibration in the sea of stillness that leads to all the various fractal permutations of energy that extend up and down from the point and form our realities. We are just little pieces of this consciousness network broken off in, using our simulators to generate a reality for us out of our dimension/resonance (so those computer simulation theories are correct, but we are the individual simulators) -- this is the observer effect. Our little simulator in our head collapses the infinite wave into a percieved moment/reality, over and over again, like a monitor with an infinitely fast refreshrate. This refreshrate is our base frequency that our 3 density dimension runs on. Everything is really just energy waves, its like that moment NEO becomes the one and sees the world in computer code. Actually reality is just empty space and energy, and our brains trick us into seeing this physical material world.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have this little theory that everything beyond the 3rd dimension is non-physical, and the only way to experience the true physical reality is to manifest in the 3rd density. This gives us a weirdly special place among the different dimensions. I can't quite figure out what sits under us in the 2nd density though, or if it even works like that. Do you need 3 to make up physical space and consciousness, and I know it doesn't work like 3D planes (x,y,z,time), but do things just get more complex as you move up? I love the whole H_H post about the different densities and the learning stage that goes on.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the hardest thing to accept in the hidden hand post is the talk about a harvest, and 2012 and that type of thing. He does say we wouldn't notice and continue living life normal. Maybe we all made it into the good version and we will see things get amazing from here on out.

              I don't like Alex so much either. Some parts do, some don't. He gets some things right and he DID some awesome shit with Bohemian Grove back in the day. But over all he's just too grazy to listen very long.
