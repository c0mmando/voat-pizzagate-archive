             All you need is a eml viewer. Once you have a eml viewer of your choice (something like Microsoft Outlook), just open the application, browse and open the folder that contains the extracted files from the download. You have to extract the files before you view them, then save them to whatever folder you choose, and then you can open your eml viewer and see the emails in their proper format. Depending on what application you choose to view them will play the role on how advanced you can search through all of the emails. (I will not recommend a eml viewer to avoid people shitposting on my personal choice on which one I have chosen)
            </p>
            <p>
             Just perform a quick Google search and you will find several eml viewing applications you can choose from to view the files/emails.
