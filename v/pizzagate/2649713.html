What they didn\'t seem to catch though was the pedo symbolism that was also on display.</p>
<p>The screenshot they used was to point out how one of the Olsens had earrings symbolizing &quot;Illuminati pyramids&quot; (a bit of a stretch imo), but what\'s obviously a much bigger deal is the huge &quot;heart-within-heart&quot; symbol that she had on her necklace (symbolizing &quot;girl love&quot;). Here it is:</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5t9b.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5t9b.png</a></p>
<p>This seems pretty goddamn blatant to me, and it made me curious...what other pedo symbolism is there in Full House? Well it turns out there\'s a SHIT TON of disturbing pedo symbolism/references all over the place.</p>
<p>Here\'s another screenshot, showing how two of the girls also &quot;heart-within-heart&quot; symbols for the headboard of their beds. And on top of that, you can see a poster on the wall with a bunch of butterflies in it (the butterfly is a common Illuminati symbol that symbolizes Monarch programming). You\'ll see more of this symbolism later:</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5t97.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5t97.png</a></p>
<p>I know it\'s hard to exactly tell if it\'s hearts in that shot, so here\'s another to confirm that the bed frames are definitely using this symbol:</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5t99.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5t99.png</a></p>
<p>Now this one is a little more shaky and less substantiated at this point, but I also believe that &quot;bunnies&quot; or &quot;bunny ears&quot; are also some sort of pedo-related/Illuminati symbol. Did anyone see how James Gunn had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jgunn/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=10152594717256157">an entire facebook album</a> devoted to creepy bunnies scaring children? I also recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/91fv1t/new_info_from_isaac_kappys_tweetstorm_macaulay/">saw this post</a> on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/greatawakening">/r/greatawakening</a> that went into Macualay Culkin\'s site called bunnyears.com, which is filled with all sorts of creepy pedo/satanic/Illuminati symbolism. So basically, I think that &quot;bunnies&quot; might be some important symbol that people have been overlooking.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I noticed that there was a bunny in this scene as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5t9a.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5t9a.png</a></p>
<p>Now this leads into what\'s likely the most disturbing pedo reference that I\'ve found. In this same scene from the screenshot above, Jessie goes in for a big hug with one of the Olsens, but the way they shoot it is creepy as hell and straight up makes it looks like he\'s raping her. I can\'t believe how fucked up this is, but you can see that at one point, they even make it look like she\'s doing an &quot;o-face&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5t9d.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5t9d.png</a></p>
<p>And for the most sick part, if you watch the clip on high volume, you can literally hear the actor who plays Jessie making sexual grunting noises as he goes in to &quot;hug&quot; her. They\'re simulating the rape of a young child right in front of everyone\'s faces, while the blissfully ignorant crowd sits and laughs along with it:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9lor0bBguRM?t=4m54s">https://youtu.be/9lor0bBguRM?t=4m54s</a></p>
<p>And here\'s another scene where Jessie straight up comes off like a child molester. The way he says &quot;our special relationship&quot; and &quot;I remember the first time I saw you&quot; sound like something you\'d say to a romantic interest, not your little niece for fucks sake. You can even get a sense of how genuinely creeped out she is too:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/KxroJHxw5Yw?t=5m57s">https://youtu.be/KxroJHxw5Yw?t=5m57s</a></p>
<p>It doesn\'t end there. Check it out, more heart-within-heart symbolism in the glasses (these glasses can also be found in the film &quot;Lolita&quot;):</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5t9w.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5t9w.png</a></p>
<p>Now for the full clip of the scene that follows this screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aSBBJA2pGZ4?t=1m">https://youtu.be/aSBBJA2pGZ4?t=1m</a></p>
<p>I think this whole scene is a fuckin wink and nod to the child abuse that goes on behind the scenes in the child acting/modeling world. In it we have a Jewish sounding photographer who\'s just unable to restrain herself from grabbing at a little girl\'s butt, while going &quot;Look at that little tooshie!&quot;...followed by: &quot;Mom!!! Do have to grab everyone\'s tooshie?&quot;. Mindblowing that they can openly throw disgusting, pedophilic shit like this into a show, and have no one notice or blink an eye.</p>
<p>Also, notice how they have the grandmother going to grab at her butt instead of the father? This is because people have an overwhelming association of pedophilia with older men. But when you have an older woman doing the same exact perverted thing, then it\'s so much easier to pass it off as just some sort of weird grandma thing, without people thinking twice about it.</p>
<p>And here\'s another clip with more bunny symbolism, and on top of that, a reference to Cleopatra (the Illuminati-types seem to love ancient Egyptian imagery):</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aSBBJA2pGZ4?t=1m48s">https://youtu.be/aSBBJA2pGZ4?t=1m48s</a></p>
<p>Another clip, with creepy Uncle Jessie again acting fucking way too intimate with someone who is in reality a STRANGER\'S KID:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aSBBJA2pGZ4?t=1m48s">https://youtu.be/aSBBJA2pGZ4?t=1m48s</a></p>
<p>Do you see how he sits her on his lap &quot;cowgirl style&quot; at one point, right by his crotch? All this stuff is kind of disturbing when you actually start looking at it through the proper lens. Jessie\'s interactions with Michelle just overall seem really suggestive, and even when nothing is explicitly &quot;wrong&quot; happening in the scene, their interactions just give me a vibe that something is &quot;off&quot;.</p>
<p>And yet again, here\'s some more bunny symbolism:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aSBBJA2pGZ4?t=6m40s">https://youtu.be/aSBBJA2pGZ4?t=6m40s</a></p>
<p>And some more butterfly symbolism:</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5taj.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5taj.png</a></p>
<p>And idk if anyone has <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1455737">read about</a> the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e2g3z/whats_with_the_podestas_and_red_shoes/">red shoe symbolism</a>, but here\'s a screenshot I feel might feature some of this symbolism as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5tbj.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5tbj.png</a></p>
<p>And this one might be a little thin, but figured I would post it. To me there\'s a something a bit creepy about this scene, as if it\'s some inside joke about how they treat kids like their slaves or something (plus there have been ppl who have come out and said they were locked in cages by certain celebrities/elites when they were children):</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/T_jH1nnejno?t=49s">https://youtu.be/T_jH1nnejno?t=49s</a></p>
<p>And here\'s another one that might seem thin, but I figure better to post it than not post it. To me there\'s just no good reason why they should have a little kid sticking a very phallic object so far into her mouth like this. Seems like they\'re purposely doing it to simulate a blowjob:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/T_jH1nnejno?t=3m53s">https://youtu.be/T_jH1nnejno?t=3m53s</a></p>
<p>Another bunny reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/T_jH1nnejno?t=4m36s">https://youtu.be/T_jH1nnejno?t=4m36s</a></p>
<p>Another butterfly reference. Also find it a bit weird that they call it a &quot;hairy worm&quot;, which seems like it could be referencing a penis, and then her sister says that &quot;if you kiss it, it\'ll turn into a handsome prince&quot;...</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/T_jH1nnejno?t=6m16s">https://youtu.be/T_jH1nnejno?t=6m16s</a></p>
<p>More butterfly symbolism (right above Jessie\'s head):</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5tc0.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5tc0.png</a></p>
<p>More red shoes:</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5tc1.png">http://magaimg.net/img/5tc1.png</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bgkTWL9YfsE?t=2m6s">https://youtu.be/bgkTWL9YfsE?t=2m6s</a></p>
<p>And here\'s another pretty obvious reference to pedophilia.....they have a little girl literally saying &quot;I\'ll party with them, but do I gotta rub em?&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lor0bBguRM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lor0bBguRM</a></p>
<p>WTFFFF</p>
<p>So that\'s everything I\'ve found for now, and keep in mind this is only from just a day\'s worth of browsing through random clips on youtube. It\'s just insane how cavalier these Hollywood sickos have been about their abuse of children, they really thought they\'d just be able to sweep this shit under the rug without anyone catching on.</p>
<p>Little did they know how powerful the internet would become, and how something pizzagate/pedogate would be able blow up the way it has. Their hubris will be their downfall!! Start digging more into some of these older kids/family shows, as their goal is to corrupt everything young, wholesome, and decent, and to subtly push their sick shit on an unassuming and impressionable audience.</p>',

           Now this one is a little more shaky and less substantiated at this point, but I also believe that "bunnies" or "bunny ears" are also some sort of pedo-related/Illuminati symbol. Did anyone see how James Gunn had

            an entire facebook album
           </a>
           devoted to creepy bunnies scaring children? I also recently
           <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/91fv1t/new_info_from_isaac_kappys_tweetstorm_macaulay/">
            saw this post

            /r/greatawakening
           </a>
           that went into Macualay Culkin's site called bunnyears.com, which is filled with all sorts of creepy pedo/satanic/Illuminati symbolism. So basically, I think that "bunnies" might be some important symbol that people have been overlooking.
          </p>
          <p>
           So with that in mind, I noticed that there was a bunny in this scene as well:
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5t9a.png">

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Now this leads into what's likely the most disturbing pedo reference that I've found. In this same scene from the screenshot above, Jessie goes in for a big hug with one of the Olsens, but the way they shoot it is creepy as hell and straight up makes it looks like he's raping her. I can't believe how fucked up this is, but you can see that at one point, they even make it look like she's doing an "o-face":

          </p>
          <p>
           And for the most sick part, if you watch the clip on high volume, you can literally hear the actor who plays Jessie making sexual grunting noises as he goes in to "hug" her. They're simulating the rape of a young child right in front of everyone's faces, while the blissfully ignorant crowd sits and laughs along with it:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           And here's another scene where Jessie straight up comes off like a child molester. The way he says "our special relationship" and "I remember the first time I saw you" sound like something you'd say to a romantic interest, not your little niece for fucks sake. You can even get a sense of how genuinely creeped out she is too:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           It doesn't end there. Check it out, more heart-within-heart symbolism in the glasses (these glasses can also be found in the film "Lolita"):

          <p>
           Now for the full clip of the scene that follows this screenshot:

           I think this whole scene is a fuckin wink and nod to the child abuse that goes on behind the scenes in the child acting/modeling world.

           Do you see how he sits her on his lap "cowgirl style" at one point, right by his crotch? All this stuff is kind of disturbing when you actually start looking at it through the proper lens. Jessie's interactions with Michelle just overall seem really suggestive, and even when nothing is explicitly "wrong" happening in the scene, their interactions just give me a vibe that something is "off".
          </p>
          <p>
           And yet again, here's some more bunny symbolism:

           And some more butterfly symbolism:

           And idk if anyone has
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1455737">
            read about

            red shoe symbolism
           </a>
           , but here's a screenshot I feel might feature some of this symbolism as well:

          </p>
          <p>
           And this one might be a little thin, but figured I would post it. To me there's a something a bit creepy about this scene, as if it's some inside joke about how they treat kids like their slaves or something (plus there have been ppl who have come out and said they were locked in cages by certain celebrities/elites when they were children):
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           And here's another one that might seem thin, but I figure better to post it than not post it. To me there's just no good reason why they should have a little kid sticking a very phallic object so far into her mouth like this. Seems like they're purposely doing it to simulate a blowjob:
          </p>

           Another bunny reference:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Another butterfly reference. Also find it a bit weird that they call it a "hairy worm", which seems like it could be referencing a penis, and then her sister says that "if you kiss it, it'll turn into a handsome prince"...
          </p>

          <p>
           More butterfly symbolism (right above Jessie's head):

          </p>
          <p>
           And here's another pretty obvious reference to pedophilia.....they have a little girl literally saying "I'll party with them, but do I gotta rub em?":

           So that's everything I've found for now, and keep in mind this is only from just a day's worth of browsing through random clips on youtube. It's just insane how cavalier these Hollywood sickos have been about their abuse of children, they really thought they'd just be able to sweep this shit under the rug without anyone catching on.
          </p>
          <p>
           Little did they know how powerful the internet would become, and how something pizzagate/pedogate would be able blow up the way it has. Their hubris will be their downfall!! Start digging more into some of these older kids/family shows, as their goal is to corrupt everything young, wholesome, and decent, and to subtly push their sick shit on an unassuming and impressionable audience.

            Wow, alot of work here.  I dont mean to.take away from.the seriousness of this symbolism but there also.seems to be an element of trendiness,  fashionista,  manufacturers making this crap for.people to wear in order to be hip or rebellious.  Is there really.a demand for such products?  Who are the designers, the marketing staff pushing this stuff?  I would like to be a fly on the wall of some corporate meetings  wherein this apparel is being evaluated.

            I'm laughing my ass off. If you wanted to talk about the bunny connection you missed the big plot arc of the bunny picture given to Uncle Jesse by Michelle as he is leaving. So yeah, that small miniscule bunny is a bit of a stretch. Also those bed frames were the style back then. It was about as common as Ikea is now....so in 20 years are a bunch of internet south's going to accuse us of being pedos because of our Ikea furnature?

            In that clip with Uncle Jesse and the recorder.  Look how Stamos holds the recorder right at crotch level for no reason, it's blatantly a dick.  Then he shoots the "gum" onto Michelle's face.  I wonder what rhymes with gum.  Can't make this stuff up.

            You are doing quite far-fetched conclusions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like for example, you cannot even see if the headboard of the bed is heart-shaped. You are just assuming it is?
           </p>
           <p>
            Butterfly's and hearts are universal symbols and found everywhere so they don't proof anything. They could implicate somethin sinister ofc if those are common theme on the show.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say keep digging, and maybe you'll find something more conclusive.

             Ya, I'm looking at the links and not getting strong sick to my stomach feelings, more oh cute.  It was a sweet show, even though we know Saget is a pig.  What worries me, is can we even smile at a baby in the grocery store anymore without looking like a freak or scaring the parent to death?

            Wow great detective work! I believe it Bob Saget is a dirty bastard he is known for his dirty jokes. And the producer Jeff Franklin was recently fired by Netflix from the Fuller House reboot show for sexually harassing women on his staff. When they did the old show I think all the producers were very excited about all the young girls it was a pedophile playground for them. But I don't think they raped any of the girls it would have leaked by now I think they just used the symbolism like your many clips and photos indicate they did.

            In the newest seasons on Netflix the chick who plays Kimmy is wearing pizza related sweaters and earrings in a bunch of scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also there’s one scene where the young girl is like “Please, daddy, can I dance with you?” In a way that just screamed OMFG that’s a pedi writer who wrote that in just to be able to jerk off to it later.
