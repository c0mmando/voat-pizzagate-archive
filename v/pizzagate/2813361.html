<p>&quot;Nigeria’s top intelligence agency warned that Chinese drug makers might be smuggling medicine “containing human remains from fetuses, infants, and flesh” into the country, prompting lawmakers to launch an investigation on Wednesday, <a href="https://allafrica.com/stories/201810250357.html">the local Guardian newspaper reported</a>.</p>
<p>The Guardian quoted a recent memo from the African country’s National Intelligence Agency (NIA) as cautioning Nigerians:</p>
<p>&quot;The South Korean Customs Service on September 30, 2018, revealed that it had seized 2,751 Chinese drugs/capsules, containing human remains from fetuses, infants and flesh imported into the country by some Chinese nationals. It stressed that the making of the human remain drugs and consuming them are crimes against humanity, which can also lead to serious health challenges.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/10/son-confirms-human-flesh-in-chinese-drugs/">Nigeria’s Vanguard newspaper</a> learned that the NIA also learned from South Korea that the Chinese capsules also contained “18.7 billion viruses, including hepatitis B.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Nigerian lawmakers adopted a measure ordering authorities to identify and arrest the persons behind the alleged gruesome trade.</p>
<p>Officials from the Nigerian committees on health services; women affairs and social development; information; national orientation; and ethics and values are expected to work on the investigation with the Nigeria Customs Service (NIS), the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the NIA.</p>
<p>Nigerian lawmakers approved the motion to investigate, sponsored by Johnson Agbonayinma from Edo, by unanimous consent.</p>
<p>Agbonayinma described the allegation as a crime against humanity, “which can also lead to serious health challenges,” the Cable reported.</p>
<p>“If immediate measures are not taken to stem the influx of these drugs and the illegal importers, it will continue to endanger the lives of citizens,” he added.</p>
<p>The Guardian acknowledges:</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the first time China has been in the eye of the storm over its exports. In 2007, Panamanian Eduardo Arias discovered that toothpaste sold in his country was labeled as containing Diethylene glycol (DEG), the same ingredient that had tainted cough syrup and killed 138 Panamanians in 2006. Panamanian officials discovered the toothpaste came from China and initiated a global response.&quot;</p>
<p>Authorities have also accused China of making drugs from babies in the past, Vanguard noted.</p>
<p>“In 2011, Chinese officials launched investigations into the production of drugs made from dead fetuses,” the newspaper noted on October 19. “The capsules were disguised as stamina boosters and some people believe them to be a panacea for disease.”</p>
<p>China lacks clear standards and guidelines for drug manufacturers, Yazan Saleh, associate analyst at Decision Resources Group in Canda, told the Guardian.</p>
<p>“In recent years, more regulations have been put in place but the question of enforcement of these remains a challenge,” he declared.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) confirms human flesh in Chinese drugs:</strong>  <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/10/son-confirms-human-flesh-in-chinese-drugs/https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/10/son-confirms-human-flesh-in-chinese-drugs/">https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/10/son-confirms-human-flesh-in-chinese-drugs/https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/10/son-confirms-human-flesh-in-chinese-drugs/</a></p>
<p>&quot;Investigations revealed that the capsules were filled with powdered flesh from dead babies. </p>
<p>They were made in North Eastern China from babies whose bodies were chopped into small pieces and dried on stoves before being turned into powder.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>From a 2012 article about a South Korean documentary on the subject:  <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/chinese-pharma-companies-accused-of-selling-pills-made-from-dead-babies/">http://naturalsociety.com/chinese-pharma-companies-accused-of-selling-pills-made-from-dead-babies/</a></p>
<p>&quot;According to the documentary, Chinese hospitals and abortion clinics give stillborns and aborted babies to drug companies, but <strong>reports suggest that some of these remains even come from China’s infamous “dying rooms.” These are places in which babies are left intentionally to perish</strong> when families cannot—or, for the legal limit of having only one child lest a fee or even a physical beating be incurred by officials, will not—raise them. Chinese hospitals perform about 13 million abortions annually to keep its enormous population in check.&quot;</p>',

            OF COURSE  Chinese drugs contain fetal parts!    It is  well known  that    MMR    HEP A  and other vaccines contain  human DNA/RNA  material.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is how they are  MADE.      And the CDC   "recommends"  that every single  child  (and now adults)   have it  INJECTED into them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry about the caps.   It really pisses me off that people are so shocked by this.     It is common knowledge and    anyone   can search   FDA  website  for a vaccine ingredient list  and      read  it.     But do they?

            Reminds me of the chinese horror film "Dumplings" I've only seen the "Three extremes" version. Horrific. Truth in fiction, from 2004.

              Deeply chilling.  Some of this is likely taken from a "shock art" exhibit by Zhu Yu:

             <p>
              "Yu's most famous piece of conceptual art, titled "Eating People," was performed at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000. It consisted of him cooking and eating what is alleged to be a human fetus. The picture, circulated on the internet via e-mail in 2001, provoked investigations by both the FBI and Scotland Yard. It was intended as "shock art"."

              I agree.  I have been so busy I meant to find if any of that stuff got into our country.  They inspect very little of what comes in.  Fish and meat I think only a small part is inspected.  They slap a US Inspector's Label on it and that's it.  I heard that some companies in a certain field are looking at bring their jobs back from China.  We need to tighten our ports.  And our Adoption Agencies.

            I probably should have posted this earlier, but here it is again for this community. Do not eat any hot dogs. Vegan, not alright. Sausages made by a local butcher is probably OK, if you trust the supplier. If I made a post about this, it would damage the entire meat industry in the USA, and that is not fair. I am waiting for the time to be right, for people to regurgitate from the mere thought.

             Yuck.  We get our meat from a very reliable local butcher.  I am very careful.  Used to get some meat from Whole Foods but now I don't trust it since Bezos took over.  I never eat pork either.  They are pushing pork down everyone's throat for a reason, imo. The other white meat?   Pigs, Pig Farms, Remember?  No way.

              Don't get too paranoid about it. Just be aware. I am not going to give up swine because of some bad practice. I might be a bit spoiled in that we have wild Iberians running wild in case the store runs out. I was talking about hot dogs in general. Chicken, turkey,other urban roadkill, swept up cockroaches dead from insecticides mixed with corn syrup, bugs from Malaysia? You know, hot dogs.

               Yeah, I get those at the butcher shop too.  The best ever.  All my meat there now.  No Costco or grocery meat.  We give up a lot to do that. No more movies or cable.

                I would personally kill something with a 1984 Eagle and put it in a blender before you eat one of those hot dogs. It is not safe for you and yourn.

                 Believe me I have known them personally for decades.  They are friends of the family and well trusted.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for our meat because I know exactly what you mean.  I have tried to talk to others about their meat.  Must be very careful with meat and dairy.

            It therefore mandated its committees on Health Services, Women Affairs and Social Development, Information, National Orientation, and Ethics and Values to interface with officials of the Nigeria Customs Service (NIS), the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the NIA, to look into the matter.

            Do you know if a NSFW Tag is needed?  There is no way to avoid getting ill while reading this post.  Unfortunately this is a side affect from doing our work.  The YT videos may be even worse.  I will not be able to watch either way, but I am sure others with stronger stomachs will.  Thank You for posting this.  This is horrid stuff but I will read all of it.

             Sorry carmencita,  but if you knew what US doctors were injecting into our children  every day,  you  would  throw up    as I did when I found out.
            </p>
            <p>

                . It has been my understanding that we can't create more flairs, but Vindicator will know.

                 I'd say the headline gives enough information that neither flair is truly necessary. I'm hesitant to cultivate a parental atmosphere in here...this is Voat, after all. We're going to invite trolling by marauding goats if we do Redditty stuff like that.

                  I'd say the 'NSFW' flair is necessary here, as an additional warning. I don't see a 'parental atmosphere' established here by flairing, Vin. ;-P :

                   "Trigger Warning" would definitely be considered parental moderation by most of Voat.

                    I was talking specifically about the current 'NSFW' flair, Vin. The sidebar rules say that NSFW must be labeled as such (from my understanding no matter whether the headline already gives hints about the content or not).
