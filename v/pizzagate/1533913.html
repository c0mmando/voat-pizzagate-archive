<p>Fresh pervert meat to have a look into.</p>
<p>Let\'s start with everyone\'s favourite creepy uncle Joe Biden -- a self professed &quot;devout Roman Catholic&quot;. Wouldn\'t it be a strange coincidence if his diocese just happened to be infamous for rampant child sex abuse?</p>
<p>Guess what? It is! This creepy diocese had to pay out so many compensations to victims of pedo rape by their priests that it had to declare bankruptcy! Joe Biden\'s own diocese.</p>
<p>130 victims came forward. Doesn\'t seem to bother creepy Joe Biden though.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/KhW7M">http://archive.is/KhW7M</a></p>
<p>Just to keep the creepiness going, the diocese he was raised in -- also multiple pedo rape cases against their priests. As we know it is common for abuse victims to become abusers themselves. Could this be what happened with Joe Biden? Wouldn\'t be surprising.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/GyvWZ">http://archive.is/GyvWZ</a></p>
<p>But hey... why stop there?</p>
<p>Obama\'s appointment for <em>SAFE SCHOOLS</em> was a homosexual who strongly advocated homosexual propaganda in schools, advised a 15 year old who was sexually abused by some old creep at a bus stop &quot;just use a condom&quot;, rather than reporting his statutory rape. He also said his major inspiration was prominent Pedophile Harry Hay</p>

<p>While we\'re at it ... one more Democrat pedophile.
Democratic Senate Aid, Mike McHaney, who worked on John Kerry\'s campaign, was also arrested for attempted child sexual exploitation in 2007</p>

<p>Finally, yet another Democrat senator who has a propensity for underage children. While perhaps not as heinous as the pre teens favoured, it seems, by Podesta/Alefantis and co., definitely pretty creepy.</p>

<p>And, finally. When Barack Obama was in Hawaii, he inexplicably loved spending time at the USMC Marine Base in Honolulu, visiting it 12 times in one vacation alone, and again two years before.</p>

<p>Guess who happened to be in charge of the base at that time? Any guesses? Nope?
Just another convicted Pedophile, Col. Robert Rice -- the guy pictured laughing with Obama in the second article. Just a coincidence, no doubt.
Keep on digging, friends, we\'re getting closer and closer.</p>',

            Ask him what he thinks, and why, about all sorts of things. If you can get him talking, it might shed light on your inklings. good luck. I can imagine he doesn't want to incriminate his friends, that's how this all grows, so stick to generalizations.

            That is really upsetting. Is your son in a fraternity or social club? That is what Kay Griggs said is where this happens, and in ROTC, anal and oral in coffins...  Those who participate become "rising stars" and are protected. She also said that for some groups (navy seals), a wet operation is an initiation rite. I think this is true of street gangs too.

            Agreed. He seems to have a seething anger and it is my belief that he was abused as a child by older men-Davis for instance. I think he is a puppet who had a dark past and was groomed to push a agenda under the cover of racism.

            I guess I always have trouble believing that someone who can laugh (especially at himself) can be the villain. He has class and a great deal of charisma. I can believe that he is being controlled but I listen to him and think, yep he is a good guy (even if he gets it wrong sometimes).
           </p>
           <p>
            So no it is not that I still believe his promises. It is that I listen to him and still believe that he is good or at least wanted to do good.
           </p>
           <p>
            With Podesta and Hillary and others I can see through their BS and see how selfish and cold they are.

              The homosexual and kenyan part does not make him bad. In fact I am sure that there are a number of crackheads that are nice people. I don't get a vibe of evil off of him but dearly want to make sure that my evil detector ain't broke.

            Yeah I agree. I see myself more paranoid now. I have always been protective but now I hardly trust anyone with my kids. There is no way in hell I would put my child in a daycare now. I don't trust organizations and charities trying to help with orphans and stuff either. When I was 12 and 13, I had 2 family members and my dads best friend do bad things to me so I know pedos are common.  But, it's far worse than I ever thought.

            I've got three different things I've written archiving code for, the Voat bot, an irc bot, and a script to archive all links on a given site. The irc bot's archives are failing on two different servers while an irc bot written by someone else running on the second server can still archive without issue.

            About Obama..
           </p>
           <p>
            I've studied psychology and personality disorders a lot. I've always been fascinated about what makes someone's brain tick. This is why I think Obama is acting so weird lately.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is very Narcissistic. He NEEDS attention. He NEEDS to be praised. Narcissists can't stand losing or humiliation. (Oh gosh, Putin mocking him after Obama tried to "punish him for hacking" was priceless!) The best way to handle a narcissist trying to get under your skin is to not let it show it bothered you. They want the reaction. He wants to step on a nerve and make someone else look weak. He wants to piss Trump off so that Trump will blow up on Twitter and cause people to mock him and say he doesn't have the right temperament to be president.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Obama is saying that he would have beat Trump if he ran against him, by him blaming everyone else for Hillary's loss, him never taking responsibility for anything, and him saying how he thinks most Americans like the direction he's going in is all him trying to manipulate you into believing him. Narcissists believe they are smarter than others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Narcissistic people do not have compassion or empathy.  They do not have the ability to truly love. That's the perfect person to be into Satanic ritual abuse. Remember this...All serial killers are Narcissists, but not all narcissists are serial killers. I'm not saying that he's a serial killer. I'm just saying that narcissists can be truly dangerous.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama trying to sabotage Trump right now is him trying to show how powerful he is. He CANNOT STAND that his Obamacare legacy ended up being a failure. For him to see that Trump is already making good changes and being praised for how well he's doing so far, and people are now voicing how much Obama has screwed things up in the last 8 years, is likely sending him over the deep end. So many globalists counted on him and he failed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want him to just keep trying to prove how great he's been and talking about himself so that he can make a fool out of himself even more while he's on his Fuck You Tour. He said in an interview that Fox made him look bad. Well every other network attacked Trump and he still won.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said he's proud of how he hasn't had any scandal within his administration in his 8 years in office. Who does he think he's kidding?! This a a great article about it. It goes on to list 25 scandals he's had and describes them in detail here LOL!!i I love it.

            The dmca thing is prolly the archive.is dev implementing a new anti-bot feature. It's happening even on Voat links.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does make me feel kinda special, though. I run another bot someone else wrote and it archives fine, but everything with my archiving code is failing -w-

            I'm pretty sure that him being gay (if he was) and enjoying drugs (if he does) is not much of a concern compared to the average overachiever.

            Yes, and it seems everyone wants their kids to be admitted to Harvard before they are out of Kindergarten. Its a control freak manifestation of the parents ego and a disregard for raising a child to become their own person. Of course social values and the concept that unless you are a billionaire you don't matter reinforces this. Its basically psychological abuse on a different level.

            I like your submission. About 1.5 years ago (before I woke up) I wondered, 'why is Obama so passionate about LGBT causes'? I started with his religious followings, Catholic/Muslim in Singapore, Christian in Chicago at United Church of Christ. It is interesting that the children's Sunday school curriculum is very favorable to alternative life styles. Then I stumbled upon George Soros the Jewish lobby and their similar philosophies. I then started following the money and realized, we have been lied to about a lot of things, and that it is possible George Washington did not chop down a cherry tree.  Note: Not against the Jews, just the ones who pretend to be Jew.

            I was never swayed by Obama.  In 2008 I started investigating his alleged birth certificate issue (which has since been proven 100% a forgery). I wrote to the Supreme Court about my concerns, as many Americans did.  It was followed up about a week later with the IRS asking a lot of investigative questions.  I could not prove it at the time, but felt strongly that the two actions were linked (now we know how corrupt the IRS has proven to be, particularly after certain groups or individuals).  I'm not a psychologist, but i saw through his personality disorders as well.  In my view he has a Multiple Personality Disorder, he shape shifts like the wind.  I've never seen true sincerity from him, no real empathy.  I suspect he may have been a victim himself.  That is what SRA (Sadistic Ritualistic Abuse) does, it causes the developing brain to dissociate or split off, and then can become easily programmed.  If it is true, that Frank Davis Marshall is Obama's biological father, and he turned Obama onto gay sex as a young teen, and God knows what happened to him before then, one can see how Obama would be so fucked up in his worldview.  Personally, I disdain this fabricated fraud of I don't know what as a #POTUS, and I will only be happy once he and his pedophile protecting criminal administration are brought to full justice for their shocking crimes!!!

            This is awesome. I knows dems are currently easier cause they've been in power, but if you could find literally just this much on republicans I'm sure it'd convince a lot of people it is non partisan. Bringing up Dennis hastert just isn't enough to convince people in my experience. Just a suggestion. It'd show people are willing to not just make obvious connections and actually sift thru I think. I don't really do my own research so obviously I'm not one to tell you what to do.

            check for yourself.  defamatory law breaking posts against me (and other threats and calls to violence on voat not on me) do not get dealt with.  thus people are free to break u.s. law on voat rendering the user agreement null and void.

            Please watch the video, it is very long, but Kay Griggs explains how boys are chosen as early as high school to be "rising stars", and initiation rituals are used to control them and weed out those who cannot be controlled. The military, judiciary, state department etc are all infiltrated by this tactic.

            I have been wondering WTF could be going with Obama since his first meeting with Trump.  His behavior was strange indeed.  I have only been able to perceive his mannerisms as that of someone who was extremely scared, something I have not seen from Obama until now.  Obamas behavior has only become stranger as time goes by, he is being submissive and defenseless although saying things which are suppose to convey the opposite.  I believe we witnessing the external breakdown of someone who is completely falling apart on the inside.

             <li>
              he is/was a heavy drug user.

            </ul>
            <p>
             deep/nasty state put him in power knowing he could easily be controlled. he didnt realize this till post benghazi. since then he has been "broken."

            You guys need to watch the Kay Griggs videos, this is a woman who was married to a high up chief of staff who was also an alcoholic who told her everything. All of the military high up is homo., the initiation rituals are rape/abuse. they target young people who become "rising stars" because they can control them. Its in every government department and all around the world. The videos are on youtube, they are long but completely relevant, it makes all of this so clear and simple to see how this massive infiltration has happened. Kay Griggs.

              I agree that Obama is a CIA creation, and further, I think that he may be the mind-controlled child of a Monarch mother.  Lurid photos of his blank-eyed mother posing for porno made her seem mind-controlled, not a slut as some have claimed.  Every time he acts up he goes to Hawaii, supposedly his home, but also where mind slaves go to be recalibrated.  No surprise that he visits the army base where it is done.  Additionally, they program child slaves there, so of course, Rice is a pedophile.

                   Well maybe he made a movie that involved some form of ritualistic abuse by a group of elites?

                  <p>
                   Yes indeed, you bet he made a movie about that, called 'Rosemarys Baby' and was filmed in 1968.

             I give Obama the benefit of the doubt after his hair turned white that maybe he is scared shitless and actually managed to manuever out of some things like the red line being crossed...he knows the truth and used republicans in congress to back out. If I want to go even further, he probably was on Bernie's side on the down low and in the end had to tell him they have everything in place and won't let him win. And if I want to take it further I've suspected Obama is in communication with Putin and told Trump he made sure he won and now it's all on him to take our country back from the shadow government and that's why he's hold up in Trump tower  while Obama and his family will be hold up in that DC house Podesta is making them stay at so they are still controlled.

              Obama has the best make up crew money can buy...there is such a thing as hair dye.  His hair is the exact color his image artists want it to be.

              that would explain the look on donalds face after he met with obama for the first time, to be honest trump looked scared shitless, and if the conversation youre alluding too actually took place between obama and trump that would explain those photos of trump looking like he'd seen a ghost.

              I think "Hot dog stand in Hawaii" and "Dominos on pizza" etc from the leaks were referring to Podesta blackmailing Obama. I don't think he is "evil" per se, but I think he has been suckered into it, and is now so far in he can't get out. Wickedness through cowardice and existing dirt (homosexual, drug user, fake ID) rather than through true malevolence.

              When he starting whining that he could have beat Trump. And then said it again. And then got into listing his achievments at press conferences. I thought, oh this guy is losing his cool in a pathethic and desperate way I haven't seen before, and I thought oh he's covering for somerhing and his true colors are coming out,

               I also thought he looked completely demoralized at the presser. And I thought the woman's medical issue was a convenient distraction, I mean I hope she is okay, but if you weren't feeling well wouldn't you leave room a lot sooner instead of passing out in a presidential press conference?

               Interesting, I hadn't noticed but I've been staying away from the news a bit lately! I just felt annoyed that so many people I know are completely charmed by him and that he IS charming, but I keep having to remind them all that "one may smile, and smile, and be a villain."

             I cannot seem to post anything without the mods deleting my quality work. I just want a general consensus on what everybody is thinking about the mods. I think they are compromised or most of them.

              I feel the same way, the interaction I have had with the mods has been hostile and aggressive.  I think we are losing a lot of valuable information, nothing but spam should be deleted period. I wish
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
               r/pizzagate
              </a>
              was still around, the energy was far more productive and positive (in terms of solving this sick web).   It's safe to assume, anyone who is on voat investigating pizzagate, is doing so in a serious meaningful manner.   The majority of us are meticulous, and probe all the posts/comments, as to not miss vital info etc.  QUIT with all the bloody micromanaging; let the votes decipher what's pertinent.

              Can you give an example of your quality work that was deleted? Maybe reply it to this comment here, because mods are not allowed to delete comments.

              I genuinely don't think they are compromised. They delete things because it is SO important that this sub remains credible, so that outsiders visiting aren't put off by anything that clearly has no evidence or sources, or anything that could come across as crazy or racist (i.e. giving the MSM the option to cherry pick those posts to support their narrative that Pizzagate is just a bunch of insane hateful racist 'alt-right' trolls)  or anything that is irrelevant or could take up space on the front page  that could otherwise be filled by some detailed, evidenced and damning research. Basically, it's to ensure that when outsiders visit for the first time, there is the highest chance possible that they will come away knowing Pizzagate is real.
             </p>
             <p>
              Because the MSM isn't covering this, this sub is one of the main sources of information and compiled research on Pizzagate, therefore it is one of the main places people are directed to if they don't know much about it or have expressed doubt. It's therefore crucial that the front page is kept as full of the most relevant and well-evidenced posts. It's also important for investigators, to be able to quickly see posts that will help with their investigation,w without having to sift through all kinds of stuff. Meta posts or questions or posts speculating without citing any evidence, or posts saying 'it was the Jews!!' all detract from these main aims of the sub.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's why there are other subverses for those purposes. What the mods are doing is actually making it more likely that Pizzagate will be taken seriously, and more likely that people directed here will go away knowing the truth and hopefully spreading the word to the people they know. I think hey are doing a great job, and it's a shame that people seem to misunderstand the purpose of the deletions. The rules are clear, and the majority of people here have no problem with the rules!
             </p>
             <p>
              Personally I think it would be better to have several flairs for the different topics instead of different subverses because it seems not many people visit the other subs, but that was decided against.
