<p>I have found a historical precedent to Comet Ping Pong -- an 18th century occult club that lured politicians, lobbyists and ambassadors into a web of blood ritual, orgies, sorcerers and mind control. And its main figure, Germaine de Staël, was not only connected to major American diplomats, but also to a <strong>mysterious building in Switzerland that Tony Podesta seems to be visiting today</strong>. Given their current relationship with ambassadors and actual nobility, it is highly plausible that the Podesta brothers and James Alefantis are involved in the same type of operation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p>During the French Revolution, several notable figures at the highest seats of power in Switzerland and France played decisive roles in overthrowing Louis XVI and guillotining the royal family. It\'s worth knowing that Soros-type bankers still lorded over Europe at the time--after all, this was the age of Rothschild. Jacques Neckar, from Switzerland, was one such rival and became a finance minister under Louis XVI for France. During the revolution, he barely managed to hold France together, but according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Necker">Wikipedia</a>, he also helped spark one of the bloodiest days of the Revolution: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Necker\'s dismissal on 11 July 1789, provoked by his decision not to attend Louis XVI\'s speech to the Estates-General, enraged the people of France and sparked rumors that the king meant to attack Paris or arrest the deputies. These fears provoked the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there\'s so much more to this. His daughter, Germaine de Staël, was a gifted writer and power player in the French Salons. She would end up being one of Napoleon\'s sworn enemies as she tried to subvert his power on several occasions. She was also married to the Swedish ambassador in France. While still young, she ran her own salon in Paris with the ambassador, and they quickly gained a reputation as <strong>being a hotspot for the actual Illuminati and Swedenborgian Cult</strong>. Quotes from the book &quot;Mistress to an Age: A Life of Madame de Stael&quot; reveal she was known to the American political elite as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Germaine’s salon in the rue du Bac had become a political meeting place for the liberal aristocracy which soon was to carry out the first phase of the Revolution. Gouverneur Morries, a frequent guest, described Germaine to George Washington as “a woman of wonderful wit, and above prejudices of every kind,” and her house as a temple of Apollo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence also suggests that the Illuminati/Swedenborgians, were involved in some bizarre sorcerer deep-state activities, as we see now with Jimmy Savile, Michael Aquino and the Podestas\' vampiric pizza activities. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Monsieur de Stael] had also turned to the Swedenborgian sect, was deeply involved in the mysticism of the Illuminati, and indulged in conjuring spirits...In the Age of Reason, at at the court of the enlightened despot Gustavus, two opposed schools of sorcerers and soothsayers were engaged in secret and mortal combat. King Gustavus’ clairvoyant, Miss Arfwedsson, whose oracle he consulted on every important occasion, was all-powerful, but she was decidedly outnumbered by the soothsayers who surrounded the King’s brother, Duke Charles of Sudermania, for whom they predicted a glorious future. Most influential among them was the Duke’s friend, Baron Reuterholm, who, before witnesses, had put the <strong>Duke into a hypnotic trance to make him prophesy the role he was to play in the regeneration of Mankind</strong>.</p>
<p>Baron de Stael already had attached to his embassy a Swedenborgian named Halldin, whose specialty it was to make spirits appear in mirrors (he thus produced John the Baptist) and <strong>to read the future in books stained with blood</strong>. Under Reuterholm’s influence these innocent pastimes took a more serious turn. </p>
<p>At one of the seances held in 1790 in Stael’s presence, a medium revealed that Duke Chatlr was “in possession of the truth itself” and that Reuterholm be his only instrument…”Mention of the King was also made; what has been said concerning His Majesty is of great interest but of such a nature that I dare not trust it to my pen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>They were literally performing mind control and hypnosis to major political figures to help them carry political goals.</strong> This is congruent with allegations of both the CIA and Globalists blackmailing VIP pedophiles to further their aim. What\'s also interesting is that Le Bac was a favorite among lobbyists, and was actually known to court the most powerful American diplomats at the time. Staël met Jefferson, Washington, Adams; but what\'s most interesting is that Madame de Staël is (1) in such an identical position to American socialite James Alefantis, who frequently courts ambassadors from his art functions. Think I\'m exaggerating? <a href="http://www.transformerdc.org/special-events/diplomatic-chair/transformer-11th-annual-silent-auction-and-benefit-party">Here he is hosting the Swedish ambassador.</a> Another Transformer event was even held at the French embassy, and Alefantis has helped organize events with <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1530742">actual French nobility</a>. History repeats itself, and there\'s even MORE proof.</p>
<p>In some amazing coincidence, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1318076_bawl-of-whacks-.html">Stratfor leaks actually indicate that Tony Podesta was subscribing to Stratfor from a property in Lausanne.</a> Turns out, he\'s actually connected to Lausanne through his family and through the art world: Several pieces by Giovanni Battista Podesta, one of the purported &quot;founders&quot; of Art Brut, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160817013327/http://www.artbrut.ch/fr/21004/1022/auteurs/podesta--giovanni-battista">appear at the Collection Art Brut</a>, located in a castle in the town called Le Chateau Beaulieu. <a href="https://www.choisir.ch/arts-philosophie/theatre/item/download/298_60322ed8320e02a81899ee14d28a953f">He is a worshipper of Mammon</a>. If you want a better idea of what art brut is, <a href="http://artbrut.com/">please look here</a>. Art brut is essentially <a href="http://artbrut.com/about.shtml">&quot;trauma art&quot;</a>, where victims of trauma, including <strong>satanist abuse and pedophilia</strong>, paint their experiences.

Also, <a href="http://www.outsiderart.co.uk/noble.htm">abuse victim Kim Noble</a>\'s work is Art Brut. </p>
<p>We also know that Tony Podesta is connected to this Art Brut art movement for three reasons: (1) <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1561189">He opened the &quot;Art Blu&quot; café in Venice</a>, where he owns another property, (2) he owns countless paintings that are or could be deemed Art Brut and (3) <strong>James Alefantis is one of the biggest patrons of art brut on the East Coast, if not America</strong>. And the painters he helps showcase have painted <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160817013327/http://i.imgur.com/NcCrOhw.jpg">pedophilia</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160817013327/http://i.imgur.com/oc10aJ4.jpg">cumpandas</a> (Matt Sesow, the artist in question, appears to have been a regular at Comet Ping Pong). So what\'s the big deal with this castle that Podesta is secretly visiting?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>It\'s the old home of Jacques Neckar and Madame de Staël.</strong> Literal Illuminati members use to live there and held unimaginable financial power over Europe. Now Tony Podesta is directly involved with visiting the same property as one of the top--if not THE top American lobbyist--in the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>The group at the Chateau Beaulieu appears to be still tied to pedophilia.</strong> There is a call to the board at the bottom of the page to go on an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170210093523/http://www.artbrut.ch/en/21045/">excursion &quot;every leap year&quot;</a> to Sciacca in Sicily. It\'s the home of a sculpture garden and art brut <a href="http://www.artbrut.ch/en/21035/302/">artist pictured here</a>. Now it\'s owned by a vineyard called Strada Del Vino Terra Sicane. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170322164648/http://i.imgur.com/Lh5qQm9.jpg">This is their logo.</a> That logo is one we\'ve seen time and again--and yes I am going to make the case that Comet Ping Pong is far, far more than just a one-off fake news hoax.

            Great Post!  Wonder if the occult ties can be eventually tied to this monster:  Gilles de Rais  (warning don't read about him if triggering is an issue or just not wanting to read about one of the worst of the worst :(
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_de_Rais">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_de_Rais
            </a>
            Gilles de Montmorency-Laval (prob. c. September 1405 – 26 October 1440),[1] Baron de Rais, was a knight and lord from Brittany, Anjou and Poitou,[2] a leader in the French army, and a companion-in-arms of Joan of Arc. He is best known for his reputation and later conviction as a confessed serial killer of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            A member of the House of Montmorency-Laval, Gilles de Rais grew up under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather and increased his fortune by marriage. He earned the favour of the Duke of Brittany and was admitted to the French court. From 1427 to 1435, Gilles served as a commander in the Royal Army, and fought alongside Joan of Arc against the English and their Burgundian allies during the Hundred Years' War, for which he was appointed Marshal of France.

            very interesting stuff.....though my understanding of Swedenborg is that he was pretty much the opposite of the current Illuminati and on the side of truth, wisdom and love....I'll have to look into his influence on the French court though, as the elites do have a habit of taking such things and perverting them

            I'm sorry but the definition of Art Brut is not limited to "trama art".  Outsider art is produced by those who are not in the regular lines of establishment art communities such as academia, museums, galleries, known artists and collectors, commercial art - the "art world".   Outsider Art is how Art Brut translates, and that can be everyone from self-taught artists, folk artists, prisoners.  Yes it could include mental patients and those that have been traumatized but that is just one subset.   Maybe edit to reflect that a subset of Art Brut is trauma based therapy art.

            Otherwise an interesting body of work bringing in the historical side.

            The plot thickens. I am very intrigued by the art component, as it is the realm of symbolic communication and opens the door for interpretation.

            Good point LoPhatt. This all originates to the original fallen star... Satan himself... Satan was considered faultless at one time until he fell... it's no wonder that the pentagram as represented by the golden ratio is lionized as Satan/baphomet. Satan before he was called Satan was called Lucifer which means the light bearer or "morning star". When you flip the pentagram with the point of the star facing downwards, you get the infamous baphomet, i.e. Satan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once satan fell from heaven, he became the father of all lies and through Adam's original sin, he had his influence on civilization and knew the way to combat truth (God's holy word), was to create a global government.... this started with the tower of Babel, then on to Babylonia where we start to see mass scale worshipping of the occult and witchcraft with all sorts of abominations against the nature of mankind such as child sacrifice which is why God told Joshua to wipe out every tribe in Canaan... they were all practicing completely abhorrent acts and worshipping Satan.
           </p>
           <p>
            This same story has run throughout all of mankind infiltrating institutions such as the RCC and even spawning "base level foot soldiers" within fabricated religions such as Islam that preach death to all and accept pedophilia as normal practice (See Muhammed married 9 year old Aisha when he was well into his 50s).
           </p>

            We're up against a battle not in flesh and blood but of principalities and spirits. Put on the armor of Christ and we shall prevail :)

            This is why shills on this site, including mods, along with disinformation and propaganda operatives everywhere it seems, try to downplay Podesta, Alefantis, and CPP. They want us to think that JA/Podesta/CPP is either fake news or an isolated drop in the ocean in pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like you, I've always focused on them, and also Epstein, and how other people are connected to them. They are the hub on the wheel, but shills want us to focus on the rim and to disregard the spokes to the hub as outrageous conspiracy theory. With all of the Podestas and Alefantis's connections in DC and the media, it makes no sense to not focus on them as the center of all of this.

             Not unlike when one realizes how many 'different brands' of competing breakfast cereal carried in most grocery stores really belong to maybe three companies.
            </p>

             The more interconnectedness of key relationships we find, the closer we are in exposing the ultimately transparently few puppet masters in the global psyop False Narrative and authors of Fake News (they just hide behind 100s maybe 1000s of 'Brands').

               Thank you.  Who would have ever thought that the 'intersectionality' of CPP, JA, JP&amp;TP, HRC, and their alliances, would spark the mother of all Deep State melt downs in known history?
              </p>
              <p>
               The MSM is now superfluous (don't watch it anymore), as are the Celebratards (don't watch, listen or respect them anymore), the MusicalPuppet-tards (don't listen to their brain drain shyte); the Antifatards (they're only interesting when they get punched back), and the Brainwashed College masses, masquerading as "Free thinkers", (more like future mental institution wards of the state, now wandering the campuses like barking schizoid spit spraying zombies) .
              </p>
              <p>
               Not dismissing the real threat of what money can buy the powerful, but ironically the more they tinker to hasten social decay by encouraging it, investing in it, the less they have to work with, the less to hide behind.  So the dull, one tone wonder of Global-Elitism rings out across the world in staged protest photos, faux 'Heros', false flags, and irritating childish slogans. The daily call to inanity.  All to mask the real carnage and unspeakable mental and physical damage to an innumerable number of human beings.
              </p>
              <p>
               But in the end, every case of 'activism' rings more superficial, reeking from the same Elitist approved stamp of Global 'Causes': CF, OpenBorders, CGI, OpenSociety, Civil Society...(fill in the blank of the thousands of related names).  A putrid smell, from the flotilla of Think Tanks chumming along across an ocean of once diverse societies, which are now being reduced to farmed fishing of the human spirit.

            Excellent work! For all researchers who keep stating it is deeper than you think. We are moving closer. A deeper understanding will be gained as we move into Rome. 
Answering who are the illuminati.. what is the genetic link we need to examine. It is right there for discovery.

            Nice sleuthing indeed. Some excellent connections there. Yes, these bloodsuckers go back centuries.Brings to mind  Elizabeth Bathory who stole children and young girls from surrounding villages and bathe in their blood.

            All of this fits into place. I am an artist and much of what you are saying about art brut is true.Art brut is sometimes referred to the U.S. as Outsider Art.

            <em>
             The Hebrew letters at the five points of the pentagram spell out Leviathan, a mythic creature in Jewish lore.

            Which means this symbol existed long before it was first published to the public.

            And its been going on a lot longer than the 1700's.  The image of an Egyptian pyramid and the Eye of Horus is right on the US dollar bill and the Egyptian Pharaohs did the same organ harvesting that is going on today.
