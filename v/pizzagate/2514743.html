<p>This seems like a VERY small article to be featured. There are a ton of numbers (digits) used in this article. (18-7-20-36-20-34-90-10-21) I\'m almost certain it\'s a coded warning to pedos that things are heating up.   
</p>
<p>I need someone with better code experience to help see if this is a big nothing burger or not. The only thing I have nailed down is the 34 million combinations is a legitimate number, meaning that Dominos actually claims 34 million, so that number is not made up for this article. I find it strange that he chooses to use so many digits in liu of words or expressions ie: &quot;a number of years&quot; or &quot;decades&quot; etc...

<p>Prison for toppings? Unlikely. Since when do Dominos Managers write Op-Eds for Washington Examiner? This is his only submission AFAIK. Why is it front page on Drudge? Why does he list the amount of restaurants as 18 and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180424173851/http://dominosdfa.com/dfa-board/jim-gerety/">profile lists 16?</a>

            The opinion piece does seem a bit strange.  We have read that spies, the world wide "cabal," etc., communicate by any means possible.

             You do realize, that your posts are a shame to your own name right? "Are we sure" would imply searching for and finding the truth, not dismissing things as a joke without being sure that they are indeed a joke. It would mean pursuing every angle to indeed be sure.. this makes you quite the hypocrite. I'm not saying I think this is a real thing or not, just you choosing that name definitely does not fit your agenda that I have seen in every single post I have seen you make. Literally every single time you speak on here you immediately dismiss the topic without being sure of anything. You should be named I am lazy that would be more appropriate.

              Reaching for some numeric code is because of a deep believe is a bunch of bullshit code words that never existed.   See the list in the other comments.   Those are completely fake.  It's a hoax.

               But his is just one example of you dismissing things on the surface from the starting date. These criminals will do things the more outlandish them more people deny them just based on how crazy they sound. Congnitive dissonance is a bitch. I'm not sying this particular "lead" is or isn't something. I'm just saying your name being are we sure is quite ironic because as your response confirms you dismissing things without being sure. Think of my message as a baited trap, and you fell right into it. You confirmed with your response that you did just that. Without any research at all you dismissed the whole lead. Sure the numbers thing seems like a silly path to go down, and it very well probably is. But are we sure? Not until someone goes down that path. Many things that seem completely ludicris on the surface later or with research turn out to be viable once someone investigates and finds out if "we are sure" just saying dude, if you want to live up to the kick ass name you have chosen there's a lot of responsibility behind it. Sure being a skeptic is half of it, but also being open minded is the other half.

            Certainly something odd. Not sure about the numerology part, but the code seems evident. Could be a distraction piece to get investigators off the trail. That would probably backfire like Gheeta/Sarah Henry. Sarah is most likely a pen name accrued from Sarah Shelton Henry: The wife Patrick Henry kept in the ...     We all know that dominoes pizza means Domination of Children in pedo code. Cohn is a variation of Cohen which is the matriarchal family entrusted to the preservation of religion. Rabbis.

            Its probably coded. They code most numbers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Id have to read the article to see all the coding, but 18 =6+6+6 and 36 is three sixes for 666, lots of 7s going on with the 7, 34 which is 7, they like 3 6 9 and 7 mostly. Ending with a 21 or 7+7+7  isnt surprising.

             So you think it could be just symbolic number signalling rather than a variation of A1Z26? That would make sense. Read the article when you get a chance and let me know what you think.

               You need to read the post. Why on earth is an Op-Ed about caloric content on the top update page of Drudge? That doesn't add up. The numbers are possible code, as well as pizza, cheese, and sauce. And yes, it sounds innocent at first glance, that's precisely why the code exists.

                The article is talking about an Obama-era regulation that the Trump administration is considering that will hurt small businesses and put a lot of them on the brink of failure. THAT'S why it's on the front page of drudge.

                By you're assessment, ANYTHING that has the word "pizza" in it must be some pedophile code, even if the example works perfectly with the underlying article explaining the policy at hand.

                Fuck that piece of shit dude... *"WHAT DO YOU MEAN ITS CODED, I DON'T SEE A CODE" * No shit fuck face, That's why It's called a code... So Fuck faces Can't see it.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is  most likely a coded Message...
                <em>
                 But in fucks faces Defense
                </em>
                The codes go beyond the numbers, And The Cliche References/meanings behind the numbers. Don't get me wrong, the Cliche is there, but it goes much deeper.   But it's not like they just Send coded messages about things having to do with pedophilia...
               </p>

                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                For example,
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Police found the 30-year-old’s cell phone, car and dog, Dolly Madison, at her Ocilla, Ga., home--about 200 miles south of Atlanta. But her keys and purse were missing. And there was no sign of break-in or signs of struggle.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                I think most people would be surprised to learn how many articles are coded messages.  It's an extremely Common way The deepstate  Communicates.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will say  You'd be safe to assume this one does have an aspect Pertaining to human trafficking, Considering it's DOMINOS PIZZA.. ANd like I said, The Cliche is included...  But I'm just making an overall point about Coded articles.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would Be interested in any Other things you stumble across that you find Interesting... Because you correct In noticing this.

            You’ll probably never be able to expose the real demons—they are too slick. If you want to investigate a demonic church—investigate the Mennonite Church.

              Well first of all I saw it totally demon possessed. I would say that is a pretty big problem! You know people going to church aren’t suppose to be possessed!!! That means it is fake. A fake church. That means it has bad beliefs-bad doctrines. So look at their doctrines, what could be wrong with them??? What beliefs that the Mennonites have that are correct and what beliefs are incorrect. But the biggest thing is why are church going people freaking demon possessed???

                The only way a person can see something like that. It is a gift of the Holy Spirit called discerning of spirits. This will probably be hard for you to understand if you are not familiar with the 9 really supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit. The Bible talks about this gift in I Corinthians 12:10.

            Look at the bottom of Jim Gerety’s bio in your link. At the bottom
of his bio it asks the question What resources do you recommend Franchiseers utilize to benefit their business. His answer is Wizardline. Go to www.thewizardline.com and you see they call themselves wizards and they talk about wizardly news. I think we’ve found another rabbits hole to go down!!!

            <br/>
            - there are enough numbers to be a credit cards in the 1st paragraph.. 1982 1985 1988 1999 combo with first line for exp and cvv
2nd paragraph.. 3 step children 11, 8, and 6 (seems like that kids in the pool luzatto lady ick)   like what writer doesn't see " 3 stepchildren" and " Jim enjoys riding..." right next to each other and doesn't re-structure the paragraph.
