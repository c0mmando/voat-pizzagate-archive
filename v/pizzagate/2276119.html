<p>&quot;There is a big name out there. A very big name. He can take down a whole lot of people with him. He is a writer and producer and we call him BC. Along with an already shamed A list actor, he was the first to force this A list director to have sex with him for a future in Hollywood.</p>
<p>BC passed that same trait on to the director. BC has several production partners. Each of them are a little piece to the puzzle. Each of them owns a company which is directly involved with other companies that all are mixed and matched with BC and his two partners. One of those projects is a boys club. An actual club similar to a boys and girls club. One where for some reason, girls are not allowed. They only want to help &quot;boys.&quot; The partner of BC who started this was groomed and shaped by the A list director who is a very frequent guest to the club and a very frequent viewer of the footage from the cameras installed everywhere in the club.</p>

<p>Sorry, I\'m literally on the phone right now talking to somebody who worked with Singer a LONG time. He just told me FOX-Marvel canceled Singer\'s Xmen TV project, and have &quot;deleted&quot; his name off the entire future production board. Which they do before filing with the DGA. WOW. Go Fox! </p>
<p>I talked with a lady boss at FOX last night who said the word came down from Murdoch - get rid of everything Singer is doing. They wanna scrub it clean to appeal to Disney stockholders! </p>
<p>Will get back with you.</p>
<hr />
<p>HOLY FUCKING SHIT.</p>
<p>So Gary Goddard is BG who teaches Bryan Singer (the director) how to rape underage boys. The actor is Spacey.</p>
<p>All of that is obvious.</p>
<p>Figure out the lawyer and GG\'s partners.
Then you\'re right there next to outing the boys club.</p>
<h2>So who in the hell were/are Goddard\'s multiple biz partners?</h2>
<p>WOW!I\'ve said it before and will say it again.
You folks are ASTOUNDING! Seriously!
Great work.
A damn shame the DA\'s office won\'t hire you guys - it would be worth it! Yes - Lookout &amp; BayAreaGirl - follow both of those leads and see what it leads to. Especially other partners. They always have these PR photo ops for their public events. Wonder who else would show up? That is, if they\'ve not been scrubbed already. Because I assure you that they know the earth is sliding beneath their feet each day. Just because someone is in a photo op doesn\'t connect them, but if a famous person is in a photo and their name is associated? They allowed it. See if those clubs have connections to any GIANT ENDOWMENT $$$ foundations/charities. And other billionaires or LA politicos tied into it? Keep in mind it would be years ago probably, because nobody would associate publicly with them since the allegations of the pool parties came out.</p>',

            I remember specifically seeing an ad w/ Singer talking about the upcoming X-Men TV project and I tweeted to their official account that Singer fucks young boys. My tweet didn't get much traction, but it might have been seen.

              Me too.  I saw it on the evening news  and it is another one of those out of control fires again and the people that spoke all look like those same kind at the last fire.  Funny how you can start spotting them.  Burning the Evidence.

                I hope it does come out.  The problem is it won't have all that much fanfare.  Afraid it will just be swept under since no one knows who Giustra is.

                  Me too.  I have hated her ever since she stood "by her man".  Little did the dumb women that fell for that claptrap that she had running for president in mind.  Baking cookies, indeed.  And calling black youths "predators".   Yes, I think Connecting the Dots now after all this coming out Reality may just sink in for so many more than before.

                   I think if Bill and her ever had sex it was Bill raping her and saying never again

                  <p>
                   I think she is the one who put the death orders out, to cover her ass which was hanging on Bill

                   She jokes about being nasty, but that is such an understatement

                    PS.  I am sure there was some set up will Chelsea's real Dad so they could pass off a daughter as theirs.  Hubble was his name.  Another Spitting Image Likeness just like Chester and Dad, my opinion only, of course.

                    The story is that she was after him first.  They moved into some old house in Ark.  So many stories about them and none of them are completely true.  All have been changed to protect the Um,  The Guilty?
