            I appreciate all of your comments, and no offense intended by what I am going to say, especially

             @ESOTERICshade

            whose replies have generated many more replies. 
Nothing wrong with replies, as they keep us thinking, analyzing, and learning, however, it appears that the focus of my post has been neglected.  (At least it was not deleted, as many of my posts have been over the past year).
           </p>
           <p>
            My sole purpose for the post was to inform others about some of the problems faced with sealed/secret/silent indictments and to hopefully obtain comments which expound much more knowledge than I have acquired about the sealed indictment process based on the recent rapid rise of hundreds (or over a thousand) that have been reported here on pizzagate. The Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 6, are lengthy, convoluted, and intimidating (as all legalese is) for a lay person such as I to understand.
           </p>
           <p>
            Peace.

             Now -- that said, I believe 'Q' -- and whoever Q represents -- is unleashing something truly powerful IF THE PEOPLE RESPOND. The more people research, the more we find out for ourselves, the more we share what we learn with each other, and slowly, with friends and family (teeny tiny red pillets) -- the more everyone gets lifted into a new understanding. And knowledge truly is power.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I will admit that the Q phenomenon has caused the masses to do an immense amount of research and many people have learned much needed knowledge. For that alone I am grateful. Some redpill seeds have been hatched.

            I agree as long as it does not lead to confirmation bias which is the death of true knowledge. We have to be willing to hear what we do not like without throwing tantrums and calling each other shills. There is a lot of that going on too.

            Life is a process and not an event. Attempting to unwind this 6000 year old pedosatanic system will also be a process. Education is the key. Accuracy in information is crucial and confirmation bias kills accuracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I use tenacity and perseverance instead of the Hopium I get from the satanic airwaves of communication.
           </p>
           <p>
            Organic Hopium is good hopium because it comes from the strength gained from good information and actions. A person has to be careful not to smoke the generic Hopium :)
           </p>
           <p>
            We can do this but it will take time and accuracy. The satanic system is very precise, and we have to strive to become equally as precise in our understanding of what is truly happening, instead of living in a bubble of the way we wish thing were.

            Q caused a lot of people to do a lot of learning. That is a good thing.

             Very important point. We have to acknowledge, repeatedly, that we're all still very much in the fog. There are layers and layers of inception. Rising up out of the depths only to get caught on the next level is not going to get us free. There's also confoundingly confusing levels of deception coming from all quarters. Trump lies. Q is, as you noted, casting all the shade in certain directions. The deepstate minions are choosing sides.

              is
             </em>
             a coup going on. But not the one we're focused on. Trump is turning the military arm of the NWO against the traditional Rulers. He's making a power play. If I'm right, these are incredibly dangerous waters. His followers will be blind to his doings and defend him tooth-and-sword, just as the Clintonites and Obamites remain blind, itching for a fight. Q already floated that 'they will call him the AntiChrist' -- and if he turns things around
             <em>
              enough
             </em>
             -- with the kind of skill he seems to have exhibited on this Asian tour -- then many who currently dislike him will come around.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dangerous waters indeed.

              Controlling water is dangerous, and that is partly why Racine is so important. Water is the new oil and gold, and the key to life.
             </p>
             <p>
              We hope that Trump proves is wrong, but we are fairly certain that he won't.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine, Wisconsin is Trump's Litmus Test. If he does not drain the swamp in Paul Ryan's back yard, it is all a show to get rid of the low hanging fruit and cut off some loose ends. Trump has known about Racine for a long time and has done nothing but endorse a corrupt Foxconn deal by the Amazon warehouse. Trump is far down on the wealth charts compared to those who really control the area.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine is the key to proving that the rule of law is dead, equal protection under the law is dead, and justice is dead.
             </p>
             <p>
              Once we realize that the system is corrupt, broken, and dead, and that their real agenda is eternal enslavement, we can rise again and save the world with the Truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              The greatest deception is Sustainability  (Satan's Ability). Racine will tell you whether Trump is deceptive or genuine.
             </p>
             <p>
              We don't believe in 33d chess, we believe in the Truth.

            Rich people can sue over Defamation, whereas poor people can't. I agree that sealed indictments are common, but mostly for the wealthy (don't want them to flee!!!!!!). I'm no expert though, and I appreciate your contribution and analysis. Trump has our back, I have faith!

             If Trump has anything to do with a single indictment, that would be an example of creeping fascism.  Rule of Law and the traditions say that the Department of Justice needs to be kept separate from politics.  This why Trump asking Comey to drop the Flynn investigation is being investigated as obstruction of justice.

               Mueller is absolutely looking at obstruction of  justice.  It doesn't matter what you believe.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump's lawyers know this very well.  In fact they have taken

                the unusual step of already arguing their case to Mueller.
               </a>
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Attorneys for President Trump have repeatedly met with Special Counsel Robert Mueller and submitted memos arguing that Trump did not obstruct justice when he fired FBI Director James Comey earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
               </p>
               <p>
                According to the Journal, the president's legal team has also warned Mueller that Comey is an unsuitable witness. In a memo submitted in June, Trump's lawyers described Comey as prone to exaggeration and the source of multiple leaks to the news media.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Jounal report, which cited "people familiar with the matter," said that Trump's attorneys gave their memos to Mueller in an effort to close the investigation of the president for allegations of obstruction of justice.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Why would Trump's lawyers take such a step?  Because they know who Mueller has been talking to and what documents he has.   In fact,
               <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/trump-comey-firing-letter.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">
                he has this document that the White House Counsel stopped from mailing.
               </a>
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Mueller Has Early Draft of Trump Letter Giving Reasons for Firing Comey
               </p>
               <p>
                The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has obtained a letter drafted by President Trump and a top political aide that offered an unvarnished view of Mr. Trump’s thinking in the days before the president fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey.
               </p>
               <p>
                The circumstances and reasons for the firing are believed to be a significant element of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, which includes whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey.
               </p>
               <p>
                The letter, drafted in May, was met with opposition from Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, who believed that its angry, meandering tone was problematic, according to interviews with a dozen administration officials and others briefed on the matter. Among Mr. McGahn’s concerns were references to private conversations the president had with Mr. Comey, including times when the F.B.I. director told Mr. Trump he was not under investigation in the F.B.I.’s continuing Russia inquiry.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               The President is definitely under an active criminal investigation into obstruction of justice.  This has been known since June and the actions of Trump's own attorneys confirm this.

           <p>
            Washington D.C. is sovereign nation in its own right. It is the District Of Columbia and owns the corporation of the United States. The Vatican is sovereign. London is sovereign. Legally they are not part of the nations that they exist within.
           </p>
           <p>
            As of 2015 the Washington Colony owed 18 trillion dollars to the EU master who loaned America the money to destroy themselves. It is much higher now. The true banking power is in London and London is the nexus, the eye, of the pedophile satanic system.
           </p>
           <p>
            This system is worldwide. The president of the United States is subservient to this system. This system is backed by the war power of NATO. NATO is the most ferocious armed force on planet earth.
           </p>
           <p>
            This pedosatanic system is at least 6000 years old. In order for one man, President Trump, to uproot this system, he would have to harness the forces of NATO to keep it from attacking because it would. The U.S. military is full to brim with the worst pedosatanists in the entire world. The newest version of their "craft" or their "art" they learned from the Paperclip Nazis that flooded into our military intelligence agencies after the war.

            Not trying to be a bummer, but an anon who named himself Q on 4chan said Trump is ending this 6000 year old system backed by NATO.

             It's not London, as we think of it -- but a secret city within a city -- called The

             The City of London controls the islands of Jersey and Guernsey -- where Savile and other so-called elites preyed monstrously on children in 'care homes.' They control the Cayman Islands and most of the off-shore tax havens. All the money flows, eventually, to the City of London.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, NATO, while technically the military arm of the NWO, is for all practical purposes historically controlled through D.C. Does the City of London have the mechanisms to control NATO? The communication channels? Any necessary knowledge base? Up till now, D.C. has always done the bidding of the City of London. What if that changed?

              I can't give an accurate answer to that, its complicated.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since the treasury borrows money from the Federal Reserve the principal and interest on that debt should qualify. But, It is probably more complicated because there are probably a lot of shell companies involved. The big 3 operate also on trusts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most people would not believe it but it could be as complicated as something like this:

             <p>
              The whole Earth is governed by The Crown, through Crown Colonies which belong to The City – The Crown Empire. It governs Africa and still governs China and India. The colonies of the Earth are really just Crown Colonies – The United States of America are states of The Crown.
             </p>
             <p>
              These might be the 3 pluses in Trumps tweets but I might get shot for saying it. Vatican, London, D.C.?

             <p>
              Since 1871 the United States president and the United States Congress has been playing politics under a different set of rules and policies. The American people do not know that there are two Constitutions in the United States. The first penned by the leaders of the newly independent states of the United States in 1776. On July 4, 1776, the people claimed their independence from the Crown (temporal authority of the Roman Catholic Pope) and Democracy was born. And for 95 years the United States people were free and independent. That freedom ended in 1871 when the original “Constitution for the United States for America” was changed to the “THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA”.

              The Act of 1871” a city state (a state within a state) called the District of Columbia located on 10 sq miles of land in the heart of Washington was formed with its own flag and its own independent constitution – the United States’ secret second constitution.

                You are a great mod vin, but when I look outside the Q bubble at where the real money is flowing, even if all my history points and understanding of where the money exactly gets from point a to point b is off sometimes, my perspective just can't grab the Q bites that Trump is getting ready to upend a global banking system and satanism at the same time with what he has to work with. Not fitting my parameters of reality, not yet anyway....These two are inextricably woven together.

                And we need to understand the relationship between the City of London (which the Queen calls 'The Firm') and the Vatican. Might be a very different animal than the relationship between the monarchy of England and the Vatican. No links -- just spitballin' here.

               I made a few posts talking about motivated reasoning and EsotericShade developed this paranoid fantasy about it.  Claiming that I'm paid to post here and a memo must have went out telling me to use the term motivated reasoning.  Claimed that multiple people must post as me because there's different writing styles.  ES claimed that motivated reasoning was not a real concept, but it NLP mind trickery and other stuff.....Let me see if I can find some of the comments.

                "motivated reasoning" is trick psych terms made up by the most corrupt and harmful medical niche in the business. The DSM Psych Manual is a horror show.

              Probably because IRL they personally know numerous folks in the military who would beat the everloving shit out of any pedo they could get their hands on.

               This might be true (remember the guy that beat up a local police chief in Afghanistan who surrounded himself with sex slaves), nonetheless the military elite and many on the lower levels are also into pedophila. Prime purpose of the military is to expand its power, not to serve "The People".
