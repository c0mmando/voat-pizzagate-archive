<p>NEW INFO </p>
<p>Orlandi’s brother Pietro has been leading a decades-long campaign to find out what happened and has even accused the Vatican of complicity in the case, The Guardian reported. The Vatican has repeatedly said it has cooperated fully with police investigating the case.</p>
<p>Recently, a leading Italian journalist caused a stir when he published a document stolen from a locked Vatican cabinet that suggested the Holy See was involved in Orlandi’s disappearance. The document seemed to be written by a cardinal and listed supposed expenses for Orlandi’s upkeep after she vanished.</p>
<p>The Vatican said the document was a fake but never explained what it was doing in one of their cabinets.</p>

             Someone told me he was murdered.  They found stakes sticking out of his neck but claimed he died from a heart attack.  Would you not get a heart attack if people were standing near you with stakes?  And then stuck them in your neck..  Yes, Martin was a Courageous Whistle Blower.  They finally had to put a stop to it.   I hope they get what they deserve.  An eternity in hell.

               Well, then there are two stories.  Either way he was sorely needed especially at this time.  He was a valuable asset in this fight against the homosexual faction of the Church.  This is going to be a war, if not already.  Thank God for the Protest coming in Boston.  I hope M Martin is watching from above.

            It's a well known mystery. Vatican is owned by degenerate pederasts who like raping and murdering children.

             Funny Thing.  I didn't find this info right away, in my first post.  I went further back, way back to like 7 or 8 pages.  Now some info has been scrubbed.  They are feverishly erasing their mistakes. Must be one big eraser.
