<p>I hope they hit Pizzagate and QAnon. We need more red pills and glimpses of people on our side. Seth MacFarlane has surprised me several times. Family Guy brought up Corey Haim and multiple other child actors who were raped or abused, and also name dropped Bryan Singer. He even tells Stewie don\'t become a child actor or you\'ll be sexually abused.</p>

            I recall that early in the Pizzagate investigations, Milo Yianopolous claimed that Matt Stone/Trey Parker and an unidentified business man were all consulting about a pizzagate Southpark episode.

           <p>
            Anyone else remember this? I can't find any traces of this discussion on the internet.

             I'll try to find it! I just found something as well. I googled South Park Pizzagate and the second link was from a still on their show. In it the parents are afraid of the children being kidnapped in a Pizza place and have trackers on them...

             </p>
             <p>
              Btw i'm a longtime lurker about to post 2 years worth of pizzagate related investigations.

              Do i still need some amount of karma or comment history to post threads?

               Welcome to the forums :) We need all the help we can get. We do have a karma system to keep the shills out. I gave you an upvote to start. Just post some comments and discuss with other users and you will eventually be able to make a thread. When I first joined we didn't, but since then we have had several attacks from shills and even a few times where they managed to DDOS Voat. One of the shills threatened my life.

            There is a theory that they know that Spielberg and Lucas are rapists based on the 2008 season.

            I found out WHY Steven Spielberg is so powerful. He has MAFIA ties. More specifically to the Bronfman Crime Family, who are financially glued at the hip to the Rotschild family. Link below (go to part 7).

             Thank You for spreading that news.  The Bronfmans have a tight hold onHollywood and Spielberg is part of it.   The Bronfman Family control Canada.  We'll see if they start taking them down with the NXIVM Case.  Also Thank You for your tireless posting on Spielberg and Lucas as well.  I believe they will eventually be exposed.

            Wait so you think Trey Parker and Matt Stone, combines net worth of $500,000,000 + who produce a grotesque cartoon on Comedy Central, owned by Viacom (Satanic as fuck) aren’t compromised?  They’re shoving this shit in our faces.

            I remember watching these in my late teens and young adulthood. I remember the Super Adventure Club episode of SP. I'd love to pick Matt and Trey's brains, ask them "where did that cone from!?" They must know a lot.

            They loosely addressed it in last week's episode, but of course remained neutral on the issue. I'm quite sure they're Nihilists, so they don't really give a fuck what happens to anyone.

            I don’t know which way this sways people in general. I doubt it sways anyone. I watched it, I’m redpilled and it didn’t move me at all. Came across as another typical joke about Catholic priests molesting boys. That shit has been fodder for jokes for decades, and this doesn’t change a thing. SP stopped trying to be edgy a long time ago. They keep running hashtag “cancel South Park” in commercials because they mean it. This IS pizzagate, but not worth persuing, because this running joke about a serious problem has been done so many times it’s sickening. Yes, the CC is getting pressure, but SP chose to do the same old worn out jokes. SP has lost it’s edge, choosing easy targets and avoiding the cowardice of the pope.

             Not true, shill. And why you got ten points for this is fucking ridiculous. I guess it's an attempt to bolster shills and make people think you're something you're not?

             If you'd watched South Park, you know that they don't make these things "funny". When they explain what the Super Adventurer's Club is it's done in a very direct style with marquee explanations at the bottom of the screen.

             You also seem to have forgotten the huge red pill they tried to deliver which was the Muhammad episode. There was a HUGE uproar that involved threats of a fatwa if it was broadcast. The episode was censored over these threats of violence and I often wonder why this incident is not brought up when the religion is touted as "peaceful". What other religion has threatened an all out war over a TV show and actually gotten the episode pulled? Yes, there have been controversies, and protests, and articles written objecting, but this just never happened before or since. Only with THIS PARTICULAR religion.

              South Park censored after threat of fatwa over Muhammad episode
Extremist group's death warning leads TV network to censor 201st episode, to fans' dismay
             </p>
             <p>
              They have depicted the Queen blowing her brains out after a failed attempt by the British army to reinvade America, Saddam Hussein as Satan's gay lover, and Jesus as a trigger-happy superhero. Mormons, Scientologists, Catholics, Jews, politicians and film stars have all been skewered on the razor-sharp wit of South Park.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now the caustic animated satire appears to have reached its limits within the confines of mainstream US television. Fans and pundits alike were taken aback last night when an episode featuring the prophet Muhammad purportedly dressed in a bear costume had bleeps and "Censored" blocks slapped liberally throughout to remove all audio and visual reference to the prophet.
             </p>
             <p>
              The censorship followed a warning from a New York-based group of extremist Muslim converts that could be construed as a death threat. The group, through its website Revolutionmuslim.com, had reacted to last week's episode of South Park which first depicted Muhammad dressed as a bear by saying its originators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, "will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh".
             </p>
             <p>
              To underline the point, the website carried a picture of Van Gogh, the Dutch film-maker killed in 2004 after he made a documentary on the abuse of women in Muslim countries, with his throat cut and a knife in his chest. They also listed the New York headquarters of Comedy Central, the cable television channel that broadcasts the show, and South Park's production company, adding: "You can pay them a visit at these addresses."

              In the aftermath of the show's censorship, the chatrooms on South Park's website hummed with the indignation of its fans. "Do you seriously think that will appease the extremists from more terrorism?" one wrote.
             </p>
             <p>
              As controversy raged, Comedy Central confessed that it was responsible for the cuts. "I can't go into the thinking behind it, but I can confirm it was Comedy Central that inserted the bleeps and not South Park," a spokesman for the station said.
             </p>
             <p>
              The apportioning of responsibility will come as a relief to devotees of the animation, who have grown accustomed to it treating nothing and nobody as sacred.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Muhammad furore began last week in the show's 200th episode when the creators introduced the character as a riff on censorship. The joke was that Muhammad was dressed as a bear because he could not be shown as a cartoon in the wake of death threats made against Danish cartoonists by Islamist extremists, who see any depiction of Muhammad as a gross insult to their religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the storyline, the prophet was brought into the show on the demand of previous victims of its satire, led by Tom Cruise, who believed that he could make them immune to further ridiculing. In this week's episode, the bear costume was unzipped to reveal that Santa Claus, not Muhammad, had been inside all along.
             </p>
             <p>
              This was the second time that South Park had taken on the prophet as a subject. In 2006, soon after violent protests erupted against the Danish cartoons, Stone and Parker produced a double episode that featured the prophet and was also censored by Comedy Central.
             </p>
             <p>
              In that case, however, there was no pickup from Islamist groups. The latest controversy has cast the light on Revolution Muslim, a group of probably fewer than 10 extremists based in New York who hand out leaflets outside the moderate 96th-street mosque.

             So, asshat, you do something one-hundredth this noteworthy and I'll applaud you. Oh, but you won't because you're a fucking troll. And note even after the death threats were issued, they weren't the ones that backed down.
