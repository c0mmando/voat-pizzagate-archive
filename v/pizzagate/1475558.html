   More subscribers is resulting in lower quality posts, and more of them. Is there anywhere we can start a private "invite only" research group?

            Guys,
           </p>
           <p>
            I created a slack group:
            <a href="https://researchmediainc.slack.com/">
             https://researchmediainc.slack.com/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I made it generic-sounding on purpose. Let me know what you think of this idea. If we can get the best researchers in one place, free of all the shills and low-IQ droolers muddling the conversation with BS and downvotes, we could be a powerhouse. I'm the guy who wrote one of the articles on PG that was in one of the old Stickies that provided PG summaries for newcomers to get up to speed. Mine was the one at aceloewgold.com. Just send me your email for an invite to the Slack group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks!

            I'm considering starting a Slack group. Unfortunately I personally am not really anonymous, as I have been a blogger and can definitely be personally ID'd by TPTB, but a Slack group seems like a great solution. Try to get as many people who have been following and contributing since close to day 1, and can show meaningful research or other contributions in the archived reddit sub and/or here, can get an invite. thoughts?

            What if we tried creating an invite only subREDDIT, and communicate via PMs and links mostly. Like, be a little cryptic, only invite the core group and a couple of others who can do organizational legwork. I think that would be the safest thing. Vague titles, codewords. Any ideas on a title eh?

            Just a thought but if we make ourselves private are we then making the whole investigation secretive and therefore not attractive to newcomers? Isn't the point to grab as much of the public as possible to create a movement? Maybe there could be a heavily moderated thread that only includes serious investigation so everyone can see where this is heading? Make this private and the momentum stops. Just My 2 bobs worth, anyway.

             Newbies will still be coming here, and the ones that seem legit, helpful, and research-savvy we can invite. Revelations can still be posted here, they just won't be buried by idiots and shills beneath false leads and other sorts of BS that people have been posting.

              I do see the sense in this, some posts lately have been pretty pointless or just plain false. It's a bit frustrating when there's no fact checking going on with some of the OPs. Speculation and theory is fine as long as it doesn't get thrown out there as the truth.

            I agree. Just yesterday, I mentioned a bit about that band member with the mask, because I couldn't find any information on it. It turns out that there was already fresh better information on it, but I just couldn't find it. My info could have been added to that instead.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that a general discussion thread needs to be stickied, so that we can ask questions about what has been found and/or what is being worked on.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm genuinely upset that I spent all those hours sifting for information only to find out that somebody has done most of it already. I feel cheated and lied to, even though that wasn't the case.

            While I have your attention, do you or does anybody have any links to those Wikileaks emails, where they are having entire discussions with a coded language? I'm not talking a word here and there. I'm talking about where every word seems cryptic.

              I don't think so. If you have a link to that one about some sort game, then I'll check it out.

              I'm thinking of a series of emails, where people were using English in weird ways. It would be like if I spoke like this to you.

            Perhaps it is time to begin fooling the shills.
            <br/>
            pizzagate can now become the old trenders. Where old news can just spot up, and the shills will be baited into it.
            <br/>
            Meanwhile the actual investigation hashtag can resume offline from the main.
            <br/>
            So MEANWHILE the MSM will attack Pizzagate, they will not realize that pizzagate is actually a husk node, the new node goes underground.
            <br/>
            So yes, invite only, where newbies have to be pulled out from husktown through worthiness.

            Awesome idea. I've noticed the same problems and have become increasingly frustrated. I don't know what the best solution would be, though. Would Slack be a good fit for this?

             it's getting very time consuming sorting through the shit to find the quality, and even then, the quality gets buried or removed.

              If anyone has a 30 day or older reddit account we can get a tiny exclusive subreddit going like the one I described above. Mods could heavily control the flow of material, eliminating anything that isn't on the basis of investigation

            We need to create a private messaging group and invite lead investigators. I've been trying to help by linking to good and buried leads but it isn't enough
The chans are killing us with investigation and we can't go idle. Do you have any suggestions?

             We are just at 8 today, but it's going to grow quick now. Despite the fact that so many people are on different pages in PG - is indeed frustrating. BUT, we are approaching critical mass here soon.

              I have read WIIKILEAKS as they came out, followed Reddit from Twitter post and it closed so I saw people coming here. I have been pretty much here since inception.  I get the impression that some people from the beginning have left and formed a private group due to shills pouring in. I have no proof, but I just feel from some posts that people left for that reason.  It would be great if was an option.

               I would not blame them one bit for that. I have suggested the same before. Contributors/non distractionaries only.

               I would be great if they shared with us.

                I don't know how to find them if there is a "them."  If you find such a group I would be interested in joining.

             I was a member of a few good FB ones until they were removed, but the same problem happened there - soon as it got around 1k members it turned to shit because there were so many new people who just weren't up to date. In order to start taking the big findings and joining them together, without being distracted with hundreds of useless points in between, there needs to be some strict quality control. That isn't going to happen in this sub, it's just too big now and too compromised.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Invite only" is probably the only way to keep the quality up.

             Does Voat do private subs like Reddit does?
