<p>A seemingly small but interesting lead of mine just turned out to be a whale of a catch.  Hillary Clinton was paid 265,000 dollars by AdvaMed for a single speech.  It turns out a member of AdvaMed is RTI Surgical which, while then known as RTI Biologics, illegally harvested dead bodies for bone marrow, organs, and tissue from the Ukraine to sell for a profit. Tutogen was their German division that was caught also using tissue stolen from dead corpses in the Ukraine.  Many of the corpses they used also were riddled with diseases and negatively hurt the people who got transplants of their organic materials.  It should be noted, Hillary took these peoples money <em>after</em> all this had already come out about them.

But there is more!  I have discovered a group that encompasses Tavistock, RTI Surgical and other shady groups.  It is called BioFlorida.  While it admittedly has a ton of members and many of the lower paying ones are probably honest businesses their premiere member list reads like a whose-who of pharma corruption.  One is PhRma whose president Stephen Ubl used to work for AdvaMed.   When PhRma went after Martin Shkreli the &quot;bad boy&quot; of pharma got pissed off.  Apparently even he thought that he didn\'t hold a candle to the likes of BioFlorida members like PhRma and Amgen.</p>',

            BECAUSE OF THE HYDE AMENDMENT NO FEDERAL FUNDS CAN BE USED TO PAY FOR ABORTIONS.

            Five Facts You Should Know About the Hyde Amendment
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             The law’s impact is limited almost entirely to poor women. The late Henry Hyde (R-IL), the conservative congressman who first proposed the amendment, acknowledged this reality during a Medicaid funding debate in 1977, when he told his colleagues:
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            “I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion: a rich woman, a middle-class woman or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the… Medicaid bill.”
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              About 42 percent of women who have abortions live below the poverty line. The unintended pregnancy rate among poor women is five times the rates for higher-income women, as is the abortion rate. One reported reason for the discrepancy is poor women’s limited access to contraception.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              By restricting Medicaid funding for abortion, one in four low-income women who would like to obtain abortions are instead forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. Since the Hyde Amendment was enacted more than 35 years ago, over one million women have been unable to afford abortions.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Since the Hyde Amendment passed, only four states have voluntarily decided to use their funds to cover abortion. Another 13 states are required to do so by court order, just as they would other forms of health care. Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia basically follow the Hyde Amendment as the congressman intended, with some small variations. One state, South Dakota, only pays for abortion when a woman’s life is in danger, but not in cases of rape and incest — an apparent violation of federal law.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              In order to assuage opponents of abortion in his own party, President Obama signed an executive order stating that The Affordable Care Act  — which could expand Medicaid to cover as many 21.3 million additional low-income Americans by 2022 — would maintain current Hyde Amendment restrictions.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>

            Someone pointed out that AdvaMed is a trade association with hundreds of members, they aren't a parent company to RTI, so the connection here is not what it seems.
           </p>
           <p>
            HOWEVER - I found this, showing that Clinton
            <em>
             gave
            </em>
            tons of money (half a billion) to RTI International, despite its track record of fraud and wasting funds :
            <a href="https://www.americarisingpac.org/state-department-waste/">
             https://www.americarisingpac.org/state-department-waste/
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             During Hillary Clinton’s tenure at the State Department, over $526 million was given to a company that had a history of fraud and abuse. Unsurprisingly, the company continued to defraud and waste taxpayer money with the funding it received during Secretary Clinton’s tenure.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Washington Examiner writes that starting as far back as 2006, government audits of the company, RTI International, “documented how the firm left a trail of misused funds, unfinished projects and unmet promises in 24 of the world’s most impoverished countries.” Some of the more egregious examples noted by the Washington Examiner were that RTI International:
            </p>
            <p>
             “Invented ‘fictional beneficiaries’ and ‘possibly even fictional spray operators’ in an anti-malaria campaign in Ghana.”
“Paid ‘inordinate attention’ to details like the color of furniture for women’s centers it was building in South Africa that failed to meet even local health standards once finished.”
“Sent computers to a school in an area of Nicaragua without electricity.”
“The nonprofit once spent $23,000 set aside for fighting HIV on a single lunch at a luxury South African hotel, according to a Jan. 4, 2011, audit report.”
“Three top RTI executives pulled down between $550,000 and $605,000…” (For comparison, the President makes $400,000)
            </p>
            <p>
             Shockingly, “of the 26 performance audits filed between 2006 and 2014 by the IG, all but two were critical of the company’s work. … IG auditors have long accused RTI of filing faulty progress reports, misusing tax dollars and failing to implement projects according to contract specifications.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The performance audits were performed by the independent inspector general for USAID, the agency responsible for America’s foreign aid.  USAID has given RTI International more than $1.8 billion in contracts between 2003 and 2012. During Secretary Clinton’s tenure, the State Dept. and USAID gave RTI International over $526 million according to federal contract data.
            </p>
            <p>
             USAID is an independent government agency that receives “overall foreign policy guidance from the Secretary of State,” is overseen by the State Department, and its foreign assistance budget is managed from within the State Department.

             Thanks for the post!  I was looking into that this morning.  I don't think the two RTI's are related because one is a nonprofit and the other a business.  But it is still very important information.

            Even today, Bill &amp; Hilary are not subject to any laws. The amounts don't matter, the criminality doesn't matter. They are completely free to be as criminal as they please and nothing will ever happen to them. And their "friends". I doubt even Trump can do anything to them.

            Imagine if arrest were made? What would happen? The corporate media would  have to call the arrest a travesty somehow, but that would only make those sleeping research the story. The last shovel full of dirt on the medias grave. If this entire network isn't brought low, people need to boycott everything and stop paying taxes. Period. I have already cancelled my cable and will not return to the movies or fund sports. Enough already. I am way past convinced and if the FBI has any white hats left, do something asap or we are through supporting any establishment apparatus and the government they control. Enough.

            OK -- if it's just audio, can't play it right now -- will look at it tomorrow.

            Obama just put $500 million into Vaccines for Haiti -- think there's any death for the nation and generations of children from that?
And how about our Cancer industry?  1 in every 3 Americans with Cancer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just be careful that while you think you're ruining a "death industry" that you don't ruin the health and well-being of females/mothers.
There are about one late term abortion in every county in the US every year -- just one!
They are done to protect the life and future fertility of a pregnant female who's health or life is threatened by a pregnancy.
Often they are mothers of other children.
The majority of abortions take place during the first weeks of the pregnancy.
Delays are caused by lack of funds, difficulties in reaching PP locations, notification laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            Planned Parenthood is very closely scrutinized and investigated all the time -- especially after the fake video.
They have done nothing illegal either in procedures nor in financing.
            <br/>
            There were no illegalities -- there was no profit.

            Well if this mod turns out to be a shill, I'm a little bit worried by the fact that he is the one who created the sticky post on this subverse. I'm not accusing him of anything, but if what michael86 says is true, there is a possibility that he could inject a few falsehoods into the most viewed thread in the subverse (the sticky) just to try to discredit the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hate throwing accusations, but this is concerning enough to ask a few questions. Millenial_Falcon should explain why he deletes this kind of threads.

            But operations like RTI pulled brings in millions of dollars.  Even if they were just one member of AdvaMed they were bring in a killing of ill gotten money.  To say that doesn't directly reflect poorly on AdvaMed and Hillary is asinine.

             Planned Parenthood stops taking money for fetal tissue donations
            </strong>
            Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday that it will no longer accept any reimbursement as part of its fetal tissue donation program, taking its strongest step yet to end the onslaught of conservative attacks against the group.
            <br/>
            “This new policy removes beyond the shadow of a doubt the ludicrous idea that Planned Parenthood has any financial interest in tissue donation — and shows the real agenda behind these attacks,” Richards wrote in a statement.
            <strong>
             Experts have said that what PP was charging for these fetal tissue donations - $30-$100 per donation for storage, transportation and other related costs - would barely have covered their costs.... PP will now absorb all costs.

             Unspinning the Planned Parenthood Video
            </strong>
            Several Republican presidential candidates have claimed that Planned Parenthood is “profiting” from abortions. But the full, unedited video they cite as evidence shows a Planned Parenthood executive repeatedly saying its clinics want to cover their costs, not make money, when donating fetal tissue from abortions for scientific research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Four experts in the field of human tissue procurement told us the price range discussed in the video — $30 to $100 per patient — represents a reasonable fee. “There’s no way there’s a profit at that price,” said Sherilyn J. Sawyer, the director of Harvard University and Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s “biorepository.”

             No, Planned Parenthood Is Not Selling Aborted Fetal Body Parts
            </strong>
            The video itself opens with a short clip of former Planned Parenthood president Gloria Feldt that is edited to give the appearance of condemning the recorded conversation that follows. But the 20/20 segment on which Feldt appears is actually an investigation into abuses made by private sector “tissue and organ procurement companies.” And Feldt even went on to later affirm that “Planned Parenthood supports research using fetal tissue in accordance with legal and ethical guidelines and are deeply concerned about the attempt by some to profit from the humanitarian contributions of courageous women.”

             Jim Vaught, president of the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories
            </strong>
            and formerly the deputy director of the National Cancer Institute’s Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research, told us in an email that “$30 to $100 per sample is
            <strong>
             a reasonable charge
            </strong>
            for clinical operations to recover their costs for providing tissue.” In fact, he said, the costs to a clinic are often much higher, but most operations that provide this kind of tissue have “no intention of fully recovering [their] costs, much less making a profit.”
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Carolyn Compton, the chief medical and science officer of Arizona State University’s **  National Biomarkers Development Alliance and a former director of biorepositories and biospecimen research at the National Cancer Institute, agreed that this was “a modest price tag for cost recovery.” Compton told us in an email:  ” ‘Profit’ is out of the question, in my mind.
            </strong>
            I would say that whoever opined about ‘profit’ knows very little about the effort and expense involved in providing human biospecimens for research purposes.”**

            however, some of the PRIVATE organizations charge much higher fees for fetal tissue donations.

             The Videos
            </strong>
            At one point in the unedited video (which was also released by the group), Nucatola says:
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Affiliates are not looking to make money by doing this. They’re looking to serve their patients and just make it not impact their bottom line.”

           </p>
           <p>
            Planned Parenthood which serves mainly women of moderate means is under constant attacks by anti-abortion groups.  This has ranged from very disruptive protests at clinics, to bombings resulting in death to clinic workers -- and even actual MURDER of doctors who perform abortions at women's clinics.

              Evidently you think the right wing sees no financial incentive in controlling the lives of women?
             </p>
             <p>
              Women do most of the work of the world, including the reality that every human being on this planet got here through the body of a female.
             </p>
             <p>
              And -- Are you actually nodding affirmatively to bombings of women's clinics and murder of doctors performing abortions?
             </p>
             <p>
              There is only one way the right wing can rise and that's by violence, stolen elections, propaganda of lies.  That has always been true and it is still true today.
We have no liberal leadership in the US because those liberal leaders are under constant threat of assassination.  Even in our own times we have seen over and again the right wing take control by violence:  Dag Hammarskjold at the UN, Walter Reuter/Union Leader, JFK and the coup which took our people's government, MLK, RFK, Jr. and many, many, many more since then.
We may have a Democratic Party which was at one time liberal but it has not been so for more than 30 years.  Both parties have been funded by the Koch Bros. and other large corporations to move government and elected officials to the right.  Koch Bros. is John Birch Society with a more than 100 year family history of working to destroy democracy in the US.
             </p>
             <p>
              PS:  Just as an exercise, check the Constitution we were all taught to honor.  Our Founders actually created an Elite Patriarchy, endowed it with land grants, gave only them the right to vote -- all while proclaiming "equality for all" -- and topped it all off by giving them immense influence and control over our "people's" government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
             </p>
             <p>
              These were the same Founders who protected the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy guaranteeing the Civil War and the long dividing of the nation into North and South which still lasts and echoes its hatreds.  They protected Slavery even down to the "Runaway Slave Act" and another 100 years of Segregation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course those Founders never bothered to stop the genocide of the native American, either.
US government created agreements with organized patriarchal religions; the Mormon and RCC churches to run "church schools" to house native American children where their identities were stolen from them.  In fact, many of the children were kidnapped from their parents.  They were beaten if they spoke in their own language.  Their braids were cut, their clothing was changed.  And, very much like we are seeing today in our institutions they were sexually abused, tortured, hung, murdered.

               No one is taking control away from women. Abortion has been legal for over 40 years. It will continue to be legal. It should not be funded with taxpayer dollars. Period. There is no control taken away.
              </p>
              <p>
               The life of the mother is but a tiny fraction of the cases involved in abortion. If the life of the mother is in danger then it should be a decision between her and her doctor. Not a walk in abortion clinic.
              </p>
              <p>
               Planned parenthood receives 1.3 billion a year in funding. Over 25% of that is private donations. The rest is federal funding.

                 MEDICAID. Tax payer funded. They get 500 million EVERY YEAR from federal/state funds and Medicaid. They perform over 300,000 abortions a year and they're involved in hiding sex trafficking, sexual abuse, underage prostitution and selling baby parts. Are you seriously trying to make the point that 500 million dollars in federal and state money is not used in any way for these activities? If you think that, there is no sane discussion to even be had.

                  Read the HYDE AMENDMENT --
PROHIBITS ANY FEDERAL FUNDS FROM BEING USED TO PAY FOR ABORTIONS
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What you might actually come to understand somewhere in this fanatical attack is that you are attacking 
females who make their own decision as to whether or not to have an abortion.
That's 300,000 individual decisions by females to have an abortion and end a pregnancy.
Are you right and they're completely wrong?
Do women have no idea as to whether or not they want to be pregnant, to go through gestation and deliver a child?
But you know what's good for them?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Again, this is fanatical -- the video was FAKED -- all evidence shows that.
Even the unedited whole film is highly questionable and contains evidence in favor of Planned Parenthood.
If they were selling baby parts -- which is illegal -- they would be arrested.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  MEDICAID FUNDS CANNOT BE USED FOR ABORTION --
NEITHER CAN OBAMACARE FUNDS BE USED FOR ABORTION --
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The people who are lying to you don't give a fig about women or abortion --
It is about controlling women.

                The Hyde Amendment prevents any Federal money from being used for abortion.
               </p>
               <p>
                What you're saying is just more right wing propaganda --
               </p>
               <p>
                Tax payers DO NOT fund abortions because that is prevented by the HYDE ACT --
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 To really understand what federal funds pay for at Planned Parenthood, you first need to know that federal tax dollars don’t pay for abortions. A decades-old, unfair law already prohibits that (except in cases of rape, incest, or when a woman’s life is in danger).
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                And, it would be helpful if you would read this link which explains that -- and also explains what kind of care you
are denying to women when you de-fund Planned Parenthood.
                <a href="https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/how-federal-funding-works-at-planned-parenthood">
                 https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/how-federal-funding-works-at-planned-parenthood
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                The life of the mother isn't only involved in late term abortions -- which are RARE.
Many young girls historically sought illegal abortions and died.
                <br/>
                Other women commit suicide.
Forcing abortions on women can also put other of her children in danger if she is
no longer able to care for them.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again -- THE HYDE AMENDMENT PREVENTS ANY FEDERAL MONEY FROM BEING USED FOR ABORTION!!!!
               </p>
               <p>
                Now that you know, spread the word.

                You're still trying to push the scam video which was heavily edited from 15 hours of taping?

               <p>
                And now you're trying to push a new fake video by the same people - a fake medical organization.

               <p>
                <em>
                 The Center for Medical Progress has release d another compilation video with some of its greatest hits – this time Planned Parenthood’s coordinated cover-up and attempt to avoid responsibility after investigators discovered it selling the body parts of aborted babies.
                </em>
               </p>
               <p>
                And, Operation Rescue is part of your debate?  Randall Terry -- pushing innocent religious believers/fanatics into 
murdering doctors by telling them "act as if you really think it's murder!"
               </p>
               <p>
                Stand up and say murdering doctors is evil -- whether you're a religious fanatic or a coward like
Randall Terry trying to get other innocent people to do his dirty work for him.

              If you have any evidence, present it.  This was 15 hours of video reduced to a few minutes.
And just as was done to Acorn, which was simply registering Democratic voters, it was all based in lies and distortion.
All history will show you that we are always in the hands of the few violent who are willing to go to any lengths to hold power.
The rise of the right is dependent upon violence, lies, propaganda -- that's always been true and it is still true today.

            As far as I'm aware there is a big linguistic argument going on about that.  I have no problem saying just Ukraine if people prefer.

             My sister actually taught him the semester before he died, and teaches at Lowndes High.  There is a lot of dis-info about what happened, and some innocent people have had their lives ripped apart because of the family of the boy.  The organs were there for the first autopsy and organs are only viable immediately after death, so I don't think this case is related.  The county pathologist might have them preserved or have a reason they didn't put them back in the body??  But I wouldn't take anything coming from the family as 100% truth... this whole time they have been trying to make it about race, and trying to profit off of the accident.

             (Sorry to sound negative, but his family has really divided the town, and lost a lot of sympathy from most people).

             Thanks, man.  Nothing new, just the old info of RTI Surgical partnering with Habitat for Humanity before.  I wish there was a better dyncorp link than just partnering with HForH but tavistock is pretty big as well.

            by Townhall in 2015 over the abortion industry use of fetal parts, baby organs. In this article the process is described where the ordering of fetal organs happens through planned parenthood.

            In the article itself the name Joseph Mengele is mentioned. He is the infamous scientist of the Nazi party that committed horrific acts on children under Hitler. He would be the mastermind of trauma based mind control MK Ultra- for example. He was brought into the US in 1948 as part of the newly formed CIA with "black budget" new name possibly Dr. Green

             SEPTEMBER 19TH, 2011
            </p>
            <p>
             Q: As you mentioned, plenary speakers at the AdvaMed Conference are very important and influential people, and this year is no different. What issues will the speakers, including former President George W. Bush and Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, address? How did they get involved in this year’s event?
            </p>
            <p>
             A: With respect to Governor O’Malley, we invited him because there is such a large medical technology industry in Maryland; it’s a key part of the O’Malley Administration strategy to get to know the industry and to foster its growth. We saw that and invited him – and we are pleased he is willing to make the trip to Washington. While a lot of Marylanders think about the bioscience medical industry in the state, Maryland is also home to many device and diagnostic companies such as BD and Qiagen.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              As for President Bush, his family has a long history of personal experience with medical devices, which helps provide a personal connection for him as a speaker.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius; the FDA Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Dr. Jeffrey Shuren; and Counselor to the FDA Commissioner John Taylor will also be part of the meeting this year.

            1:20 p.m. StemExpress: The calvarium (cranium) is mostly intact, with a tear up the back of the suture line, but all pieces look to be there. The limbs, one upper and one lower, are totally intact, with one upper broken at the humerus and one lower broken right above the knee. Please let me know if these are acceptable. I have set them aside and will await your reply.

            Tenet healthcare a major player. Heart transplants? Fetal transplants?
RTI surgical
Yes PP was caught selling baby body parts. The media lied and the Obama admin lied when this broke over a year ago. The final report issued silently December 31, 2016. 
The plan was to nominate liberal justice swing the Supreme Court after Scalia to repeal Hyde ammendment. Green light late term abortions. 
This is one of the main reason they fought Trump so hard. It is not about Pro choice. The market is huge to supply the rich new organs tissue. 
Just imagine if these evil monsters could pay ahead of time.
Trump challenged HRC on stage in debate if she was willing to take baby in final month of pregnancy. That was their goal. 
We should all be sickened by this. Trumps first action was to stop federal dollars going into third world countries for abortions. Did any of you know Obama has been sending tax money for abortions in places they do not have laws regarding fetal organ harvesting? Late term abortion.
Horrible

             And let's not forget Obama  vetoed  the Born Alive Survivors Protection act.  If an abortionist 'fails' to kill the baby, and the baby is born alive, Obama was all for leaving the infant die on the table, without medical care.  These are evil people.  Abortionists, Clinton, Obama,   Cecile Richards.

             Do you mean green light late term abortions on a federal level? 
The Hern Clinic in CO does them all 9 months and LeRoy Carhartt also does them up till the last day, though he has been utilizing a "mobile style" of late after having too many injured women and bad press at his MD office.
Those are the two most well known late term abortionists that are currently practicing.

            Great job and great find.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found an article from 2014 re Hospitals involved in the practice, but the entire article is interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2014/06/09/the-elite-are-abducting-and-murdering-u-s-children-for-their-organs/">

            "Charity Begins At Home
           </p>
           <p>
            In the United States, Nancy Scheper-Hughes identified several major U.S. hospitals who participate in these heinous practices of illegal transplants in some of the best hospitals on the east coast, including Mount Sinai, Albert Einstein in Philadelphia, and Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since I first publicized the story of Monika Wesolowski whose four-year-old son was taken and is most likely being sexually abused and very possibly trafficked, nine former CPS agents from around the country have contacted me to speak about the horrific abuses being perpetrated against American parents by CPS. Two of these agents have said that they had knowledge of abduction rings tied to child prostitution and organ harvesting. They are both frightened about the possible consequences of speaking out. However, this fact should not surprise anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conclusion
           </p>
           <p>
            Why hasn’t anyone asked the question as to why the federal government will pay a CPS organization approximately $5,000 per child that it takes away from its parents, more money is paid if the child is a minority or has a disability because the parents don’t always have the means to fight back? The child sex slavery ring and child organ harvesting trafficking begins with the federal government as they are paying CPS to seize children. Why does the federal government care if CPS seizes children? The answer should be obvious, this is the modern day version of the Selective Service Act and the subsequent drafting of our children for the right to prey upon their genitals and organs."

             In actuality the Federal government pays much more than $5000 per child.  They pay the state from $62000-$110000 per child and children with disabilities, medical complexities are the ones who are on the higher end of the reimbursements (most of which come out of the Social Security Trust Fund).  The 5k you were referring to may have been the adoption bonuses. Each state receives 5k- 10k depending on the adoptees ages and teens being on the higher end and the states receive these bounties if and only if they exceed their adoptions over the prior year.

             There is an online publication that I've read by the  name of MedicalKidnap which only publishes stories of children taken by CPS through a hospital , doctor or other medical personnel as it's been proven that many children's hospitals actually have contracts with CPS and it's thought that some of these children have been used in clinical trials.  Under the Bush Administration Congress passed a law enabling medical facilities to allow foster children to be subjected to riskier clinical trials than if that child was in the custody of the bio parents.   There's been a rash of what is now called Medical Kidnappings.

              That medical kidnap site is full of great info, though it is hard to read the stories and know that shit is happening in the freaking United States! It is terrifying to think that CPS has so much power.

             This is seriously disturbing. The more that bubbles up, the more appalling it is. This is basically human/sex/organ trafficking and racketeering by the US judiciary.

               If you count how many chemical abortions are caused by hormonal contraception, then it could indeed be that large a number.
              </p>
              <p>
               They don't count the ones caused by the Pill and other hormonal birth control. That is a major mechanism of hormonal birth control, not allowing a fertilized egg or zygote to implant.
Edit- to be sure, how could anyone really know? Pharma in the 60's hushed this up bigly when they rolled out "The Pill" to delighted Boomers.

                 One of the main mechanisms of hormonal birth control is to thin the endometrial lining and change it to make it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant. Inhospitable womb. This is why when women take the pill, their menses are usually much lighter and fewer days.

              . I believe this post was made before we had fully instituted the current submission guidelines, as well as the requirement of mods to leave a comment when making a flair with their reasoning, and when we were still tweaking the flair set. As a result, the way the OP has written it forcing the user to click and read all the links to fully understand the supporting evidence for his thesis is not optimal. I would have asked him to edit it to spell out each step, rather than just stringing together a bunch of links. Overall, though, my sense is this user is a legit researcher.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would not have given this a "New Evidence" flair, either,

              . I believe this might be worth a "Potential Lead" flair, though. He's provided links that show Clinton was paid by AdvaMed, that RTI is a member of AdvaMed, and the Daily Mail article showing
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The seized documents suggested that the remains of dead Ukrainians were destined for a factory in Germany belonging to the subsidiary of a U.S. medical products company, Florida-based RTI Biologics.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I wish all research submissions were this well sourced. Yes, this is a string of circumstantial evidence. No, it's not proof of a conclusion. But it most certainly is the kind of lead that we want posted and flaired as such to encourage further investigation, in my opinion. This is what

              if I am reading the comment thread correctly. They seem to have been discussing MF removing posts. Apparently MF was
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1624197/7930705">
               pinged
              </a>
              in one of the deleted comments, but did not post a reply in the thread.
             </p>
             <p>
              To confirm whether the comment was removed by a mod or the user, I just looked at
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1762202/8631147">
               this thread
              </a>
              , in which I suggested Psychanaut remove her comment reply and it does not specify that the comment was removed by the user, but the comment also does not show up in the removed comments area 26 days ago, where it would go if a moderator deleted it. I suspect this is due to the User Agreement, which says

              I also tried a making and deleting a test comment in one of my own submissions, and it looked exactly the same. However, I'm a mod, so that test is inconclusive. AnonOpenPress, you should make a comment somewhere you are not a mod and delete it, see whether it specifies [deleted by user] or just [deleted], and look in the Removed Comments area to see if it shows up.

               "Potential lead" would fit there nicely, as there is a great effort to try to follow the money - which is about the best way to dig into the truths.

               About the deleted comment, if there's any mod deleting either his own or user comments without explaining why, I would suggest a serious discussion in open, or (as a last option) simply to drop such mod to avoid any further problems.

                I agree completely regarding mod removal of comments. Technically, our conversation here is in the open, of course. The place for additional discussion is
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
                 v/pizzagatemods
                </a>
                if you feel like you want to make a post there. Based on your test, though, as well as my experiment, I think Michael86 removed the comment himself.

               That is definitely not the case. Only mods can flair submissions, so this was flaired by a member of the mod team of 2 months ago. Whoever the mod was, though, they did not leave a comment explaining their move, so I'll clear the flair now. FYI

             Planned Parenthood and the expose of them selling fetal tissue is just the tip of the iceberg with them. I am certain there are grotesque things going on there that we don't know how bad it is. Just the former worker testimony is enough to keep one awake.
I truly think Gosnell had all those baby and baby parts frozen for sale to places, no one knew that shit was going on at the time he was busted.

               Not surprised. Hell's Bible (how we refer to the NYT) didn't cover Gosnell when he was caught or on trial. It was "local news". Wtf.

                 I know, it is truly mind boggling. And once you're woke, you're woke, you know? There is no going back, and realizing how many people are not awake and won't listen is extremely depressing.

                 3801 Lancaster is a great docu on Gosnell. He is interviewed from prison in it, and it's scary how he sounds normal and still doesn't get what he did was serial murder and endangering the lives of poor women.

            The organ trafficking will bring them down first, I'm convinced.  Well done.  Coincidentally I earlier saw a commenter here called "skreli" and wondered if it was pharma dude- maybe he could help with insider info.

             PP is a front for everything. Harvesting babies organs &amp; tissue. To be sold transplanted to higher bidders. Sold to labs for experiments and when everyone can trace all this evidence back into the Tavistock Institute founded in part by one of the biggest child pervs know in history the "psychiatrist" Sigmund Freud who propagandize that children were the sexual aggressors early on. Inventing terms like "penis envy" and oral fixation to describe his sick research. There you have Tavistock Institute founders along with Hitler's scientist Dr. Mengele and numerous others who developed hideous programs of child torture to create spilt minds or MK Ultra. This is still happening. It was exported to the CIA in 1948 by bringing these monsters into the US under aliases who developed programs in certain hospitals. 
And Yes and Sigmund Freud is the grandfather of the aforementioned Clement Freud involved 
With the Madeline MCCann abduction with John &amp; Tony Podestas.

             Not only organs...they would harvest whole fetuses with some still alive to be sold to satanic groups for ritual sacrifice/cannibalism.

              Great Question, podesta4prison.  Ethically, it is a problem.  Using human beings as commodities.  It should horrify us that we're detroying a fellow human being to benefit another one,   (Personally, I think people would be horrified that we did that to dogs.  But not so much for people. )
Legally, use of human embryonic stem cells derived from established stem cell lines ( from previously aborted humans ) was legalized by  George Bush for federally funded research.  The thinking is, ' well, the cells are of no use now, we're going to throw it out, why throw away these good cells' .  That opened up Pandoras Box.
 Then,  In 2009,  Obama  signed an executive order that repealed a Bush policy limiting federal dollars for human stem cell research.
              <br/>
              Recently, you must know that the NIH has attempted to combine human cells, and tissues with animal tissues.  This has been discussed on VOAT.   So you see how far we've fallen.
              <br/>
              ****It is interesting to note that scientists have achieved  great success from using adult stem cells ( undifferentiated cells from adults bone marrow, etc.).  But the use of embryonic stem cells ( from aborted fetuses) has been problematic-- tumor cells,  undifferentiated cells, see more here.

               Makes you wonder if PP is talking scared/confused women into having abortions too??  Are they trying to fill an order?  We need 50 livers by Tuesday.. better get some more patients in for an abortion!

                this video

               , of an ex-PP employee.  She is talking about getting pressured to get more abortions done for the revenue, but the real revenue might have been selling that parts &amp; organs!

            Thanks for the post.  I would be incredibly surprised if PP wasn't selling fetal organs, marrow and tissue.  I used to doubt the Project Veritas videos authenticity but after reading about all the aborted babies being harvested in the Ukraine I learned there is a fortune being made off of it.  Stem cells from the marrow appears to be the most coveted part.

             Glad you know the truth now! The news really tried to discredit Project Veritas' reports on PP.  As you know by now, it is true.  So awful.  The whole  issue of late term abortions.  Not necessary to save the life of the mother.  But the organs of the children bring big bucks to companies.  People should watch all of those videos.

            All of that disease is gonna be another scandal in itself
People paying good money for organs etc only to receive 
Damaged goods which will put them to an early grave
That's gonna be hell to pay don't ya think

He let one of the presidents of the Millennium Villages speak on the subject and I highly suspect that that organization is a front for trafficking.  Also it is good to learn about what is going on in China.

              your post is fantastic. I agree with you on Francis, the details of this organ trafficking are disgusting, my link was only to help expose the practice of it. A few weeks ago I would have thought organ trafficking was limited to people in traffic accidents.

            TUTOGEN
           </p>
           <p>
            18 Sep 2009
           </p>
           <p>
            "A German medical firm is under investigation after accusations that it paid a middleman to cannibalise corpses in Eastern Europe so they could be sold to hospitals in the West.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tutogen, a German subsidiary of America's RTI Biologics, is alleged to have bought up the bones, cartilage, tendons, skin, eye corneas, and heart valves from thousands of corpses for implantation in living Western patients.
           </p>
           <p>
            The value of a single corpse to the medical industry can be worth over £150,000 and the gruesome market has sometimes attracted unscrupulous and criminal operators. The trade is worth £600 million in the United States every year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lena Krat, Ukrainian woman, has accused Tutogen of profiting from her father's body after buying his remains from a Ukrainian company which had misled her into signing a consent form.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I was so upset that I couldn't think clearly," she told Der Spiegel. "If I had known that so much is cut out, I would never have given my consent."
           </p>
           <p>
            Joseph Düsel, a senior state prosecutor in Bamberg, told The Daily Telegraph that his office was investigating the allegations.
"The state prosecutor is at this time exploring whether to open a formal preliminary proceeding against the responsible parties at the firm Tutogen because of breaches of the transplantation and medicines laws," he said....

            I recommend Tenet Healthcare as a lead on organ harvesting as well. Jeb Bush was on their board and stepped down during the election. Tenet worked with the Clinton Foundation in a big way. I have posts on this as well.

             Prescott Bush was listed as treasurer of Planned Parenthood in its early days.
Wouldn't be too surprising to find Jeb has links to a shady healthcare group. The Bushes are linked to the Clintons since the early Mena Airport Days

              Bush was on the Board of Tenet Healthcare but had to leave when he ran for President.  Very shady outfit.  Look at the Posts of Wolftrail7272.  Phenomenal.

             If these clues keep coming, we will be able to put it all together in one neat package.  I wonder if Rick Scott is tied to all of this too.  Jeb Bush is the one that pulled his rear out of the water after he bilked Medicare out of Millions.  Being Gov he could pull a lot of strings for these companies in Florida.  He committed his crime with Medicare while living in Texas, the home of Tenet Healthcare.

              Hey, check this out.. I posted this elsewhere but looks more relevant here, Ill see if you think its worth its own thread and where to put it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The earthquake in Haiti happened in 2010.
In other research I was doing I realized that 5 democratic politicians got very wealthy around that time in an article published the following year.
I wonder what the Clintons, Podestas, Huma, Bush's and other portfolios look like..
I copy and pasted my original text and the link, let me know what you think
             </p>
             <p>
              I post this in another thread: 
In regards to Haiti and the earthquake of 2010 The very next year a few democratic politicians got pretty wealthy. Organ harvesting, stem cell harvesting and human and child sex slave trafficking bring in big bucks. Just sayin'..
             </p>
             <p>
              Six of the top wealthiest politicians (when this was written in 2011) were democrat. That's some big doe.

               It ties everything up.  I think it is definitely worth it's own thread.  I read the article.  They are not satisfied with investment profits anymore.  They now us our kids to enrich their bank accounts.  And slit us open so they can live longer.  They are the bottom of the barrel.

                We are nothing to them.  What was it Hillary said about us in the emails or maybe it was Huma who said it about what she thinks about us.

                Where should I create this? Which subverse?

               <p>
                Something else I thought of.. 
The  NWO requires population control.   If the Clintons did create that earthquake with an underground nuclear explosion, well.. ding ding ding... that's quite a bit of evil wrapped up in one big expensive bow.

                 I am ready to believe they created the earthquake.  I also believe the cabal created Katrina as well.  After what we have all learned, I put nothing past them.  I think you could really submit the Posting here, for I believe that the reason the have all added so much wealth, much more than you can make from investments, is the demand for trafficked organs, especially by those that can afford them.   I shudder to think what will happen when they figure out how to sell the blood of the young to their friends, and make it legal.  This is what we must fight and push those that are not involved in their filthy dirty habits. And about what she said about us, I remember that she called some people deplorables, I believe she thinks we are ALL deplorables, not only Trump voters.  Little did she know that many Democrats voted for Trump too.  I know a few, and that is because they hate her so much.

               I have been suspicious of March of Dimes for years.  We know about their Clinton connection we just have to find very incriminating proof.  Thanks for the heads up.  Tenet is definitely involved big time.  Wolftrail7272 has been on their trail for awhile now.  Check out his posts.  They are awesome. The organ harvesting is the big money, the pedophile connection is a cover up and ruse.  Fiona Barnett tweeted this out last week.

              I've been reading through the links in your post &amp; comments for 2 hours. I think my husband might actually be somewhat convinced in all my "Conspiracy" talk the last few months. He's very much against planned parenthood so tying pieces together on the organ trafficking/killing babies etc with other Clinton related activities isn't as much of a stretch.

              Great Find. Props to you. Shows why we can't let the big bad Russians control Crimea.

              Now to see who has floated between government and these companies. Who are their lobbyists, what congress critters do they support, what law firms represent them, who are their international subsidiaries, what other companies are these executives major holders in? Down the rabbit hole we go.
