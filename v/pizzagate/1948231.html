<p>Q. Who are we talking to?</p>
<p>A. Still Wesley. And it was still early in the afternoon and stuff by the time we got there.  This guy said this is the one they wanted and stuff.  I as, I don\'t remember which personality it was, didn\'t want anything to do with it.  <strong>Emilio</strong> took me for a little drive, stuck a gun in my head on a dirt road and told me I either did this or he was going to blow my brains out right there and then.  At that point I agreed to go along with whatever, you, they want and stuff.  Went back to the hotel. That\'s where <strong>Tony</strong>, who is another guy, not me, he was an older guy and stuff. <strong>He had a lot of pock marks on his face, kind of skinny. He also can pose as a woman, which he has done on numerous occasions.</strong>  <strong>He or tony, myself, and Mike went into the other hotel room while Emilio, this guy named Sam, and another guy talked in the hotel room.</strong> And were discussing, i guess, the details of how things were going to go down.  Later on brought all three of us back in, <strong>Tony, myself and Mike</strong>, and they put up some chairs like it would be a car, and driving, and they said this is how we\'re going to do it. <strong>You and Mike</strong> will be in the back seat when we pull up to where this kid\'s at and stuff, we\'re going to ask him a question. We\'re going to go around the block. Which they did.  Then they came back and stuff and they had myself and <strong>Mike</strong> out of the car and stuff. I went up to him, asked him a question. And at that point he was close enough to the car where <strong>Tony had pulled up in a van</strong> and they pushed him in the car, and they had a rag with chloroform in the bag that they had us stick over his face. And then put it back in the bag after he was out.  After that point they told <strong>all three of us</strong> to stay down in the back seat so nobody could see us. I think it was also so we couldn\'t see out to see where we were at. And at that point we drove several miles and stuff, we met up with a station wagon and a van several times and stuff. Which I know <strong>Tony was driving one of them, and this other guy, I believe name was Sam was driving the other.</strong> Several times they <strong>had us switch vehicles with Johnny and stuff.</strong> And eventually we ended up in the back of the van, <strong>a white van.</strong>  And we drove from there, the car that had originally taken Johnny and drove east toward, they said that he was going to drive eas toward like Chicago. And the station wagon that we transferred him into and stuff, they were going to have it driving going down south so that if anybody had seen anything and stuff they\'d have it going out in different directions.  But what they did was out in the country where there was nothing but corn fields and stuff where you couldn\'t see anything, they stopped and transferred him into the van. That why nobody would ever see the actual vehicle that was going west toward Omaha.  And we did stop, we did go through <strong>Council Bluffs</strong> because they made up stop at a place that I kind of know kind of well and stuff over in Council Bluffs. It was, at the time I believe it was called <strong>The Joker Lounge</strong>, which strangely enough is <strong>owned by, was owned by my, one of my uncles.</strong> And they went in, they just went in to get some drinks. And nothing that went on there. They left us out in the car. But that\'s when I peeked my head out. <strong>Cause they had a curtain in the van where you couldn\'t see out the front and they had curtains on the side on side windows.  It didn\'t have windows on the back but it had some side windows on the side too.</strong> I peeked out, that\'s when I seen <strong>The Joker Lounge</strong> and I recognized it because of the fact my uncle owned it. And I\'m not sure if it was <strong>Fat Jacks or The Joker</strong> at the time, they\'ve changed so many times.  But then we drove up to <strong>Sioux City, Iowa</strong>. Which is where we stayed for the night. And the next day they took me back to Omaha. And --</p>
<p>Q. What happened that night?</p>
<p>A. That night at first <strong>Emilio</strong> and this couple other guys went into town to drink. And they left <strong>me, Mike, and Johnny</strong> in a room that had no windows on it. That they had locked from the outside of the room and stuff. They lock us all three in this room. And that night when they got back they ordered me and Mike to do some things with, sexual things with Johnny. And they filmed it so that they could sell the film or whatever they were going to do with it.  And then I know that they took me, they next day they took me back home. And then a couple of months later of months later I got a chance to take a trip out to Colorado. And that\'s where I seen Johnny Gosch the second time. And at that point he was staying with a guy that I only knew as <strong>The Colonel</strong>.  And it was <strong>a kind of ranch house but it was out, had a raised floor, underneath there was a space that had been dug out.</strong> And that\'s where they kept some of the kids at and stuff when they caused trouble or were bad. And they had <strong>a lot of lookouts on this road</strong> and stuff. If anyone was to even get close to the place that the kids could be taken up into the hills before anybody could ever get there.  It was also the same place that in 92 when I, 92 or early 93 when I got out of prison where America\'s Most Wanted had taken myself and Roy Stephens to Colorado and stuff to see if I could find any of these places where they had taken us.  And I had no idea that Roy had been in that same area.  He\'d never found the house. He had found elephant rock and some other places that stood out to, you know, would have stood out to anybody and stuff that had been in this house, because it\'s visible from the house. And he had been down that road.  But I didn\'t find the main road that he, that you would think most people would find, because when they took us to this house they always took us up, I guess up the road and stuff where we have to take an old raggedy bridge across I believe the Arkansas River and alongside the river.  And when they took us out there I was shocked, because as we were going on this road <strong>a guy popped out of the middle of nowhere with a radio, which I\'m sure they could tell you that, this guy popped out and he had a radio and stuff. And I have never told anybody up to this time and stuff, but that\'s one of the guys who was involved.</strong></p>
<p>Q. Involved in the kidnapping?</p>
<p>A. Involved in the kidnapping.</p>
<p>Q. Did you know who he was?</p>
<p>A. I never knew his name. All I know he was close friends with <strong>the Colonel</strong> and arranged for auctions. And shortly, I mean, I, shortly after we drove past him he went back up into the woods I believe, made some calls. And that\'s why we wouldn\'t have found nothing in that town.  I think they knew in advance that we were there because we\'d stayed in some hotels and stuff going out there and stuff. That I believe that they knew we were in the area and they hightailed it out.  Because when we went to the other road that I had recognized and stuff we stopped at this <strong>guy\'s house who was a mailman</strong>. And shortly after we left his house he was hightailing it down to the trailer park which I had talked about.  And I don\'t know, we don\'t know what happened because we just seen his mail truck going down to the <strong>trailer park</strong> and it wasn\'t a mail run because it was way too late for that.</p>

<p>Is there anyone else who has heavily researched the Finders that could find correlations between Bonaccis\' testimony and the Finders group?</p>
