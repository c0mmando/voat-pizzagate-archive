</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Foundling Hospital itself bought back 2.5 acres (10,000 m²) of land in 1937 and built a new headquarters and a children\'s centre on the site. ..The original charity still exists as Coram, registered under the name <strong>Thomas Coram Foundation for Children</strong>, and is one of London\'s largest children\'s charities, operating in adjacent buildings constructed in the 1950s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Coram Foundation for Children</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coram is structured as an umbrella group of charities working with vulnerable children in different areas. Coram\'s headquarters are at Brunswick Square in London, but they work with children and young people across the UK and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Adoption</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coram Adoption is an independent adoption service working in London, the East Midlands and Cambridgeshire.[2] They also work in partnership with local authorities.[3] Their partnership with the London Borough of Harrow was the first use of the model.[4][5] Coram were also one of the pioneers of \'concurrent planning\' (also known as \'foster to adopt\'), and received government funding to become a \'National Centre of Excellence in Early Years Permanence\' in 2012.[6][7] In 2015 the British Association for Adoption and Fostering went into administration. <strong>Coram took over many of the services in England</strong>, offering a total of £40,000 and taking on 50 of the 135 employees. The membership, training and research organisation became CoramBAAF. The Independent Review Mechanism (England) was taken over by Coram Children\'s Legal Centre. The National Adoption Register for England is now run by First4Adoption (jointly run by Coram and Adoption UK).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>(The) transfer of services to Coram has caused concern among adoption and fostering agencies that were members of BAAF</strong>. TACT’s Elvin, for example, is uneasy about BAAF services now being part of a group that includes another adoption agency.”</p>
<p>“BAAF was an umbrella agency, Coram’s an adoption provider, so they are in the same space as us,” he says. “It doesn’t feel comfortable with, particularly the Independent Review Mechanism where we are being asked to hand over commercially sensitive information to a rival agency. I’m not sure the DfE has been well advised to allow these contracts to be handed over.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a crisis within the family court sector in the UK what with forced adoptions and secret family court hearings.  Disturbingly in 2014, a leading <strong>LSE legal academic Helen Reece called on Theresa May to allow pedophiles to adopt</strong> : <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/1397090/let-pedophiles-adopt-children-says-leading-academic/">Let pedophiles adopt children</a> </p>
<p>Controversial <strong>Reece seems to have teamed up with the equally controversial Barbara Hewson who has called for the lowering of the age of consent in the UK</strong>: <a href="http://journals.kent.ac.uk/index.php/feministsatlaw/article/view/80/239">http://journals.kent.ac.uk/index.php/feministsatlaw/article/view/80/239</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The arguments advanced by both Helen Reece and Barbara Hewson are deeply problematic for two reasons: they appeal to existing rape myths in society and they fail to root their claims in evidence. This storify piece sets out how the responses to the event developed on Twitter. As feminist academics we wish to condemn the decision of the LSE Law Department to hold this event <strong>and to continue to defend it</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, the Coram group (including Coram Adoption) seems to be quite powerful with its connections to family services, legal chambers and various very well connected charities.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Foundling Hospital still has a legacy on the original site. Seven acres (28,000 m²) of it were purchased for use as a playground for children with financial support from the <strong>newspaper proprietor Lord Rothermere</strong>  [of the Daily Mail]. This area is now called Coram\'s Fields and owned by an independent charity, Coram\'s Fields and the Harmsworth Memorial Playground. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rothermere is good buddies with <strong>David Cameron</strong> - for example : <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XNNuw">https://imgur.com/a/XNNuw</a></p>
<p>The trustees on the board of the St Andrew\'s Charity are also numerous and well connected - including some high level <strong>connections to the Prince\'s Trust</strong> <a href="http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1095045&amp;subid=0">http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1095045&amp;subid=0</a></p>

            HAH!  Well an alarm went off probably for most of us that saw the pictures of the Fashion Show.  Something was amiss.  Also while not exactly the same situation as our CPS stealing children from parents and handing them off willy nilly, there seams to be Fishy Nonsense being committed by the govt.  And if this Reece and Hewson are involved and thrown into the mix I fear for the children.  These people seem to have not regard for the placement of the children so there is some kind of cover up or actually it seems that they are doing this in the open to some extent, for after reading this it seems pretty obvious that this whole operation is not above board.  It seems that over in the UK and in the US they are doing some really underhanded things right in the open and in plain sight.
