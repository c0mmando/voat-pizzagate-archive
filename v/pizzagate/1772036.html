            I take issue with your article.  I am a daily listener to AJ.   He is the ONLY one that I am aware of who is DAILY, especially now, talking about going after the pedos.  Rush, Hannity, Ingram, Coulter are mum.  Breitbart and Daily Caller are dismissive of it.  Drudge doesn't really point to it either.  If I just listened to/read other conservative media, I would think this wasn't as big an issue as we all know it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            So back to your article.  You said, "According to Alex, the information about “code words” wrapped in pizza rhetoric was actually planted by the DS."  Please provide a sound bite or a link to that.  I have listened multiple times and I never heard him say that.
           </p>
           <p>
            You also said, "THAT is what started the crowd sourcing on 4Chan, and Reddit that uncovered the overwhelming evidence on Comet Pizza and other pedophile networks in general, commonly now known as PizzaGate."    There is not overwhelming evidence that Comet Pizza is a pedophile network.  There is plenty of stuff that makes it worthy of an investigation but there is no proof of child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            You said: "Alex accuses Bible believers of being DS plants to make him look bad."  I have never heard him say anything close to this.  I'm calling B.S. on this.  Please provide link to where he says this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, you said "Alex also blamed the push of Pizza Gate on INTERNET TROLLS."  I have never ever heard him say this.  You must provide a source for this as well.  If I had I would be furious.

            To me this article is divisive and something that would hurt our cause, not help.  Are you a JA troll?  If not, consider of what benefit to our cause was it to write this article.  You are attacking the only person who is getting the word out about these pedos to
            <strong>
             millions of people
            </strong>
            .  No one else is talking about pedogate, especially on a daily basis that can reach as many people.  We need people red pilled for goodness sake.  He is even including the spiritual dimension in this which is huge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did he back off on JA?  I don't know.  But what seems clear is that when JA says jump, people jump.  More proof JA is a powerful person.  I'm curious why he is untouchable.
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW, you didn't PROVE any of your points. Without links to sources it sounds more like you have an ax to grind with AJ.  For those of you who would like to listen, re-listen to these conversations referenced in the article please see below:

             <em>
              I
             </em>
             am a daily listener as well, and the article shows I've supported Alex for nearly 20 years. However, pressure like the kind I and others have put on Alex after he fired Joe Biggs over Pizza Gate are precisely why Alex has been forced to cover it more, and he's only RECENTLY given it more attention. However, campaigns against low-level pedophiles is not much of a victory when you distract from the people who are financing the operations, which is precisely what PG has drawn attention to.
            </p>
            <p>
             And you apparently weren't listening to the same program. If Pizza Gate was a distraction, and PG began by the recognition of code words, and the DS planted the PG as a conspiracy, then common sense tells you they planted the bug that started the investigation, which means planting the code words (not to mention Alex DID say that).
            </p>
            <p>
             And there not being "overwhelming evidence" is a strawman argument. Nobody advocating for Pizza Gate has there's overwhelming evidence that Alefantes was guilty of pedophelia, but overwhelming evidence that there's enough to warrant an official investigation: of which there's been none.
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding "internet trolls", it's clear you are merely SAYING that you listened to all the broadcasts because I'm not the only one who heard it
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1745195">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1745195
             </a>
             Google the rest because VOAT is claiming the other links are "BANNED DOMAINS", and perhaps you should look at Alex Twitter feed announcing his apology and look at all the references his own followers made about his "internet trolls" comments.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now those few links above you could have retrieved yourself in 5 minutes, so there's no point in responding to the rest of your book here because you clearly didn't do your research before responding. The very fact that you called me an Alefantis troll when I'm here defending PizzaGate, and have been a long time Infowars supporter shows you didn't read my article in the proper context, which begs the question of who the real troll is. Furthermore, this isn't my first VOAT post if you'd have bothered to look. Furthermore, I've had that website for several years, and my Twitter account has 54K followers, hardly the characteristics of a troll account.
            </p>
            <p>
             And if you read the OPENING OF THE ARTICLE, I stated at the outset, the point wasn't to PROVE PizzaGate, but to refute ALEX'S LOGIC AGAINST IT which doesn't require links beyond where to find his own comments on what I was rebutting.  That apparently went right over your head.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yes, I have an axe to grind with Alex which occurred AFTER he made those comments. Having an axe to grind is not of itself a rebuttal to an argument. If it were, your argument would be invalid on its face since it's pretty obvious you have an axe to grind against me.

            Anybody that plays George Strait songs, and knows George Strait songs, (as well as some other hard core country songs) can't be that bad.  And AJ knows his George Strait.  IMHO.

             You judge someone by the music they like , or pretend to like? One thing about all this : it got the swarm of snakes rising to the top of the river water, so you can see them all with your own eyes. All the music cultures are engineered. -

            Why are we saying could be? They absolutely are there's no other explanation for their recent actions. It's almost certain Cernovich was given the Susan Rice information beforehand to give him credibility. Now watch Cernovich sabotage pg in the both realms of mainstream and alternative. People who have never believed or given Jones any credit are mind bogglingly turning to his word when he says sorry for covering pg to his asspussy hugging master James Alefuckface. Sorry to people who still think Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich ever had good intentions but they've exposed themselves

             My thoughts exactly. Elites knew Cern would be on the AJ Show, and discussing a different topic, but in agreeing with Alex on PG, he damaged the credibility of both on pedophile investigations. Cernovich already said that someone else already had the story at NYT and Bloomberg, they just sat on it. So it's not like he did some fantastic journalism to get information nobody else had. But then when you go on 60 Minutes and defend PG, followed by rejecting it a week later on Infowars, doesn't do much for your credibility.

            If 60 minutes had him on and not as a gotcha victim, he's control. Probably deep state operative tasked with becoming the leader of those they fear and they will give him a bone to throw your way every so often. You could even expect that 60 Minutes had to publicize Cernovich before they tasked him with exposing Rice because they knew there was no way Rice wasn't gonna be exposed and they needed a "Pizzagate Guy" to do it so that they could dismiss it. They establish beforehand that their control guy peddles "fake news".

           <p>
            We all have different perspectives on Pizzagate. IT'S FUCKING OK! Holy shit, people!!! What is this? We are here for THE KIDS. AJ has a role to play, Cernovich has a role to play, David seaman has a role to play and YOU have a role to play. We are on the same team! It's ok if you don't agree with all the other players all the time! Go take a walk, get some fresh air. There are people here who started distancing themselves from ex-navy seal Sawyer because "hmm, I'm not sure if he's legit.." FUCK THIS! This is so stupid. We have to be more intelligent than this. Don't you realize that it's what "they" want? They want that we fight among ourselves and destroy our very own initiative.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLEASE, I implore you, try to remember why you are here.

              I was kind of pissed off when I wrote this. Sorry if I offended you, nothing personal. You have a right to be suspicious of other people. I'm just completely discouraged to see people fighting among themselves and trying to expose each other. People have been blasting Seaman, Jones, Titus Frost, Cernovich and others for a long time and it doesn't change anything. Most people who liked Seaman for example still like him today even with the non-stop bashing. So what does it give?
             </p>
             <p>
              It really feels like the pizzagate community is on the verge of self-destructing as a result, really sad.

               NP. The beef between Titus and Seaman is clearly a personal one with some petty acts done by Seaman's IF TRUE about his reporting them, and Titus blaming everything on Zionism (which is pretty much no different than liberals blaming everything on Russia and calling anyone conservative a Nazi). This with Alex isn't personal.

              I don't have to read the article  V___Z, I read the title and I know it's about creating division within the pizzagate community and therefore I understand it's bullshit, not worth my time. I'm not here for the drama. I'm here to help children.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not very fond of Titus Frost. I think he's very immature and juvenile. I also think that David Seaman should give credit to other researchers instead of talking about "people attacking him". I think that Alex Jones is playing the "fear card" way too much.
             </p>
             <p>
              Still I respect these 3 individuals. I won't waste my time trying to destroy them just because I don't agree with everything they say. They expose pedophilia and satanic child abuse in their own way. They deserve respect and I love them for that.

               Alex jones is spreading disinfo, and caused division by maligning pizzagate researchers. If someone is telling untruths, then there should be division, just as Jesus threw out the money changers. This is war.

               AMEN!!!!  BTW, I did read the article and you are absolutely correct.  Totally divisive.  As far as a surgical dissection, not so much. If it was surgical, he would have had links to back up his inflammatory statements.  He had not a one.

            james is the core person of interest... he wasn't singled out because he's a pizza shop owner who has a creepy instagram and friends in high places... he was singled out because he is clearly the individual to who all other power-players are tied.. and in case that isn't clear, there is the added fact that he's the most viciously protected and defended actor in the entire pizzagate scandal... even more so than hillary.. there's only one reason to execute that much damage control for one person. if i had to guess, i'd guess james is the cia-operative center of the operation.... if there's a goliath in pizzagate, a capstone individual - it is without question, james alefantis... if james fall, they all fall.
           </p>
           <p>
            i've wondered if the false-narrative end-game plan b is hillary's fall.. (where plan a is just change it to pedo-gate and forget felling the giants, and plan b is ok they won't let go, let's give them choice 1 podesta or choice 2 last ditch effort sacrifice hillary).. i'm sure we'd all love to see hillary fall (especially the folks who've suffered under her hand)... but at this point, even hillary could go down without sufficiently tearing the veil.... there's an unholy trinity of pizzagate actors... James, Hillary, Podesta. in that order. their exposure will be what brings down the entire house of cards. the "#pedogate only" narrative doesn't allow for that.
           </p>
           <p>
            we have the option to replace their false narrative with the truth, tho..
           </p>
           <p>
            pizzagate was manifested when we the people united as a "sea of chaos" refusing to be thought-controlled and demanding justice for the children - in this unprecedented time when that justice can for once be delivered.
           </p>
           <p>
            nothing about pizzagate is new.
           </p>
           <p>
            the only new thing, is that unprecedented opportunity to expose this worst of long-hidden truths to the world-at-large... thus, delivering the largest, widest-ranging, and most-effective red-pill truth-bomb in human history..
           </p>
           <p>
            not because innocent children are being sold, tortured and destroyed by the elite...
           </p>
           <p>
            but because innocent children are being sold, tortured and destroyed by these particular elites.. James, Hillary, Podesta - especially james. he's the hidden hand in this entire affair.. he's what the establishment wants to hide from everyone... that's why it was his pizza place that the false-flag "shooter" chose... why the march 18th protest which started at his pizza place was so violently ridiculed... and why the march on the 25th was focused on "pedogate"
           </p>
           <p>
            because, in the end, if push came to shove, the PTB would be ok with the following final headlines:

            Case. Closed.
           </p>
           <p>
            that shouldn't be allowed to happen.. not because james is the core.. but because exposing the core is what reveals the inner workings.. revealing the inner workings is the truth that will change the world..
           </p>
           <p>
            exposing the truth that changes the world is what we the people came together to do. there are more of us than there are of them... and we're all smarter and more talented than they are... our global, diversified unity is more unified than theirs... our deep-state is deeper than theirs.. and most of all, our narrative isn't a narrative; it's the truth, and that truth is what makes people free... that is their ultimate fear and number one foe (and our greatest weapon).
           </p>

              Yes - JA is the most powerful person of interest in Pizzagate.... my theory is, he's the cia elite placeman at the core of the trafficking and satanic aspect... he's soooo hard to touch.. Almost untouchable... but the truth is coming out... his days are numbered.

           <p>
            or
           </p>
           <p>
            b) pull ourselves together en masse and demand judgement on the "big names" of pizzagate
           </p>
           <p>
            we have a real opportunity to see these elites brought to justice... it's hard to imagine that will come from any shiny name...
           </p>
           <p>
            the opportunity itself is the real miracle in this all... it seems like we're being asked to trade that miracle for a temporary victory... let's reject that and go for the giants of pizzagate... exposing that core is what will awaken the slumbering masses more than anything else.

            the marches started the smoke signals.. they realize they have to take a stab at altering the narrative now, before that smoke turns into wildfire... that's why they're begging trump to denounce sandy hook truthers... so they can do the same for pizzagate truthers.... they want to give us consolation arrests and placate us with "hey we're talking about "pedo"gate... isn't that enough?" but we can't let them have this.. pizzagate is a blackswan and the biggest redpill the world may ever know... and they just can't have it, because we're not going to let them.
           </p>
           <p>
            all this proves they're afraid, for once, of being held accountable... we can't stop telling the Truth about #pizzagate.

            Having a different opinion on pizzagate makes him a controlled opposition? If he was a true shill, then he'd deny pedogate all together. He's clearly doing good after donating 100k to Craig Sawyer's organization. And Mike Cernovich just broke a bombshell news story about Susan Rice - do you really think the opposition wants him to break those stories? They're trying to bury that story, even CNN won't cover it. My dad doesn't believe in pizzagate either(even after I showed him all of the evidence) , does that mean my dad is bought and paid for by the elite? No, it just means he has a different opinion

             Having a different opinion is what prompted the article, but because he vilified those researching it internet trolls which included members of his own staff and  guests he's had on his show. It damaged his own credibility as well as all the people who follow him.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Cernovich "breaking" a story gives the impression he had information he obtained that the elite didn't already have. If you read Bloomberg, another reporter from Bloomberg and NYT already had the story. Cernovich simply published it ahead of them, but you have to ask since they were sitting on it, how did Cernovich get it in the first place?
            </p>
            <p>
             I laid out the argument on the article as to why I believe Alex is controlled opposition. If you can't respond to the specific points I made, and just foist a strawman about me attacking him because he has a "different opinion", no point in arguing further because I'm not going to repeat myself over something I've already written.

            For someone as experienced as TraitorTwat Jones supposedly is, his tapings of his shows are very poorly made! The eyes are never looking in the direction his body faces, they dart around way too much, and blinking is so unbelievable!

             Your paper is flawed, terribly flawed. I am toying with the idea of dismantling it on the technical level for VOAT readers.You need new material V____Z and some new interest, like trying to put bad people behind bars. You've devoted an inordinate amount of time to trying to prove Jones is CIA operative protecting pedo rings, and it is so disgusting, I cannot remotely let you get away with it. In the last twenty-two years,
             <strong>
              Jones has dedicated more broadcasting hours to telling the story of satanic child sex abuse than any other person living or dead
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             What have you done besides attempt to destroy Jones by claiming he's CIA pedophile cover? And why don't you man up instead of playing fast and loose with word play. Why don't you tell us what you really think? What would you tell Nancy Schaefer tonight if her spirit were to visit you? Are you going to tell her that Jones is a closet pedophile who had her on the show to tell her desperate story about CPS child kidnapping as a trick on listeners? Are you going to tell her that Jones has been working all these years for the same entity that suicided her and her husband?

              I must say, I'm not surprised this is coming from an Alex Jones fanatic. It's very creepy. You shouldn't have to rely on anything but the facts, not threats or ad hominems, and why you would even think of harming someone just for exposing some shock jock on the Internet is beyond me, but again, super creepy.

               I have never been big on forums, but for the few I've committed to participating in here and there, I have never come across anyone who was more adept at proving how delusional and misguided they were through their responses. Allow me to demonstrate.
              </p>
              <p>
               The probability of us actually learning our identities and having occasion to meet at some mutually attended event and then engage in fisticuffs is so low, one is left breathless as to how you took it as a literal threat. In current context, its called a figure of speech or literary device, i.e., your claims are so vile and outrageous, you are apt to move someone who is peaceful and absolutely adores all animals and children, someone who actually catches and releases house spiders, to imagine an act of violence. But I am beginning to appreciate your disablities, so to clarify, I am not actually planning to discover who you are and hunt you down to pummel you.
              </p>
              <p>
               Continuing, I am not an Alex Jones fanatic, I am an Alex Jones expert. I know jones’s real mistakes and flaws in a way you never will. Jones has made a litany of errors over twenty-two years of broadcasting, and few people are more capable of reeling them off than I. Jones has made a litany of errors because anyone who takes to the airwaves three hours a day for twenty-two years about the most complicated and controversial subjects known is going to make mistakes. It’s inevitable. But they reside in the very long shadow cast by the body of work for which I hold him in the highest esteem.
              </p>
              <p>
               The facts remain undisputed by you and everyone else. In addition to revealing incredible crimes against humanity like MMR vaccines decimating children with autism, Jones has put more broadcasting hours into revealing the world is run by a satanic child sex slavery consortium than any other person living or dead. Jones has featured some of the greatest people on his show, people who had ordinary lives and yet put them at perilous risk to tell the truth, people like Dr. Andrew Wakefield, Nancy Schaefer, Ted Gunderson, and John De Camp, people who will literally find themselves standing beside the Good Lord for their good work when He returns that terrible day to roam the Earth.
              </p>
              <p>
               THE CIA DOES NOT RUN INFOWARS SO JONES CAN HOLD THESE PEOPLE UP TIME AND AGAIN FOR TWO DECADES AS THE VERY STANDARD WE SHOULD STRIVE TO ATTAIN!

              But what percentage of his talking was truth, and what was, as another commenter here points out, what is being fed to him by his handlers?

             <p>
              I think Alex is a disinfo agent of the highest order, and always has been. He's  dangerous to the truth movement. I also think it's strange that this Alex Jones cheerleading on Voat was not here before his big apology, and that it isn't organic. I think he has a lot to loose by loosing his audience and it would serve him to have people try to control the narrative &amp; get his followers back, no matter what it takes. You've excused every single thing by repeating that no one talks more than AJ. That proves nothing.

               According to you, Jones is CIA, goes rogue on Alefantis for a few weeks until head office notices, gets a phone call from chief that Alefantis is actually on Jones's team. Jones then goes on offense for Alefantis  by going after all other Pedo rings in America, which are also protected by CIA, but for some unexplained reason, they're expendable. Meanwhile, Jones hires ace frontman and wordsmith named RWB to pull back a flock of perhaps 10 disgruntled former listeners who are actually deep reading VOAT/pizzagate threads. And meanwhile, over twenty-two years Jones has managed to hoodwink every NWO, NSA, big pharma, vaccines, CPS, chemtrail, satanic Illuminati researcher of any repute that has come on his show, and yes, even the only person to run for president in the last forty years who should have won.

            As a fellow Christian and someone who has followed Jones for a long time, I have to take issue with your article on virtually all counts. I maintain you have finally fallen for the same propaganda marched out by Jones's most vehement enemies for years. I've commented extensively on why Infowars was targeted as the preeminent organization which to strong arm into a retraction. In response, Jones is doing everything he can obliquely to continue the fight again Satanic child sex slavery. Here are a just a few links to some of my recent remarks here at VOAT. I maintain that on a point by point basis, Jones's commitment to wanting to see the end of child sex slavery is unassailable. I see responses to my remarks here and there, but I cannot recall anyone proving any individual point wrong, and this should tell the careful reader something.

             No offense, but that's about the nuttiest analysis I've ever read. The article I wrote clearly said I've been a Infowars supporter for 20 years. If Alex Jones is a Christian Syncretist that gives false information about who God is, and attacks Bible believing street preachers, then me having issue with that makes me a prey to the propaganda against him on the LEFT? Are you kidding me? What kind of warped logic is that? What I have issue with about Alex is entirely different from what the LEFT attacks him over; and I don't disagree with you that the majority of what the Left/MSM attacks him over his contrived crap.
            </p>
            <p>
             And how can I trust a man who says he's willing to go to war, stands up to Hillary "Body Count" Clinton, but get's "strong armed" into capitulating to a PIZZA STORE OWNER? People end up dead over Hillary, but you're afraid of a pizza shop nerd? Doesn't add up, especially when Alex tells people "You want to sue me? BRING IT ON".
            </p>
            <p>
             And I did prove all those points wrong in the article. Alex was wrong about HOW Pizzagate started; he was wrong about WHEN Pizzagate started, he was wrong about WHO pushed it into the public spotlight (it wasn't him or MSM), and the rest I laid out in the article.

              DrJamesA, I am trying to rationalize your effort to seriously deceive the casual reader even as to the very premise of my presentation I requested your impression of. Here it is yet again in brief:
             </p>
             <p>
              Jones was labelled a wicked atheist by a VOAT member, who cited a video that was to prove same. The speaker in the video readies to lay out the evidence, but first pleads with me about preacher Kent Hovind, a man of God unjustly sentenced to ten years in Federal prison. However, Kent Hovind is known to me,
              <strong>
               but only
              </strong>
              through the work of one Alex Jones, who discussed his plight dozens of times and even had him as a live-on-air guest
              <strong>
               from a Federal prison cell,
              </strong>
              a veritable miracle worked by Jones.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a term for this kind of sequence of events that tell two stories. It's called revelation. The VOAT member sought to prove Jones a wicked atheist, but cited a video that in fact proved Jones threw everything he could behind a wrongly convicted Bible believing street preacher. Sir, you did indeed prove something. You proved your evil intent in constructing your paper, and your fantastical fabrication in responding to me. DrJamesA, we are not equals.

               I don't believe Alex is an atheist. I clearly stated in the article that he is a Christian Syncretist which is a liberal theistic position, but clearly not atheist.
And Kent Hovind and I graduated from the same alma mater (Calvary Christian College started by Jack Van Impe) so I am thoroughly familiar with where Hovind stands on theology, and I promise you he will never get a chance to explain his beliefs on the Alex Jones Show. Alex interviewed him a LONG time ago about government corruption, not about his Biblical views because if he did, Kent would probably straighten him out on a few things.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you would have actually read my article, there are links to Infowars articles where Alex land Paul Joseph Watson attack Bible believing street preachers in the same denomination Hovind and I belong to.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again, I don't believe Alex is an atheist, but what he teaches on his show is far more dangerous. Here's a start on

                DrJamesA, I see from your comment history that you were on VOAT seven hours ago, which means you read my post and question but did not respond. Can you indicate why not? Did you also have trouble finding the links to the articles of Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones that you indicate are in your article?

                 First of all, when you open a comment that begins of accusing me of trying to deceive my readers, when I've been a loyal financial supporter and follower of Alex Jones for nearly 20 years, that's not a very good way to get a response.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Secondly, everything I mentioned can be Googled, so you're not trying very hard. As I mentioned in the article, my goal was not to give detailed explanations about Pizza Gate because that work has already been, but to provide a logical refutation of Jones' apology. Every single "rebuttal" you keep making ignores that part of my article.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thirdly, all of your points do not address what I raised in the article, and some are even red herrings and strawmen. For example. You attempted to claim I was painting Jones as an atheist, and my last response clearly stated that not only did I never make that point, but in fact, stated he was a CHRISTIAN Syncretist. I gave you a link as to what a religions syncretist is, which you apparently didn't even bother to read.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thus, given that you have repeatedly demanded that I answer questions that have nothing to do with what I actually wrote, I'm not going to chase rabbit trails that are out of context, and strawmen

I watched the ~6 minute video from Infowars found through one of the hyperlinks, but cannot find any links to any articles from either Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson in spite of clicking every hyperlink in your article and even every hyperlink at NowTheEndBegins. I fully intend to respond, but would like to read them first. Can you indicate precisely where they are to be found in the article as you just indicated?

                 <p>
                  Hello DrJamesA, I have waited for sixteen days for you to make another Voat post to verify you read my most recent remarks, but admittedly, I'm pressed for time, so I'll have to proceed with responding to the video without benefit of a rebuttal from you on my other points.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The only evidence that Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson
                  <em>
                   may
                  </em>
                  have attacked street preachers consists of a six minute video you cite at Now the End Begins. If you were indeed a reader and listener of Infowars as you claim, you would know that every week they publish scores of videos, mostly with, but occasionally without accompanying articles. Some videos are of Jones, Watson, or an Infowars reporter, but occasionally the videos  are from other news sources or submissions from freelance reporters that are not employees of Infowars. This video from a freelancer probably made it onto Infowars because it contains a short clip of Joe Biggs. When videos and articles are posted on Infowars website, the lion's share of selection and titling is done by dedicated news room editors, not Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson, neither of whom have the time to watch every video and read every article that
                  <em>
                   might
                  </em>
                  get posted. In all likelihood Jones was unaware this video was ever on the Infowars platform.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now to the video itself. There is a discussion between the camera operator and a bystander that some very vocal proselytizers might be making Christians look bad. The bystander being interviewed did indeed describe what he sees as "Christian extremism" among other things, and from your viewpoint, I'm sure you would find the comment objectionable, but the question is, do these few remarks constitute an attack on street preachers from Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Since the comments came from one man and the camera operator attending a very busy rally at the height of the election season, the answer would be no, they did not come from Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson in any way, shape, or form.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Finally, from the 2:35 mark on, they transition away from the street preachers and are in fact talking about radical Islamicists, and they use the Christian fundamentalists on hand to point out the extreme contrast between the two. They say in essence, look, Christian fundamentalists may hold signs and holler, but radical Islamicists will run you over with a lorry, as they had just done in Nice France, killing 84 people. When the fellow says "these are the fanatical Christians" he's actually dripping with sarcasm about the contrast between Christian fundamentalism and Islamic fundamentalism. They then transition into another topic at the 3:16 mark, conveniently.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I would wager that you altogether missed this transition at 2:35 to Islamicism in their dialogue. And you neglected to note in your article that the Infowars headline says "Are Street Preachers used to demonize Christian Conservatives?" They were asking a question of their readers, because that is the nature of fair and rational discussion. If there are Christians who prefer alternative methods to spreading the gospel besides bullhorning, I think it's reasonable to entertain the idea they're entitled to hold that opinion.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Therefore, your entire thesis that Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson attack street preachers rests on precisely one example of a few civil but no doubt insulting heat of the moment remarks made by people who are
                  <strong>
                   not
                  </strong>
                  Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson in less than three minutes of video (no accompanying article) at a very raucous rally where everybody's on edge and Christian fundamentalists are bullhorning the crowd.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  DrJamesA, at the very best, you are a monumental exaggerator.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Unless you'd like to call another witness, the defense rests.

                  DrJamesA, I see that you were on VOAT yesterday and are thus now aware that there are no such articles. Would you like to correct the record and offer an explanation, or would you rather have the casual reader realize you either fabricated the story or were journalistically incompetent? I am duty-bound to complete the proof that Jones and Watson never remotely attacked street preachers as you claim, so kindly respond, otherwise I will just proceed with the rest of my proof.

                  DrJamesA, I sense some hostility in your two replies. For the sake of continuity, I will address salient points of both responses in this one post.

                  DrJamesA, I refute the claim. Can you cite or quote specifically where I remotely attempted to claim
                  <strong>
                   you
                  </strong>
                  were painting Jones as an Atheist? And what formed the basis for you imagining I did not read your link about Christian Syncratism? For the record, when I am dialoguing with someone about a particular topic, I always extend the courtesy of reading things offered by my counterpart.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To recapitulate, I indicated I read your article, and disagreed. You accused me of not even reading it, further citing as some evidence the fact I had not even read the articles by Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson that were purportedly included in your article. Here is your remark to that effect:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   If you would have actually read my article,
                   <strong>
                    there are links to Infowars articles
                   </strong>
                   where Alex land Paul Joseph Watson attack Bible believing street preachers in the same denomination Hovind and I belong to.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  I responded that I read your article three times and exhaustively searched for those links to Infowars articles, not just in your article, but also the article at Now the End Begins, including every theoretically possible hyperlink at both pages.  Your response was:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   So what you're saying is that you can't find where Alex Jones criticized street preachers on the link I provided even though the article itself is TITLED "INFOWARS SAYS CHRISTIAN STREET PREACHERS ARE ‘RADICAL EXTREMISTS’ WHO MAKE CHRISTIANITY LOOK BAD" And you wonder why I don't want to respond to you.
If that direct link doesn't work for you the way it works for everyone else. Google "Alex Jones criticizes street preachers Now The End Begins". And if you claim THAT doesn't work: YOU'RE LYING
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Exactly, DrJamesA. I'm saying that I can't find where Alex Jones criticized street preachers on the link you provided. And although highly redundant, for the sake of heading off obfuscation, I just googled "Alex Jones criticizes street preachers Now The End Begins" as you suggested and read the very same article for the fourth time, except I reached it in a different manner.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  All links work perfectly, but none take me to
                  <em>
                   any
                  </em>
                  articles by Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson, let alone ones that attack Christian street preachers. That direct link you just cited takes me to a page that contains one video from Infowars (which I am also willing to address once I read the articles under discussion) and no links to any articles written by Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Clicking the title INFOWARS SAYS CHRISTIAN STREET PREACHERS ARE 'RADICAL EXTREMISTS' WHO MAKE CHRISTIANITY LOOK BAD does little more than link to another page making claims about Infowars from a lone 6 minute video taken by someone other than Jones or Watson. To suggest that I should now scour the internet for the
                  <em>
                   very articles by Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson that may have formed the basis for your article
                  </em>
                  because they are nowhere to be found, is unreasonable. I do not believe any such articles exist, because they are nowhere to be found in your article or anything you've cited in spite your claims and my exhaustive efforts to find them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you cannot cite where these linked articles by Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson are to be found in your article or in the secondary article at Now the End Begins (and extension of all hyperlinks at the aforementioned) it is obvious they are not there, and thus you were disingenuous. Nonetheless, I am even willing to forgive your oversight if you can furnish links to any articles by Alex Jones and Paul Watson where they attack street preachers.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  UPDATE:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  DrJamesA, I decided to re-read your comment:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   First of all, when you open a comment that begins of accusing me of trying to deceive my readers, when I've been a loyal financial supporter and follower of Alex Jones for nearly 20 years, that's not a very good way to get a response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   <strong>
                    Secondly, everything I mentioned can be Googled, so you're not trying very hard.
                   </strong>
                   As I mentioned in the article, my goal was not to give detailed explanations about Pizza Gate because that work has already been, but to provide a logical refutation of Jones' apology. Every single "rebuttal" you keep making ignores that part of my article.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Thirdly, all of your points do not address what I raised in the article, and some are even red herrings and strawmen. For example. You attempted to claim I was painting Jones as an atheist, and my last response clearly stated that not only did I never make that point, but in fact, stated he was a CHRISTIAN Syncretist. I gave you a link as to what a religions syncretist is, which you apparently didn't even bother to read.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Thus, given that you have repeatedly demanded that I answer questions that have nothing to do with what I actually wrote, I'm not going to chase rabbit trails that are out of context, and strawmen
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Anticipating an objection based on your second point that I wasn't trying hard because I could simply find said articles through google, I changed my mind about insisting it was incumbent upon you to produce them. I have now finished a reasonably comprehensive google search using various terms. No such articles could be found.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There are two possible reasons why no such articles could be found on google:
                 </p>
                 <ol>
                  <li>
                   <p>
                    The articles you cite by Jones and Watson exist, but are obscure and very difficult to locate, in which case it is incumbent upon you to produce them.
                   </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   <p>
                    The articles do not exist, in which case you either fabricated the idea that said articles exist, or you erred by imagining that the articles exist.
                   </p>
                  </li>
                 </ol>
                 <p>
                  With respect to the second reason, if you erred by merely imaging there are articles where Jones and Watson attack street preachers, then this is evidence that you are not a reliable journalist and your writings are suspect in all regard. If you fabricated the idea that the articles exist, then you are guilty of bearing false witness against your fellow man, which is a very serious sin in the eyes of the Lord.

             .  I'm a believer that Alex Jones, whoever he is, is one of the good guys.  I'm a well-educated Christian,  for whatever that's worth.    I believe AJ is the real deal, working for good, not evil.

             Come On! Jones is an attention seeking TraitorTwat, just like Beck!
Not one thing has this jackass "revealed" that has a mounted to stopping anything! He spouts off about "sources tell me" but never any real people to verify it!  "Breaking here first folks" yeah where are the arrests? No one panics, no one tries to leave the country. One threatened lawsuit and he drops his BVDs and grabs his cankles ready and willing with no lube!  Lawsuit BS aside, Jones was never going to follow through with uncovering pizzagate. Why would he? He is making $$ off of stringing a long his listeners!

              I'm pro bono when the cause is just. Jones's worth should not be a consideration of yours. How do you expect anyone to form a beachhead against evil without money or resources?
