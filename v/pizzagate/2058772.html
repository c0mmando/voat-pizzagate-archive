<p>Sexual Abuse, Fraud and Negligence Alleged at Closed Centralia Home for Boys </p>
<p>Centralia’s Kiwanis Vocational Home, open from 1979 to 1994, was intended to be a safe place for wayward boys, a state-licensed foster home where 11- to 17-year-olds could get an education and job skills in a “family atmosphere,” according to a 1986 Chronicle article.</p>
<p>However, four lawsuits from former residents paint an alarmingly different picture. </p>
<p>“This was a pedophile farm,” said attorney Darrell Cochran, of Tacoma, who represents plaintiffs in all four cases, two of which were filed Tuesday. </p>
<p>The lawsuits each allege physical, sexual and emotional abuse by both staff and residents of the home, intentional understaffing with unqualified workers and financial fraud and negligence by staff and state agencies, including the state Department of Social and Health Services, which licensed the facility.</p>
<p>“These individual defendants continued to support KVH despite clear evidence that it was a breeding ground for sexual abuse and sexually charged physical abuse,” the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cochran said evidence gathered in the cases shows conspiracy rife with “political corruption” with the facility acting to conceal allegations of abuse while continuing to profit from state reimbursements for services. </p>
<p>“Despite knowledge of the deplorable condition at KVH, Defendants acted to cover up and shield those from scrutiny, or at a minimum, did nothing to report or otherwise curtail the situation,” the complaint states.</p>
<p>While complaints of abuse and mismanagement came pouring in to DSHS — and even showed up in their own audits of the facility — the agency consistently approved requests to increase capacity for residents at KVH.</p>
<p>The two lawsuits filed Tuesday in Thurston County Superior Court name three plaintiffs identified by their initials — G.V., G.C. and R.P. — and list numerous defendants, including: Kiwanis International; Kiwanis Vocational Home; Kiwanis Pacific Northwest District; Kiwanis of Tumwater;  Kiwanis of Pe Ell; Lewis County; Kiwanis of Chehalis; former KVH board members Sam C. Morehead, Edward J. Hopkins and Lewis E. Patton; the state of Washington; DSHS; the state Department of Children, Youth and Family Services; and state Child Protective Services. </p>
<p>The lawsuits specifically allege that each of the agencies and individuals listed acted negligently, putting the juvenile wards of the state living at KVH in physical danger.</p>
<p>“Each and all of the Kiwanis Defendants ignored their duties to the children at KVH and created a danger that Plaintiff would be sexually abused and suffer life-long injuries,” G.V.’s complaint reads. </p>
<p>In all, Cochran’s office is involved in four lawsuits regarding abuse at the KVH. A 2016 lawsuit filed on behalf of a plaintiff identified as K.B. lists Kiwanis, KVH, Lewis County Youth Enterprises, Kiwanis of Tumwater, Kiwanis of Pe Ell, DSHS, Children, Youth and Family Services and CPS. That lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in Thurston County Superior Court in July 2018.</p>
<p>A 2015 lawsuit filed on behalf of a client identified by R.N. against the same agencies is scheduled to go to trial in Thurston County Superior Court in April 2018.</p>
<p>The four lawsuits involve residents of the facility from the mid-1980s to the facility’s closure in 1994. </p>
<p>Kiwanis International was not able to provide a statement as it had not yet received the lawsuit. Lewis County has also not received the lawsuit. DSHS does not comment on pending litigation. </p>
<p>The Centralia/Chehalis Kiwanis Club did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Many of the individuals named in the documents no longer work with the agencies or groups they did at the time of the allegations, and some have died. </p>
<p>The allegations against KVH are similar to those at another Kiwanis-sponsored facility — the Olympia Kiwanis Boys Ranch — which also closed in 1994.</p>
<p>The OKBR received extensive coverage from the regional media after its collapse. A December 1995 Seattle Times story called the ranch a “house of horrors” and blamed DSHS for allowing it to stay open as long as it had. </p>
<p>When Darrell Cochran began taking on lawsuits alleging abuse at the OKBR in the mid-1990s, the cases literally hit close to home.
...</p>
<p>In the past 20 years, he’s been fighting cases related to the OKBR, but said these four lawsuits are the first filed regarding sexual abuse at KVH in Centralia. </p>
<p>According to Cochran’s office, Pfau Cochran Vertitis Amala, of Tacoma, dozens of plaintiffs who have sued the OKBR have received settlements totaling about $50 million, all in cases settled “as discreetly as possible” by state and local defendants.</p>
<p>“I feel blessed to be able to expose it and get help for the people who desperately need help,” Cochran said.</p>
<p>Unlike its Olympia counterpart, similar allegations of abuse and mismanagement have not previously been reported in Centralia. 
...
The Kiwanis Vocational Home was founded in 1979 on Sawall Avenue off North Pearl Street after Centralia resident Ben Martin donated more than 300 acres of property just north of city limits to the project. Lewis County Youth Enterprises was formed to govern the home. Kiwanis clubs in Centralia, Chehalis, Grand Mound, Rochester and Tumwater were the initial sponsors of the home, according to a 1990 Chronicle article.</p>
<p>KVH began by taking only a few boys. It grew to include more than 70 residents at its peak, all of whom were wards of the state who were removed from their birth families by state agencies and placed in foster care.</p>
<p>“They come from broken or abusive families,” director Charles McCarthy told The Chronicle in 1990. “They are emotionally hurt and need some training to move back in with their family, relatives or foster homes.”</p>
<p>About 80 percent of the home’s funding came from the state, according to a report in The Chronicle from 1987, and the facility was licensed as a foster home through DSHS. </p>
<p>Many of the stories filed in The Chronicle’s archives about the Kiwanis Vocational Home are glowing reviews of the facility’s mission to help young boys removed from abusive or troubled families. </p>
<p>Coverage from the mid 1980s and early 90s shows students digging in gardens, doing school work and playing ping pong.  
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reports of assaults by staff members on students were already starting to alarm state agencies.</p>
<p>In Dececember 1981, DSHS staff wrote to the Lewis County Sheriff’s Office expressing concern about violence at KVH. The letter notes five examples of assaults on residents perpetrated by staff or other residents dating to October of that year</p>
<p>“We are told that other assaults may have occurred previously and may have been witnessed by others who have present or former connections with this group home,” wrote Larry Pederson, Chehalis Community Service Officer with DSHS. </p>
<p>Pederson requested the Sheriff’s Office’s help in investigating the incidents. </p>
<p>The Chronicle has requested records of criminal investigations regarding KVH from the Lewis County Sheriff’s Office.</p>
<p>Investigations undertaken through the four lawsuits have identified instances of sexual abuse reported and documented as early as 1982 — three years after KVH opened, according to documents provided by Cochran’s office.</p>
<p>In January 1982, a boy living at the home reported a staff member let him drive his car in exchange for oral sex. The boy left the facility for a week and returned to learn that the incident was not reported to law enforcement, according to documents obtained by The Chronicle.</p>
<p>The boy called the Lewis County Sheriff’s Office to report the rape, and according to a report from the Sheriff’s Office, a staff member took the phone away and dismissed the allegations. </p>
<p>A report from DSHS dated Feb. 4, 1982, notes prosecution was unlikely in that specific abuse report, and agreed to renew KVH’s license provisionally, provided the home met training and other requirements. </p>
<p>Further instances of sexual or physical abuse between residents or perpetrated by staff were reported consistently while the facility remained open. </p>
<p>For example, in November 1985, several instances of abuse were reported, including a staff member backhanding a boy, a boy raping another boy with no report filed and physical force used by staff to “maintain order.”</p>
<p>A DSHS memo issued days later dismissed the concerns.</p>
<p>Alleged abusers included both boys at the facility, KVH staff and leadership and Centralia School District staff.</p>
<p>“Dozens and dozens and dozens of kids are being molested in this place,” Cochran said.</p>
<p>He said evidence shows boys identified as victims of abuse were living with boys identified as sexual assault suspects. </p>
<p>In September 1988, a resident was arrested on suspicion of first-degree rape for an incident that occurred at KVH. The Chronicle printed a story on the police report. </p>
<p>That week, a CPS staffer wrote to Chronicle Publisher Jack Underwood chastising the newspaper for calling the incident a rape, as the police report did, and instead insisted the incident was consensual, according to documents obtained by The Chronicle.
...</p>
<p>KVH was renamed Coffee Creek Center after the Children’s Industrial Home Board of Directors took over. </p>
<p>Allegations of abuse continued until the home was finally shuttered in 1994.</p>',

           Sexual Abuse, Fraud and Negligence Alleged at Closed Centralia Home for Boys

           The Chronicle has requested records of criminal investigations regarding KVH from the Lewis County Sheriff’s Office.
          </p>
          <p>
           Investigations undertaken through the four lawsuits have identified instances of sexual abuse reported and documented as early as 1982 — three years after KVH opened, according to documents provided by Cochran’s office.

           A DSHS memo issued days later dismissed the concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
           Alleged abusers included both boys at the facility, KVH staff and leadership and Centralia School District staff.
          </p>
          <p>
           “Dozens and dozens and dozens of kids are being molested in this place,” Cochran said.
          </p>
          <p>
           He said evidence shows boys identified as victims of abuse were living with boys identified as sexual assault suspects.
          </p>
          <p>
           In September 1988, a resident was arrested on suspicion of first-degree rape for an incident that occurred at KVH. The Chronicle printed a story on the police report.

            WOW! I grew up there during that time period. So bizarre to see this on Voat... Can't add much to the story. The only thing I remember hearing about the boys home - some of my girlfriends would go to the roller rink Sat. night and make out with the "bad" boys from the boys home. That would be the stories I'd hear Monday at jr.high school. I don't remember if any of the boys went to our school, I don't believe they did. Centralia was a very small town. Most people worked in the timber industry or steam plant/ coal industry. The police seemed to just focus on harassing the high school kids that were just "cruising" in town. Yes, that was the thing to do. It was a way to find out where the keggars were or just innocently drive around and see your friends. Now it's a meth heroine tweekerville cesspool full of illegal's living in housing built and provided by the Catholic Church. Although I do hear it's starting to get cleaned up a little. Centralia is conveniently located on the main freeway ,the I-5 corridor, right between Seattle and Portland. Sad to see what happened to that town and those poor boys. I'm sure there was a lot more going on in that town than people realized.

            Kiwanis Vocational Home or Coffee Creek Center
           </p>
           <p>
            The Kiwanis Vocational Home or Coffee Creek Center in Centralia, Washington, was sponsered by a Kiwanis Club in Centralia or Chehalis, and was run as poorly as the Olympia Kiwanis Boys Ranch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's an article from the April 18, 1996 Olympian about the Kiwanis Vocational Home and some of the abuse that happened there.

           </p>
           <p>
            Virgil Clarkson said in the November 19, 1995 Olympian, that: "We received international acknowledgment when we opened it in 1972," said Virgil Clarkson , a longtime ranch board member. "The Kiwanis in Chehalis sort of copied us. Other groups used us as an example of how to do something like that."

Should be preserved with a plaque on the front with the names of every embezzling, sadistic pervert that ran the place and covered it up. Old Kiwanis Vocational Home represents the ugly truth of where this community sent it's youth for help. Either that, or demolish the hell hole.

I agree with you as well I stayed in that hellhole for 3 to 4 years it was a child's worse nightmare a place that was supposed to help us children but in return abused us as well as the older inmates I truly believe that this place should be brunt to the ground it ruined my life forever so I would be the first one to piss on the ashes if that ever happened it was truly a house of horrors and destroyed many innocent young boys life's
