<p>The case of the Oakland County Child Killer has been (ostensibly) unsolved since the mid 70\'s.  Since then, the families of the victims have been working tirelessly to get the truth and corruption surrounding this case exposed.  Last night, Channel 4 WDIV in the United States aired an hour-long special on the case.  THIS IS A HUGE DEAL.  The families of the victims have been pleading for increased exposure for decades, and some of the leads the families have gotten are only due to citizen work/ tips from the public given directly to victims\' families.  
</p>
<p>It does not seem that Oakland County wants to own up to the truth about this complex and harrowing case.  This hour-long special aired last night provided a large audience with the story and with contact information to submit any tips they might have.  There have been sporadic minutes-long news segments on this case since the 70\'s, but nothing like this.  This is a huge deal for everyone fighting for the truth about the Oakland County Child Killer(s.)</p>
<p><strong>To remind some of you, this is the case that is connected to North Fox Island off the West coast of northern Michigan, where there was a pedophile ring going on organized by &quot;elites&quot;, with connections to a certain Boys Home as well as a millionaire &quot;philanthropist&quot; from Oakland County, Michigan.  It is said that the truth about this case may have been covered up due to the possible killer being the son of a GM executive.</strong></p>
<p>Not only did this unprecedented expose air last night, but WDIV has planned a 5 part documentary series to follow.  
</p>
<p>I will provide updates.</p>
<p>For more information or to get more involved, please see the blogs of victim Timothy King\'s sister and father.  They are both heroes:</p>

              Saw it.  It's so obvious to me that they are protecting the GM Busch Family.  The killer is dead but the family lives on and cannot allow such a heinous crime to be connected to them.  Sick Sick Sick.  They let these families suffer all their lives while they are protected. Elite Privilege gone amok.

               I'm sure this also trickles down through history to connect quite a few prominent industrial and political names right on up to Michan Governor George Romney and everything Bryce Taylor had to say about mk-ultra mind control and sex slavery.

                This case surely may be more than they are saying.  Possibly a pedo ring as well and CP too. Yup Romney figures in and we know who might be trying to keep a lid on this.
