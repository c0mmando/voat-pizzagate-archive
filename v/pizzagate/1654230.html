<p>wtf</p>
<p>The bolded line is what got me to think about this. It\'s worded very strangely.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>This video from the show which involves pizza-making describes Barney as a &quot;convicted pedophile&quot; in the title: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZBPvDlG0hE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZBPvDlG0hE</a></p>
<p>The segment doesn\'t have any explicit pedo code that stands out as far as I can see other than somewhat normal usage of &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;cheese&quot; and I can\'t find any credible sources regarding a conviction of any of the actors who played Barney.

<p>There\'s also a supposed &quot;<a href="http://www.dustyfeet.com/evil/enemy.html">parody</a>&quot; site which was sued by the show\'s owners (article: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/30/bad-news-for-barney-dinosaur.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/30/bad-news-for-barney-dinosaur.html)</a>) which describes it as Satanic, although it might only be referring to the merchandising and commercial aspect.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>The show featured some of those messed up Disney starlets including Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, and Debby Ryan who are involved in children\'s charities:</p>
<p>Selena Gomez is involved with UNICEF</p>
<p>Demi Lovato</p>

<p>In May 2013, she was cited for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental health challenges at a National Children\'s Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in Washington, D.C.</p>

            My working theory is there was some covert attempt at introducing pedo symbolism into the show, most likely most of it was caught and cleaned up before airing except for the BJ character. The now tame pizza scene may have been cleaned up. The line about pickles is just too characteristic of the kind of code we've seen in pg to just be nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            This means we should look more at the production side (Disney connection, what a surprise). It might be a dead end but I felt the description of the BJ character as well as the involvement of Disney and child starlets was noteworthy, so at the very least this is now documented here pending future discoveries.
