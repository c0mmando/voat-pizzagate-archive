            Findingassange.com seems to be a domain hosted by Enom.com
           </p>
           <p>
            This company has a bad history in relation to Wikileaks:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Indeed, on this page, Wikileaks calls for a boycott of Enom.com:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Wikileaks calls for a global boycott of eNom and its parent Demand Media, its owners, executives and all affiliated companies, interests and holdings, including .... [etc.]"
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not at all promising.

            Well, assuming it´s possible get an (cleaned) oldschool notebook with an old pcmcia wifi adapter. Definitly not the buildin ones. Doubt you can mess with that kind of old tech, since it doesnt have any 3G/4G at all. Hopefully it can connect to the wifi used.

            Firstly what they release should be codes for the files that have been available via torrent. It is an 88GB file and is available to download via torrent:

            Wikileaks always tell people to download the insurance file in case anything happens.

            All this website should be providing is the code to open the files. Not the actual files themselves.

             Secondly, the files were released  before wikileaks possibly because comprimised (which isn't fact yet, he could still well be alive, lets hope). Meaning that they could not of been faked.

              Agreed. If they are codes from some earlier files good but if they are codes from the last bunch.. we don't know if JA was in control at the time they were dropped.

            If you want to risk and download it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Grab a new cheap phone not connected to you. Get on a public wifi (without any cams around you). TAPE the 2 phone cams. THEN activate it and download the stuff (do not activate it before, it can be tracked).  Check the content on the phone (have zip downloader ready etc) and when it´s cp or worst destroy it immediately: throw it in water (still on), after that remove the battery, clear fingerprints. Destroy it as good as you can. DO NOT keep it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh yeah get there with a friend. Looks less suspicious then a lonesome guy/girl fiddeling nervous with a phone. And leave your phones at HOME.
           </p>
           <p>
            My 2 cents.

            another note, I wouldn't trust TOR if you're thinking it'll make you anonymous. Not worth the risk really.

             Yes. Did not they pass a law that took effect on 12/1/16 that allows them to essentially tap into TOR/VPN connections with the assumption of criminality (that is, no search warrant needed)? They put this under the auspices of stopping illegal activities, but it is really meant to shut down these kinds of investigations.

            Mods can we perhaps create a sticky "discussion thread" for this leak? Otherwise we are going to have dozens of posts about every little part of it, clogging up the whole sub (and it might all be bollocks). One discussion thread to post all findings would be much better and it would also allow a mod to summarise it properly and list the key findings.

             shit man I was just about to delete this post since it didn't have sources etc (rule 3) then I realised it was you... Can you please include more context for your audience? Some people won't know what you're talking about. Link to an archive of the findingassange discussion or something.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can only have one sticky (limitation of voat) so it depends on whether you think this is more important than current sticky.

              it probably doesn't need a sticky until it looks substantial i'd say, it may be a massive load of crap. And it will go straight to the top and be very visible regardless.
