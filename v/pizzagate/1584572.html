            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            here a snippet of some of what is said, it is a long read. I honestly donno about this Kevin Annet character as ive seen some things about him, but me being from canada and aboriginal I can see the pattern presented. this involved the Picton farm and celebrities and hells angels involvement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Synopsis
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              An organized system of abduction, exploitation, torture and murder of large numbers of women and children appears to exist on Canada ’s west coast, and is operated and protected in part by sectors of the RCMP, the Vancouver Police Department (VPD), the judiciary, and members of the British Columbia government and federal government of Canada , including the Canadian military.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system is highly funded and linked to criminal organizations including the Hell’s Angels, the Hong Kong Triad, and unnamed individual “free lance” mobsters from Vancouver and the USA. It is funded in part by a massive drug trade, with which it is intimately connected.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system is decades-old and has been supplied for many years with women and children from aboriginal reserves and residential schools, with the paid collusion of lawyers, clergy and officials of the Roman Catholic, Anglican and United Church of Canada, along with state-funded aboriginal leaders and officials of the Department of Indian Affairs.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system is international in scope, Vancouver being one spoke in a wheel of pedophilia, sex slavery, human organ black markets, “snuff” films and violent child pornography that has outlets throughout the Pacific Rim world, particularly in China and Thailand .
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system relies upon a network of complicity extending to the highest levels of power in Canada and other nations, involving coroners, judges, doctors, clergy, politicians and social workers, as well as the media. It also relies upon a network of “body dumping grounds” and mass graves, located in remote rural areas or on aboriginal reserves and both church and Crown land, where human remains are regularly disposed of by RCMP officers.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system is kept in place because of a practice and philosophy of unofficial tolerance and protection by the established police, judicial, military, church and governmental institutions in Canada and elsewhere. The crimes committed by individual officers of the police, churches, court and government against women and children caught in this system are known and tolerated by these institutions

             Eyewitness Accounts
            </p>
            <p>
             Eyewitness #1: Caucasian woman, age forty nine, domiciled in Vancouver at 2618 West 8th Avenue , ph: 778-386-7024. Given name of witness is Annie PARKER, who claims to have personal knowledge of the allegations made herein. Statement video-recorded on 16 February 2006, in Vancouver .
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               The witness states that during the spring of 2000, she was severely assaulted by an officer of the RCMP, Bruce MICHAELSON, in her Vancouver home after requesting RCMP assistance to deal with harassment from her ex-husband. MICHAELSON tortured the witness and compelled her to join what she terms “the hooker game”, where she learned the facts alleged herein.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The alleged “hooker game” is a protected system run by Vancouver police and RCMP officers in which prostitutes are arrested, drugged, raped and sometimes filmed as part of violent pornographic and “snuff” movies, in which they are tortured and killed on film. The women killed in this manner are then disposed of at special body dumping sites monitored by the police.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The witness claims that there are two levels of the “hooker game”: the simplest level involves the arrest, drugging and raping of prostitutes, then releasing them. The witness estimates that at least one-quarter of all Vancouver policemen take part in this level of the “hooker game”, and that the rest of the police force as well as the Mayor and Chief of Police are aware of it. The higher level of the game involves the use of prostitutes in snuff and pornographic films, and in torturing and murdering them. While unaware of the details of the more extreme level of the game, most police know of its existence but do not betray it or its practitioners for fear that their involvement in the lower level of the game will be exposed.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The witness claims that the drug most commonly used on victims of the “hooker game” is SCOPALAMINE, a hypnotic barbituate often termed a “rape drug”, in which the victim is “zombified”, obeying any command, and then is unable to remember the events for some time. However, memory can return, and the fear of this occurring has prompted MICHAELSON and other participants in the more extreme game to murder the victims and dispose of their bodies. MICHAELSON is the key actor in this body disposal system, according to the witness.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Soon after the assault of the witness by MICHAELSON in the spring of 2000, she was taken by MICHAELSON to one of the locations of the “hooker game”: a “clubhouse” for policemen in either the penthouse of the Century Plaza Hotel or in the basement of the Hotel Georgia in downtown Vancouver . Witness claims that this clubhouse hosts a “pornographic film studio where woman are raped and tortured on film”. MICHAELSON is described by the witness as “a pimp and drug dealer for all the Vancouver cops and their friends … a lot of the dealing goes on at the clubhouse.”
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness states that MICHAELSON works out of a North Vancouver RCMP detachment and is on the city drug squad, having access to large volumes of illicit drugs that he sells to policemen and others.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               At one of the clubhouses described in Point No. 5, the witness was introduced by MICHAELSON to Willy PICTON and Steven PICTON, who ran and continue to run a pornography and snuff film business from Port Coquitlam (alias “Piggy’s Palace”). The witness was subsequently taken by Steven PICTON to the Port Coquitlam site (alias “Piggy’s Palace”) on several occasions to engage in sex and drugs. At this site, she witnessed young girls being drugged and raped, including on film, after being brought to the site by RCMP officers. Witness describes seeing three RCMP officers, including MICHAELSON, at Piggy’s Palace, engaged in drugs and in raping women. Witness states that “ten of the twelve recently murdered women were last seen in the company of RCMP guys.”
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               At Piggy’s Palace the witness also met Jean-Guy BOUDRAIS or BEAUDRAIS, whom witness claims is the serial killer responsible for the murder of many of the women in the downtown eastside of Vancouver over the past ten years. Witness states that BOUDRAIS is a close associate of MICHAELSON, obtains women and drugs from him, and relies on MICHAELSON to dispose of his victims after he has raped, tortured and killed them. Witness says that BOUDRAIS works for a computer programming company tied to the Canadian military or the federal government, and gives seminars in Ontario and Montreal , where he is domiciled. Witness claims that BOUDRAIS, like MICHAELSON, is a Freemason.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness claims that Steven PICTON is the ringleader of the snuff film operation that formerly operated out of Piggy’s Palace, and which has now moved to an undisclosed location in Coquitlam. One of PICTON’s associates operates a front for snuff films out of a company named “Goodbye Girls” at 999 West Broadway in Vancouver. Witness claims that snuff film victims’ bodies are weighted with cement blocks and dumped in Beaver Lake in Stanley Park .
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness claims that a snuff film network in Vancouver involves MICHAELSON, a CBC cameraman named Gerry DUNNE associated with Pogo Productions, a film maker named Dave COLLINS who owns Lions Gate Studios, an underworld enforcer named LARRY, a porn film star named Tom TASSE, and the PICTON brothers. TASSE worked in a snuff film studio in the basement of a North Vancouver home a few blocks from MICHAELSON’s RCMP office. Snuff films sell for up to $250,000 and have eager buyers in Asian countries and the USA .
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness was told by MICHAELSON that he acts as the main supplier of women and drugs for this snuff film network and for the “hooker game” with the assistance of three “dirty cops”: a local policeman named Bob KRISKO, and two RCMP officers named DAVE and STEVEN. Both of the latter cops are associated with the Missing Women’s Task Force and use this position to prey on and rape/murder street women in Vancouver .
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness claims that both DAVE and STEVEN are also associated with BOUDRAIS and have raped and murdered women with him, including Brianne VOTH, age 19, who was abducted, raped and drowned in 2004 in Coquitlam by BOUDRAIS and STEVEN, in association with a prostitute named Stella MALLOWAY.

             Exactly.  That site isn't safe.  I went to check it out (on a diff device and network bc I don't trust that place) and it's just someone rehashing the stuff about the guy that did the reddit AMA.  Also talks about Carole Greenwood, her son and about the food critics article that's archived.  All of the info on glp came from here and reddit, so it's nothing new.
