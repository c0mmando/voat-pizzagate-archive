<p>There are so  many offshoots from this. For example:</p>
<p> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2566937">The Royal honeymoon and a Saudi hotel chain that takes us from the City of London back to the Podestas and the Acorn Group</a></p>

<p>Jasper Park Lodge ..In 2006, it was purchased by Oxford Properties, the real estate investment arm of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), but is operated by Fairmont Hotels. (Oxford Properties also owns the Leadenhall Buildingin the City of London). ..</p>
<p>..Investors from Canada have long been influential in shaping the UK real estate market.  ..Five Canadian companies (Ivanhoe Cambridge, Sun Life Financial, Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and OMERS) are within the top 25 global real estate investors and together hold real estate assets under management worth US$ 144 billion. Three of these companies (CPPIB, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and OMERS) are public pension funds which over the last two years have increased real estate assets under their management by 26 per cent from US$ 56.5 billion to US$ 71.2 billion. </p>
<p>..AccorHotels today [December 2015] announces the signing of an agreement with the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Kingdom Holding Company (KHC) of Saudi Arabia and Oxford Properties, an Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) company for the acquisition of FRHI Holdings Ltd (FRHI), parent of Fairmont, Raffles, and Swissôtel. </p>

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.

<blockquote>
<p>Richard Desmond, the billionaire owner of the Daily and Sunday Express newspapers, is planning to bid for the rights to run the National Lottery.</p>
<p>Desmond, who already runs the rival Health Lottery, is said to be preparing to tender for the UK lottery franchise when it comes up for renewal in 2019.

            The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP), whose worldwide investments also include the UK's Busy Bees nursery chain, indicated it was looking to expand the business. ..

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Richard Desmond, the billionaire owner of the Daily and Sunday Express newspapers, is planning to bid for the rights to run the National Lottery.
            </p>
            <p>
             Desmond, who already runs the rival Health Lottery, is said to be preparing to tender for the UK lottery franchise when it comes up for renewal in 2019. Camelot, which is owned by Canadian pension fund the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, holds the rights to run the National Lottery until 2023.

          <p>
           So the lottery in the UK is corrupt and connected to OMERS and other Canadian companies.  Epstein and his Zorro Trust collected on the US lottery right?  We need to look into that.

             Sometimes my posts meander because I'm simply using reference points for myself for future explorations, research and posts.   Sometimes they are more for me than for anyone else. That's necessary sometimes as the web is so wide it is no longer possible to put everything in one post.  I mainly use voat, selfishly, as a data storage point for my own personal use.

             I had that originally in the post.. and referenced your comment.  I then decided to take it out.  I'm really glad now I did. It was the right decision.  Pity you don't make posts of your own anymore as you have much to contribute.

On August 22, 1851, the schooner America won the 100 Guinea Cup (renamed America’s Cup) from the Royal Yacht Squadron by defeating 14 British yachts in a 53-mile race around Isle of Wight. The syndicate that captured the trophy later assigned the Cup to the New York Yacht Club with a Deed of Gift, under condition that it be preserved as a perpetual Challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign nations. The trophy was renamed the America’s Cup.
