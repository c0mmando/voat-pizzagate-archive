            Gentle Plea to the Community (not specific to this OP)
           </p>
           <p>
            . . tl;wr . . We need to try hard not to, even inadvertently, screw over others' work by using attention-drawing post titles on our own work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol. It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone. Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down, sometimes into oblivion and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The extraordinary hard work and effort of people on this forum is diminished by the use of hyperbolic titles (for example by the use of all or partial CAPS, !!!!!!, "** ****, and or exclamations of URGENT, BREAKING, DIG DIG DIG, THIS ONE TO THE TOP, #PODESTAFORPRISON (all in caps), etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted my strong feelings on this inv/pizzagatemods, asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles. I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created inv/pizzagatewhateverhttps://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030. If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <p>
            1 Also reaching out to the mods - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
           </p>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up. At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all. If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            . . tl;dr . . We need to try hard not to, even inadvertently, screw over others' work by using attention-drawing post titles on our own work.

             Leaving aside, the merit of your plea:
            </p>
            <p>
             Why don't you make a separate post about your "plea" and give it a chance to be voted up, instead of spamming every other post with your comments?
            </p>
            <p>
             Talk about screwing over other's work. Aren't you hijacking everyone else's threads with your own agenda and screwing over their work?
            </p>
            <p>
             I've seen your comments several times today. Maybe even voted them up, but I'm not feeling it presently based on your insistence that your methods somehow justify your means.

            Why did John McCain's former presidential campaign manager Steve Schmidt declare Hillary Clinton the winner by a landslide before the election on MSNBC? Why was he and other members of the establishment so confident that Hillary would win, and why didn't he push for Trump as the Republican candidate if he was a Republican? Why has he been so silent ever since?
           </p>
           <p>
            John McCain is closely tied with Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus. Their district in Racine and Kenosha, Wisconsin which is a cesspool of corruption and is closely connected to Pennsylvania, Denver, DC, New York, Arizona, and many of the global hotspots for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Rothschilds are linked to McCain and to Racine, Wisconsin along with the Rockefellers and other many other global power players. Everything is connected, and there is a system of global corruption leading to a one world government, one world currency, and one world Internet, controlled by the same groups. Racine is a key that links directly with Agenda 2030 and the truly evil global plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. If you want to solve this puzzle, investigate and report on Racine, MILO (and others).

              Everything about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption connects to Racine, Wisconsin. That is the point.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine is the answer. Do you want to solve Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption? Try helping. Research and investigate it. Help get the word out that it needs to be investigated. Don't just downvote something because you won't take the time to investigate it, especially if someone is screaming over and over that it is the answer to this entire problem. If you heard a kid in a pizza place screaming for help, would you help them or downvote them?
             </p>
             <p>
              For McCain, his main connections to Racine are his Institute, Arizona State University, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Paul Ryan, Russ Feingold, and some family-owned company. Do you know who John Jeffry Louis is? Do you know what the Pilgrims Society is? Do you know what the Council on Foreign Relations is? Do you know what Agenda 2030 is? Do you know what GlobeScan is? Do you know about the history of brazen criminal corruption in Racine? Do you know about the pedo crimes, the mafia, and the secret societies and clubs they are in together?
             </p>
             <p>
              Please take the time to research these things, and then help tell everyone that we need the spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin. It is the answer. We need your help.

             You are more than welcome to make your own investigation and publish your own findings. You are trying to hard to plant doubt. If you have something make your own thread. The more you push Racine the less I am interested. Yawn. Not really sure I understand why you keep spamming the same thing.
