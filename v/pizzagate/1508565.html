            Listen to Eminem's song Music Box. I know a lot of his work is dark just found it interesting listening to it through lens of pizzagate. Especially the second half of it. Terrifying.

             </p>
             <p>
              [Intro]
Yeah
Yeah girl
Can you hear that?
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy?
Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark are ya?
             </p>
             <p>
              [Verse 1]
You hear the beat As it makes ya Not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door It's locked so I go to creep
'round the back with binoculars Not 'cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry She smells like taco's I want to eat
Visions of hot choclatey marshmallows Also sweet
With sugar plums Oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey A holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast With strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers With Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper Is all that I am
My music box
             </p>
             <p>
              [Chorus:]
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But i can hear u my love, you keep calling me
I want the world to know, you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come, I will answer
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box, playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around, and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer
             </p>
             <p>
              [Verse 2]
I almost look comatose, Who wants to be sobered gross
I foam like a doberman, mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig til I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park
             </p>
             <p>
              [Chorus]
             </p>
             <p>
              [Verse 3]
I'm fixated on asphyxating and breakin' this little chick's
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippins,
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortition of love, sent from above,
Forced entry, the more wenchy, the more stingy I become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her
And climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha!
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
Stand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

            In one of the episodes, I believe it was late 2000's Bart mentions that Marco Rubio, or whatever his name is, is a pink handkerchief. It was too out of context.

            The Simpsons appear to have predicted the future yet again, with an unearthed 1991 episode depicting a situation very similar to the “Pizzagate” scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            On November 21, 1991, an episode entitled “Flaming Moe’s” aired on Fox, and featured a pizzeria named “Zip Zap” and “Za Pizza Arcade”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Distract101.com reports:
           </p>
           <p>
            Predictive programming is a term used to describe a method used [mostly] in mass media. A short explanation of this, (and one to help one better understand the context of this article) would be a Television program that is set in a future date or time, and shows an event or a situation that targets human emotion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Popularized by researcher Alan Watt, predictive programming is somewhat similar to classic forms of subliminal messaging or propaganda. The use of subliminal messaging, predictive programming, and both used in propaganda can be extremely powerful and dangerous.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most effective use of these methods is of course when it is used in the media. Power-brokers who have direct control of the mass media can use media to desensitize the public and the masses to a growing tyranny. For example, Adolf Hitler (through Joseph Goebbels) and Joseph Stalin (with his ‘Cult of Personality’) both had experts in propaganda and control over the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            The United States outlawed the use of subliminal messages/propaganda in television, advertising or movies. That is, until the law was repealed in 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, did The Simpsons know about Pizza Gate and try to tell us about it?
           </p>
           <p>
            On November 21, 1991 the episode “Flaming Moe’s” first aired on Fox. Although most of the contents of this episode were about Moe’s bar and Homers drink recipe, a brief portion showed a pizza place called “Zip Zap and ‘Za Pizza Arcade.”

            The episode is not about anything related to Pizza Gate, although a sign that hangs on the Zip Zap and Za Pizza Arcade says “the Kidnapping was at our other location.”

            Although this is one of those situations where people may be connecting dots that aren’t there, it is at least somewhat interesting that more than 25 years ago The Simpsons were talking about a pizza place that had a kidnapping.

            So, do we think the episode “Flaming Moe” was an example of predictive programming and did it predict Pizza Gate? — Not really.

            The important part of all of this is to always remain open minded and aware that the US government can and will use propaganda, predictive programming, and subliminal messaging, and Hollywood has and will as well.

            What are your thoughts? Do you think The Simpsons were trying to warn us about Pizza Gate?
