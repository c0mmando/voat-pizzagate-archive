<p><sub>It\'s painful to have to state the obvious, but this is pizzagate related due to it being an image of a young boy in chains posted by a high ranking member, exactly what was stated in the title..  </sub></p>
<p>In trying to interpret what is meant by a tweet posted by SCOTX Justice Don Willett it is important to look at the origins of this quote.</p>
<p>Inauguration of Gerald Ford:  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nixon\'s resignation was tendered to United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at 11:35 am. </p>
<p>I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers. And I hope that such prayers will also be the first of many... If you have not chosen me by secret ballot, neither have I gained office by any secret promises. I have not campaigned either for the Presidency or the Vice Presidency. I have not subscribed to any partisan platform. I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman—my dear wife, Betty—as I begin this very difficult job... <em>My fellow Americans, <strong>our long national nightmare is over</strong>... Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.</em> But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy.
— Gerald Ford, Swearing-in Ceremony speech

<p>It\'s also interesting to note that it was also used on David Letterman\'s final show, spoken by former presidents: George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barrack Obama.<br />

<p>We have these words spoken to reassure Americans that justice has taken place as well as used  mockingly by democrats. And it isn\'t real clear on what was meant by Justice Don Willett, but we do have at least a few clues.  
</p>
<p>He was on President Trumps SCOTUS list.<br />
And he tweeted this exactly 1 hour after tweeting about the travel ban being upheld by the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p>I believe it\'s indeed a reference to pizzagate and specifically human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>Building the wall has always been about more than just stopping the entry of illegal immigrants, but doubles as a way to fight human traffickers kidnapping women and children taking them out of the country.  
</p>
<p>I believe the war against the corrupt and the evil--the wicked of the world, has just begun. Once again we can be reminded that America is truly a government of laws and not of men.  
</p>
<p>Under the leadership of great men such as Donald J Trump and Rex Wayne Tillerson, and with the support of enough honest men and women, our long national nightmare might soon be over.</p>',
