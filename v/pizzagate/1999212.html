             Didn't I put enough links / sources in? It makes perfect sense faggot. The gays / gay judges (Alexander Wakefield) say in case law you must always respect a gay person and never vilify them under the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, '93 Dog Collar wearing Crypto-Lesbian Mayor of Sydney Homosexual Vilification Amendments, only used by her office staffer confirmed pedophile, purjerer who's going to the high court of Australia now to defend the OTOAustralia.org.au - one Garry Richard Burns - a man who was caught sending his penis picture to minors and is the first gay marriage activist on national TV after the former prime minier Kevin Rudd announced gay marriage. (Also the same pedophile who sued my dad and made the two case law examples below - all for the crime of not loving some baby anal sex done by Mark J Newton and Peter Truong and disrespecting them - hence homosexual vilification)

             or I'll do that. Let him have the last word not me. Note the same link causes link is in case law, and the XYZ judge court rules the video about Newton and Peter Truong doesn't autoplay, but the internet archive says that it does even in the html source. Your IT skills could tell you something is up here when the government takes over 3 years to try people for disrespecting convicted XYZ pedophile felons who were praised by state media as XYZdads.

                 Yeah funny you don't refute the facts - the facts being gay judges say all must love fucking little boys or at least respect those who do - or they will have their assetts seized for not being a good boylover. Pedophilia has been normalized by the gay lobby. Pedophilia love enforcement has been created by the gay lobby - special gay anal sex police do it

                 The faggots were always about fucknig little boys. The founder of Gay Rights in America was NAMBLA's Harry Hay. Imagine if George Wasington was a child rapist? Then anyone could say America was founded by child rapists, probably still child rapists. Both the OTOAustralia.org.au/OTO.org and the Gay rights lobby were founded by child rapists. Guess what you probably are too? If you joined the child rapist's club, you probably are one.

Oh I said faggot child rapists not faggots. So if you say that's bad me to wish death on those who fuck children - i.e. homophobic i.e. FAGGOT CHILD RAPISTS, then you are saying all good gay lovers have got to love fucking kids too.

                  So, it's good policy to single out homosexual "child fuckers"? Seems you wish to leave the heterosexual "child fuckers" alone. Is this Robert L. Robinson hoping to steer the path from his doorstep elsewhere? 
Btw I usually can only get through about one sentence by you before it becomes a tedious mess.

                   strawman arguement. I hate hetrosexual child fuckers equally, well almost. Where is the law that says hetrosexual child fuckers must be respected because they said I'm LGBT? Oh that doesn't exist? Why do gay child fuckers get special treatment over regular child fuckers. Stupid faggot. It's you Garry the great boylover little child fucker who sends his penis pictures to child prostitutes. We are coming for you faggot.

             (who got banned no doubt - ban evader) is back.
Why do all gays and gay leaders say:  TO INVESTIGATE ANY GAY CHILD RAPIST is the same as investigating ALL GAYS, therefore all GAY CHILD RAPISTS (not all gays) MUST BE FREE TO RAPE CHILDREN AND ROAM.
See the leader of the Australian gay lobby just say that here:

             Here's his paper - defending jailed proud boylover until the day he died Robert "Dolly" Dunn saying he's innocent because he only fucked 16 year old boys (just after it was made legal to fuck a 16 year old boy) when he ended up being convicted for raping 6 year olds.

             Monday, 6 February 2017
Chris Puplick AM former Anti-Discrimination Board president head of JusticeLegal.nsw.gov.au writes a paper on how dare police target gay pedophiles who anal rape young boys, because the convicted perpetrators may kill themselves!
I was doing some research on MASS TRANNY POLITICALLY CORRECT AIDS RAPE GATE on the first transsexual to both use a woman's bathroom and use it in a woman's prison to boot - all before before having a sex change, and Chris Puplick's direct responsibility for orchestrating the whole saga (confirmed in Parliament by his NAME!). Anyway whilst researching him and I came across paper he wrote dismissing the actions of the most infamous police protected pedophile in Australia's history Robert "Dolly" Dunn! NSW Police Corrective Services Investigations covered up the Mass Rapes in a Woman's prison so he can be where he is today. Further details (i.e. a fully sourced UN-Human Rights Complaint DOSSIER with exhibits to be sponsored by Russia) is forthcoming. In the same year the mass rapes were covered up (2001) by NSW Police Corrective Services Investigations and the Parole Board that gave Noel Crompton Hall a Release Date - Chris Pupick got an Member of the Australian Order. Those rapes had to be covered up to ensure this man continues to rise in power.
(more on the archive.is gay judge / nsw police censored at the barrel of a gun blog link)
            </p>
            <p>
             "Puplick who litterally wrote the book on Gay Marriage in Australia gave 4 submissions to the Wood Royal Commission to steer them away from gay pedophiles that remain classified to this day. Time to declasify them now that the pedophiles are already dead and wont kill themselves again!"

Look, this is not the place. The topic of the conversation is Virtualmin. Says it right at the top. If you want to talk about something else, do it somewhere else. I've deleted your comments because they are wholly off-topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that (until I'm able to sort out how to make it detect correctly without it) if you add a file called "/etc/virtualmin-license" containing the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            SerialNumber=GPL
LicenseKey=GPL
I think it'll get it right and won't complain about the license. I can't think of where else it would be looking.

I'll post those two comments on pizzagate and your reply, I guess that's the place, right now you know if you win the argument because you decreed the truth must be censored. As you suggested that's the proper place.

            Please Delete your comment too giving the false perception I'm nuts for opposing my University of NSW Professor Father (chem-eng / co2crc clean coal research etc) being found guilty of disrespecting convicted XYZ pedophiles for one mere comment link that is refered to in case law here:

            i.e. Mark J Newton and Peter Troung you can look up here:
            <a href="https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/">
             https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/
            </a>
            or I'll do that.
Let him have the last word not me. Note the same link causes link is in case law, and the XYZ judge court rules the video about Newton and Peter Truong doesn't autoplay, but the internet archive says that it does even in the html source. Your IT skills could tell you something is up here when the government takes over 3 years to try people for disrespecting convicted XYZ pedophile felons who were praised by state media as XYZdads.

Yeah well it's case law not conspiracy theory. With something I wrote as well sourced as what I said from mainstream sources it couldn't be anything else. I just had to have the last word on the topic to prove it's no hairbrained conspiracy theory - unless the government has got into the business of publishing them.

            GLLO Special Gay segregated police exist because all normal police can't be trusted to do the bidding of the elite (biased) LGBTI that Harvard's best innovation in American government too. The fact they even exist that implies gays are godlike and are not subject to the same flaws of human nature / traits of bigotry etc as everyone else. The fact they that I can affirm is true - they are capable of that and doing BIAS RELATED HATE CRIMES to other people - i.e. myself ). I guess even the "people of colour" are out on campus in America calling for segregation of the whites these days. If it's hate speech to call out bigotry then call me a anti-bigot bigot then.

            I also got Tammy Lynne Charles (New Life IVF Thailand &amp; more) and her gay son arrested in Cambodia for Human trafficking just like the example I gave before with Mark Newton and Peter Truong and found the 400 new life ivf human trafficking customer records including the VP of Microsoft, Head of IT Security for Westpac bank, and Tim Wilson head of the Australian Human Rights Commission treating Asian women like $1 a hour breeders aka $6000 for 9 months, and they don't even tell the gayby baby breeders they are taking HIV+ semen or even the sexual preference of the so called single parent - the so called "sperm washing service" has been proven to be medical hoax (charged extra to the gay parents:

            ). Who would do such a thing? Hurt a woman and bring a sick child into the world from their own HIV+ seed when so many children need adoption from loving parents and a normal family. They are even making cosemetics out of human trafficked gayby baby placentas (rxgenesis.com - placentas trafficked by cryo-cell.com certified by @ gaydads (twitter -oops) owner of BSC, prosecuted by the MHRA and the government for operating illegal businesses, found bankrupt etc and made an infomerical THE PARENT MAKERS broadcast on infomation.tv selling children as a product, and his own twin son born 10 years apart from his older twin brother says a plug for the business: "only men who sodomize eachother make the best dads".

            If the LGBT lobby says don't hate human trafficking it's hate speech to complain if we do it - something is wrong with a society if it doesn't care about it children. Someone has got to fight to keep the world safe for children. I think it's a noble cause just like you think your's is noble. So we can agree to disagree and move on now.

            You saw the link to his actual comment, and the internet archive saying what he said, yet it was refuted by the LGBTIXYZ judges.
Enough said.
The interview with Jim Fetzer PhD (x2) of 911 scholars for truth would have shown that.

            If you see the comment on the pull request I did I've got a few patches in the pipeline over the next few months. The last of them being btrfs quota support, thought that could be implemented as a quota script and just blogged which is probably what I'll do. So consider the discussion finished on this topic and I'll keep it all from on webmin source related. But do tell all your LGBT friends to have a crack at the box when I think my security work is done, if they don't mind being reported automatically to their ISP on genuine attempts to get in (fail2ban recidive).

            That's the market I'm trying to fill and the sector is exploding now. Setting up webmin without cluster support would be an epic fail.

            I'm trying to decide to go the gentoo way of hardening webmin using selinux for a 8% performance tax or continuing the course of using apparmor that performs better. In either case it would have lots of tunables and I'm putting it off for the time being.  Maybe this comment will end up exploting some free XYZ labor to work for virtualmin doing penetration testing work, a service that costs loads to buy on the commercial market, so let's leave it here :)

The free license deal goes the other way; if you buy Virtualmin Unlimited ($20/mo or $200/yr) you get Cloudmin Connect ($4/mo or $40/yr) for free. That'd work with any number of Virtualmin servers (whether Pro or GPL) to allow use of Cloudmin Services for Virtualmin (which allows off-loading databases, spam/AV scanning, and DNS to one or more separate servers; very useful, nearly priceless really, for large operations, not as exciting for single-server deployments).

             Let's not get sidetracked into a political discussion. I don't speak for other Virtualmin folks, I can only speak for myself, but I wholeheartedly support LGBTQ equality in a very active way (I march, I hold signs, I go to rallies, I talk to legislators, I visit my reps), and it sounds like you're rolling hard on a pretty bizarre conspiracy theory equating homosexuality with pedophilia and child abuse. If I'm misinterpreted you (I am unfamiliar with most of the topics you're discussing and it's way too late for me to wander down some Alex Jones conspiracy rabbit hole), I apologize. But, really...I'm pro-equality. I don't have any interest in being supportive of an anti-LGBTQ organization. And, I know that a lot of people who oppose LGBTQ equality use made up accusations of pedophilia, devil worship, etc. to demonize gay folks (e.g Pizzagate).
