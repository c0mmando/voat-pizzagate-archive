<p>Under philanthropy, Kidco supports  March of  Dimes: <a href="https://www.kidco.com/about-us/philanthropy/">https://www.kidco.com/about-us/philanthropy/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Dimes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Dimes</a> ::</p>
<p>The organization was founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, to combat polio. The name &quot;March of Dimes&quot; was coined by Eddie Cantor. After funding Jonas Salk\'s polio vaccine, the organization expanded its focus to the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality. In 2005, as preterm birth emerged as the leading cause of death for children worldwide,[2] research and prevention of premature birth became the organization\'s primary focus.</p>
<p>..Following widespread use of the polio vaccine, the organization was faced with disbanding or steering its resources toward a new mission. Basil O\'Connor, then the organization\'s president, directed his staff to identify strengths and weaknesses and reformulate its mission.[5] The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) shortened its name to the National Foundation (NF) in 1958 and launched its &quot;Expanded Program&quot; against birth defects, arthritis, and virus diseases, seeking to become a &quot;flexible force&quot; in the field of public health. In the mid-1960s, the organization focused its efforts on prevention of birth defects and infant mortality, which became its mission.</p>
<p>..In 2003, the March of Dimes began releasing an annual, state-by-state report card on each state\'s adoption of expanded newborn screening recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. <strong>March of Dimes president Jennifer L. Howse, Ph.D</strong>. has stated that this program is intended to inform parents of the tests available in their state, enabling those with affected babies to pursue early treatment.</p>
<p>I<strong>n 2009, the March of Dimes partnered with the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the World Health Organization (RHR/WHO)</strong> to publish a white paper on the global and regional toll of preterm birth worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Kaiser Family Foundation  (KFF) website: Jennifer Howse <a href="https://www.kff.org/person/jennifer-l-howse/">https://www.kff.org/person/jennifer-l-howse/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Howse joined the March of Dimes as Executive Director of the Greater New York Chapter. Prior to that, Dr. Howse held a number of top public service positions in health related organizations, including State Commissioner for Mental Retardation in Pennsylvania, Associate Commissioner of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities for New York State, and Executive Director of the Federal Court Appointed Willowbrook Review Panel.</p>
<p>Dr. Howse holds a Ph.D. in psycholinguistics from Florida State University. She serves on the Board of The Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, <strong>the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, the National Health Council, and the James Beard Foundation.</strong> She has served on national advisory committees for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including the Committee on Genetic Diseases in Newborns. Dr. Howse is an Honorary Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>

<p>Notice the Kaiser name again.. are Ken and Dan part of this family? I don\'t know, yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Family_Foundation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Family_Foundation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, or just Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), is an American non-profit organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It focuses on major health care issues facing the nation, as well as U.S. role in global health policy... KFF worked with UNAIDS in 2004 to launch the Global Media AIDS Initiative at the United Nations to mobilize media in response to the global AIDS pandemic. Large-scale regional media coalitions operated under auspices of the GMAI, including efforts in Africa, the Caribbean, the Asia-Pacific region, Eastern Europe and now developing Central and South America.</p>
<p>Under Greater Than AIDS – a national public information response to the U.S. epidemic launched in 2009 – KFF works with a broad cross section of public and private partners[16] to increase knowledge, reduce stigma and promote actions to stem the spread of HIV. While national in scope, Greater Than AIDS focuses on communities most affected.</p>
<p>By 1985, the foundation no longer had an ownership stake in the Kaiser companies and is no longer associated with Kaiser Permanente or Kaiser Industries.[19] KFF is now an independent national organization and one family member, selected by the Board, serves on the Board of Directors of KFF.</p>
<p>The Kaiser Family Foundation previously funded professorial chairs at UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University, named the Henry J. Kaiser Professorships.</p>
<h1 id="md-notable-members-of-the-board-of-trustees">Notable members of the board of trustees</h1>

<p>Jim Doyle, former Governor of Wisconsin</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Olympia Snowe, former United States Senator</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Criticism and controversy:</p>
<p>Animal rights organizations have raised concerns about March of Dimes-funded medical research involving animals.[78] The foundation states it supports the use of non-animal research alternatives wherever possible.</p>
<p>In his book Essentials of Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach, sociologist Professor James M. Henslin describes March of Dimes as a bureaucracy that has taken on a life of its own through a classic example of a process called goal displacement. Faced with redundancy after Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine, it adopted a new mission, &quot;fighting birth defects&quot;, which was recently changed to a vaguer goal of &quot;breakthrough for babies&quot;, rather than disbanding.</p>

            The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, or just Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), is an American non-profit organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It focuses on major health care issues facing the nation, as well as U.S. role in global health policy... KFF worked with UNAIDS in 2004 to launch the Global Media AIDS Initiative at the United Nations to mobilize media in response to the global AIDS pandemic. Large-scale regional media coalitions operated under auspices of the GMAI, including efforts in Africa, the Caribbean, the Asia-Pacific region, Eastern Europe and now developing Central and South America.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under Greater Than AIDS – a national public information response to the U.S. epidemic launched in 2009 – KFF works with a broad cross section of public and private partners[16] to increase knowledge, reduce stigma and promote actions to stem the spread of HIV. While national in scope, Greater Than AIDS focuses on communities most affected.
           </p>
           <p>
            By 1985, the foundation no longer had an ownership stake in the Kaiser companies and is no longer associated with Kaiser Permanente or Kaiser Industries.[19] KFF is now an independent national organization and one family member, selected by the Board, serves on the Board of Directors of KFF.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Kaiser Family Foundation previously funded professorial chairs at UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University, named the Henry J. Kaiser Professorships.

            Animal rights organizations have raised concerns about March of Dimes-funded medical research involving animals.[78] The foundation states it supports the use of non-animal research alternatives wherever possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            In his book Essentials of Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach, sociologist Professor James M. Henslin describes March of Dimes as a bureaucracy that has taken on a life of its own through a classic example of a process called goal displacement. Faced with redundancy after Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine, it adopted a new mission, "fighting birth defects", which was recently changed to a vaguer goal of "breakthrough for babies", rather than disbanding.

              In a separate incident, former Delbarton teacher, the Rev. Timothy Brennan, who in 1987 pleaded guilty to abusing a 15-year-old boy, was removed from his priestly duties by his supervisors at St. Mary's Abbey in March, just as the sex abuse scandal started gaining nation-wide attention. However, Brennan, who hasn't officially lived in the area for three years, said mass for the diocese in Rochester, N.Y., up until a few weeks ago without the diocese being aware of his conviction.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Omega Point is the subject of a belief that everything in the universe is fated to spiral towards a final point of unification.[1] The term was coined by the French Jesuit Catholic priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955).[2] Teilhard argued that the Omega Point resembles the Christian Logos, namely Christ, who draws all things into himself, who in the words of the Nicene Creed, is "God from God", "Light from Light", "True God from true God", and "through him all things were made".
             </p>
             <p>
              Teilhard de Chardin was a paleontologist and Roman Catholic priest in the Jesuit order. In France in the 1920s, he began incorporating his theories of the universe into lectures that placed Catholicism and evolution in the same conversation. Because of these lectures, he was suspected by the Holy Office of denying the doctrine of original sin. This caused Teilhard to be exiled to China and banned from publication by Church authorities.[7] It was not until one year after his death, in 1955, that his writings were published for the world to read. His works were also supported by the writings of a group of Catholic thinkers, which includes Pope Benedict XVI.[7] His book, The Phenomenon of Man, has been dissected by astrophysicists and cosmologists to be a theological or philosophical theory that cannot be scientifically proven...
             </p>
             <p>
              Teilhard's theory was a personal attempt in creating a new Christianity in which science and theology coexist..

             <p>
              The Texas Jewish Post was conceived in mid-1946 by Jimmy and Rene Wisch, who were both working for the Federal government at the time. They became active publishers and editors in 1947... Among the landmark achievements of the TJP are: the only Jewish newspaper allowed into the Soviet Union during the Cold War of (1965-66); representation at the Johnson-Eshkol Summit in Texas; the only Jewish newspaper invited to the historic Nixon-Breshnev Summit in the Soviet Union (May-June 1972); and personal interviews conducted with leading world figures. Stories and columns from the TJP, have been reprinted in the Houston Chronicle, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the former Dallas Times Herald, the Congressional Record, as well as many other weekly and monthly publications.
             </p>
             <p>
              Besides being members of the Texas Press Association and other national professional organizations, the TJP, has been a member of the American Jewish Press Association (AJPA) for more than half a century. Founding editor and publisher, Jimmy Wisch (1947-2002), was Executive Secretary of the AJPA for 14 years and served as President for three years.

JPMorgan Chase and representatives for Alwaleed did not respond to requests for comment on the deal." Also, "Rizvi maintains an elusive Web presence. The only readily found picture of Rizvi is a snapshot of him sitting with Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and Alwaleed in a New York hotel after the prince bought Twitter shares."

             <p>
              Youth Oasis was founded as Baton Rouge Alliance for Transitional Living in 1998 by members of local social service agencies and universities who saw the need for a transitional living program for young adults aging out of foster care. In 2002, a basic emergency shelter was added to provide support to at-risk youth ages 10-17. The organization become known as Youth Oasis in 2003 and officially changed its name in 2011.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2016, the transitional living program was expanded to include services unique to the LGBTQ+ community and branded “Diversity House”. Today, Youth Oasis remains true to its foundation of breaking the cycle of homelessness in our community and state by operating the foster youth shelter, transitional living center, and Diversity House.

She was also endorsed by both the Louisiana State Democratic Party and the Orleans Parish branch of the Democratic Party. .. On June 8, 2017, Peterson shouted an obscenity at Representative Dodie Horton of Haughton after Horton asked a group of senators present on the House floor to stop talking so that the budget proceedings being considered could be heard. Peterson later apologized for her verbal attack.
