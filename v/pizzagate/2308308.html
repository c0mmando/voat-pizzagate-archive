               I think the names were Donald Young and Larry Bland
              </p>
              <p>
               Both were murdered execution-style 
Bland on Nov 17, 2007 
Young same on Dec 24, 2007

                Seems they are all unwanted sex partners.  What was behind the deaths?  Were they going to talk?  Talk about what?  Was he afraid they were going to spill the beans of about him being gay?  There may be more we don't know about.

                 There's the gay issue, which at the time might not have gone over well, plus he married

                <p>

                 Don't think he really went to college

                <p>
                 Don't think he really practiced any law, everything I have read he was taking part in, there was always 2 more lawyers

                <p>
                 Jarrett said she never met him before interviewing Michele for job, but her Father was very tight with Davis.

                  There are sure many things that don't add up in his background.  The stuff about Michelle is sketchy too.  Someone picked him out. Forgot the name of the Dem. Org.  that Bill Clinton belonged to, Obama did too for a while.  Might have been the DLC  Democratic Leadership Council?  Not sure. God, all this strange stuff popping into my head all of a sudden.

             Some of the comments after that particular CDAN Blind . . . 
"In a time of hyper-partisanship, everyone and no one is suspect (depending on what side you're on). But if you want to talk about the "other side," there's always a certain billionaire and a certain Mormon-land politician not to mention the current POTUS who are known (suspected in the case of the first two?) to have attended at least one of the parties of a certain disgraced NY real estate magnet in the 90s.
            </p>
            <p>
             The thing about politics though is that even the icons and idols are only useful to the party until they're not. By the 60's and 70's, progressives and leftists (including but not limited to man of the hour Gore Vidal) were pouring gas on the FDR-was-a-pretty-bad guy fire. Per Trump himself not even Reagan is sacrosanct on that side anymore. (Back in the 8'0s, you were a crank to suggest his people cut a deal with Iran to delay the release of the hostages until after the election, despite the fact that the Congressional investigation concluded it probably happened.) One day Obama might not be so sacred either.

             Hillary's people are the ones that started the birther stuff. It just stuck around since then. They would not show an old birth certificate to shut it up."

              The comments always amaze me.  They make you end up scratching your head.  If you see them over and over many times they are true.  But they could be repeated because people see them over and over.   I tend to believe most of them, for people are pretty smart nowadays and really are catching on.  Waking Up so to speak.

            Yes, people wonder why celebs don't come out. Well, some people have been used as examples that if you speak out you get trashed, blacklisted and maybe killed by their boots on the ground i.e. Mossad or CIA creeps. Look around, anyone that has been on here for the past year and can you not see CLEARLY that agencies such as the FBI are working for the gangsters? While I agree that that article about Macaulay Culkin came from a self than respectable or credible source it doesn't mean that it isn't at least partly true.I see the comments on CDAN and obviously the lawyer is having some shills and trolling going on. Kinda wish he stayed away from that Macaulay stuff as it makes everything look suspect. If you haven't noticed, the number 1 problem we all have on here is our credibility. The agencies and the pedo scum will always attack our sources. Shit this past Christmas'regular' family members still believe pizzagate was a false story about Hillary selling children out of the basement of a pizza restaurant!!???!!

            (Both of) the Coreys' parents seem to be more clueless than ruthless where their kids were concerned. Culkin's father, on the other hand, would sell his own body parts to the industry, so no surprise that he sold his son.

            Macaulay looks to be very much healthier in recent photos, which was good to see.

            When Elijah Wood came out about Hollywood pedophilia a few years ago (and quickly added in later interviews that he had no direct knowledge of it) he was probably talking initially about the experiences of Culkin. Those two have been very good friends since "The Good Son" in 1993.

            Mac, tell your story to a site with even bigger men with guns behind them. If you look at the real news, events are moving forward where previous ultra powerful types are loosing their grip thanks to event's beyond their control...see the New Orlean's blind for reference.

            Blind Item #8 - Door To Door Cease &amp; Desist
It is one thing to get a nasty little cease and desist letter from an attorney which you toss into the trash or hit the delete button on your e-mail. It is quite another when you are visited at home by several gentlemen who show you they are armed before having a discussion with you about things you post on the internet. Three times in the past month, the owners of websites have been visited by this group who make it very clear that no matter how true a certain story is about a former A+ list child actor (don't even guess anyone named Corey), that these stories can't be published. Yes, he saw deaths. Yes, he saw things that he speaks about because he is trying not to use drugs and instead communicate his feelings. Why do you think he lived overseas for so long? Why do you think he feared certain family members? Apparently his new girlfriend also wants him talking about his past. This will not end well for anyone. You don't think a junkie can have an overdose? Yeah, ask how that has worked out for celebrity drug addicts the past year. It is amazing how fast the website owners pull down anything about him. No one wants a visit from those guys with guns.
