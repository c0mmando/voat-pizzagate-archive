            They've been flooding the comments for months now creating doubt and pushing their narrative. I had one mod over there delete my comment fucking with a guy who I wasn't sure was real or a bot. He was pushing the narrative that pedo's are mentally ill and we should feel sorry for them, basically acceptance. The was around the time that the people in

            were outed and they started infiltrating conspiracy. Reddit has always been a shithole.

            I saw all this stuff fresh, uncensored, undeleted, including that image.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lots of creepy stuff got flushed from there and youtube.  There was one video of a kid working at CPP who said "You take care of us, we take care of you.  We don't tell secrets."  Another video of a young kid, obviously a trauma victim, promoting CPP along with his dad; the kid had a monotonic delivery that was chilling.

                I believe Skippy to be the side dad of most male Washington DC residents born after year 2000. Every single one of them are having free hot dogs from his stand every Monday morning.
The aliens taking out Tony Pedosta, I can't say I'm familiar with -  but happy hunting to them. Let's hope they spirit cook his ass long and good.

            The day after Thanksgiving, because of another stupid thing spez had done, I learned that Reddit had deleted an entire subreddit called "Pizzagate" and I asked myself 'why on earth would they do that???' Because of that I began to look into it. It was then I became red pilled after investigating every single major event since JFK. Thanks to spez for opening my eyes to what is really going on behind the curtain - it was because of his stupidity that led me down this path (aka 'the rabbit hole').

             I don't think it was Spez' idea to shut down that sub. I'm thinking it was on the orders of JA or some other higher-up. Same as when Infowars had to issue an apology, that threat came from JA too. 
Don't get me wrong, Spez is an utter cunt who probably enjoys walnut sauce on his dominos too, I just feel shutting down the sub was pretty drastic and came from the top.

             Sandy Hook  red pilled me in 2012, but PG is the last straw. Maybe worse than 9/11. My roomate warned me about 9/11 being not what we were told, but the limited hangout of Farenheit 9/11 had me thrown off the trail back then. Michael Moore is a phoney and outs out disinfo. Would never work on me now.

             Yeah I was aware of Pizzagate a little but the banning was a huge red flag and really got me interested.   So I would say Reddit and then all the MSM obvious shilling for Alefantis who I could not understand why they would defend a little pizza shot owner like they were doing.  That was before we realized he is a damn Rothschild and one of the CIA chosen ones.....destined to supply kids for sex his whole life.
