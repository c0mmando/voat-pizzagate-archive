<p>&quot;Tony, should the plan be Indian cuisine? If yes, I will send you a list of dishes
we can decide on, some of which we can make in the pizza oven.. The shopping

<p>Ashok Mahbubani is the President and CEO of Multitronics VMI, LLC from AL, while the Mahbubani-founded EKTA foundation appears to mostly operate in Haiti.

<p>It struck me that Multitronics is located directly between Redstone Arsenal in Al (which has an airfield) and Hunstville International Airport. The location in Alabama is a comfortable flight distance from Haiti. I found this to be a glaring red flag re: trafficking, in light of what we know about obscure rural airports and smuggling when related to the Clintons. Especially if the Mahbubanis are also running a charity in Haiti.</p>

            Inter-American Development Bank Group

had not yet been fully completed and began receiving funds from remaining loans.
They are charged with reinvesting loan repayments into programs consistent with the Clinton
Bush Haiti Fund's mission of promoting economic opportunity in Haiti.[8]

           Please browse the pastebin and links for more details. This also links to some medical establishments specifically in the Carribean. (possible organ trafficking?) - The rabbithole here goes into all sorts of insane places. I've never seen any real focus on this. Much more information in the pastebin.

            Good god: "Tony, should the plan be Indian cuisine? If yes, I will send you a list of dishes we can decide on, some of which we can make in the pizza oven.. The shopping list will follow. Trust you received the Army Cook book I sent to you, by now. Warm regards Amrita"

            There is a new post about indigenous (Indian) kids disappearing in Canada as it relates to Queen Elizabeth.  There have been many accounts of kids being taken on picnics, the queen and her husband show up, they take a few kids into the woods and those kids are never seen again.
           </p>
           <p>
            My comment was: "So, the queen wanted a little snack, did she?  I hear she loves "Indian" cuisine."
           </p>
           <p>
            This could be about securing South Asian Indian kids.  For sex? ... more.   "In the oven" ... of course they eat these kids.
