<p>On my last day in the ChuChu offices, Krishnan related a parable to me from the Mahābhārata, a Sanskrit epic. A prince wants to be known as generous, so the god Krishna decides to put him to the test: He creates two mountains of gold and tells the prince to give it all away in 24 hours. The prince begins to do so, parceling it out to people he thinks need it. But as the day ends he’s hardly made a dent in the mountains. So Krishna calls another prince and tells him he has just five minutes to give away the gold. This prince sees two people walking along, goes right over to them, and gives each a mountain. Just like that, the job is done. The moral is unsettling, but simple: Don’t impose limits on your generosity.</p>
<p>Krishnan loves this parable. “This is a story which I can do for ChuChu,” he told me. <strong>“But with pizza.”</strong></p>
<p>This applies to Pizzagate as a Children\'s media producer seems to be using the same coded language discovered in the Wikileaks Emails.</p>
<p>I\'m still digging, but would appreciate any info on CHUCHU</p>',

            I see this as a hindu propaganda being pushed on kids to worship their demonic false gods, preparing kids for the new age spiritual deception.

             How is Chakra Meditation considered demonic? They are not a patriarch religion. They can follow whatever gods they choose for a given situation. And hell has a different concept to them that the western followings on the "one god" religions. Do you even Hindu bro?

              My opinion: "Sorry but Christianity is reality. Watch Walter Veith's videos on the New Age Movement (and that doesn't mean I agree with him 100% on everything but he's seems honest and speaks a lot of truth). The worship of false gods has always been associated with these cult-like groups and with child sacrifice, across all the ages." That being said I still respect religious freedom as long as the false god worship doesn't involve anything more sinister

              I used to be involved in chakra meditation and there's nothing good nor holy about it, in fact you open yourself to demonic attacks, because those doors aren't meant to be opened.  I tried lots of things, but nothing ever compared to the love of Jesus Christ.  I seen and experienced things and Christ is the only Truth.  Nearly everything about pizzagate involves witchcraft and satanism, which is what the elites practice and these types of principles directly oppose Jesus, but don't oppose any of the false religions.  I'm not expecting you to believe me, but if you think hinduism is kosher, then you'll never figure out the spiritual truth.

               I study religion via my search for true magic. I believe if enough people have faith in a cause it will manifest itself. (We may be stuck in a simulation that had the cheat codes removed years ago when the gods walk.) Good for you to find something strong to give you faith. It does not have to be real to hold power. Just enough belief in the fact. I don't need to believe, you do and for me that is enough.

                 So you disprove the thousands of other religions to suit your own. Did you relatives or community have anything to do with this? It is a whole lot easier to back your own belief when others around you are preaching the same thing.

            Couldn’t read it all, but got to this part-
When Krishnan watches “Johny Johny,” he sees a universal father-child interaction. The kid tries to get one over on the dad, and when the dad catches him, the parent isn’t actually annoyed. Instead, he’s almost delighted by the sly willfulness. “Inside, the father will be a little happy,” Krishnan said. “This child is having some brains.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Having some brains? Instead of another reference for  being smart? Ew.
           </p>
           <p>
            You’re onto something. And they fuck with us by making it obvious. I’m realizing that the only way to protect kids is to start teaching other people’s children openly about what to watch out for. I don’t think we can rely on parents to explain anything to their kids, especially if they don’t understand themselves. Good work, and thanks for sharing.
