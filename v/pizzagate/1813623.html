            The depravity here has no science. Kinsey was deeply disturbed obviously, and his 'research' was how well he could manipulate others in carrying out his own perversions.

            Pretty good video.  I was pleased to see the inclusion of the Kinsey-Crowley connection and the expose of the underbelly of the "soft" porn industry (Playboy, etc.).

            Kinsey Victim Speaks Out: My Father Was Paid to Rape Me
           </p>
           <p>
            WASHINGTON, D.C., October 21, 2010 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Decades after her ordeal, a woman who says her father was paid by Alfred Kinsey, the "father of the sexual revolution," to rape her at the tender age of seven as part of his experiments on human sexual behavior, is speaking out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Going by the pseudonym Esther White, the woman spoke to Wold Net Daily in hopes that her testimony will help convince legislators to defund the Kinsey Institute in Indiana, which has perpetuated Kinsey's "experiments" as the foundational school of thought behind the sexual revolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            White says that she became the victim of Kinsey's research, which was to become a cornerstone to modern sexology, after her father and grandfather were paid by Kinsey to molest her and collect data on her reactions. WND notes that two of Kinsey's works on human sexual behavior contain tables describing sexual responses in children as young as two months old, including information on procuring multiple "orgasms."
           </p>
           <p>
            "[My father] was giving me orgasms and timing it with a stopwatch. I didn't like it, I went into convulsions, but he didn't care. He said all little girls do this with their daddies, they just don't talk about it," White told WND. White noted that she was ordered "not to tell my mother because I would cause a divorce, and that was my greatest fear. That was awful in those days, nobody had divorces."
           </p>
           <p>
            "In 1943, when I was nine, I found a sheet of paper that had boxes on it and my father was checking off things he was doing to me. He grabbed it away from me and put it in a brown envelope," she said. "It was a form with little boxes down the left side of the page, and a list of statements describing sexual acts. He was supposed to check things off, whether he did that or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            "One of the statements included the words 'timed orgasm.' I didn't know what 'orgasm' meant, so I asked him and he told me. That's why he was using a stopwatch." White said her father also filmed the abuse and sent the tapes to Kinsey.
           </p>
           <p>
            She says her mother left her father after once catching him in the act, without turning him in to police. However, he later returned, and continued attempting to molest White, even trying to sleep with her after she was married.
