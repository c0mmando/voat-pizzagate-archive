<p>“You have also to remember that there’s a big financial interest – particularly in the armaments industry – in a bad American relationship with Russia and the worse the relationship with Russia is the larger contracts the armaments industry can expect especially in the most high-tech high-profit side of fighter jets and missiles and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>“And Trump has actually already indicated he’s looking to make savings on the defense budget particularly in things like fighter [jet] projects.

<p><strong>FBI Anon said to follow the money and that Clintons were sometimes paid with people. Murray is suggesting their biggest donors would be willing to kill to protect their interests. Then he emphasizes Podesta is a Saudi government lobbyist:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;John Podesta was a paid lobbyist for the Saudi government,” Murray noted. “If the American security services were not watching the communications of the Saudi government’s paid lobbyist in Washington, then the American security services would not be doing their job.”&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Is it not logical to suspect the leakers were motivated to face these extreme risks because of child trafficking?</strong></p>

             Not to be too much of a party pooper, but Raytheon has a rather diverse portfolio.  If their contracts for missiles were to evaporate (which they're not, they just got $225 Million contract to extend patriot missiles) they would still have a large selection of Intellectual Property to sell off, or products in other fields to push.  Honestly, out of all of the Defense Sector, they're one of the most stable in time of peace.

             NAVAIR though, that's a company who is soul dependent on selling weapons.

              To whom, though? Their contracts for missiles just evaporated, and it's not like the Military is going to say, "OK, Lockheed, now
              <em>
               you
              </em>
              make the Patriots." Just saying, tho, not trying to sound like a know-it-all. Good comment. Ultimately, they all depend on war.

               Raytheon is more than missiles.  They recruit programmers like mad because they're into cyber defense.  They work in therm-optics.  Honestly, I'm fairly sure that if you can think of a weapon, a command style (like satellite to ground unit relay), or even a good number of civilian technologies; Raytheon has had their fingers into it.
              </p>
              <p>
               And yes.  They can sell off the designs for the patriot missile to Lockheed, the contracts with the plants, even the assembly plants.  It's a normal business deal.  This type of thing actually happens more than you would think.

              Speaking of selling weapons, the one entity, the huge hand in the shadows, the man behind the curtain is Israel - the Israeli government, political Zionists, more precisely.
             </p>
             <p>
              It should be front and center of every conversation because they are up to and above their eyebrows in weapons sales, nukes mischief, espionage, black flags, massacres, ethnic cleanings, data collection, cyber warfare, human and organ trafficking, you name it.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is not the only path back in history to the roots of Luciferianism but it is huge and can't be ignored in the quest for truth and justice we're engaged in.  It is my ardent hope that this issue will be the thing to pull all of that out of the shadows, where it can wither in the light.
