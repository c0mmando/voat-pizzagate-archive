<p>As discussed here on voat before Virginia with it\'s DC metro area is one of the worst places in the nation to be a child, second only to Florida in cases of missing children and known to have a human trafficking problem. </p>
<p>&quot; Apparently, the state of Virginia has by far the highest number of missing kids per capita in the nation at 0.00467. The second highest per capita is the much larger state of Florida at 0.00175. This means that a child in Virginia is about 2.67 times more likely to turn up missing than in second ranked Florida. Most of the states run about 0.0010, making Virginia an 4.67 to 1 outlier. The state of Maryland nearby to DC is also quite high on a relative basis at 0.00179...&quot;

            I think a state-by-state approach is going to be very effective.  Especially if local people work together.
I suggested my state have a citizen panel to review the problem of child trafficking and make recommendations.  They sent me to a web site that had NOTHING to do with trafficking.  Then that web site owner, who had received an email of introduction from my delegate, sent me to the NCMEC.  Not exactly the run-around, but they are just not responding to individuals.  I guess we need a state organization and website.  Still trying to think of what would be effective.  All suggestions welcome!

             Hello -  Unfortunately because of the nature of pizzagate and the nature of the entities that infest this board, I am not comfortable sharing any information about my state or my whereabouts with anyone.  Perhaps as time goes on and pizzagaters are less of a targeted class that can change.  I wish you the best and good luck.

              Oh no, I meant generalities, not specifics.  I totally understand that you wouldn't want to share details of where you live.   I am distressed that I gave you that impression.  Let me explain.  I tried to take state level action and was kind of repulsed.  I have been racking my brain to think of ways to approach my state legislature, which is different from federal.  So at that level, not specific state, I was seeking suggestions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Totally understand your concern, and thank you for replying.  I should probably fix my post to make that clear.
             </p>

              Thank you.

               Don't be too discouraged if you don't get a lot of response - this forum is borderline abusive and most people are pretty wary unfortunately of anyone reaching out that they are not familiar with.  Most of the mods are fine promoting violence and bigotry.  There are more shills than there are sincere commentors.  And some of the sincere commentors are quite nuts, spinning around and calling anything with a 5 pointed star on it PROOF OF SATANIC TRAFFICKING.   But there are a few good people and if you manage to even talk to a couple, it might help.  So again, I wish you good luck, but be careful what you expose about yourself - there are very real forces that do not want child trafficking to stop, and they are just as attracted to this place as the ones who would work selflessly to end it.

            For a second there I thought you were going to say am I the only person who saw what a creep that official was when he used the double entendre 'I make sure to enter all of them' - that is the kind of thing they would do/say though. I can't believe what just researching this whole thing has done to my mind though, it's horrible, seeing double meanings and horrific things all over the place.

            I think Eva we are overrun with shills here - the clown just above describes themself as foaming at the mouth, the clown below calls illegals ignorant.   All of that just discredits everyone commenting.

            I always encourage myself with this Breitbart tweet:
           </p>
           <p>
            "How prog-guru John Podesta isn't household name as world class underage sex slave op cover-upperer defending unspeakable dregs escapes me."
           </p>
           <p>
            Goodness sake, he's saying Podesta's so bad he should be a household name, he's a sex slave operator and cover-upperer,
            <em>
             underage
            </em>
            sex slave operator at that, a world-class one, and that he defends unspeakable dregs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bannon will be seeking justice for his friend, and he has the power to do it now.

             Podesta is arguably on his way to being household word Podesta = Pedosta.  His pizzarelatedmap is also pretty well known.
