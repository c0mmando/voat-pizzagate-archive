<li>Virginia Roberts, who was 17 at the time, claims Prince Andrew had sex with her</li>
<li>The incident allegedly happened at the Belgravia home of Ghislaine Maxwell</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Police records that could make or break Prince Andrew’s alibi for the night he is alleged to have had sex with a sex-trafficked teenager have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard made the admission to a former Royal protection officer who told The Mail on Sunday he believed Andrew may have returned to Buckingham Palace in the early hours of March 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Virginia Roberts, then 17, claims she was coerced by paedophile Jeffrey Epstein into having sex with the Prince on the night of March 10 at the Belgravia home of Ghislaine Maxwell. In his infamous Newsnight interview last November, the Duke of York insisted he had spent that night at Sunninghill Park, Berkshire, with his children, having earlier dropped off Princess Beatrice at a Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey, for a party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this year the former Royal guard told this newspaper that he recalled making a complaint to his boss about allegedly abusive conduct by Andrew when he arrived at the Palace in a car driven by his personal protection officer.</p>
<p>To confirm his account, the ex-officer – who had a 23-year career with the police – asked for access to his shift roster at Buckingham Palace and other documents. Last week, 149 days after making the request, he finally received a reply from a caseworker at the Met’s Information Rights Unit in Sidcup, Kent. An email said: ‘I conducted a number of searches. However the Retention and Disposal Policy states that Duty Records and Annual Leave records are only held for 2 years. Therefore, there is no information the Commissioner is required to supply you.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night, the former Royal guard said: ‘I am very disappointed. Why on earth did it take nearly five months to respond with such a non-informative answer? I’m also surprised to discover that any records regarding the Royal family and their police protection are destroyed, much less after just two years.’ The disclosure raises the possibility that other documents, including Royal protection officer logs, which would confirm where the Prince was at the times in question, have also been destroyed.</p>
<p>The Met declined to tell the MoS what searches had been conducted or the disposal policy for Royalty Protection department material. Prince Andrew’s representatives declined to comment.</p>

            AH HA! Now we hear officially of PUPPETS. Remember the Internet gossip about Prince Andy and Comey and a Howdy Doody puppet, except it was never clear who wore or wielded that Howdy Doody puppet or marionette or costume and who did what to whom.  Was the other party to the festivities done up as Clarabell the Clown or Captain Kangaroo?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are they furries or otherkins or is there a whole separate kinky sub-culture devoted to puppets as there is with those who love and lust on mannequins?

               That doesn't explain why you're seeking my interpretation specifically, via a comment to this submission, instead of making a submission of your own and explaining in that what your interpretation of it is and why it's relevant to

                v/pizzagate

               . If you want feedback as to your own interpretation, present it for everyone to scrutinize in its own submission on its own merit.

              Pizza Express founder Peter Boizot has passed away at his home in Peterborough. His sister Clementine Allen confirmed her brother and former Peterborough United Football Club owner, 89, had died. The entrepreneur opened his first Pizza Express in Soho in 1965 and has been widely credited for introducing pizza to the masses and revolutionising the casual-dining experience.

             <p>
              .. In 1969, Peter started PizzaExpress Jazz Club, with the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Amy Winehouse starring there. Ever since, music has been at the heart of the dining experience ...Amy Winehouse celebrated her 26th birthday with dinner in Pizza Express in Marylebone in 2009

            England is not America.
           </p>

            Of course they protect the monarchy, especially when the monarchy steps out of line.

            They call him Randy Andy.
           </p>
           <p>
            If he was video taped sacrificing children in High park, they would not prosecute him.
           </p>
           <p>
            They might lock him up in a psych ward.  Insane, but never criminal.  In English society, if you are insane, it is nobody's fault, not even your own.  So an insane person cannot be a criminal under English law.  It's an illness, not a crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not that they care what happens to Andy, it is that they care that the monarchy cannot be criminal.  It can be insane.  It is often assumed to be such.  There's lot's of insanity among the English.  An insane monarchy is still socially acceptable.

              The girl was 17 at the time so stop trying to distract from the jews running the show. She was above the age of consent.  They are just using his fame to take the heat off of their tiny hats.  I'm not defending his actions just saying it's much less important than the actual story here.

              There's much more to the Prince Andrew story.. that's why they're after him. The stuff you're seeing in the media is surface level stuff.

              I distinctly recall there was a story in the mainstream media and linked to here on pizzagate that stated Prince Andrew fingered a friend of his daughter in a womens' bathroom possibly at a pizza place, possibly this same Pizza Express in Woking.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cannot now find the story either in a general search or a pizzagate search.

                Thanks for finding that. I was certain I'd read it somewhere. So it was the "establishment mentioned," the Pizza Express in Woking.
