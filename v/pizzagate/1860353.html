<p><strong>Katy Perry</strong>, a pop artist connected to pizzagate due to her video contents, has fueled already 40 submissions here. I found that confusing and decided to do some &quot;spring cleaning&quot;, cherry picking everything relevant into one submission (including controversial posts).</p>
<p>Not only <strong>to discover what we have</strong> on one person, not only <strong>to avoid future duplicates</strong>, but also <strong>to present how we could work</strong> in the future, I start with a topic &quot;How this was done&quot;. You should pass this topic if you\'re not interested in doing similar investigations / collections, but I do hope few of us will</p>
<h1>How was this done</h1>
<ul>
<li>I used <a href="https://searchvoat.co/index.php?t=katy+perry&amp;s=pizzagate&amp;u=&amp;d=&amp;b=on">searcvoat.co with keywords &quot;Kate Perry&quot; (including post content)</a> and opened (+) all submissions starting from the oldest (in this case, from the next page) </li>
<li>I used CTRL+F in the browser window to highlight all &quot;Perry&quot; words. I went through them from bottom to top (oldest first)</li>
<li>Every time I run into a new claim, I copypasted it into a text file, including <strong>username</strong>, link to <strong>submission</strong> and type of <strong>sources</strong></li>
<li>Every time I run into a new video, I checked if the topic includes a claim; <br />
   If yes, I copypasted the claim into a text file, adding username and link to submission. Additionally, I checked and copypasted the video link
   If not, I added it only into the &quot;Videos&quot; category, passing the Voat submission</li>
<li>After going through all the 40 submissions, I categorized them as shown below</li>

I\'m new and don\'t know how to link yet, but check out the episode with Katy Perry singing to a hand puppet goat about being a sexual preteen. From what I learned, this show is for toddlers and only broadcasts in the DC/Virginia area.

            I don't see any mention there of her song E.T. The lyrics are pretty sinister and features Kanye West, who later started breaking his programming and had to be taken against his will to UCLA medical center (Who were heavily involved in the CIA mind control experiments) for "mental health problems" and has not made a convincing public appearance since.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, check these lyrics.
           </p>
           <pre><code>You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
[...]
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial

              "completely worthless" is a pretty strong claim, that would mean there's NOTHING reliably sourced in that video,

             Exactly, this way we could organize the site to make it easier to add new material relevant to a particular category as well as hopefully preventing dozens of redundant posts.
            </p>

             The search function could be improved, but the idea of mega-threads is a great one.

            thank you for your work here!  This is a model example how those in the community not finding new leads can help contribute in a very helpful way.   Not saying you are not finding new leads, just want to point out that others can be contributing like this with other individuals.

            Outstanding detail, A+++ and thanks for the effort. I almost added one of my "Related subs" comments (like I do here from time to time) to the latest Katy Perry OP, but I'm so sick of thinking about her, I just couldn't muster. Glad I didn't, you put my typical "Related subs" comments to shame. (Not that I'll stop doing that anyway :))
