            If this is all for blackmail purposes, why has none of the evidence of ANY of this ever surfaced?  I find it hard to believe that no one has ever run afoul of the system or just said eff it I'm sick of being a puppet or whatever or just plain effed up.  Or if this is held over the heads of the person's heirs as well, I mean, that's a lot of photographic evidence piling up over the eons.  If someone said they'd release photos or videos of someone with a kid then that would obviously expose the whole operation or at least be way too revealing.  Are the photos something that only LE would see?  Is this something that happened to the few that got caught (Hastert, Sandusky)?  Seems pretty stupid of them to ruin their lives just because they got sick of doing someone else's bidding but perhaps they simply effed up super royally.  In some way.  But how?  Anyone wonder the same things?

            These people do see themselves as above the Hoi Polloi and are certainly willing to abuse them.  This should not be seen as unusual.  It is the natural course for unrestrained govt.
