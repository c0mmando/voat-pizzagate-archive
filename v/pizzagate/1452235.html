            Bill Clinton's is on his right wrist; "The former president also wears a bracelet on his right wrist that he says he has not taken off in over ten years.
The woven bracelet was a present from the Colombian children’s music group, Los Niños del Vallenato, who first met Clinton when they performed in the White House during his administration. The music leader of the group, which sings and dances for peace, was later kidnapped by Marxist rebels and killed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton says he wears the bracelet to honor the strength of the Colombian people during their 40-year civil war.
“When I go to Africa they ask me about it, when I go to the Middle East they ask me about it,” Clinton once said about the bracelet during a trip to the Bogota, according to the Associated Press. "All over the world they ask me about this bracelet."

            RiseUp's canary is dead and that is extremely alarming. But if you want to do the work of some intelligence agency intern by organizing some information for them, sure go ahead. I'm not exactly sure what you'd be leaking either... public documents? Does wikileaks accept shitposts?

             I don't understand why you people want the pieces to the puzzle scattered all around in this mess instead of piecing it together in an organized fashion to find real leads and evidence... unless you're just a fucking shill trying to keep it disorganized.

              There's a difference between organizing evidence and organizing evidence and sending  it to a compromised source. I'm not sure why you feel the urge to rely on wikileaks. Whatever investigative community there is there no doubt is already here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Listen cuck-shill-jew-towel, I'll say it again, I'm not sure what you think you'd be accomplishing by particularly sending it to Wikileaks, i doubt it will have any effect in either direction, but if you want to organize information, good on you, go ahead and just shut the fuck up about it if you don't want any input and do it.

               You're an idiot. WikiLeaks is not compromised.
              </p>
              <p>
               The purpose of the Assange death speculation is to discredit WikiLeaks in an effort to prevent people from reading current and future leaks.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is nothing solid to suggest he is not alive. There is nothing to suggest WikiLeaks is compromised.
              </p>
              <p>
               The disinformation needs to end.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ask yourself, have you read any leaks since these rumors started? Have you paid attention to WikiLeaks or to the false rhetoric?
              </p>
              <p>
               The 8Chan post was proven fake, there is no evidence that the hashes released when Ecuador severed Julian's internet access are for the new encrypted insurance files. In fact, WikiLeaks tweeted saying they were for already decrypted files.
              </p>
              <p>
               Julian has been locked in a couple of rooms in the Ecuadorian Embassy for 2,187 days. He has bigger things to deal with than rumors and speculation floating around the internet. He will speak when he chooses.
              </p>
              <p>
               Facebook, Twitter, 4Chan, and Reddit are compromised and are crawling with CTR shills whose only purpose is to spread disinformation and lies.
              </p>
              <p>
               They've enlisted WikiLeak's own supporters in spreading these lies and disinformation by constantly barraging WikiLeaks posts with "this is fake, WL is compromised, don't trust WL, don't share this, don't read this, #proofoflife or we won't help you spread the truth".
              </p>
              <p>
               Another thing to consider is that the interview Julian did with John Pilger was indeed proof of life and it was released after the Twitter poll asking what proof we preferred.
              </p>
              <p>
               Instead of being relieved, people shouted that it was fake, doctored, selectively edited, and some even ridiculously claimed it was CGI.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some claimed it was recorded months beforehand and was therefore not proof of life.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is ridiculous.
              </p>
              <p>
               Julian specifically mentions the content of the Podesta emails and Ecuador severing his internet and if we really step back and use logic and reason, why would Julian spill the beans about the content of the emails months before their release?
              </p>
              <p>
               These rumors have no basis of fact.

                I already told you do you what you want. Believe what you want. Personally, I think it's probably more likely julian is fine than not. However, considering all the shady shit that's been going down (the fact that riseup's canary is missing, the fact that PGP, while not POL, was being used and suddenly now is not, the IP change, the pre-commitment tweets, the dates being changed to 1984, the DDOS attack, the weird Todd and Claire email, the fact that they have not kept to their release schedule, the documented shill-botting that was going on at

                 r/whereisassange
                </a>
                ), i know if i had information to leak that would get me killed, I'd be waiting right now until the Feb interview, lest I be honeypotted. But like we agreed, you're not leaking anything. So do what you want.

            Great post. However, it's best not to use Private Internet Access (PIA) as a VPN because it is still a US-hosted service, the last time I checked....
           </p>
           <p>
            You need to look at VPNs 1) in more privacy-friendly jurisdictions like Sweden or Norway, 2) that don't keep logs and 3) that accept crypto-currency as payment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mullvad.se of Sweden is a cheap, fast, top notch service that meets all those requirements. Personally I rate it above PIA.

            You are SO RIGHT: linking a Wikileaks pizzagate page, to friends and relatives, will be FAR more effective than linking a random video of a random youtuber.
           </p>
           <p>
            As long as we don't send anything secret, and all is already available here, on Twitter, Gab, Reddit, Youtube and so on there's nothing to be afraid of. I think the alphabets already know the names/nicks of the thousands people following and researching pizzagate, anyone of us is on socials after all, we aren't anonymous hackers or whatever but normal people.

            Hillary email #14333 should be considered top-tier evidence in light of more recent revelations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why on Earth is Hillary Clinton directly involved in an email chain casually discussing sacrificing a chicken, slang for an underage boy, to Moloch, the ancient Canaanite god of child sacrifice? Like, perhaps more so than almost any other piece of evidence, this one just remains completely and utterly inexplicable to me.

              Could it be hyperbolic? Kind of like saying "if we don't win I'm going to punch a kitten".

             <p>
              If she's trying to make a joke like that, it's not a very good one. Moloch seems too specific.

              But we need to look at this from all angles.

              Maybe, but it's just so odd to me that the expression would refer to sacrificing a "chicken" when that is clearly the wrong type of offering for Moloch, a god of child sacrifice. Even odder is the fact that "chicken" is known pedo slang for an underage boy, which, coincidentally, is the EXACT right type of offering for Moloch.

              That email, along with the related details like who Moloch is/was, is probably the single piece of evidence that forced me to reluctantly move #pizzagate from the "laughable" column to the "plausible" one.

               To me, it was the refrigerating room. I've a lot of friends that are restaurant owners, and they told me NO pizza parlor neither restaurants can have a room that big (90% of them don't have a freezing room at all, big or small). That room is an Overlook Hotel one.

            There's no harm in doing this, it's always a good idea to spread out the information as much as possible. If we later see that anything has been removed, that just further proves that they're compromised. I don't think you or anyone else is thinking about backing up anything over at their servers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, keep telling normies that there is a chance that WL is compromised.

            just make sure you dont put anything there that you dont have archived or saved somewhere else.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also remember if they detect that you're using tor to access, they now by law can consider you guilty and launch an attack against you and probe your computer. Who knows if it's compromised or not, but I'm pretty sure someone else set up a pizzagate wiki that wasnt wikileaks.

             Well they ask for submissions through encrypted email, you can't edit directly on the page so I think using an encrypted throwaway email should be fine for submitting.
            </p>
            <p>
             I plan on spending all weekend sorting and organizing what we have, backing that up, and submitting it to WikiLeaks as a further backup.

             It is certainly possible they've been compromised but it's more likely they're not and Assange is fine considering the U.K. is currently fighting the UN the past few days over his detention.

             It may be one of the shills that down voted you. 
Personally, I dont see any harm in it.
