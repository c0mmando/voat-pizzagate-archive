            Richard Wurmbrandt tesifies that in Communist prisons, they were subjected to such extreme tortures, that he shrunk from describing them all. He said that, if he were to have done so, his hearers would faint with the shock of it. Also, he said that he could not talk too much about these experiences, because he would suffer from nightmares. Katy's testimony, although different in details, is terrifyingly in agreement in spirit. There is one thing that marks all these people out (i.e., the perpetrators), and that is: They are opposed to LIFE, and every sort of good. They are a destructive people. They are a people who need to come to see that the Life of God is greater than death, and his love and forgiveness is greater than their hatred, and any sins they may ever have perpetrated. The victims too, have to come to know this reality.

            I posted the same video around a week ago, I believe she's telling the truth, would you really want to be seen on video talking about your parents doing all this shit to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also when I posted I thought then it needs to be seen, real or not this kind of thing is continuously happening to children just like her, sometimes it has to be driven home just how sick this stuff can really be. If this girl can give just a glimpse of what some of these tortured souls are going through it can only but help the cause of getting people mad enough to make sure this shit gets stamped out for good.

            Of all the SRA survivor stories I've watched on You Tube (quite a few) this one actually seems the least authentic.  I can't explain why.  It's as if she's trying too hard.  There's the contrived Joan of Arc haircut and the grating overdramatic delivery.  While she seems very emotional about her experiences, she is pretty short on specific details--the who, the where, the when and the why.  If she's the real deal (which is still possible I guess) and she ever reads this, I apologise.
           </p>
           <p>
            This really is "info wars".   I'm afraid I can't automatically trust every alleged victim with a story to tell on Youtube.

             I had the opposite reaction. Almost everything she says about programming, what her family did to her and especially her deprogramming videos check out. If she's a LARP then she's at god-tier level.

            She does seem to be suffering from mental health issues like anxiety or PTSD, which you'd expect of anyone who'd been abused.

            She's mentally ill. Watch her earlier videos, she admits to drug and alcohol abuse and mental illnesses (dissociative Identity Disorder, Agoraphobia, self harm etc).
           </p>
           <p>
            'Programmed' people would NOT know that other people were programmed. The whole point of MKULTRA was to erase people's minds and memories and create a new subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            She probably was abused in a 'local' form, she does say that her dad abused her, but it's materialized in this mental illness by the looks of things and now she's convinced it was a government program etc.

             A dead giveaway (aside from all of the admitted mental illness stuff) is that she calls it MKULTRA. We know that it was renamed in the 70's long before she was even born. If she really was a part of that and somehow was able to remember it, she wouldn't call it MKULTRA, she'd call it whatever codename, or codenames, it was as she was growing up. This is mental illness, the result of real abuse at the hands of her father, and stuff she's read, meeting in the middle and turning into a nightmare.

               Because that's not what it would have been called. Calling it that suggests heavily in favour of her having read up on the notorious MKULTRA and deciding that's what happened to her. Nope, not for me. Abused maybe, but not MKULTRA'd. If you want to see what MKULTRA did to people, see Linda MacDonald's account. I'll give you a hint, she only knew it happened to her thanks to documentation. She didn't know anything else, literally.

                well I tried listening to her story but it didn't honestly seem like a legit victim, maybe I'm wrong... but I didn't find her very believable or compelling at all. Hopefully I don't burn in hell for saying so.

                 She's definitely read a lot of stuff. I mean, your average victim doesn't know the ins and outs and all of the appropriate language like she does. That's acquired knowledge.

            Ft Hood is the largest military base in the world geographically speaking and its outermost boundaries could easily be within 45-50 miles of Austin. It has had a very large CIA presence for decades. JFK assassination reseachers determined that it served as a CIA storage facility for CIA military hardware used in Latin America excursions during the 50s and 60s and probably other covert operations elsewhere.

            Texas becomes quite desolate very quickly outside Austin City limits and the city limits of nearby towns.

           <p>
            And then there were the CIA affiliations within the Univv of Texas system located in Austin.

            I’m not familiar with her. Is she naming names? Working with any other survivors? She says she was part of a cp snuff ring located 45 minutes outside of Austin TX!!

             She's not transgender. My thought was she shaved her head to not attract unwanted male attention after all the sexual abuse she survived, and perhaps to be less recognizable from her abusers and due to the cp she is in  (heartbreaking.) I find her wholly credible

             Up vote, yes.   I listened  to the entire video . She spares us details for the most part and  doesnt say anything we havent heard before so the video is quite tolerable, except for those who may be triggered.

             She is either the real deal or an actress deserving of an Oscar. But I found her to be the most convincing and the most powerful of any of the survivors I have watched. I found myself actually holding my breath as she spoke and there were times she wss gulping for air as her chest constricted like mine with the story telling.

              Two different situations. Don't compare comments and draw conclusions from the numbers. There's no way to know for certain if this girl is the real deal or a fraud. So you posted, made people aware, and now the videos will either catch on or they won't. It's not similar to posting someone known to the community is dead.

              She's probably controlled opposition. Some truth some lies.

              Don't feel stupid, the lie would be on her not you. We've all been lied to since birth. This happens more often that you realize.

               She ain't a flake. I have tried for 2 hours to post on here about her and coming to her defense. I have been blocked until now. Been around victims now for over 20 years since my children(through their mother) were involved. Much of her story resonates with me. REAL DEAL
