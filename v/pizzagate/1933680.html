            ASHI is simply a certification program school like many others. You have to be certified by law to do home inspections. Much like security guard schools. Home inspection is not a Union profession. You generally work as an independent or a company.  These schools offer minor benefits like discounts and help with job listings. You guys are reaching here.

             it is not simply anything- it's a huge  organization with many people, and many connections, and a huge conference in Vegas (this year)..... the cert. school is just one function of the non-profit.... that's a bit like saying : schools just have classes that's all. uh, nah..... no reach at all.... especially since he was also in construction for much longer before that.... while he was beating and terrorizing his foster children i guess.... WAKE UP!

              It is not a HUGE organization. It is exactly what i told you. They are a dime a dozen. You ARE reaching  You are making the claim of all these wicked connections...well prove it.What are the other functions as you put it. Please cite. I was quashing the narrative of ASHI being in league with SEIU. That is a false correlation. That isnt how home inspection works.  There is nothing to suggest that. Do you own a home? You are wanting so bad to find a connection between the two and you are only offering conjecture and speculation. Show me SEIU connections in construction in Illinois and evidence he was part of that Union. I've already looked into this so , but I want to see what you bring me.

            Totally insane people!!
 I was actually thinking this was a bit of stretch when first looking into this guy as an operative of some sort.... figured the usual 'mentally unstable' info. would soon out. (not that he is without mental issues of course).
The ASHI connect perked my interest a bit more, but this info- in the public press now- about foster children abuse and a foster daughter- committing SUICIDE by FIRE!!! wtf, seriously..... 
then it says he was in Construction for a long time before the home inspection business! (all sorts of shady organized crime AND UNION activity possible).
and now.... now we get more details from NYT and other outlets.... living in a white cargo van on the street for months, suddenly leaving his wife and home and business - though most note no more than intense political interests and one 'angry' - and list no reason for his sudden move to homelessness at all.... then he is described as living out of van for months on a street near the park- often in the lobby of a bldg on his LAPTOP. ***DOES this really make any sense at ALL??why did he move with no home or plan? what was he waiting for? what was he doing and who was he talking to on his laptop? if he planned to hit the ballgame, why camp out nearby for months, increasing the likelihood of getting caught for something? if he left with only a van and a gun, why didn't his wife report him? seems he was not hard to find, hanging out in very public places with staff present... 
it's all a bit much really, seems like someone has something over this guy for sure! some way to make him do what they wanted.

            I don't think it mattered if he was connected to a union or not.  He was  publicly  hating Trump and republicans, and was a member of some facebook groups that voiced such. It would not have been much of a search for the Democrat hit team  to find him and set him up to do it. I wonder if they had to promise him anything.

            PS - I've now spoken with numerous Alexandrians.  No one knew that Congress practiced on Simpson field for the yearly match.  Not that it was a secret, just that it was not widely known.  Ergo, Hodgkinson had to learn this from somewhere.

            Home inspectors are generally self employed independent contractors. Anybody can become one by taking a course and meeting whatever requirements your local or state authorities might have in place. They are most commonly utilized by the real estate industry wherein a  Buyer will hire one to look for flaws in the property that then becomes useful in  renegotiating the purchase price. Property insurance companies may also employ them in connection with claims.  If high end property or commercial real estate is involved then one is likely to encounter a business that employs several home inspectors.  Not a business or profession that is likely to be unionized.  There are professional organizations that one might be involved with to pad one's resume and lend an air of respectability.

             Great!  A name to go on.  Howard Pegelow.  Research him with everyone we know is complicit.  CF,   SEIU,  etc.  Rodney Davis. Do not leave anyone out.  I think this could be a hot lead.

            This is connected to pizzagate because of the claims that the congressmen shot were speaking out on human trafficking, and previously claimed connections with Podesta and SEIU involved in targeted hits..... Watching you tube video of suspect's FB...The shirt he is wearing has the ASHI logo, his facebook also notes he owned his own JTH Inspection company, which he apparently STOPPED running in Dec. of 2016... interesting timing.... Also, the ASHI conference was earlier this year in Las Vegas, with HUD officials and many others involved.... i have tried searching connections to SEIU, they are obviously loosely connected and are discussed in various articles together, but nothing stands out.... run with this and see what we can find!!

             I so very much think you are on the right track here.  I agree that there is a very good chance they are connected in this operation.  The place to start in Illinois could be Jan Schakowsky since she supposedly has control of some operations within the SEIU and her husband Bob Creamer.  This could be the connection.

               You are probably right, and she has plenty of company.  On both sides of the aisle.  They have all fooled us.  No more.
