            *Of chief issue are self-hating pedosexuals and their enablers. They call themselves “virtuous”. In truth they are feckless and morally bankrupt.  Too many have swallowed the lies of society whole and believe that they themselves are defective, instead of those who victimize the most vulnerable. If you can't accept yourself, how can you expect the world to accept you? For them, the most important battle is inside. After that, the rest is EZ-Mode. Don’t take this the wrong way, but I’m happy I’m not one of you. I don’t have to deal with forbidden attractions on a daily basis. Even if I can’t find a date, I can easily find legal porn to watch online. I could never handle the stress of never being able to truly and fully love someone, but I can offer this encouragement:
           </p>
           <p>
            Never doubt that you are on the right side of history. The past several decades have been marked by the relentless removal of barriers to love- from nationality to color and sex. Age is the only one left, and even then the taboo is an extremely recent one. Pedophobia first reared it’s ugly head in the 1600s due to Puritan morality and a Victorian view of sex as inherently evil. After a long period of liberalization, the paranoia reached crisis levels in the 1980s with the rise of the religious right, "family values" and criminalization of child sexuality. While stigmas against the number of people in a relationship remain, they are not nearly severe as the one against age. The end goal (and best kept secret!) of the queer rights movement has always been complete sexual liberation for all people and all ages- not just gays and lesbians. You can read this for yourself in their founding documents which advocated the repeal of age of consent laws until circa 1980. Society can only take so much change at a time, so it made sense not to force everything all at once. So far, they’ve done a great job. Now it’s your turn to pick up where they left off and finish what Stonewall started by demanding equal rights. Nobody will stand up for you until you stand up for yourselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Forget what society has told you: Pedophobia is not natural. It's an entirely manufactured hatred, one that rests on shallow intellectual foundations that are province of the weak-minded. America has been wrong before and it’s wrong again. I could go on all day debunking the lies misconceptions and stereotypes, but this book isn't about that: You already know the arguments. This book is about how we will overcome- kinds and straights, together. We will degrade, defeat and ultimately destroy pedophobia everywhere it lurks in society*

            Yeah, this is clearly beyond just pushing for acceptance, there's a sense of confidence that he/pedophiles can influence society in such a way as to reverse roles of abusers/victims (in a way it's kind of like MKULTRA ritual abuse, confusing the victims into thinking their victimizer is also their protector/one that actually loves them) and turn society against the parents because they are absuing their children for not letting them be abused. It's really insane and scary stuff, and I get the vibe from that page that this guy is actually bragging, essentially saying that he knows this is what is happening and will continue to happen, and is slyly playing it up like he's making it "acceptable" when he really knows that's the plan all along. Kind of a nod to elite pedophilia and government complacency in the abuse.

            These old perverts are disgusting.  Ernst Steiner is the leader of that group.  Here he is crying about the 'bigotry and hatred' of people who don't like paedophiles.   His narcissistic and sociopathic thinking is blatantly obvious.  He cares not one jot for the rights of children to a safe and happy childhood; for their rights to decide on what they will do with their bodies when their brains are fully grown.    For pedophiles, all children are simply sexual objects for them to masturbate over, and manipulate, groom and prey upon

            The rotating banner is insane, literally has all the known symbols and variations of it combined with perverting quotes from people like Nelson Mandela (the whole reversal/corruption theme). I archived the two articles linked here:
            <a href="https://archive.fo/7imu7">
             https://archive.fo/7imu7
            </a>
            <a href="https://archive.fo/9nGwv">
             https://archive.fo/9nGwv
            </a>
            . Also noticed the "accessible pedophile" link and archived it
            <a href="https://archive.fo/eAZzY">
             https://archive.fo/eAZzY
            </a>
            . It's extremely disturbing, essentially describing how they want to do their PR and make it accepted by the public via "accessible pedophiles", which I can only imagine would be famous ones, probably from Hollywood or similar. Unbelievable how blatant this site is.

            Here is a mention of Pizzagate:
           </p>
           <p>
            "…On the one hand, we have situations like these “pizzagate” people, openly cobbling together a bunch of unrelated bits of information, while constructing and promoting an unwarranted narrative around it…It’s the sort of thing that leaves you asking, “Who are these people, and what is wrong with them?”…That’s not just a matter of sloppy “reporting”…It’s a matter of social paranoia, and breakdown in logic faculties…"
