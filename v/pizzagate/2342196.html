<p>David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, were arrested at their home in Perris, California, on Sunday after their children - aged between two and 29 years old - were found padlocked and chained inside a foul-smelling room, according to police.</p>

            Find out who your county sheriff is. Then look at the chief deputies, see what their background is. If they have a Dyncorp background, if they have a militaristic practice of policing.

            The dad worked for dyncorp, Jeff Epstein was heavily involved in dyncorp. Some news report says the teen called from a cellphone left in the house, some say she fled the house to call, and news didn't even say if it were their kids or stolen tight when the news broke out. Wouldn't you want parents with lost children to know they were not their lost loved one?!

            John Bennett Ramsey, father of JonBenet Ramsey, had links to Lockheed Martin. There have been rumours she was a victim of a child sex ring.

            What kind of a controlling creep calls their female daughter John and Bennett?

             John Ramsey didn't just have links to Lockheed Martin; he was founder, president, and CEO of a major Lockheed Martin subsidiary, Access Graphics, that made up to $1 billion annually. And supposedly, all of this money just came from selling unspecified computer services - I personally suspect they were involved in some black-budget projects on behalf of Lockheed.

            They took a lot of trips to disney, seemingly one of the only things the kids were allowed to do... very strange, wonder if they had some sinister sponsors for those trips? Trust your instincts, that lady has crazy eyes you could spot a mile away...

            Apparently this is a side by side of where they used to live and their current home where the kids were found.

            I don't know much about American houses but to me it looks like they downsized. Did they decide to get a smaller house in order to keep the children under control more easily?

            Was the school a front for a child sex ring?

             I tried to look up the old house on Zillow and can't find that exact address on that street so that's odd. The new house is over 2300 sq feet so it's not exactly tiny. A lot of these newer American track homes often look smaller when they are single story than they really are. They may not have necessarily downsized, just moved to a different community  since Murrietta and Perris aren't exactly close by each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm still bothered by not being able to find the old house....

            Who is the father of that small Baby?  and who is the mother?  I want to know.  They must take tests to find out.  Oh God.  Also what really Scares The Hell out of me is that CPS will be the caretakers of those children when they are released from the hospital.  What in the world could be Wrong with that, especially in Cal.

            Others said they had seen the children digging for food in the garbage bins, but had not taken notice as it did not look sinister.   WTH is wrong with the people in this hood?   Children digging in garbage bins for food and they thought nothing was wrong with that?  Others in the hood also were on Cloud 9.  They said the kids looked like albino children and looked emaciated.  Why would you want to snitch on bad parents, right?  O God Please.  This country has brain washed people into not caring anymore.  Political Correctness Has Run AMOK.

            There is so much more to this story than we are being told.  And Oh My God.  How many times are we going to hear that no one noticed anything odd.  I saw on the news that they took them with them to LV and to Disney.  The grand parents are another strange addition.  They said they never talked to the children only the parents on the phone.  Are they involved in some way too?  What kind of people are they that never talk to the kids.  There is a lot of confusing stuff here.  I heard on the news that the father worked at some Electronics or Electrical Firm but also Home Schooled them.  How could he do both.  Too many unanswered questions.  Yikes.

             Lots of weirdness. And two maternal aunts have spoken up saying they hadn't seen the family in years, having essentially been cut out of their lives. One aunt claims she was sexually abused by a relative as a child while the other one became highly offended online by people wondering if the two year old was the product of incest. She hasn't seen them in a decade or more but unequivocally denies incest is even possible in their family! Uhhhh, your other sister was a victim of incest, but ok, we believe you!

              Not a bit surprised there was incest in that family.  The grandparents seem extremely strange as well.  I have a feeling there is some really sick and perverted stuff in their background.  Good God I wonder what more will come out as this unfolds.

            Noticed in passing a bankruptcy filing in 2011 then a home purchase in 2013.  To my knowledge, you must wait five years to purchase another home after a bankruptcy although it could vary.  But the only sure possible way would be to lay out the purchase price of $351,000 in cash.  Red flag.  Who has that kind of cash right after a bankruptcy procedure?

             The police should get surveillance of the people/cars who have visited the house previously!  Also every video on site from within the house, I reckon its going to be a website they run, torturing and abusing the kids on demand.....just too sick to think.  ALSO just a thought but how many of the houses that were 'torched to smithereens' in the California 'fires' housed similar contents they had to get rid of???

            There are two supposedly different David Turpins with different middle names and similar ages who both have lived recently in the town of Perris, California. The other Turpin (middle name Leon) is listed with different relatives, possibly a wife and kids:
           </p>
           <p>
            David Allen Turpin:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            David Leon Turpin:
            <a href="https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/results?name=David%20Turpin&amp;citystatezip=Perris%2C%20CA&amp;rid=0x0">

           </p>
           <p>
            Could he be one of those guys who keeps two families and that's why he's broke even though raking in a nice salary?
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Interestingly, David Leon now lives in nearby Hemet, location of Scientology's Gold Base, nicknamed "The Hole" by church members who have endured what they report as prison-like conditions there.  The church says it never existed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Hole:

           <p>
            To be clear, I haven't found a direct Scientology connection to Turpin.

            The Sandcastle Day School they operated out of their house was listed on the California Dept. of Education School Directory:

            The website is fake. They say they are a Cadence School, but the Cadence website says they have no school in Perris, CA:

             All I could think about when I read Sandcastle School was middle eastern Princes...what were they teaching the children there? How to please a middle eastern Saudi? And if this was there only means of supporting themselves then at least Trump is slowing this down...unfortunately the kids are the ones hurting...I hate these vile people

              Solid legwork. Those houses are practically on top of each other. Seems unlikely neighbors wouldn't of heard occasional screams or other noises from all of those children, especially when god knows what was done to them.

              Does lockheed have a non-compete agreement? I understand the state of california makes those moot, but at the same time, it strikes me as odd that he works for the bitter enemy of his previous employer. Something is not adding up here.
