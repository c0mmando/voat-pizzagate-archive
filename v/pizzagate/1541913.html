<p><strong>1. The FBI liked your video</strong>
How would he know unless he had an insider in the FBI? </p>
<p><strong>2. They are right about me. But Im not into kids</strong>
He\'s into something else. Perhaps torture... or submission.... or trafficking...There is definitely something huge going on. </p>
<p><strong>He threatens to sue Ryan personally but balks at the expense.</strong> 
This means that despite him rubbing shoulders with the elites, they\'re not going to go to bat for him. He is a bottom man, and may be cut loose soon.</p>
<p>**He needs to protect his family. **
From what? from us exposing the truth or the elites that have turned on him?
I have no doubts that the elites are not happy with him being the source of the investigation....what better way to get rid of him than blame a false flag on pizzagate researchers? </p>
<p><strong>He threatens Ryan into removing the video and asks him to blame Youtube</strong>
This means he has no clout with youtube. He couldnt ask a youtube insider to do it for him. 
This means that the videos that are being removed from Youtube are done not to protect him specifically. Someone higher in the chain is using the suppression to protect themselves. They are letting him burn.</p>
<p>The entire exchange has some rather unexpected discrepancies. He may have been the 49th most powerful person in DC a few years ago....but this exchange indicates that may no longer be the case.</p>
<p><strong>Could it be that James finds himself caught between us and the elites?</strong></p>
<p>We are using him and his connections to expose the elites. The elites want to divorce themselves from the whole situation by isolating the whole situation to him. The media narrative has been &quot;poor small business owner targeted by hate group.&quot;
But should we find out something undeniably damning, the elites wont hesitate to have him go down with the ship. People look out for themselves. It\'s alot easier to finger a small business owner as a pedophile, and mark it as an isolated incident.</p>
<p>The people are digging to expose his secrets. The elites are capable of creating false flags. </p>
<p>So James finds himself caught between us and them. Either he gets exposed, or he gets false flagged. </p>
<p>Keep digging. lets turn up the pressure and see where this goes.</p>',

            They have to be pissed because it was actually the posts and the stupid comments left on his public instagram accounts that blew the lid off of this. These clowns got too comfortable and now they all have a major problem. I am guessing the discussion right now is do we suicide him or does that bring more heat so let's figure out a way to lay the whole thing on him so we can get the heat off. You people investigating this are doing great work, keep up the fire.

             The only thing protecting him right now is that he's got dirt on people and is likely promising that if he goes down, they go down. How do we get him to break rank? What abput one of his friends?

              Doubt he has any friends left right now, I think it's a matter of who does he fear more, and right now he fears them more because he knows they will kill him or his family.

            Why is no one questioning that the claims of Ryan are real?
I mean who is thinking about his webshop to promote it, after his life, his mother's life and his girlfriend's life has been threatened?
Who does not get the police involved?
It's very important as life-insurance.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the threats do not make sense at all: threatening someone, after the video has been published on the net? Come on! The motive for this threat is not even there, because the leak can no longer be sealed. Therefore it must be ignored and downplayed. But thereatening the uploader is creating PR for it!
           </p>
           <p>
            And JA and their network very well understands how PR works.

             Alefantis in many ways is typical queer. Overly dramatic, attention whore, loves being the "pivot man" for a league of perverts. I think his primary "love" is money and power. He has both, at least over his little world.
            </p>
            <p>
             In tracking all of these followers and their various posts, which one assumes means that they wish to be identified with what they post, it is clear that these mutts are seriously twisted. Nonetheless, within those questionable circles, there is a hierarchy of weird. Some are just nibbling around the periphery of the whole sordid affair, others are deeply striving to identify themselves as the bull goose looney leaders.

            A lot of men don't like women.  at all.  and they rape and  murder them.     I don't know what this means, but like you said,  why does a guy who doesn't like kids. at all.  have so many  horribly suggestive and  alarming kid pics in his IG, and  Hadrians lover Antinous as his avatar.

            One theory might be that his mom is living at the pegasus place which is why he mentions protecting his family and why he targets the pegasus video.

            Very well could be. The pictures I see are all really close up of their nails and one nail would be completely different. An example would be all blue nails but the ring finger has a different color with some design on it.

            I've seen this on multiple accounts with different people, all have children as their main theme. The only way I can think to confirm this would be getting an insider to admit what it means.

             I'm not saying there's not some kind of code at work in those accounts, but nail art and painting one fingernail a different color or pattern seems to be very trendy now.

            The thing about people not suing because it's too expensive - I think that's just a line, an excuse for why people aren't suing, when the real reason they aren't is because if they sued the defence would be that it's all true, and there would be an investigation and more publicity. It's not worth the risk. I think that's partly why Wikileaks said they'd sue CNN over the pedophile claim - it showed up all the people who haven't been suing over the similar allegations against them.

            For all we know this stunt could be a a way to stage another false flag like the CPP shooter, this time at pegasus, parade us in the media as quacks that went off the deep end, and introduce some new censorship.

            Plausible summation. I'm sold alefantis seems to have personal shills on voat. Your post makes me wonder more so if he himself is fighting back with little to no help other than he and a few others. Alefantis &amp; CPP could be a CIA plant to facilitate a small branch on a large tree. That would explain his incessant attempts to skirt a pair of breeze block boots. He made the first mistake of a criminal, he was entirely too complacent &amp; cocky to post all of those pictures online to public sites. They can't wait to take him out.

              I know the feeling. As soon as I saw that picture, well you know what they say, 'the eyes are the window to the soul', so I just knew. People say that when they become murderous, their eyes turn dark, almost black. Ok, excuse me, going to puke now!

             Excellent points, the whole rolling gate to me suggested a stringer operation.  The go to ground between a Waco-like compound and CPP.  CPP seemed like a place to show off the wares.  I think this is abc operation.  A=Waco-like kid stable (factory).  B=Pegasus (warehouse). C=CPP (retail)

            more interesting point we are learning is that the FBI is watching the videos and "liking" them. That tells us the FBI are watching this for some reason other than monitoring for Alefantis safety, and that verifies our suspicion the FBI knows more than they are saying. It's an admission from Alefantis something freaky is going on worth FBI attention.

            I disagree. The payoff on a deal will be proportionate to the value of the information. If him flipping helps the feds get an entire network of high level traffickers Alefantis and family will disappear into witness protection and will probably live the rest of his life on a beach with a protection team.

             Could be faked FB video sure, but the wall in the 'kill room' welding workshop place matches in the pics. For the whole thing to be fake

             would have to be a fake or hacked to have modified images. This is why you should have at least two sources of things. At the end of the day some pics of people doing plumbing work with inappropriate hashtag comments isn't proof of a crime, there has to actually be a body in the hole.

            There must be something going on at Pegasus. I remember seeing a video of people confronting him at comet ping pong and he seemed open about showing them around to prove that there was nothing to see. When it comes to Pegasus though he isn't so open about things and wants to silence any talk about it.

            People have mentioned his mom. Susan signed a letter supporting convicted child molester Christopher Klomen. That's probably why he's worried she's in danger. Either that or he's worried someone in the ring or intelligence community will target her.

            Seems obvious to me, kill room isn't his concern, the location isn't his concern.  His concern seems to be Pegasus, and the people involved with the project.  I think everything in DC is locked down, i.e. protected.  But PA may not be as policeman friendly, and/or the people involved with this project pegasus are higher ups and/or people who scare the shit out of JA.  I believe the key is linking the pajama factory.  The people involved in this project are located in PA, that is the KEY!  The people involved and the Pajama Factory!  Do wayback searches and find out what has been deleted from the named individuals in his kill room original video and the pajama factory since PG began.  Strange things, dead people, haiti/dominican children, Im telling you something not good is still connecting JA with pajama factory and JA is scared to death!

            Most of James' comments make no sense and up until reading the text messages, I thought he was smarter than that.  Whether he dipped into the box of wine a few too many times or not, I have no idea.

            Not necessarily- the account creates sympathy -"oh that poor hurt pizzaman just trying to make it".  It's all about PR and a little bit of mad money doesn't hurt.  It takes 10 minutes to set up something like that and creates a portion of a front story.

            "He needs to protect his family. ** From what?"........I'm no shill but JA has probably gotten some serious death threats over this stuff. I can understand how he's freaking out.
           </p>
           <p>
            And here's the problem though. This entire shit show could be avoided if Law Enforcement did something. But all we get is the DC police saying they investigated and found nothing but we find out they didn't even investigate anything and they lied. That is so sketchy it makes you sick. You combine that with Edgar Welch discharging his rifle inside CPP and wouldn't you know he hit CPP's computer system right in the hard drive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something is very very wrong here and the longer Law Enforcement does nothing the more suspicious people will get and try to become vigilantes which is never good. What a shit show this is.

            I thought it was weird he knew what a shill was, but not a mod.  Translation - knows political op talk "we hired some online shills to shut down the thread", but doesn't go to online forums much at all himself.

              Actually, no. It does look like a farm to me. This looks like the interior of an old barn. Just picked up this picture from flickr.

            himself. He could be cross examined in court. The other party could start a slide show of all the images he posted on Instagram, asking questions about those. He won't open himself up to that, he is smart enough to figure that out. Money is no object for him.

              To get the neighbourhood behind him. Do you really think someone that owns multiple houses and real estate has to crowdfund money? That whole "we stand with Comet" was an orchestrated action by a specialised company. Which company was posted at the time, can't remember it.

                I remember someone found the PR company behind the "we stand with comet" crap. I can't seem to find it anymore. In the court papers of the lawsuit Brock had, Brock his ex wanted about 17 properties Brock owns. He was just with Alefantis at that point. Now sure if Alefantis also has that many real estate, but it doesn't seem unlikely he has at least several properties. It might be possible to find out all the properties Alefantis owns if someone dives into property records.

            'hes a bottom man and may be cut loose'
clearly he's at least a middle man - 49th most powerful man in DC? - But the mass red-pilling that would occur were they to try and defend him might mean the have to cut him loose. Look at Epstein - Billions couldn't buy him a judge to quash his conviction - the names of his accomplices were suppressed as part of the deal, though (which also gives us hope the pedomafia are not yet all powerful)
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis may be hung out to dry , to 'take one for the team' . But this investigation cannot end without Podesta's scalp at the very least, if the evidence is true to its dark inferences.

             I'm not disputing your overall point, just pointing out that in Epstein's case, didn't he only spend something like eight months in jail, and he got to leave during the day? They put him in jail just for show. He wasn't forced to actually STAY there 24/7, the way most inmates are.

            So after reading alot heres my speculation. It´s seems to me JA is some kind of art dealer/has involvement and most likely is doing money laundering for elites in DC to screw IRS over. You need a "Museum" to show off the art he wants to sell.

             Cats are not evil. "Evil" is a very simplistic term. I've worked with hundreds of strays, housecats, and outright feral cats &amp; I've never met a cat that was hateful. Toward each other..... sometimes, but they only show us fear; never hate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hating animals &amp; harming them is a typical precursor to psychopathic tendencies; of which serial pedophilia &amp; cannibalism are two examples. Pets are important in teaching children empathy, and responsibility. They've served us in so many roles throughout history and we owe them respect.

             Ugh, cats aren't evil at all. I never could stand cats and dogs because of the fur and the smell, but house cats can be such pretty and amazing creatures. They are very clean and some don't lose their hair. I have one now and I'm completely in love with him. He's a sweetheart and the kids have never been happier :D

               Haha, cute, but this only proves one thing. Cats are curious and like to play. They also are impulsive. There is also an age where kids like to throw stuff on the groud just to get a reaction or see if it's going to get back up or into their hands. It's called curiosity. I think the saying 'curiosity killed the cat' was very well thought of. The cat doesn't give a crap about your feelings, he's being driven by impulsions. Without intent, evil can't be proven.

                  Did you ever watch your cat look/growl at things that humans can't see?  Mine would be attentively following something around the room that nobody else saw.  CLEARLY a view into another dimension, possibly the afterlife.

                 Omg, thanks for the laugh! That was really funny but so speculative. Can anyone really read cats' minds? I wish you could, maybe then you'd really appreciate their simple-minded, a bit lazy and at times capricious natures. Other than that, cats are great to keep houses clean from mosquitos, flies, lizards, cockroaches, bees and spiders. My cat doesn't like anything other than cat food and as much as I'd love to see him get excited when I sometimes serve him some of our left overs (meat or fish), he won't have it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I guess I got lucky with mine :D
                </p>
                <p>
                 Edit: He does sometimes get 'crazy' as all cats do and starts sprinting from one room to the other as in a panicked mode for no reason. Doesn't impress me though haha.

            George Webb of the Eric Braverman videos suggested Alefantes was organizing a Brownstone operation (CIA or other intelligence unit sets up powerful people in compromising positions - like with kids-  for leverage purposes). So he's not into kids per se. On the other hand, Alefantes being the likely sociapath he is, could mean the opposite of what he said is true. I.e He's into kids in a major sick-arse way.

            Politicians and Celebrities get constantly lied about and subjected to "Fake News" about them their entire careers. They get stalked, harassed, and threatened all the time. It's what happens when you get fame, however small and

            I found it surprisingly creepy when he kept referring to his "family". Like, these aren't just friends and people he does business with that involves fucking and killing kids, they are his "family".

              He probably knows someone that works for the FBI, especially after everything going on.  Hell, I know someone that works for the FBI.  I think he's just throwing names around here since he knows he has Ryan quite shaken up.

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I didn't know what he meant until he said "but don't like kids. At all." so I assumed he simply meant that he was gay, just not a pedo.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Suing Ryan - Could be expense. Could be he doesn't want his dirty laundry run through the court system.  Once it's entered into evidence, it's free game to discuss and will keep this in the news much longer than he wants.
           </p>
           <p>
            Family - I think he means it as it sounds, his literal family.  I don't know the details but I assume he has a mom, nieces, nephews, partner, etc and doesn't want internet idiots harassing them or showing up at their house with a gun and demanding to see their basement.  There are some crazy and stupid people on the internet. Can't blame him here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Video removal - I agree that YouTube is removing pizzagate videos for their own reasons.  We've already seen them removing and censoring others discussing the same topic even when the video doesn't dox anyone.  I watched a video that was basically just someone in the Comet neighborhood filming the surrounding area so people could get a perspective.  Pizzagate was in the title ONLY.  DELETED by YouTube.
           </p>
           <p>
            Powerful - He's buddies with the Podestas.  James may not be powerful but he's friends with people who are.  Look how little effort it took for him to have John show up at a tiny Hillary rally at Comet.  They're not merely acquaintances.  Had Hildabeast won the presidency, James would have been a lot more powerful than he is today.  Same with the Podestas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Based on his aggressive and threatening demeanor towards Ryan and his family, I'm convinced James is the same dickhead that created and responded throughout this thread:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1458823">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458823
            </a>
            .  I have no doubt actually.
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of everything else, the text messages have convinced me that James is small change.  He's like one of those guys that knows someone who's in the mob.  He acts all tough because he thinks that he's protected via association but he himself is not a member, just a hanger on.  Think Joe Pesci's character Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon. Hilariously, despite Ryan not recording the conversation, the text messages confirm that James threatened Ryan and his family.  James is officially more fucked than any of us (well, those of us who have not called James and threatened him or his employees) because he actually was stupid enough to threaten him via text message.  James texting the pictures of Ryan and his GF and Ryan and his mom are REALLY fucking incriminating.
           </p>

            (Ryan) for having the balls to make the follow up video and explain everything.  I'm sure James isn't pleased.

              It's clear in the voat post as well that an online forum "mod" is a foggy concept to him:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Trolls, don't waste your time. If you're not a MOD, fuck off."
             </p>
             <p>
              "mods are the head of the community here"
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, from a recent comment of his:
             </p>
             <p>
              "we don't all have have the same cultural touchstones"
             </p>
             <p>
              It's him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another telling comment, for those of us who believe he was raised from a child to be in this "culture":
             </p>
             <p>
              "let me first ask you this: as a child were you ever sexually abused by an adult?"

              The way he talks in the voat message and in the text messages doesn't fit. In the voat message, it looks more like a reasonable person, not really emotional, who knows how to trigger egos like "Show me you're not pussies". Alefantis is not in this. He's a sociopath and narcissistic person, he would victimize himself, he would say more something like "I would be really glad to answer your questions, to end all this threatens I am victim of", he's much more emotional than the guy is.
             </p>
             <p>
              To me, he's an agent representing him.

              IF they are the same person, the only 2 scenarios would be either misdirection or he wasn't sure which definition of MOD was being used - moderator vs. modification.  Or, someone shoulder surfing told him what to write when it was written and now he's surfing on his own.
             </p>
             <p>
              If they aren't the same person, wow...

             I don't think that was Alefantis in that debate challenge thread. At least not the whole time. Alefantis didn't know what mods meant, this debate guy does. Actually it seemed like Alefantis was slow to pick up on what Voat is in his exchange with the pizzagate gear guy. Someone was probably helping with the username details. Also, the case changed in responses. Some were properly capitalized and others were all lower case.

             I don't get the logic there.
How does saying "I don't like kids. At all" make you assume hi is gay?
And would you really have to like kids to torture and kill them in satanic rituals?

              The statement doesn't lead into him being gay. He was seeing David Brock for a time and there are pictures of him being gay. Up until now everyone thought kids were part of his sexuality too, now it looks like it's only for the money, and venting agression.

              gay. He's out and proud.  It's not a secret.  I'm not equating pedophilia (or the non-desire of pedophilia) with homosexuality.  There have been a lot of comments on here about him being gay (as well as emails from the Podesta files).  I assume he meant THOSE things that are said about him are true.

             Getting the smaller guys to sing begins to crack the bigger ones.  Also, as orchestrator of pedo parties, he's not that small.  He was the secretary of the blackmail set.

              No idea.  As you can see in the thread, I participated in it when it was happening though reading through it now it looks like a few of his posts may have been deleted.  I seem to remember responding to that dickhead a few more times.

              It probably just got lost in the shuffle of all the activity at the time.

               Maybe looking at the thread in hindsight makes me see it differently than I might have when it was posted. But the OP, Alefantis or an associate, sounded like an insider the way the thread flowed. Seems like it would have caught more attention.

             God damn, it's like people have never seen GOODFELLAS before!  He's just providing a pizza joint for the mafia to meet and do business, which also could mean that he is helping them show off children, but they are keep in a stable offsite.  A very innocent looking child sex slave auction block.  I agree, he is NOT a made man.  John + Tony are, fuck, aren't they even Italian too?

              Yet, he used the term shill like it was taught to him in grammar school.  I think he knew what mods were but wanted clarification.  Mods can mean moderators or in technical speak, it can mean modifications.  Based on the convo he didn't know WHICH meaning of mods was being used.

               I think it's clear that either he, himself, or someone on his behalf has been posting here in an effort to diffuse or misdirect and been called a shill.  Based on his response via the text exchange and phone calls I think this is all but certain.

                No doubt. He's one of those guys that probably jumps on VOAT a few times a day to see what people are posting about him, not because of safety concerns but because he likes to read about himself.  He definitely comes off as a narcissist.

            If, It was J.A. that's an excellent summary. At this present time all this enquiry has done is to make everyone highly suspicious of the activities, any interesting lines of proof would have been read, and closed up. In fact we have done them a favour, by letting them know what areas to concentrate on. I think Pizza gate is a diversion from the  Weiner Laptop, all the real stuff is on their held by the FBI and the NYPD. James might have got himself into something that got out of hand, but proving it would difficult.

            Alternate (and too wishful) theory--he knows the FBI likes them because they brought the videos up while questioning him?

           <p>
            In any case, I bet he doesn't directly have a mole in the FBI or DOJ. You know who probably does, though? The Podestas...

            This video confirmed for me that they use fingernail polish as code. A bunch of instagram users with children and satanic symbols have been posting their fingernails with different colors and designs which I knew meant something but was not sure. Him sending that emoji confirmed it is some sign.

             To me it looked like an offer to bribe Ryan into shilling for him. Lips could mean they can be friends or business friends. Nail polish could mean coverup. Money emoji could mean he'd get paid to do it.

              While it may mean that, I know from seeing many different accounts of these people with kids that are obviously for sale that nail polish is some kind of code between them. They use beads too which don't have to be a necklace but it usually is.

             IMO all the code stuff is probably a lot less specific and a lot more loose and variable than some people seem to think. "Pizza = boy, pasta = girl" etc., may hold in one social circle or between just two people or a small group, but have other connotations in another group, but they all use the same or similar words in general so they know at least they're talking about pedo shit in general. The painted nails, pizza talk, food talk, etc., may just all be general code words for "Hey I'm a pedo, if you're a pedo, lemme know", "we do pedo shit at this location/business", etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             The "dominoes on pizza or pasta" email suggests a more specific use, but as I said, I wouldn't be surprised if the more specific uses are variable among different social circles within the wider pedo scene. This is just pure speculation but I wouldn't be surprised if really specific, complex stuff like a fingernail color code worked on a sort of one time, in-group, basis, kind of like how illegal raves work, i.e. you get a certain code word, a certain location, a certain symbol, etc., right before the event, and that symbol, code, location or whatever is only a temporary system used for getting info about, finding, and getting into that one event.

            He could have filed the police report for real to boost his credibility even if his chat with Alefantis was fake.  The police won't know if he actually talked to Alefantis.

            This is obviously a false flag. No reason whatsoever to believe Alefantis would have a phone call with some stranger investigating him and subsequently (criminally)threaten him and his family.

            The proof video is easily faked:

           <p>
            I don't know how to prove the police report is real -- but even if it is that's not proof he actually talked to Alefantis.
           </p>
           <p>
            The phone number thing could also have been faked.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm adamant that we need proof because this is a guy who is already making money off pizzagate, and who will make more money if people believe this story, so he has a big incentive to fake it.  He advertizes his pizza gate tshirt website in his videos.

             I don't see anything wrong with selling Pizzagate t-shirts myself. I'm sure it's not so lucrative that he'd do all this to sell another 5 or 10.

             I'd like to see you spoof a similar deal with, say, John Podesta. If you can pull that off as convincingly, I'll start questioning GOT.

              Nothing wrong with selling tshirts IMHO either, but if this is a fake story to generate more sales or youtube views, that is immoral IMHO.

              I'd love to humor you with the Podesta thing, but it seems a waste of time.  I asked GOT for proof, explained why the current stuff is not proof and also explained how to prove it.  GOT hasn't replied yet since then.  We'll see.

             Kind of an odd choice but I think the child trafficking/pedophilia is a cover for some other illicit business, because of how easily it throws any investigation off track.

              Cover up for sra and mind control. Fiona Barnett mentions it in the 'Australia Pan Pizza' video I believe. Makes sense. The satanism seems to be most obvious in all of this and the evidence supporting mind control as a huge cover up in the US fits well. Like pedophilia is just entertainment for the sickos who do these other things.

             He means sexually.  But let's take the view that NOTHING is going on at Comet for a second and it is merely just a pizza place.  James doesn't have to like kids to recognize and capitalize on the fact that having kid friendly activities brings in more people than if he didn't.  I met a guy once who cremates people and animals for a living.  You know where he makes MOST of his money?  Selling urns, necklace pendants made from ashes, momentos, etc from PET OWNERS.  When the pet owners come in he already knows how attached they were to their pets and he empathizes with them, hugs them, cries with them, then shows them all the things they can purchase to help them remember their pet.  He fucking hates cats and dogs.  But he loves making money.

               Yeah exactly.  Just because he doesn't like kids doesn't mean he isn't selling them.  My personal theory is that there is some kind of illegal adoption ring going on based on the fact that many of the people in his inner circle appear to be young, single artist types with young children.  Jabaroos is one of the bigger creeps.  I think he's Jimmy Comet's contractor.  He had an Instagram photo of what appear to be his hands with two tiny dark skin hands all covered in mashed potatoes or something.  I think it's possible they are selling kids to people who want to adopt but are not qualified to do so legally.  Just a theory.  Something is going on there no question.

               But people who don't like kids usually avoid them. They don't seek them out and make kid-friendly restaurants. So there is some disconnect there.

              That's how I read it too. His hatred for kids allows him to do all of this and perhaps even propells him into it aside from the money. Psychopaths like him seem to get offended when people get things wrong about them, it bruises the ego. Like the Zodiac killer was really offended that that journalist called him a latent homosexual. The self importance can't be helped.

               It's that huge ego that made him sloppy. He was getting out-of-hand, putting himself and his creepy stuff out there for everybody to see. Classical narcissist downfall.

                I kind of feel the "mom" thing is two-fold. It allows him to justify lawfully his anger and his threats if he says he feels his family is threatened. And threatening people's families are what he does so he assumes everyone else does too. He seemed really seasoned at mafia style threats, like posting random photos with "cute", saying "not yet", "lucky boy", and the big one for me was "calm down and figure it out". Those ambiguous moves allow plausible deniability and make the person's imagination run wild in a panic and fear. This guy is really dangerous and has done some very bad things.

                  Maybe, or maybe movies are based off guys like him. He was really good at flipping the control over so he had the upper hand. Mind gaming about supposed shilling, counting down and saying last chance, which doesn't give the guy time to set up a recorder or think straight and give over his number. posting photos for no reason, making threats only over the phone, then when he had the guy peeing, Stockholmed him with calm down, figure it and this will be ok, scheming together with him, "maybe I'll explain this to you someday",  then the coverup bribe code with the emojis to make him feel friended and an insider now. He did this all without missing a beat. Pretty good for just a pizza guy who's seen too many movies.

                   Yeah it was very good, and that's why I think the people who are certain it's faked are wrong. It was a very authentic conversation and that psychological manipulation was one of the factors that indicates it wasn't faked.

            When he does the livestream to prove it, then I'll probably believe.

             <p>
              You're absolutely right about the overuse of the killroom in almost every Pegasus post.
             </p>
             <p>
              The killroom (meaning the walk-in freezer) is behind CPP's kitchen. Between Little Red Fox and CPP. Let me explain. In this video here, paused at minute 2:13,
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMGGSY0A8r8">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMGGSY0A8r8
              </a>
              you can see a door with COMET written on it. That is the door at the back of CPP that's in the backroom (kids party room) which leads into the parking lot. You can see this door being opened from the inside in this next video here, paused at 1:31
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYy0JPyZZ1E&amp;t1m30s">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYy0JPyZZ1E&amp;t1m30s
              </a>
              . Now, if you go back to the first video and paused at minute 2:13 and continue to watch, you'll see a white add-on room. Pause at 2:31. That add-on is between the backdoor of Little Red Fox (on the left) and the bathroom exit door of CPP (on the right). To better understand, watch this entire video here:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=YJrkbgiETzs&amp;app=desktop">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=YJrkbgiETzs&amp;app=desktop
              </a>
              and listen closely to how she explains (from a witness recount) at 2:49, that there is a side entrance by the bathrooms that leads outside to the parking lot by the restaurant. The size of this add-on fits perfectly well with the walk-in freezer killroom and has a vent unit (AC) on it's roof? Anyway, I also remember the JSmith van and the concrete plywood that he had put in there which are grey in color and fit the size of the walk-in cooler wall panels. I think someone should do a post on this alone. What do you think?
             </p>
             <p>
              However, the Jsmith personal killroom, well, that I have no idea. The dig room could be the back of CPP, when they were renovating and making the kids party room a half a level lower. I wish people would stop calling every suspicious place the killroom and call them by their name, for example, walk-in cooler, dig room and JSmith's (workinonmanightcheese) killroom. Peace.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: Digging site found at Pegasus! Check this thread here:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1543972">

              <br/>
              The white triangle seen at the corner of the dorrway from inside the digging room in this picture here

               https://sli.mg/WXNVRe

              turns out to be a white gypse rock block hanging on the wall of the next room seen in the next room here:

              So, the digging took place inside Pegasus and since the basement is only 608 sq ft, they must have widened it some more. Enough for another secret basement or underground space! Exciting news :D

              The only reason they haven't "suicided" him already is because they know it would look too obvious.  If it gets bad enough, they will throw out the optics and do it anyway, and hope the media helps them by not covering the incident.
             </p>
             <p>
              Either that, or as others have said they will false flag him and blame it on Voat.

               With all the inauguration hoopla on the 20th, would anyone notice a pizza place owner who just "couldn't take it anymore" and was found overdosed?  WaPo around Page 12, bottom.  Not mentioned for a day or two on Me-again NBC.

             my impression is that he was setting it up as a sort of false flag.  Something happening to his mother would be easy for him to fake, and he could blame it on pizzagate investigators, especially if they showed up at Pegasus premises or nearby.

              There is absolutely NO reason for anyone honest to go to his mother.  The only info we were ever interested in was family connections and family name, and neither of those requires visiting mom or dad.

             We've seen people digging up his family info on ancestry.com.  People are listing every known associate, family member, etc. they can on him.  Eventually, some idiot is going to go nosing around where she lives, wherever that is.  I've got people in my life that if I thought people were going to fuck with them, I'd go ape shit too.  I don't know why anyone would do something like that either but I'm sure someone would and probably already has.

                You're right. In the text messages, he's asking for a proof that Ryan is really him, and "not a shill". A shill ? Pretending to be Ryan instead of who ? People that threaten him ? To verify the way he acts ?

               According to MSM and James himself, Comet Pizza has received many threatening phone calls.  Whether you believe the MSM reports is up to you but it has been reported that they have received threats and early on  it was quite a few every day.  And if you have been following the youtube videos and comments on deddit and VOAT, there are lots of posts that people are "coming for him" and everybody he's associated with.

                that seems interested in saying things like and propogating the idea that someone is going to go after JA and or family, they are getting death threats all the time (because he JA said so, must be all true, right?), and the lie that there are lots of posts that people are threatening him.  You are smooth, but you are not that smooth, your game is pretty opaque.
               </p>
               <p>
                There are not vigilante posts by the early shills anymore, there are not hate speech posts anymore since about the second week when they got mostly mopped up or burnt out, bigoted posts and etc the same; and I've been all over this place for weeks since the beginning and there definitely are not "lots of posts" that people are coming for him - this is a lie.  I defy you to prove this.  But of course you won't and can't because it isn't true.

                 Hey.  Idiot.  Check out my post history.  Here, I'll give you a couple to wet your whistle:

                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Sorry. Way too violent of a tone for me. We're not here to be violent. THIS did it for me:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "And anyone posting here against my directive stand and make your case or be attacked and taken down with them... I say strike with furious vengeance until Trump tells us to stop."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Your tone is violent and irrational. I do not support it and my hunch is most here don't either. Either you're a shill or you are too dense to be in public alone. I'd stand with "them" before I'd support your sorry ass. In this country everybody is innocent until proven guilty. PROVEN. If proven, it's not our job to enforce the law. It is not our job to punish.

                <p>
                 Or how about this one:

                 <p>
                  I wish these assholes would quit calling these people/businesses like they have a right or moral obligation to. It's harassment plain and simple and I hope they get arrested for it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This bears repeating for those that are dense: ALL CALLS ARE BEING TRACED AND MONITORED.

                  Au contraire, it is you who must perform your nastiness on yourself.  As I said, the early stuff is gone now and you've got nothing.  I laugh at your feeble bs - two posts from the very start of this forum.  enjoy yourself because no one else obviously does and btw, I see your agenda very clearly and you are on my watch list shill.

                   Oh, I didn't realize that all of the threats of violence in the beginning didn't count and they had to originate on VOAT.  I said they received or read about them.  I didn't say lately and I didn't say here on VOAT.  So now you're admitting that yes, the threats and harassing phone calls were real.  My point is made.   But...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'm on your watch list?!  OMG.  Please, no.  I can't take it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I've been very consistent with trying to squelch threats as well as comments that are considered defamation of character or slander.  If the idiots on here want to continue calling specific people pedophiles with zero provable evidence, go ahead.  And if you're so blinded with the feeling of grace and nobility that you don't see the entirety of what's going on on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc I don't know what to tell you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Please.  Tell me my agenda.  I wasn't aware that I had one but if you could tell me what it is, I could put some effort towards my direction.  But since you brought it up, we've both been members on VOAT for about the same amount of time.  My CP is over 4000.  Yours is about 800.  I'd say people enjoy my contributions quite a bit more than yours.  No?  That would make YOU the shill.

                    nice try. .  Yes I am watching that's all.  If you are as you say, then I'll apologize in a flowery manner.  We'll see.  That's all I have to say except take your ongoing comments trying to seed violence by a pretence of innocently describing it and clutching your pearls, again, and again and again with the concern trolling, and your nonesense assertions like you just tried with me and put them on a shelf of memories.  In other words, you need a new suit, the one you are wearing is busted.

                     Wait wait wait, seriously.  Where did I try to seed violence?  If I did, I'll edit that shit right now.  I merely pointed out that he was trying to protect his mother from possible harm.  Whether James/Comet is guilty or innocent, they have been harassed and just a short while ago the place had to be emptied because there was a guy there with a gun.  I didn't realize you weren't aware of any of that.

              I don't think so. Someone researched this and found out that the residents were people with Latino names. However, if this is true, it would make sense of what Alefantis was saying. After all, not every resident of a building can be found out online.

              It would be a perfect false flag and would tie it all up in a neat little bow. "Look what your crazy theories have done! Cost a man his life!" Just a little more justification for ww3?

               JA is threatening the posters family as JA's family has been threatened.  The wetworkers have made it clear they will go after his mother if things don't calm down.  If anyone could talk with his mother and get her to talk with him about coming clean he just might.  However if the uppers see JA's communication I think both him and his mother will be wetted.

                 I think he might be afraid that the government might just get rid of him because he's causing them problems. If he goes down, then others will too and he's being sloppy. If it does happen, they will blame fake news and and the Russians for starting Pizzagate. So, they accomplish 3 things. 1. Getting rid of the sloppy attention seeking media loving Alefantis. 2. Another strike against Russia for hacking. 3. Another reason to take away our free speech and push how "fake news" needs to be controlled.
