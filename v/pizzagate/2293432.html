<p>HAITI CONNECTION!
Clinton connection:  <a href="https://cotocrew.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/who-killed-barry-and-honey-sherman-and-why/">https://cotocrew.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/who-killed-barry-and-honey-sherman-and-why/</a>
&quot;Sherman was one of the most powerful and highly-connected men in North America and was perhaps most well-known for securing a deal with the Clinton Foundation during to provide vaccines in Haiti. In September 2014, in response to the spread of the chikungunya virus in Haiti, Apotex worked with the humanitarian organization Direct Relief to donate more than $2.2 million in medical aid to the country.
Apotex struck a deal with the Clintons’ Direct Relief organization to provide drugs to treat victims of the virus, saying in a statement: “Apotex is in a position to help (in Haiti), and we are delighted to work with Direct Relief…”
Apotex worked with Direct Relief in Haiti, who was a “particularly active” member of the Clinton Foundation/Clinton Global Initiative community, supporting post-hurricane “relief efforts” there. The huge pharmaceutical company airlifted vaccinations and medical supplies into Haiti that was funded through charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation and other connected charities.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the Health and Human Rights Journal <a href="https://www.hhrjournal.org/2013/08/a-one-time-only-combination-emergency-medicine-exports-under-canadas-access-to-medicines-regime/">https://www.hhrjournal.org/2013/08/a-one-time-only-combination-emergency-medicine-exports-under-canadas-access-to-medicines-regime/</a>  there is a clear connection between Apotex and the Clinton Foundation</p>
<p>Read the article but this is the pertinent part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MSF had been conducting talks with a number of developing countries to encourage them to make use of the mechanism, but all efforts had been unsuccessful until Apotex was put in touch with the Clinton Foundation, which led Apotex to Rwanda.70</p>
<p>In discussion with MSF, developing countries reported that they did not wish to self-identify because of pressure from pharmaceutical firms and the World Bank.71 Unless a country self-identifies, generic firms are not able to obtain a voluntary or compulsory license, so the process stalls. For months, until Rwanda came forward, it appeared as if no drugs would ever be produced under CAMR. In fact, facilitation by the Clinton Foundation followed on that foundation’s discussion with the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network at the 2006 XVI International AIDS conference in Toronto regarding use of the legislation</p>

             Latest Dead Body Tied To The Clintons Turns Up Valuable Evidence
            </p>
            <p>
             On January 20, 2018
            </p>
            <p>
             Another body found in a shallow grave in Arkansas has been tied to the Clintons. Marcia Ann Bosley, who was the head housekeeper at the Governor’s Mansion before she was mysteriously let go in 1985, has been positively identified after spending more than 3 decades in the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bosley, who had no family when she was let go, was assumed to have left the area for other opportunities. She was never reported missing. According to the Hamilton County Coroner:
            </p>
            <p>
             “The body was wrapped so well in plastic thast much of the tissue is still intact. We were able to extract 2 DNA samples. We’ve determined that one was an unborn child. That could be huge in determining who else was a part of this young woman’s life.”

             Exactly!  As above, so below?  lol.  It's the same thing Hildebeast was doing as SoS for sure.  Of course UraniumOne is the prime example of this and it involved Frank G.  Still wish I could find a hard tie between Frank and the Shermans...

            The bad ones, the Deletes, can get away with ANYTHING in Canada! RCMP work as their goon squad. The Reitmans, Bronfmans, Robert Lantos, hell, they can do as they please. The Hells Angels work for them. Just one big pile of shit and the world can't see it. Got a pedophile politician from Europe whose is in trouble? Geez, where to send him?? Oh yeah, Canada. People there are too stupid to ever figure it out. Sorry Canadians but if you are truthful you know what I mean. They stomped me like  bug up here and EVERYONE played along. I had evidence of my children being threatened. had evidence of my ex wife's paper trail collecting my life insurance. Just one big shit show!  Lionsgate washes money for the cabal  then turns around and programs the children! Snuff films, The Pickton farm...nothing EVER gets done. How many politicians exposed for pedophilia. NONE. Lame lame lamest!!! Want to get away with murder, shit, do it in Canada. They own the police, the governments, the whole friggin country!!! My bet, there may have been some decency with the Shermans and they didn't like what the Clinton Foundation was up to! The drugs they sent to help the people of Haiti were NOT being used!! The Shermans thought, because of their wealth, they had a right to speak out! WRONG!! Not in Canada

             Yep, Canada’s FCKED. I have a close friend up there who tells me everything. The Hells Angels in BC Canada are the worst. They all work the ports, full patch Hells Angels, many of them, working the ports full clearance, they’re even in the union, getting friends hired. Gee, wonder why they have such a drug problem up there? The Pickton Farm had Male DNA not just female DNA and then it was shut down, no further inquiries. The higher up cops are Freemasons and yes the Hells Angels work for the Freemasons as some of them are also. Beyond dirty in British Columbia Canada. Would be interesting to know where they hold their sacrificial ceremonies.

             They're true. These are clearly murders that people have uncovered. IT'S FUCKING OBVIOUS after 5 years, but what people like you don't see is that stickied posts like this are used to place Pizzagate (the revelation that the world is run by Satanists- literal worshipers of Iblis, "the rejected one") within the lexicon of a single political party so that half of the population will summarily block out any discussion about the topic. Democrats will hear "child sacrifice" and stop listening based on brainwashing. This is part of the brainwashing, the bifurcation of information streams.

Take it to your professor, your student, your friend. It's not political. It proves to them that everything they know about our history is HORSESHIT. Show them. Understand it first.

             Sure. I upvoated and gave it a potential lead flair. I'm also going to sticky this an have you update this original submission with quotes from the new article, adding a second "UPDATE: We called it etc etc." headline at the top of the body of the post below the original headline to give it new attention. I think it's important to acknowledge our victories.
            </p>
            <p>
             Make sure you're viewing Voat's desktop (not mobile site), type your headline, select it, and click the formatting button that has an "H" on it (#10). Or, type two ## at the beginning of the line you want to change to a headline, no spaces between them and the first word.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can ping folks in who haven't commented to ask them to upvoat to raise it higher in the "Top" rankings.

             wow tyvm!  This is heating up. **&gt;
Sources say investigators found the Shermans, side by side, in their windowless pool room, each with a men’s leather belt wrapped around their necks and tied to the pool railing. Both had on jackets that were pulled “behind their backs” and rolled down over their arms.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is believed the camera in the pool area had been disconnected.**

             The “RCMP” are a joke as they are made up of Free Masons higher up so nothing happens, charges get dropped. The news already said the deaths are not suspicious. Yeah right, two people dead, not suspicious at all.

            So as I was trying to fall asleep last night, I kept thinking about this case. They don't say much in the article except that the cops "think" he killed her first, then hung her, then hung himself. Doesn't make sense.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             How did he supposedly kill her first? If he shot her, then why go to the trouble of faux hanging her and then hanging himself, supposing he could manage to do that with those awkward pool railings. There are trees on the property. Why not use a tried and true method?
            </li>
            <li>
             She had to of been dead before going into the noose, because why would you voluntarily do that unless you didn't think you were going to die? For instance, erotic asphyxiation, or someone forces you to do it with a gun to your head and you try to buy time by complying. Still, if someone wanted to hang her, why not do it from something less awkward than a flimsy pool railing?
            </li>
            <li>
             She was not a small woman. He was an older guy. How the hell did he drag her body into position in the pool and then put the noose around her to faux hang her? He wouldn't of had to hang himself, he would have died first from a heart attack.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Conclusions:

              If someone killed those two, they could have done it much easier with a few bullets to the head, or if they're into hangings, from a tree.

              The "death by hanging" was a message. Eye for an eye. Hang them from street poles.

              Either someone wanted to send a message to child rapists, murderers, and torturers that they will be assassinated for what they have done, or the Cabal is setting it up to look like street justice is occurring. Think CPP and the "street justice shooter." If it's the latter, expect to see more eye for an eye styled murder/suicide and suicides.

              Yes, I was thinking that too. And it would be a way to send a message (from the Cabal to other potential whistleblowers) that loose lips sink bodies.

             And I have to say that in every photo of them that I saw, they looked genuinely happy together. Their body language and closeness is not faked.  Its so obvious when the spouses don't like each other they stand together with phony smiles, leaning away and trying not to touch each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were making plans, going on a holiday, and she was getting in touch with friends with their itinerary. It makes no sense that a man verging on elderly and can do whatever he wants with his life could or would be physically or mentally able to do that to his wife and himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree that it was a message. I'm glad the family isn't accepting the official line of bs.

             Great observations and I agree.  I sought out that photo of their indoor pool and it does tell a story.  Even if one person wanted to commit suicide by hanging, that pool railing is inadequate.  You'd basically sit at the edge of the pool, the bulk of your body weight is above the top of the pool at an angle, never hanging freely, no matter how you cut it.  Just impossible.  Same with "faking" her hanging, it just wouldn't work.  And going back to the Doctor who committed suicide by stabbing himself in the torso, come on.  A doctor would know hitting an artery is quicker and more effective.  Better yet, drugs.  And for a father to kill themselves while their young daughter would be left alone to find them?  WTF?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes this is a message.  These could have looked like real suicides, or even real crimes (aka Seth Rich shot in the back on the street/robbery gone wrong).  Instead, these are nonsensical methods of suicide.

            Something is really wrong with this picture. Why only bad people kill good people, but good people don't kill bad people? Have all the good people become mind controlled? Where are the freemen? Think about this.

            Hi,
           </p>
           <p>
            I found George Puello (Laura Silsby's lawyer's Twitter), and he has testified that Clinton is running the trafficking in Haiti months back and it seems to be his official account. PLEASE SHARE i will send this message to a couple more users, I am hoping that one of oyu can make a thread!!!

            Say what you like about Killary but there is no denying she lives up to her name!  By the time the lame long winded Trump moves on her she will have Exited ALL the witnesses.

             I know that Trump seriously has important matters to deal with, but by the time he gets to Hilary, she'll have moved to a whole nother country. She's wrapping up loose ends and witnesses and making sure that no one can take her down.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sad to see that she might truly get away with her heinous acts. Even sadder is that history may very well paint her in a positive light even though she's a fucking inhumane monster.

             Hillary Clinton is part of a crime family that has left a trail of dozens of dead bodies in its bloodthirsty pursuit of power, according to Mike Tyson who told an audience in Las Vegas: “Hillary is America’s most prolific serial killer – bar none.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Manson family ain’t nothing compared to the Clinton family,” Tyson said. “Ted Bundy? John Wayne Gacy? Please…that’s kiddie stuff,” Tyson said, pointing out the Manson family murdered four people, while Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy accounted for 35 and 33 respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the 51-year-old former heavyweight champion, who was warming up for the next leg of his Undisputed Truth 2 speaking tour with a small show in Las Vegas, these death tallies pale in comparison to the number of victims who have met their maker at the hands of Hillary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             “She murdered her very good friend Mr Vince Foster. She deliberately on purpose let Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans die in Benghazi. Do you know how many of her personal bodyguards have died deaths of a premature nature?
            </p>
            <p>
             “Twelve. Twelve young men in close proximity to the Clintons have died premature. This information is all out there. You can look this up yourself. All of these bodyguards are indeed dead and it might all just be a tragic coincidence. Now I don’t know about you but I wouldn’t want to be on their list of associates,” Tyson said, before encouraging audience members to Google “Strange deaths surrounding Clintons”.
            </p>
            <p>
             “People in a hundred years from now going to look back at us and scratch their heads saying ‘Uhh really guys? Really? You couldn’t see what was right before your eyes?”
            </p>
            <p>
             “How many more witnesses do we need to commit suicide by two bullets to the back of the head just before they about to testify against the Clintons before we start to say ‘Hey, something here sure smells fishy’?“
            </p>
            <p>
             Accusing Hillary Clinton of literally getting away with murder, Tyson said, “Sad but true thing is we will never get justice for her. We the people will never see justice served. She’s above the law of the land.”

             Wow, new respect from me toward Tyson. He was always very eloquent when speaking about boxing, particularly about its history, but outside of that I never heard him put sentences together that well. Like I said, respect.

              On his rape conviction...
             </p>
             <p>
              He never did it. When asked if he was upset about being imprisoned for something he says he didn't do, his exact response was:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "No, because even though I never raped that woman I have done a lot worse things in my life than rape. So I deserve to be here."
              </p>
              <p>
               He was severely molested as a child, lived in the slums, and then was wrongfully accused of rape. Tyson has always been a decent person, he had to live through some troubling times and media narrative/bias to make him into the good person he always was at heart.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dude does a shit ton for charity and for the people he interacted with while boxing.
              </p>
              <p>
               From reading his biography, it's most likely murder. Probably more than one. He had quite the temper and was involved with gangs as a teen. He discovered his talent for fighting after he absolutely destroyed some kid for taking one of his pigeons and killing it as a way to make fun of him for raising birds.
              </p>
              <p>
               Harvey Levin interviewed him on that show he does on Sunday on Fox. Really good, and he talked about the pigeon getting killed, and Tyson still has a whole bunch of them. He showed them on the show. He breeds them and has always loved them.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don’t care what anyone says, I think you can tell a whole hell of a lot about a person by how they treat animals.
              </p>
              <p>
               Especially non-tradition pet animals like pigeons. Many “normal” people would gladly take a pellet gun to the park and pick birds off one by one instead actually care for them.
              </p>
              <p>
               The guy had amazing talent and he was preyed upon by vultures. In a different world he could have lived a very peaceful and happy life. It probably would have suited him, or anyone of us, a whole lot better.

            my takeaways:
1. expect more murder-suicides to come. hopefully they dont prevent the case from being pushed further.

              look into pharma companies involvment. systematic drugging of populations? just like boeing and lockheed contract on top secret govt. projects, im sure pharma companies also do secret govt work. think Montauk and mk ultra, monarcch mind control.

              In light of the above link, we should look to countries thathave avoided cabal controlled. Coincidence that these are all countries typically considered US enemies? might be time to put aside differences until the common enemy of the cabal is defeated.

              look at Operation Condor inS Ameriva?  how about us-installed pinochet in Chile? that was a rehime of torture and disappeances. I think a lot ofinsights can be gained from looking at what happened there. That waz cbal work under kissinger and others.

             Barry Sherman kept strange company.
 For a member of the top 50 Richest Jews in the World, he didn't seem to mind losing money in this particular case: He bankrolled Frank D'Angelo in a brewery that never made any money, lost 100 million $ and kept on bankrolling D'Angelo when he decided to become a film producer of Mafia movies. As late as last year, Sherman was involved financially.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank D'Angelo's parents moved to Canada in 1956 from Sicily.Besides "losing money" on various expensive projects, he (and a crooked cop) have been involved in obstruction of justice in a trial for alleged sexual assault. His brewery was partly owned by three offshore Bahama companies that were part of a broker conspiracy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seems like Sherman scattered his "philanthropy" dollars in strange places (for someone who didn't want to give his benefactor's children their pledged estate).

             " In September 2017, an Ontario Superior Court justice ruled against the cousins.[10] At the time of the judgement, a lawyer for the cousins said they would appeal, though no appeal occurred, and Sherman died a few months later under unknown circumstances." Wikipedia
            </p>
            <p>
             Sherman did a fast one on his young cousins. Their parents died prematurely (she had terminal leukemia and died 17 days before  he died of  suspected aneurysm, leaving 4 children under the age of 7) and Sherman right out of grad school bought up his Uncle's business and leveraged into big bucks. He made some enemies. The fight between his cousins and him got dirty : "  legal fight turned ugly, with allegations flying that Mr. Sherman had plotted to kill Mr. Winter"

            This was on the news this morning.  I immediately had a sinking feeling.  Another one Bites The Dust.  How tall was this guy?  He looked big sized from his picture.  Another Chris Cornell hanging himself suicide.  Ring The Alarm.

              Fatal strangling typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and as the auxiliary lethal mechanism in hangings in the event the neck does not break.

               Do you mean using the same implement as the ligature?   Garrote to me usually means a thin ligature.   Or do you just mean strangled by ligature and then posed as hanging.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you mean the later, that is possible, if you mean the former, that would have two different imprints on the neck and would look suspicious.
              </p>
              <p>
               A thin ligature is used in garroting someone because you generate much pressure per inch by using something  thin, giving them less possibility to fight back.  These are old folks though.

               There was a scene in the The Wire, when someone was killed in prison by being choked with a belt.  After he was killed the belt was tied around a doorknob to make it look like a suicide.

             And just last week, that doctor in NY who called out the Clinton Foundation for stealing money meant for Haiti "committed suicide" by plunging a knife into his chest.

             Surely a doctor would know a more efficient way to kill himself.  It was clearly a hit.

              This doctor could've easily gotten some sort of drug to overdose on since he'd have access to it. There's no way a fucking knife into the chest is gonna be a doc's method of suicide.

               I wish I could say your premise is far out, MV. But sadly, I have no doubt they would murder people for curing disease. They'd better watch out, though, or the Japanese will beat them to it and put them out of business, anyway.

               The ny doctor self-stabbing "suicide" and the toronto billionaire couple "murder suicide" are related. Neither are suicides. Both happened same week &amp; are both connected to haiti charities. No way either was suicide, toronto already exposed as murders, ny will be next. What doctor, with access to medications for a painless death, would stab themself in the chest? Ridiculous.

               Since the two most recent ones are Haiti connected I'm guessing that's where they're feeling the heat, although I don't know of any pointed investigation there.  But it's long overdue of course.  HRC is so utterly vile but I actually think Bill is the mastermind behind the Arkancides.

                 Any idea of the date of that article?  I've been poking around regarding Haiti and Bill's '95 handover to the UN, and also the 2009 coup (Hellary).  So Haiti connections can go a lot deeper than earthquakes/hurricanes.

              I saw this too, and there is no way it sounds like a method a doctor would use to suicide.

                Yes, we are absolutely sure.  It was made up in 2017 by yournewswire.  The doctor went to Haiti as part of volunteer emergency medical team and found the need was overwhelming, the situation was chaotic and their needs including security weren't supported.
               </p>
               <p>
                He never mentioned the Clinton Foundation AT ALL in his letter which was appropriate because his trip to Haiti had nothing to do with the Clinton Foundation.
               </p>
               <p>
                We are sure this is not true because yournewswire is a fake news source and when we look at what they claim is their evidence (but they do not link to the evidence), it doesn't say what yournewswire claims it said.
               </p>
               <p>
                Fake News.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's a couple of reasons that make a suicide highly likely in this case.   He was home with his daughter at the time.  She didn't hear anyone enter the apartment.  The cops didn't find any forced entry.  It was a doorman apartment, so someone was in the lobby.
               </p>
               <p>
                The doctor also had a few bad things happen to him.  He was being sued by an NFL player for ruining his career through a botched surgery.   And then this, two days before his death, he learned he couldn't practice at his hospital which is number 1 in NY and number 8 in the whole country.

                  This an argument by incredulity.  And that is a logical fallacy.  You can add another dozen exclamations points and that still wouldn't change anything.

                 <p>
                  His daughter was in the apartment with him.  She did notice anyone enter the apartment and cops found no forced entry.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So the options are.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He killed himself.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  She killed him.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Some third party killed him.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For the last one to be true they would have needed to get into the apartment quietly, leave no traces of them coming or going, find a knife (Because a strange knife would be a giant clue someone else was there) and kill him without him screaming.  Since it was a doorman building, you probably can't enter from the lobby.   So it's an incredibly improbable and risky operation and you decide to undertake it when a potential witness is in the apartment.   And you also need to find someone with an actual motive to kill him and capable of going though all this rigamarole, not some bullshit he wrote a letter to CNN 7 years ago that everyone forgot about motive.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I think it's more likely that a guy who just suffered a crushing professional blow a few days earlier took his own life.  What about his daughter?  What about his heart?   Do you think someone who takes their own life is thinking rationally and thinking about others?  Do you think that someone who stabs himself to commit suicide (if it he hits the heart with 100% accuracy) is thinking rationally?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To me it seems the impulsive act of someone who hates himself.  I don't know if you ever saw real depression and mental illness up close, but I know someone with an anxiety disorder who when it hits, it's like they fell off a cliff.  Negative thoughts pile up on top of negative thoughts like Niagra Falls.  Psychologists call it catastrophizing.

                  I also have a good friend whose father impulsively killed himself with a handgun during a family argument.  I can assure you he was not thinking of kids who were there when he did it.

                   Firstly, although I don’t know this one’s actual layout I have visited many high end apartments in London where it is more than feasible that one person may not be aware of the entry, exit, location or movement of the other/s and for visitors to enter/exit without their knowledge.  Secondly, the one rationale you keep returning to in order to explain away the difficulty of entering or exiting the actual apartment building is that it is a “doorman” apartment block so “someone was in the lobby” which you automatically seem to assume this person as safe, trustworthy and security minded as opposed to potentially hostile, manipulated or deliberately placed to either enable or commit said crime which is, given what we know, not beyond the realms of possibility.  In this light it’s even not impossible that an assailant was already in the apartment beforehand (and perhaps the daughter in tow wasn’t planned) who knows? but you cannot just dismiss this as a murder using those arguments.  I agree that this kind of ‘suicide’ is extremely unusual and highly unlikely from one with so many easier and less traumatic methods available to him; mental state notwithstanding.  But you’ll argue for argument’s sake, because that’s your job.

                    The immediate facts prior to his death were
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    *He being sued for ruining a NFL players' career
*His hospital would no longer let him practice.

                   <p>
                    Two giant blows to his career happened right before his death.

                    Now let's look at what you say.

                    Yes, it's feasible, BUT then they also have to stab a man to death.  This could be quite noisy.   Even if he just saw someone in his house before he was stabbed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is a reach

                   <p>
                    A doorman apartment block is not a New York term. So I'm not sure you are familiar whatsoever with the layout we are talking about.  So yes there was someone in the lobby.  The main job of  NYC doorman is know who belongs in the building and who does not.

                   <p>
                    Here you go far, far, far beyond the realms of possiblity.

                   <p>
                    The doorman is going to be a known entity.  They are usually quite long-term in the building.  They are unionized.  I once worked a summer replacement in a doorman building.  You are now in the realms of fiction.  You are writing a screenplay.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    First off, there is no one with an obvious motive to kill this guy.  The only one I can think of is the NFL player, but it's more likely that the NFL player wanted him alive to pay off the lawsuit.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Then, if you want to kill the guy, your plan is to somehow manipulate the doorman so you can break into his apartment while family is home and stab in the chest?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Your third point is further fantasy

                    The NYPD consider suicide the most likely possibility and nothing you have said changes that.

                   <p>
                    As for your meticulously planned fantasy murder, we know of no one who has a motive to murder this man let alone do it in the way you describe.

                   I disagree completely. Yes I know all about the mental illness aspect you speak of and there is NO WAY a surgeon would commit suicide in that manner especially after having thought about it for four days as you say he suffered a professional blow. Why did he not get fentanyl and take the pills instead, quick death instead of painfully stabbing himself. He had access to all kinds of powerful quick death drugs. Even when suicidal one can still think rationally and ways to kill themselves that would be the best, quickest and least painful.

                 Weird way to commit suicide though, wouldn't you agree?  Are we sure it wasn't homicidal rooftop, rappelling ninja niggas?

              Someone did raise questions about that, I forget who, but I remember seeing mention of the daughter being the one to find him or something?
