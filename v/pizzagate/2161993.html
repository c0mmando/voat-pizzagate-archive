<blockquote>
<p>Eel Pie Island is an island in the River Thames at Twickenham in the Borough of Richmond upon Thames, London. It is situated on the Tideway and can be reached only by footbridge or boat. The island was known as a major jazz and blues venue in the 1960s. </p>
<p>The Eel Pie Studios or Oceanic Studios at The Boathouse on the mainland nearby, formerly owned by Pete Townshend, were the location of several significant pop and rock recordings. Townshend\'s publishing company, Eel Pie Publishing, is also named after the ait.</p>

<p>“Arthur really was the centre of it,” said Whitby. “He was not a massive music fan, but was fascinated by young people and their problems in a genuine way. A lot of people have told me that he changed their lives for the better.”
The pop-up museum contained a recreation of Arthur’s living room in nearby Strawberry Hill,  with his original desk. In June 1961, on the club’s fifth birthday, he was interviewed by the News of the World. “This place started as a jazz club.

<blockquote>
<p>Contacts were Arthur\'s stock-in-trade. In addition to mixing and matching the participants in the Club he made a point of getting to know people in authority who could help the young people who showed up at the Island. He persuaded as many as he could to visit the Island and meet some of those who used to hang around the \'membership desk\'. When the situation was right he would introduce the facilitating contact to the individual. He contacted me at the Home Office. So far as I know I was able to help at least one young man, who had left home and was in difficulties with an academic father; it transpired that he wrote well. He was interested in journalism so I was able to facilitate his obtaining a scholarship to Chicago. He is now a broadcaster. He may not wish the disclosure of his background, so he had better remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Arthur knew many members of Parliament and took a strong emotional interest in the Home Office Research Unit and the difficulties it sometimes had with politicians.  …..</p>
<p>It was expected that a Labour government would be elected. Arthur arranged for me to meet several MPs. Austin Albu I recall was one. But it was the meeting he arranged with Peter Shore which was to determine the outcome. I recall our discussion in a taxi near Downing Street.  ….</p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One of those on the list and later convicted was Charles Napier. Napier was jailed for 13 years in 2014 for hundreds of sex attacks on schoolboys. The file also contains a John Napier, who had been convicted for running a “child brothel” in London in the early 1970s. &gt;
            </p>
            <p>
             Metropolitan Police sources admitted the PIE list had been all but ignored until recent paedophile allegations surfaced. “The police had the lists from the late 1980s, at a time when it was not a crime to be a member of the PIE. The files sat in a drawer, metaphorically speaking, until 2012, when Operation Fairbank decided to go back and have a look.

             On the 19 July 2015, Australia's 60 Minutes broadcast an investigation of an alleged paedophile ring, into which abused children were supplied by one of PIE founders Peter Righton, who was also a
             <strong>
              former director of education in the National Institute for Social Work
             </strong>

              legal aide to the Thatcher government
             </strong>
             . The alleged network was said to include senior public figures such as Greville Janner and Cyril Smith alongside a former head of MI6 Sir Peter Telford Hayman.

The Despicable Case of Jimmy Savile 10
           </p>
           <p>
            The Despicable Case of Jimmy Savile
           </p>
           <p>
            The Savile case is noteworthy for the swathe of sexual abuse that its perpetrator cut. At least 450 separate victims are identified, the youngest aged 8, and one of them was a terminally ill male aged 11 or 12.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2012, a “former BBC colleague of Jimmy Savile accused him of being a necrophiliac whose usual sexual partners were “underaged subnormals.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In another newspaper article dated 2012, a former director stated that he interrupted Mr. Savile in the act of sex with a 16 year old girl in his dressing room. He reported the incident to BBC officials who did nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Everyone knew what was going on. That includes senior BBC people—chiefs at the highest levels.” Explaining, Mr. David Nicholson continued, “There were always girls in Jimmy’s dressing room. Everyone would have known about it—all the hair and makeup people, the wardrobe, show directors, producers.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Further in 2012, an ITV1 documentary, “Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile” was shown. BBC stated, “no evidence of allegations on its premises had been found.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in 2012, BBC suspended all Newsnight investigations after allegations that Conservative politician Lord McAlpine was a pedophile unraveled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in 2012, BBC  “described claims of a coverup around the sexual assault allegations about Savile, who died in October 2011, as malicious and unfounded.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Savile's depravity was detailed in a joint report by the Metropolitan Police and the charity NSPCC that chronicled 214 sex crimes between 1955 and 2009, when Mr. Savile was 82 years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Savile illustrates the British policy to identify pedophiles after they are dead. Living pedophiles, particularly establishment figures, are inexplicably given a pass.
           </p>
           <p>
            Exemplifying the challenges investigating establishment pedophile networks, some 114 government files out of a total of 527 detailing child sex crimes in the UK unexplainably vanished.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, British reporters who publish about the pedophile menace in British society keep turning up dead. Mrs. Liz MacKean worked for the BBC for more than 20 years, but she resigned in 2013 over BBC suppression of her work on Jimmy Savile.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mrs. MacKean died at age 52 in August 2017 from complications related to a stroke, immediately stoking conspiracy theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms. Jill Dando, a former host of the program Crimewatch, tried to warn her superiors at BBC about pedophile rings operating at the heights of the British government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms. Dando was gunned down on the doorsteps of her home in 1999 in a crime that remains unsolved. She exposed the existence of the pedophile rings in the mid-1990’s, passing a file to her management.
           </p>
           <p>
            BBC suppressed the information, and pedophiles continued operating with impunity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Establishment Pedophile Rings in the UK
           </p>
           <p>
            When a newspaper editor for The Bury Messenger in the UK received dossiers confirming that the highest ranking law enforcement official in the nation was aware of elite pedophile rings, investigators from Special Branch seized the materials, brandished a "D-Notice," and threatened the editor, Mr. Don Hale, with arrest if he pursued any investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The politician behind this act of suppression was Liberal Party Member of Parliament Cyril Smith. Despite some 140 accusations of child molestation against him, despite the discovery of "indecent images" in his personal vehicle, Mr. Smith was never prosecuted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even the British intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6, were implicated in the coverup. The longtime director of MI6, Mr. Peter Hayman, was apprehended with "explicit" materials and never charged. In his case, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher herself ordered "his depravity to be concealed from the public."
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Hayman was accused of pedophilia by a Member of Parliament when a Conservative MP, Mr. Geoffrey Dickens, named him using Parliamentary privilege on the floor of the House of Commons in 1981.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also accused was former Soviet spy Sir Anthony Blunt, an unnamed Sinn Fein politician, a Labour MP, and several Conservative politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Chief of the Home Office, Mr. Leon Brittan, himself accused of molesting young boys, was implicated in the coverup.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/OhLfotgl6A4">
             https://youtu.be/OhLfotgl6A4
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1983, Mr. Brittan received an explosive pedophile dossier directly from the hand of Tory Member of Parliament Geoffrey Dickens. The dossier vanished.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Brittan, Mr. Hayman, and other establishment pedophiles of the era were members of an organization known as the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE).
           </p>
           <p>
            Indeed, the Dickens dossier alleged that 16 Members of Parliament and Members of the House of Lords were members of PIE, along with 30 high profile figures from the Church of England, private schools and business.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the early 1970’s, PIE campaigned that the age of consent should be reduced to the age of four, if not abolished, and incest legalized. PIE also facilitated secure communications between members and personal meetings.
           </p>
           <p>
            An interview with a convicted pedophile PIE member, Mr. Tom O’Carroll, was included in the Australian 60 Minutes documentary, Spies, Lords and Predators. Produced by Stephen Rice, this documentary blew the coverup of elite pedophile predations apart.
           </p>
           <p>
            A videoclip of a prepubescent girl, aged approximately 8, shows her holding a vibrator.
           </p>
           <p>
            Asked “what constitutes consent,” meaning the consent of a child to participate in pedophile sex, Mr. O’Carroll replies, “the willing involvement of the child, it’s really quite simple.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Later in his unspeakable interview, he insists, “if they were traumatized they would not have gone along.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. O’Carroll continues, “PIE was an organization for people who had a sexual attraction to children, and we thought our illegal interest in children ought to be made legal, if it concerned relations with young people who were consenting to a relationship, or willingly involved.”

            Watching the beginning of Michael Jackson's video scream.  It had a message at beginning about how he did not support the occult.  Thought it seemed unnecessary before a music videos about zombies but now I'm wondering if he knew what he was talking about.
           </p>
           <p>
            In china they preempt civil genocide by calling everyone insects.  I'm wondering is all this zombie talk a psyop to get us viewing each other as less then fellow human?

            Pete Townsend.  Look into him.  He was just in the news and talked about on here.  He was charge years ago for CP but the charge was later found to be false.  Hmm.  He also admits to being Bi-Sexual and having gay relations.  Edit:  I have just started looking into Eel Pie Island and I smell the stench too.  It is a sense that I have just from doing research on other posts.  This stinks like 3 day old fish.

            Great post.  Looking forward to the next installment.
            <br/>
            How the average Brit isn't aware that their country is ran by pedos is beyond me.  It is even more obvious than it is in the US!  Seems like Her Majesty has a tight lock on the majority of British media.

             It is most likely that Jewish homosexuals are used as a kind of upper management tier, for the Knights Templar masons. In other words, a level of deviancy is expected, but some of these deviants go too far. Above that, you have the untouchable pedos, who are more of an international mega-crime network.
            </p>
            <p>
             If nobody "does anything," then why so many successful criminal prosecutions in the UK already? I mean, the judges and senior police could have shut the cases down, surely? But very often, they won't actually do that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, a lot of Brits are aware of the problem. The question is, what to DO about it. It's not like the Knights Templar etc. are a weak opponent. See the posts of HighLevelInsider. This is what we're up against. It's virtually the entire international technical and commercial system.

             I have posted another bit in the subverse pizzagatewhatever as it is a little 'out there'.  Posts about the occult are more difficult to explain how one arrives at certain conclusions.  I will have another more 'mainstream' post coming soon..in the meantime you can read my second post here:
