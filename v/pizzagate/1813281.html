<p>There is a consensus that sexual experience below a certain age is inappropriate and likely to be harmful. Certainly harmful, most people would probably say. There is not universal agreement, however, of just what age is too young. Children in some cultures can technically marry even before puberty, although the marriage may not be consummated for some time. In this country the age of consent is different from state to state.</p>

<li>Just as some people are more vulnerable to post-traumatic stress disorder than others who find themselves in the same traumatic situation, the effect of illicit sexual behavior—incest and/or sexual abuse—in childhood is different from one person to the next. I have seen two women (not counting the woman reported above)  who reported that they had had frank sexual intercourse with their older brothers until they had reached puberty, or even after, and were not troubled in any way as a result—in their opinion, anyway. They did not feel as if they had been exploited, and they were not angry at their brothers.  I have seen others in that situation who were, indeed, angry at their brothers and resentful.
Sexual behavior is likely to occur, especially in childhood, when a young person is being supervised by an older male. The older male does not have to be someone who is obviously disturbed or perverted. Some situations invite sexual acting out—for young men who might otherwise never think of committing such acts.</li>

<p>Parents don’t like to have sex in front of their children. I take that as a given. Maybe it was different in prehistoric times. Maybe back then when a committed couple (I assume there was no marriage ceremony in those days) wanted to have sex, they may have gone about  it out in the open in front of everybody instead of way back in a dark corner of the cave; but I don’t believe it. Not if their kids were hanging around. No matter how kinky sex may have been back in those gay, uninhibited times before organized religion grew up to stop that sort of thing, sex in front of the children was still considered outré and reprehensible. I am sure of it. Freud explained why; and his thoughts are too familiar to repeat here. Suffice it to say, if a child accidentally comes upon his parents having sex in the bedroom, or elsewhere, everyone squirms around and shudders. It is the natural way of things. At least in suburbia.</p>

            I think it depends on the age difference between the children. A friend of mine was raped by her older brother since she was 4 and he was 11. This went on for years. She became a drug addict and eventually attempted suicide. Finally she got the therapy she needed. She told her parents when she was an adult and now longer speaks to her brother. So no, abusers can be family members too. Even siblings, can abuse the more vulnerable younger child. Lena Dunham abused her baby sister. And she is being held up as an example for women.

            There are several trained psychologists involved in exposing this... from the inside. God forbid this truth would come out and everyone realize all that theory and training was built on many lies.

            Sigmeund Freud was a pedophile who experimented on his own children and many others. After which he proclaimed infants oral needs to take in nourishment was in some way attached to their sexual desires. Of course why would he not project that on young children when he &amp; his brilliant mind was sexually assaulting them.

            Dr. Jung changed the conversation slightly but was most known as a spy/agent who worked for Allen Dulles the namesake of the CIA.

            This was all under the roof of T.I.  and still is. Unbelievably true today.

            I am so disturbed that this pro-False Memory Syndrome piece was published in psychology today!?! I'm a therapist, and this is NOT what they taught is in school. This seems like a pro-pedo  disinformation piece meant to discredit woody Allen's daughter

             I was on the path to become a psychologist until I realized how full of shit the schools were. I met plenty of therapists who were terrible. So now I'm on a new path (call it alt-therapy if you must). Yeah I will never make nearly as much money as a psychologist, but I will have a clear mind and will not be supporting a broken system. Well worth it if you ask me.

              Kinsey is hailed as a hero for one, I know now that he was just pushing the moloch agenda in the USA, but for mainstream psychology he is a liberator ahead of his time hero, freud and his decendants should need no explanation but look it up, I bet they killed Lev Vygotsky
