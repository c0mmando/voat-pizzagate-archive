            I find it interesting that the definition of "incest" has changed. Western civilization's ideas about it have been Biblically defined. Obviously, after the Fall and before the Flood, a pair of children of Adam and Eve would have had to have married. There were dramatic changes in the ecosystem after the Flood, and the life span of people dramatically dropped. This change is noted in the Old Testament, and the Law given to Moses included God-approved and disapproved marriage relationships. Intermarriage within a nuclear family unit was forbidden (sibling/sibling, parent/child). This became known as incest. The Bible did not forbid marriage between first cousins. In fact, this was widely practiced amongst the European elite ruling class. It had the benefit of increasing family wealth and power. In Medieval times, marriage was more of a corporate merger, and females could only inherit property when they married. If first cousins of wealthy landowners married, the family name and land stayed in the family. This is how many clans initially formed. Albert Einstein's second wife was his first cousin, and this practice also helped the Rothschilds to build wealth and power, as well as some of America's Founding Fathers. In fact, later, laws were written to prevent these close marriages in order to break up these family monopolies. It was about money and power more than genetics.
           </p>
           <p>
            Legalizing the Biblical definition of incest (parent/child) (sibling/sibling) would leave the child vulnerable to any pedo proclivities a parent might have and add to pedo normalization. It has also been shown that these types of relationships have a much higher risk of producing a child with birth defects. JUST SAY NO!   Addendum: Whether you believe there was a flood or not, the early Christians did, and so the original laws regarding incest were influenced by this belief.

              "For a long time, the dangers of inbreeding or having children with a close relative weren't completely understood. The biggest problem with inbreeding is that when close relatives choose to mate, it results in homozygosity, which can increase their offspring's chances of being affected by deleterious recessive traits for all kinds of physical and cognitive disabilities, including ailments like hemophilia and cystic fibrosis as well as deformities like the Habsburg jaw. These incestual pairings also run a greater risk of...
Reduced fertility (both for the related parents and in their offspring)
Lower birth rate and higher infant mortality
Congenital birth defects (including facial asymmetry)
Certain kinds of cancer
Suppressed immune systems
Smaller adult size (pedigree collapse)"

            <p>
             You don't have to appeal to morals or religion to declare that inbreeding is not a good idea.

             If a brother and a sister both have had sterilization procedures I guess I wouldn't care if they married.   I say both to make it as close to 100% as possible.

              My comment regarding marriage between first cousins was to confirm the Biblical laws laid out in the Book of Leviticus, not necessarily the morals of those practicing this. Repopulation of the earth after the Flood would have been impossible without this practice (Shem, Ham, and Japheth). God did not condemn this, but  “And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.”  Genesis 9:1    Significantly, this command by God is restated AFTER the Fall and the Flood. First cousin marriage was their only option. Our genetics have continued to decline since the Flood, and in the present day it would be WISE to avoid such relationships, but God has not forbidden them. Some families have pushed the practice for greed and power, but eventually they go into decline or begin marrying outside the family. True incest has always been forbidden. If you reject what I am saying, then you must reject the Book of Genesis, and then you have NO moral ground to stand on for ANY kind of relationship. If we believe we are God's creation, then we must acknowledge His power to tell us how we are to relate to one another. Of course, we all have free will to reject the teachings of the Bible.....at your own peril!

            There is nothing great about incest, especially when it occurs for many generations. In colonial American sometimes cousins and more likely second cousins would marry, but it did not happen for any generations after the generation that involved itself in incest.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think the moral issues are as worrisome as the potential impact it could have as concerns diseases/disabilities. The only group that has been modestly successful and practiced incest on a large scale are Ashkenazi/Sephardic Jews and even then there have some been dysfunctional(psychologically speaking) and disease-wise effects of that.

              Pedo mod tries to get us to adopt anti Muslim nonsense, as if all religions are not superstition, as if Muslims are not used by the controllers to incite ignorant westerners to buy into the phony wars manufactured by the controllers agencies. You do not think-, or you do, but are paid to keep us asleep.

            Maybe that is why they are pushing abortion so hard - to remove the taboo against inbreeding which seems to be a hardwired revulsion. Remove all barriers, all distinctions, all inhibitions = leftist Utopia.

            There have been a ton of stories on the media on the last year or two about "genetic sexual attraction", which is basically incest but the relatives didn't actually meet until they were adults. Like somehow that makes it more ok to commit incest!
