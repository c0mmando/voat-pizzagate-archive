<p>Beginning in the 1940s Ernest Mittler (a New York Defense Attorney) investigated domestic baby-selling rings extending across North America and Canada (search “georgia mann”). A vocal advocate for domestic adoption reform,  he first discovered AHEPA’s international ring in the 1950’s. In 1959 Stephen S. Scopas, a magistrate who had been appointed by Mayor Robert F. Wagner (and Supreme President of AHEPA) , was indicted on charges of selling 30 Greek children to New York couples. In a scandal that captured front-page headlines, Mr. Scopas was charged with accepting payment for placing the children and for doing so without authorization. Though forced to resign, Mr. Scopas was acquitted. A judge ruled that because the adoptions had been legal in Greece -- as it was believed at the time -- Mr. Scopas could not be convicted in New York. Because adoption laws were considered a “states-rights” issue, they differed widely. This lack of standardization continues to facilitate inter-state and international adoption rings. Thus, AHEPA was able to operate with relative impunity well into the 1970’s (and, I believe, to this day). </p>

<p>OUSTED JUDGE CALLED BY D.A. Still insisting that he is innocent of any wrongdoing, former City Magistrate Stephen S. Scopas was due to show up today in Manhattan District Attorney Frank S. Hogan\'s office to answer questions about his role in the adoption of Greek orphans and their immigration to this country. Scopas was ordered to undergo the questioning following a report submitted to Mayor Wagner last Friday by Commissioner of Investigation Louis I. Kaplan. On the basis of the report, Wagner asked Scopas to resign as magistrate on Saturday. Several hours after first refusing to do so, Scopas telegraphed his resignation to the mayor.</p>

<p>THE CINCINNATI ENQUIRER FRIDAY, AUGUST 22, 1941 Ahepans Consider Establishment Of Counterpart Of Boys\' Town</p>
<p>An Ahepa Convention Committee is considering a plan to establish a Greek counterpart of Father Flanagan\'s famous Boys Town in Nebraska. Still In the preliminary stage, the plan calls for assistance In obtaining the land a a 15,000-acre tract and construction of dormitories, a school, church, and hospital &quot;somewhere In the United States&quot; which would be known as the Ahepa Home
Ahepa leaders said the government probably would be approached. The home would be launched on a small scale, possibly large enough to house 100 each of orphan, made available to Greek war orphans and refugees, primarily, and to orphans and poor aged persons of Greek descent, secondarily. Father of the plan is William Hells, Greek Consul at New Orleans, and wealthy oil operator. Hells, it is understood, stands ready to contribute $100,000 toward a proposed $.&quot;100,000 fund for establishment of the project for boys, orphan girls, old men, and old women. From there, the project would be permitted to grow in proportion to its ability to sustain itself. Leaders said that once the war had stopped and the project no longer was required for Greek use alone, it probably would be turned over to the government for Americans generally. It was also expected that government officials would be invited to sit on the board Immediately. The plan calls for conducting the project In a manner similar to the town of boys originated by the Catholic priest. After upon The plan calls for creation of a Greece {illegible} after the war.</p>
<p>AHEPA succeeded 3 years later and founded their orphanage in NY “St Basil’s Academy”
<a href="http://www.stbasil.goarch.org/about_us/">http://www.stbasil.goarch.org/about_us/</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Athenagoras, of Blessed Memory, founded Saint Basil Academy in 1944 with the valuable assistance of the Greek Orthodox Ladies Philoptochos Society. On March 15, 1944, the Philoptochos purchased the 400-acre Jacob Ruppert estate in Garrison New York, on the shores of the Hudson River, overlooking West Point Academy for only $55,000. It was an era when many large estates were put on the market because of the ever-increasing property taxes. In 1976, a parcel of land encompassing 250 acres (primarily marshland) was sold to the Audobon Society. The Archbishop dreamed of establishing an orphanage or children\'s home ever since his arrival in the United States in 1931. The Philoptochos purchased the Ruppert estate with the proceeds of two years of the Vasilopita celebrations. The Academy, as envisioned by the late Patriarch Athenagoras, has expanded in scope to be a well equipped Residential Child Care Center, with modern dormitories, a gymnasium/auditorium, indoor swimming pool, beautiful chapel, library and all the necessary comforts of a loving home. The Academy was named for Saint Basil, who was the founder of many orphanages, hospitals, and homes for the elderly in fourth century Caesarea, Asia Minor. He is considered one of the greatest philanthropists of the Church and founder of the modern-day hospital concept.</p>',

            Relevant thread regarding blood drinking:

             Incoming dark joke (you’ll grow to appreciate them around these parts for good reason)
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Since these people are vampires, when do we get out our whips, holy water and throwing crosses so we can start hunting them? Maybe whip a wall or two and find a pot roast if I’m lucky.

             I guess fear and lack of confidence in the theory. However recent research and finding of OSS/CIA/MASONIC/CATHOLIC connections pushed me over the edge. I've seen posts about the Greek Orphan scandal previously deleted, so I wanted to have something well researched to contribute. Only this week did I make the OSS &amp; Anemia connection (mainly prompted by Jan Irvin's Logos Media podcast on Adenochrome &amp; Vampires)
            </p>

             I've previously posted and crossposted on CDAN. I did a loooot of research on "the Church".

             I have been researching for 2 years now, and have been afraid to post due to op-sec reasons. But it's eaten at me wayyyy too much, I finally have taken reasonable safety precautions, so it's time to let go of this awful weight.

              I watched parts of that podcast on LogosMedia about vampires and werewolves but  was slightly dismayed at their angle and approach. The subject deserves a much closer look. This is what I commented on that particular episode:
             </p>
             <p>
              Interesting subject, one that I wrote about during Pizzagate on Voat. An interesting direction that you could go with this is with the French DeVere family were there is an obvious etymological connection who are connected to the Merovingian Kings,Grail legends and Jesus.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are also tenuous connections between reality and fiction in The Underground series of vampire movies and real life considering the above and Hungary's King from 1458 to 1490 Mathias Corvinus, considering Vlad the Impaler was not far from this province. The DeVere familial line also occurs during this time period. Politicians from the Queen of England to Hillary Clinton and the Bush's have claimed descendency from Vlad and life extension technologies have become the 'new' way of condensing a horrific and gory practice that has been occurring for thousands of years.﻿
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I'm not sure anyone realizes the very real alchemical PSYCHOLOGICAL process that is subsumed in ALL film and television of turning MEN INTO BEASTS.  I cannot express this point enough...
             </p>
             <p>
              "ESSENTIALLY, WHEN 'PERFORMING ARTISTS' LIKE ABRAMOVIC, GAGA, MADONNA, DEBBIE HARRY OR HEAVY BREATHING INCULCATE YOU INTO THEIR BRAND OF "ART" WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS AN ALCHEMICAL PROCESS OF TRANSFORMING MEN INTO BEASTS."

               May I ask what about their angle dismayed you? Too narrow of a focus on certain groups?
              </p>
              <p>
               I've found it very helpful to look at older medical studies. In researching Thalassemias, its obvious that it has to do with Inbreeding. Different mutations seemingly pop up in completely different areas.
              </p>
              <p>
               The oldest records both literary and archeological indicate it first came out of the Mediterranean. Yet there is this insistence on forcing and "Out of Africa" theory.
              </p>
              <p>
               In a theological/philosophical sense, I believe the trauma of sexual violence and inbreeding manifests in trauma on a genetic/cellular level. In a Biblical sense, it could refer to generational curses "the third and fourth generation of those who hate me"

              I commend you for your Courage to post this information.  Many of us wonder when we post what it may set off.  We sometimes yes, we get lots of down voats from shills etc.  But post away we do anyway.  I really believe we are the  True Journalists that have long left us.  We search out the evidence and gather it  and post it.  Thank you.

             CLAN OF WORMS PART 6: AHEPA &amp; ANEMIA
            </p>
            <p>
             Stephen Scopas (previously accused baby dealer) served as the National Chairman of the AHEPA COOLEY’S ANEMIA FOUNDATION.

             What is Cooley’s Anemia? It’s a genetic mutation that causes red blood cell irregularity. As a result, the blood is less capable of holding oxygen and iron.

            <pre><code>“Thalassemia, also known as MEDITERRANIAN ANEMIA, is an ANCIENT group of diseases that have existed for over 7,000 years. The name thalassemia comes from the ANCIENT GREEK word for sea, thalassa, as the ancients believed it was an "illness that came from the sea". In 1925, pediatrician Thomas Benton Cooley published a work on thalassemia. This was the first description of the disorder, and for a long time it became known as Cooley's anemia.
Traditionally, beta thalassemia major is particularly prevalent in a belt stretching from West Africa through the Mediterranean, the Arabian Peninsula and the Black Sea to India, South China and South-East Asia. However, due to global mobility in modern times, sufferers are now found nearly everywhere. Throughout the world, it is estimated that 4.6 million children and adolescents are affected by thalassemia and every day hundreds of babies are born with this inherited disorder. A high number of CARRIERS of the thalassemia genetic trait are found in countries where MARRIAGE BETWEEN RELATIVES was, and still is, common practice and in third-world or emerging countries. Little or no schooling, social or religious stigmatization, and a lack of useful information and education all help to spread this genetic disorder. In many cultures, sick children, particularly girls, are often hidden away, abandoned or killed.”

             Countries like ITALY, GREECE, and Cyprus have the highest frequency of thalassaemia cases in the world, 10 percent of the Mediterranean population are carriers of this gene. There exists a thalassaemic "belt" that includes the Mediterranean passing through West and Central Asian countries like Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan onto Pakistan &amp; India and passes on to the South East Asian countries like Indonesia, Burma &amp; Thailand. Cooley and B. Lee (American physician) described the disease in children of Italian immigrants in the USA.

            <pre><code>“Children's Hospital Oakland, a world recognized center for treatment and research of thalassemia, has formed an international network treating patients throughout the world. Thalassemia is the WORLD’S MOST COMMON GENETIC BLOOD DISORDER and it is RAPIDLY INCREASING. SEVEN PERCENT of the world's population are CARRIERS, and 400,000 affected babies are born each year. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts a DOUBLING of these STATISTICS within the next few decades. Once rare in California, it has become the most frequent disorder detected in the state newborn screening program of over 700,000 annual births. Thalassemia is usually FATAL IN INFANCY unless ONGOING TRANSFUSIONS are initiated.”

             In 1972, the chapter joined hands with the Connecticut Campaign Against Cooley’s Anemia, and with Ahepan Congressman Robert Giaimo in introducing the Cooley’s Anemia Research Bill Act before the U.S. Congress, resulting in the National Funding for Cooley’s Anemia Research.

Cooley’s Anemia, also known as “Thalassemia”, is a rare but fatal genetic blood disorder. It mostly affects people of Mediterranean descent. In its most severe form it requires bone marrow transplants but usually those who are diagnosed experience symptoms of fatigue, weakness, paleness, and slow growth. Many are unaware they are carriers of the genetic disease until either their child suffers from it or a DNA test result is acquired. In it’s major form, Thalassemia “Cooley’s Anemia” is fatal and requires bone transplant surgery. In 1990, after the son of one of our chapter members was in need of this surgery, it quickly became obvious that an even greater need existed, thus the AHEPA Bone Marrow Donor Registry was incorporated. Today, there have been incredible breakthroughs in gene editing that may allow for children to live Thalassemia-free! Since 1947, AHEPA has supported the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the AHEPA Hospital wing. It has helped over 10 million patients and continues to serve the community of Thessaloniki today.

             All in all, I suspect that much of the PizzaGate, Ritual Sacrifice, Bloodletting, Vampire/Werewolf Lore, Blood-letting and other blood-based cult activity has some biological, eugenic imperative. Religious orders have long been obsessed with Blood-Lines which led to inbreeding. Inbreeding led to genetic diseases in wealthy families. These same organizations founded hospitals and have been doing inter-country medical research and population-wide genetic testing.

            St. Basil’s Academy flouts NY adoption/orphanage laws.

            GARRISON, NY — In a letter dated January 2, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) formerly notified St. Basil Academy Executive Director Fr. Constantine Sitaras that the institution had been denied an operating certificate. While the property continues to be owned by National Philoptochos, the archdiocese has long administered the academy as one of its ministries. In recent years, St. Basil has transformed itself from being a boarding school to providing residential care for an estimated 24 children. In denying the application for an operating license, the State of New York cited a number of reasons for its decision, including “a history of unlicensed operation” beginning in 1997. Once St. Basil ceased operation of its educational program, it was no longer exempt from compliance with New York’s Interstate Compact in the Placement of Children (ICPC). Nevertheless, according to the State of NY’s document denying certification, St. Basil continued to accept placement of children from outside New York state without first going through ICPC. The question concerning financial responsibility for the support of those children has resulted. Because St. Basil no longer operates as a boarding school for instruction in elementary subjects, “it has no authority to provide residential care for children outside the context of a boarding school.” According to the State of New York, “St. Basil has not taken steps to ensure that children in their care receive an appropriate education in accordance with the requirements of education law.” While in recent years the children of St. Basil would receive their education in the Highland Falls school district, that school has now refused to accept the children due to the institution’s alleged failure to pay more than $236,000 in tuition costs owed to the district. In September 2003, St. Basil then sought to enroll the children in the Garrison school district without payment of $46,000 in tuition costs to date, which the district said it is owed. As a result, the State of New York alleges in its denial for certification “St. Basil failed to meet its financial obligations, which calls into question the willingness of the agency to make the financial resources available to properly operate the program.” While St. Basil has 60 days within which to challenge the state’s denial of certification, the NY Division of Development and Prevention Services has directed the institution to “cease and desist any further operation for the residential care of children by January 31.”

            ST. BASIL ACADEMY TO CLOSE DAVID NOVICH THE JOURNAL NEWS (January 6, 2004)
“St. Basil officials have said the children have no parents to care for them and have made the academy and the school district their home. But Garrison officials disagree and have said the children go home for the summer, make telephone calls to their parents and are covered by their medical insurance. Garrison Schools Superintendent Ellen Bergman had mixed feelings about the denial of the license. She said St. Basil students have done well at the school but have been a heavy expense for the district.
Last month, school officials had to borrow $410,000 to cover the costs of the St. Basil students. In 1997, the academy stopped educating its children because of a lack of funds and started sending them to the neighboring Highland Falls-Fort Montgomery schools in Orange County and paying tuition. In addition, the academy was chartered as a boarding school, not as a residential-care facility.”

            Pro Bono Effort Thwarts State Attempt to Decertify Orphanage:
The latest development in a long-running legal battle between a Hudson Valley orphanage and a public school district that has resisted accepting some two dozen orphans into its classrooms involves the claim by a state agency that the institution is “HARBORING” an ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. On Nov. 3, an administrative law judge in Albany shot down the claim – advanced by the New York State Office of Children and Family Services – as arbitrary and capricious. The state licensing agency had attempted to withhold operating certification for the orphanage, Saint Basil Academy in Garrison, which has been operated since 1944 by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese. At issue was the presence of a 14-year-old resident – “K.T.” as she is known in documents submitted to Administrative Law Judge William B. Day – who was ABANDONED in New York City four years ago by her MOTHER, a Greek national. According to legal papers, K.T. WAS BROUGHT TO NY AT AGE 10 AS A POSSIBLE ORGAN DONER for her 20-year-old brother, who later died at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. DISTRAUGHT AT HER SONS DEATH, THE MOTHER LEFT “KT” TO THE CHURCH AND RETURNED TO GREECE. “St. Basil is not ‘harboring’ K.T. as an illegal alien, as her presence in this country and her whereabouts have been made known to appropriate federal officials at all relevant times,” the decision said. “No action has been taken by those federal authorities or any other law enforcement entity against St. Basil in connection with their continued efforts to keep K.T. in their facility while seeking to resolve the child’s immigration status.” Lawyers for the Office of Children and Family Services did not appear at the Nov. 3 hearing, nor did they file documents challenging the position of K.T.’s attorney – James M. Stillwaggon, of counsel at White &amp; Case and chairman of its pro bono committee. Previous attempts by counsel for the Garrison school district to intervene on behalf of the state agency’s earlier attempts to decertify Saint Basil, in 2004 and 2005, were rejected on grounds of improper standing. Attorneys for both sides declined to comment on why the state agency has been so insistent in attempting to decertify the orphanage.

            Organ transplantation has been commonplace over the last decade but Greece still remains the lowest numerically among European countries in this field because of the lack of organ donation although it is highest in traffic accidents. Despite this, the legal framework regulating transplantation was enacted late in comparison to other European countries, and was not the only obstacle to the development of organ donation. Several other factors such as philosophy, culture, traditional and religious attitudes, lack of public information and lack of the relevant social fabric, have all contributed to the current sad situation. This article aims to present a critical view on the evolution of the legal framework in the field of tissue and organ transplantation in Greece. Issues that still deter organ donation are discussed along with an insight into the current situation in the Greek social context in order to make a constructive contribution to future perspectives.

            New legislation in Greece towards presumed consent for organ donation, effective as of June 2013, has come at a critical moment. This pilot study aims to explore awareness, specific concerns and intentions about the new organ donation framework among patients attending Greek general practices in a rural and urban setting. Only 2.6% of respondents had a donor card, a mere 9.6% was aware of new legislation, whereas only 3.8% considered that the public had been adequately informed. Higher income respondents were more likely to be aware that they would be considered organ donors upon death, unless declared differently. Urban practice respondents were less likely to have previously discussed with a significant other their intentions in regards to presumed consent. One quarter of all respondents (22.4%) intended to carry out their right to prohibit organ removal upon death. Survey results reveal that organ donation reform has yet to be disseminated by the Greek society, underscoring the urgency for targeted information campaigns.
