             Pastor Paula White-Cain delivers invocation at Inauguration Day 2017
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of the word of faith- prosperity preachers like Paula White teach a false doctrine of name it and claim it, that we get rich by giving money to them and calling forth for prosperity; and that we are all “little gods” on the same level as the Father in Heaven. She says, “Your words create your world…. If God can create something out of nothing, and we are created in his image, then if we can imagine it, then, so it can be for us.”[16] New Age Movement word of faith- prosperity preachers “angel experts” like Paula White also instruct their followers to love their ANGELS and call upon them for health, healing, guidance, and
            <strong>
             PROSPERITY
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Paula White (Paula Michelle Furr– German) of Tupelo, MS reads like a manual on CIA MK ULTRA/MONARCH. In Tupelo, her father and mother ran a toy and craft store- most likely to draw children. Paula’s sexual ritual abuse began at 6 (six) years old, a prime impressionate MK ULTRA/MONARCH year of age to split off complete multiple personalities from the original.[23]
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometime after the Satanic number 13 (thirteen) years old, she became a self daughter of an unnamed and undisclosed “two star” admiral naval officer. Paula and her military family transferred to one of America’s most notoriously known still classified and top secret Nazi Project CHATTER/ MK ULTRA facilities, Bethesda Naval Hospital.[24] The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center and colloquially referred to as the Bethesda Naval Hospital or Navy Med, is a military medical center located in the community of Bethesda, Maryland.[25]
           </p>
           <p>
            Paula’s husband, Randy Alan White, was born January 11, 1958, during the Cold War in Frederick, Maryland.[26] I believe that he is also related to MK ULTRA/MONARCH, but through another extremely notorious government ultra classified and top secret east coast biological, genetic, ethnic- chemical warfare and mind control institution, Fort Detrick.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paula’s church, New Destiny Christian [Pentecostal] Center, was founded by a charismatic figure like HollyWeird’s Will Smith, the late “Fresh Prince of Be lair.” Zachery Tims was a felonious con-man, drug addict and trafficker out of Baltimore, MD. According to one of Tims’ former mentors, Rev. Douglas Chukwuemeka, Randy White had been his pastor.[32]   Tims’ church blossomed into a charismatic mega-evangelistic Pentecostal church, News Destiny, whose membership grew into the thousands. The church secured a twenty-one acre property debt free, and built a $3.4 million- 34,000 square foot building on the site. The bottom line was Tims, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, was all along a Satanic drug addicted (cocaine- heroin) philanderer. He was caught carrying on a highly publicized year long affair on the other side of midnight with a Parisian Exotic Dancer and Stripper, Judy Nguyen. Tims’ wife of 15 years divorced him. Before taking over New Destiny, Paula and Randy had built another charismatic Pentecostal predominately black congregation, Without Walls International Church, in Lakeland, FL into personal empires of greed, wealth and corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prosperity is an old gospel preached by religious charlatans who make merchandise of false promises and heretic religious doctrine. They are destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain (1 Timothy 6.5). Peter called them false prophets with “hearts trained in greed” (2 Peter 2.14). He warned that “in their greed they will exploit you with false words.” He exposed them as scoundrels and dismissed them as “stains and blemishes” on the church (v.13). For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6.10), wicked, foolish and weak people that are lured and preoccupied in pursuit of wealth and money are far too willing now to sell their souls to Lucifer, engage in blood rituals and ever murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            On August 14, 2011, the “Fresh Prince” Rev. Zachery Tims was found dead on the floor of his hotel room at the W Hotel New York Times Square. The NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner’s release says Tims died of “acute intoxication by the combined effects of cocaine and heroin. Manner of death: Accident. “[33]
           </p>
           <p>
            Naturally, in order to determine whether Tims’ death a homicide, accident or suicide, a police investigation would have discovered what he was doing in NY. Police would have reviewed his telephone log and cell phone records. They would have reviewed his guest list and, or review the surveillance video tapes of his room, and inquiry into his drug source. However. Now, almost 6 (six) years later, the reason for Tims being in New York is still covered-up and unknown. The source of the Tims’ toxic cocktail of cocaine and heroin is still covered-up. The people that Tims met or connected with at the hotel also remains covered-up. In other words, as far as the NY police are concerned- Tims traveled all the way from Florida just to drop dead on the floor of a hotel room on Thursday, August 12, 2011 or Friday the 13th, Times Square- New York.[34]
           </p>
           <p>
            W Hotel New York Times Square is not far, just blocks away, from Paula White’s Trump Tower NY condo. Paula and Randy White walked away from Without Walls International Church in August 2011, within days of Tims’ death in NY. By December 29, 2011, Paula White had taken over Tims’ mega-church and congregation.[35]

             very interesting . . . but as I read it,  and I realize the purpose is to point out Christian, conservative, Republican hypocrisy and in reaction to my original post about the accusations against this pastor:  There is plenty of hypocrisy on the Dem side as well,  so many "tolerant" Democrats choose to live on the "down low" and in the closet.  I have my suspicions about quite a few of them.

             Can anyone offer any discourse as to why it seems that child abuse, and from what we are finding out the horrific extent of, seems to proliferate in a segment of the population that consists of white, repressed anglo saxon religious extremists that prefer to 'have their cake and eat it too', ie, 'maintaining' the religious fronted, bearded vanilla family life and then duplicitously indulging in depravities in a secret life?

            I have attended Calvary Chapel in SoCal for sixteen years. I never noticed anything out of the ordinary. This article makes me sick to my stomach. I live in a rural area and the congregation is small. Wtf.

            You know, there is something seriously off about the Calvary chapel chain. Years ago I had to meet with the pastor of a local one here for business, and it truly had a cultist vibe. I'm very open minded and very tolerant of most folks and I've been part of some weird religions myself, but this guy was off big time. His teenage daughter walked into the room and he made a creepy off color remark about her being his mistress or something. Totally not what I expected from a so called pastor.

              I attended this Calvary Chapel back in the 90s with Coy as the "pastor".  He was like a rock star. It was cult like.  One of the youth pastors was arrested for molesting a child at his home - actually showering with the kid.  You are right about the kids going off to a separate area.

               Good to hear a first hand account. I've also read they draft tithe directly out of your account. Is that true? There is no way in hell I'd allow my child to be alone with someone if it was mandatory. That's really suspect.

            Apparently Coral Springs Police Department,  in Florida, sat on this complaint filed in 2015.  I am not clear on how this is coming to light at this time. I am wondering if maybe a whistle blower is revealing this information now.

             Hmm.  This says it all to me:  The sexual assault claims, which have never before been divulged, raise new questions about the pastor, his church, and the police who handled the case. Documents show that Coral Springs cops sat on the accusations for months before dropping the inquiry without even interviewing Coy. His attorneys, meanwhile, persuaded a judge with deep Republican ties to seal the ex-pastor's divorce file to protect Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale from scrutiny.  A COVER UP.

             Or they sat on it and now there are more coming forward and they cannot plug the dam?  Idk, sounds fishy to me.  Not that it is not true but the not reporting.

              Not only that. I was into politics way before my other new hobbies. Conspiracy theorist Allen West, without a link or explanation, followed by Charlie Christ denied, threw up some alert sirens for me in the writing department. This guy who wrote this needs to be examined closely with a microscope because in my experience Allen West is a real person and a true American patriot in every sense of the word, even if he took the opportunity to speak to a large audience. Charlie Christ is a gay man with a beard wife who is a Conservative republican/democrat with a history of destroying Florida for profit. One can not put those two in two paragraphs without more explanation, much less call Mr. West a conspiracy theorist without a source, and then explaining it to the reader. Not saying that the article is not chock full of needed sources that deserve multiple threads, but  anyone who is familiar with Florida knows who owns the East Coast. I think this guy is guilty, and being thrown under the bus. They would love for him to end up in Chipley or  Raiford Prison. He could die while on stopover while staying for the night at OJC. In the old days they would have sent him to Copeland at the Judges discretion. He knows too much, and is an easy target for death.
