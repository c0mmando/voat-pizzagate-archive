<p>I went dumpster diving for the case <a href="https://voat.co/s/he">s/he</a> mentioned, but instead found one that was SO OUTRAGEOUS! Why isn\'t she in jail? She was reprimanded by the Court of Appeals for knowingly filing an appeal when the prosecutor on the case willfully falsified testimony by adding two lines as a &quot;JOKE&quot;!!!! Yes, that was the excuse given!!! The it was a joke between attorneys!!!! Hardy-har-har-har!!!! </p>
<p>The case was against a pedophile who molested a child! He would have been convicted without the prosecutorial misconduct. But because of this &quot;JOKE&quot;, THE INDICTMENT WAS THROWN OUT!!! Yes, the pedo walked free!!! And Ms. Willie Brown\'s Bitch Harris was slammed by the Court of Appeals for the THIRD TIME!!!! </p>
<p>My question is number one: are the people of California that stupid as to elect this bitch as senator? We know they are because 62% voted her in even after engaging in this kind of conduct!!!! This brings me to question number 2: Was this done on purpose? Was this defendant someone that they were protecting? The signs are right that this was exactly what was done because the excuse that the prosecutor did it as a joke IS A JOKE!!!! </p>

<p>When will they ever learn? Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski declared months ago in a much-quoted opinion that there is “an epidemic of Brady violations abroad in the land.” And yet, prosecutors continue to deny there’s a problem. Indeed, the Department of Justice gets outright indignant at the suggestion, and so do many state court prosecutors. They bristle at the very mention of the possibility.</p>
<p>But here’s another doozy: The People (of California) v. Efrain Velasco-Palacios. In this unpublished opinion from the Fifth Appellate District, the California Court of Appeal reveals that state prosecutors and California Attorney General Kamala Harris continue to be part of the problem. Kern County prosecutor Robert Murray committed “outrageous government misconduct.” Ms. Harris and her staff defended the indefensible—California State prosecutor Murray flat out falsified a transcript of a defendant’s confession.</p>
<p>Kern County prosecutor Robert Murray added two lines of transcript to “evidence” that the defendant confessed to an even more egregious offense than that with which he had been charged—the already hideous offense of molesting a child. With the two sentences that state’s attorney Murray perjuriously added, Murray was able to threaten charges that carried a term of life in prison.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When confronted with the defense’s motion to dismiss the indictment for outrageous prosecutorial misconduct, Mr. Murray claimed his own false alteration of the transcript was “in jest,” a “joke” between two lawyers, and harmless to the defendant. Mr. Murray lobbed in another little bombshell for good measure, swearing that defense counsel had said that the defendant’s defense was “not viable.” </p>
<p>... </p>
<p>California Judge H.A. Staley got it right. He found that Mr. Murray’s fabrication of “evidence”—falsifying the transcript of a confession during discovery and plea negotiations—was “egregious, outrageous, and . . . shocked the conscience.”</p>
<p>The trial judge saw no laughing matter—and neither should the rest of us. He dismissed the indictment completely, and in a scathing opinion, also quoted by the appellate court, wrote that the prosecutor’s actions “diluted the protections accompanying the right to counsel and ran the risk of fraudulently inducing defendant to enter a plea and forfeit his right to a jury trial.” The court refused to “tolerate such outrageous conduct that results in the depravation of basic fundamental constitutional rights that are designed to provide basic fairness.”</p>
<p>Undaunted by the criminal conduct of a state prosecutor, or the district court’s opinion, Ms. Harris appealed the decision dismissing the indictment. According to the California attorney general, only abject physical brutality would warrant a finding of prosecutorial misconduct and the dismissal of an indictment. Fortunately for all of us—and the Constitution—she lost again.</p>
<p>This is Ms. Harris’ third strike in hardly as many months—and those are only the ones that have come to our attention.</p>

<h1>PEOPLE v. VELASCO PALACIOS</h1>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Defendant Efrain Velasco–Palacios was charged with lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under the age of 14 (Pen.Code, § 288, subd. (a)).  Prior to trial, the lower court found the prosecution inserted a false confession into a transcript of defendant\'s police interrogation and granted defendant\'s motion to dismiss on the basis of outrageous government misconduct.</p>
<p>On appeal, the People assert the trial court erred by dismissing the case against defendant, as defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\'s misconduct.   We find defendant\'s constitutional right to counsel was prejudiced by the prosecutor\'s misconduct and affirm the lower court\'s order of dismissal.</p>
<p>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>
<p>On July 9, 2013, defendant was charged with five counts of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child after the daughter of defendant\'s girlfriend reported several instances of molestation.</p>

             When you control the press, you control pretty much everything. It's why we ha ve to start now. Run different memes and try different tactics to see where she's vulnerable. Like on Voat. I can tell what's important by the amount of pushback. So our indie journalists need to try different angles. It's why I'm pretty excited about this other thing I dug up. It exposes a vulnerable area where there's pay dirt. I'll have to read it again to make sure, but that's what I got out of it the first time around. Fingers crossed if it said what I think it said the second time.

S.F. CRIME LAB SCANDAL
           </p>
           <p>
            San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris' office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a police drug lab technician and was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings, a judge declared Thursday.

            Yesterday, the California Attorney General, Kamala Harris, raided the home of David Daleiden, the undercover journalist who started the Center for Medical Progress and exposed Planned Parenthood for their practices of selling the body parts of aborted babies.
           </p>
           <p>
            AG Harris is also running for Senate to replace pro-abortion Senator Barbara Boxer. To no one’s surprise, Ms. Harris is supported by Planned Parenthood. But she is now using her official office to go after David, Planned Parenthood’s nemesis.

            EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT
           </p>
           <p>
            "Murray placed a fabricated admission of guilt into an English translation of Velasco-Palacios’ Spanish-language interrogation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Specifically, the prosecutor wrote the following into the transcript:
           </p>
           <p>
            “[Officer]: You’re so guilty you child molester.
           </p>
           <p>
            “[Suspect]: I know. I’m just glad she’s not pregnant like her mother.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Murray has said the change was a joke, but he did not admit to falsifying the transcript until nine days after delivering it to Deputy Public Defender Ernest Hinman, Velasco-Palacios’ attorney, and only after Hinman requested the CD of the interview be reviewed by the prosecution’s interpreter."

              Never, and it taints the entire confession, investigation, and prosecution. The court was right to dismiss the indictment, but the people involved must be held accountable. When the court uses the phrase "shocks the conscience," that's as bad as it gets.

              "He found that Mr. Murray’s fabrication of “evidence”—falsifying the transcript of a confession during discovery and plea negotiations—was “egregious, outrageous, and . . . shocked the conscience.”

            The story starts with a questionable severance payment made to Barankin. Issues regarding the legality of his role as communications director for Harris’ Senate campaign are raised – and left unanswered by Harris. As for where the story ends, well – it’s not over yet.
