 which I have never seen before in the context of this undertaking. (source Alefantis/transformer gallery, washington life mag, and some other stuff)</p>
<p>Not proof of anything but certainly interesting. The results are cherrypicked for sure but I didn\'t have to be creative with it. About 1 in 3 artist featured stuff like this with heavy focus on child abuse, pedophilia and sexualization of children.</p>
<p>Art by Petrina Hicks, featuring the big bad wolf / red riding hood motif, loss of innocence, seduction, early flower, sexualized image with butterfly.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/YZpcbL">Gallery1</a></p>
<p>Art by Louise Bourgois, well this is quite something, the same artist that did the Dahmer thingy. Hidden rooms/Hidden thoughts propably about repressed memories - likely child abuse, the rooms are cages. Deformed  and systematically dismembered bodies, drawing of bloody cutting tools. Note the picture of the \'big\' white house. Hovering above it a guillotine as the sword of damokles, interesting. </p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/lSXwhp">Gallery2</a></p>
<p>Art by Nils Karsten, almost exclusively featuring art of sexualized children/infants (yes, sexualized infants)  intermixed with symbols of american power and culture. On most pictures the subjects are missing limbs. I find it rather disgusting tbh. Also note the Iggy pop lyrics.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/pd9etq">Gallery3</a></p>
<p>Art by Anna Gaskell, propably the most overt depiction of sexual violence on children. No explanation necessary. Also for some reason a bloody half of a head. Podesta knows her irl of course. </p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/uAIw3G">Gallery4</a></p>
<p>Art by Julie Roberts. Her art features slightly unsettling pictures of children without supervision. There was another I couldn\'t find with a boy alone in a tub, washing himself. The theme here is neglect, even depicting a child in what appears to be a coffin. The girl in the water is a bit out of place but i found 2 or 3 other pictures of (dead?) children drifting in or under water from artists Podesta enjoys.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/vcHOcS">Gallery5</a></p>
<p>Art by Berlinde de Bruyckere. hard to interpret, decapitated, butchered sexualized bodies, That sorta thing. Fun for the whole family. (If my hollywood forensic skills are on point I would say they standing lady died of drowning)</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/iB1Fuu">Gallery 6</a></p>
<p>Art by Boo Ritson, you\'re gonna love that. This artist paints food and this wouldn\'t be Pizzagate otherwise. Here are his Pizza and Hot Dog paintings. (I wonder how he came to enjoy this artist. Colourful fun paintigs, this strikes me as rather out of place now that I am familiar with his taste in art...)</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/hytrYr">Gallery 7</a></p>
<p>Here we have a cooperation of aforementioned pizza artist with one Tracy Neuls, now suddenly rather violent. Then a photograph of a series by Sam Taylor Wood, featuring what appears to be teenagers, suspended in the air by colourful balloons.</p>
<p>And last but not least Gillian Wearing, not sexual or violent but still interesting. Her work which is mostly video art show her wearing masks she made based on the faces of other people. Rather unsettling. This could depict sociopathy or dissociative trauma.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/Yio5eh">Gallery8</a></p>
<p>Short thoughts on all this; At first I had assumed that people were cherrypicking a few weird artworks to fit the narrative but now, besides art he buys for investment reasons and whatever is for his wife or to appear super progressive, I\'m not so sure he even collects anything different at all.
Other, mostly trendy art he collects, show empty buildings and building facades, scarcely people and usually standing with the back to the camera.</p>
<p>Ok hope you enjoyed my post.</p>
<p>*short disclaimer; collecting this kind of art doesn\'t make you a criminal, most of this work propably came from a place of compassion (although at times hard to identify where exactly) But the point of the post is that some people would appreciate this art from a rather different place within them.</p>',

            Missing limbs is a Project Monarch thing. the dolls are either slowly dismembered and force to deal with the trauma, or convinced that their limbs were cut off to induce desired emotions in ones intended to stay intact.

            To be clear, are these works owned by Podesta, or just artists that he owns a piece by them?

             He held exhibitions featuring these artists. According to different sources he owns one of the biggest contemporary art collections in the the country. I cannot tell which he owns, but these artists hardly do anything else but this type of work.

              I don't know about that.  Louise Bourgeois for example does a whole range of all sorts of different things.

                He owns that?  Like that's easily one of Rosskam's most famous and acclaimed works.

                 Yes I'm familiar with it, I found it referred to as part of the Heather and Tony Podesta Collection. Not sure if this is still the case.Thought it would hang in a famous museum.

               I've found a source on an work by Julie Roberts he owns. Not a child, but a dismembered body. You know this whole research went like that..this is just his taste. Doesn't have to mean anything but I mean come on. What are the chances that every third or fourth artist I look into works on those themes? It's not like all artists go through their dismembered child sex period.

               Well she is rather old. But in her case we do know that he is the owner of a least one decapitated golden body. / I have also seen one of the cages at a podesta party. Also that weird pelvis penis sculpture is on a table in their house.
