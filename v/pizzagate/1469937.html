<p>Q. In regards to the Clinton Foundation, what would happen if all of this information ended up being released to the general public? As in, what would happen if all the Clinton Foundation secret records were released publically?</p>
<p>A:  I said that in the last thread, total chaos. The government would be exposed at every layer, who pays who, who buys what, and no one has yet asked about all the human trafficking bits I have been laying out.</p>
<p>Q:  Is there any evidence of the Clinton machine having 20-40 people murdered? I can\'t find the picture.</p>
<p>A:  Plenty. Dig deep.</p>
<p>Q:  You\'ve said two things so far: human trafficking and looking into the Clinton Foundation... Is that a hint to the starting point of our own research?</p>
<p>A:  Everything I have said is a hint.</p>
<p>Q:  Do members of Congress own strip clubs and when they visit, have their own sex slaves?</p>
<p>A:  Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Q:  &quot;I said in the last thread, total chaos. The government would be exposed at every layer, who pays who, who buys what, and no one has yet asked about the human trafficking bits I have been laying out.&quot; Okay. Do tell. What about the human trafficking? I assume that those who can be indicted are involved.</p>
<p>A:  Pedophiles are sex traffickers everywhere. Many polticians trade girls like cattle.</p>
<p>Q:  Oh I wanted to ask you if Bill Clinton is a pedophile that blows babies. You know anything about that?</p>
<p>A:  Bill Clinton is a confirmed pedophile.</p>
<p>Q:  Please, before you sleep, speak a little on the child prostitution ring.</p>
<p>A:  Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primary in British parliament and Saudia Arabia, and that\'s why Hillary and Bill love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.</p>
<p>Q:  Who has more CP, the FBI or CIA? Is CP a big deal in the highest level of officials in world governments?</p>
<p>A:  CIA is huge.</p>
<p>Q: can we, anons, using only publicly available material, get enough evidence to indict Hillary?</p>
<p>A: No, and I ahve stated this from the beginning. The goal was to make noise and evoke enough doubt about HRC to get the MSM talking. In case you did not notice, they are openly discussing memes and internet subculture in the mainstream. The ironic thing is, they backed off this last week because they realized as they kept talking about it, people kept coming.</p>
<p>Q: What country was the Clinton Foundation operating from when they accepted donations?</p>
<p>A: Ireland</p>
<p>Q: Current odds of Trump winning in your opinion?</p>
<p>A: 95% probable Trump victory</p>
<p>Q: Was Hillary involved in Scalia\'s death at least? Does the Clinton kill list theory have merit?</p>
<p>A: Not sure about Scalia, the Clinton Kill List is very, very legit. Some are natural causes, but the ones that seem too outrageous, actually are. I forget his name, but the one who claimed to be investigating the Octopus who ended up in a duffel bag locked from the inside, he was investigating the Clintons.</p>
<p>Q: To this end, I\'d reiterate the second part of my question: Is there anything that we, and by extension; the american people can do to prevent this investigation from Stalling?</p>
<p>A: Keep making noise and bringing people on the board.</p>
<p>Q: You have always told us to focus on the Clinton Foundation, and not to focus too much on the email scandal. I did some research on the Clinton Foundation\'s tax returns, and found a lot of issues, especially with the amended tax returns. It seems to me that the Clinton\'s pocketed a lot of the Haiti money in 2010.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons using it as a personal bank account, is there anything you can tell us that we might have overlooked?</p>
<p>Maybe something you have said before, but we have forgotten or been too tunneled vision to see. Basically, not being able to see the woods through the trees.</p>
<p>I know the Clinton Foundation started as a project to build Bill\'s Presidential Library, but then the Clinton Foundation expanded into something way different. Also, I believe you getting people to focus on the Clinton Foundation and people bringing it into the public light is why the Clinton Global Initiative shut down.</p>
<p>A: The CF always operates in countries where birth records are difficult to maintain. Let that sink in for a moment.</p>
<p>Q: Thisarino, which entity should we look for? Our new contact bros are being vague.</p>
<p>A: Haiti was a disaster for a number of reasons, but as regards to the CF, a number of people went missing in Haiti shortly after the CGI set up shop. Maybe someone can find out why.</p>
<p>Q: What is the actual chance of Obama being in real trouble over his implication in all this? Didn\'t you say he cares about his &quot;legacy&quot; or something?</p>
<p>A: Obama would be impeached if the truth were out. Unfortunately, the entire government would collapse, and Americans would revolt tomorrow, assuming most people believe the truth. Once you know what the real deal is, it is ahrd to have faith in people anymore.</p>
<p>Q: What Is The Biggest Smoking Gun, ThaT Isn\'t Getting Enough ATTENTION?</p>
<p>A: The latest FBI doc dumps. The redactions aren\'t hard to figure out if you\'re putting 2+2 together</p>
<p>Q: What is Obamas exact background? Does the rumors saying he has been connected to intelligence agencies for a long time have any merit? What about Cooper being CIA and Blitzer Mossad</p>
<p>A: Obama is an atheist liberal with Muslim sympathies. He was born in the US, but spent a good portion of his childhood overseas. He also has Chicago mob connections through his father.Cooper and Blitzer are both former CIA</p>
<p>Q: What are some reliable news sources that don\'t propagandize?</p>
<p>A: The financial appers are usually better reads because they are written for businesspeople, and usually big money decisions require solid info. Stay away from politically oriented sources though. I like to read Investor\'s Business Daily, the Wall Street Journal, Drudge Report, Mish\'s Global Economic Trends, Al-Monitor, Government Executive, The Hill, and Asia Times. Those are just a few of the sites I read though. I use Feedly to aggregate all my news.</p>
<p>Q: Are you unable to talk about the Bahamas?</p>
<p>A: My mistake, I wrote Haiti in oen of my earlier responses but meant the Bahamas. Anywhere the CF is peddling their HIV/AIDS solutions, inevitably missing people and questionable organizations with enormous cash flows appear.</p>
<p>Q: Is there any truth to any of the Moloch stuff or is it disinfo?</p>
<p>A: Disinfo</p>',

            FYI the "moloch stuff" - I don't really know what they are talking about here. Keep in mind this was all way before the Podesta emails, Alefantis etc. He also said in the AMA that the 4chan has often worked things out before the FBI have known.
