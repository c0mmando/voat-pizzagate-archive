            This isn't hard to believe, look at Epstein. He had a sweet deal in the Florida jail, I read somewhere he only served weekends over 13 months.

            It's funny that people think we actually lock up sexual offenders in the US.
We release offenders on probation so that they can re offend. 
Don't be silly.

            I'm not sure if people are unaware of how we treat pedos here in the states, but let me give you a little insight.
           </p>
           <p>
            My father works for a company called MSOTC. 
That is Missouri Sexual Offender Treatment Center. 
This is a facility for offenders who have been sent to prison, released and continued to commit heinous crimes against children. Over the years I have seen this place suck the life out of my father. He's told me things, just little fun facts about offenders that I wish I've never known. We treat them the same way. They are "patients". They have access to tv. They get Playstations. They get basically anything they want in the name of any foul treatment being a "hate crime".

             It is the same in the U.K.  When training as a forensic psychologist I spent time in purpose built clinics that had to be referred to as 'Therapeutic Communities' (TC's) and I was shocked at 'perks' and home comforts afforded them as well as the amount of freedoms they had to come and go - often outside of the grounds for the day.  The premise of the treatment protocol was that to qualify for acceptance into the scheme (often as an alternative to prison) they had to commit to a number of group and one to one therapies whereby their behaviours and attitudes were subject to the scrutiny of their peers and that this would help them to better 'self govern'. TC is voluntary and usually preceded terms just prior to release from sentence.  The psychiatric hospital in London  to which I was attached was also one of three agencies responsible at that time for the update and maintenance of the UK Sex Offender Register.  I remember asking a renowned Forensic Psychiatrist just how prolific paedophilia was in UK society back then and was floored when he answered that numerically (although the spread is not uniform) there exists one paedophile for every four doors of every street in every town within the UK.  This was in 1997. God only knows what the stats are now.

              Honestly. we have to consider a few details here. 1) Psychiatry is a hoax field with firm roots in the German-Jewish left-wing political movements in Weimar etc. What makes you trust the guy's judgement? The 'professionals' who want to normalise this crime would obviously over-state its prevalence in the general population, would they not? In a crafty attempt to 'mainstream' it?!
2) Are we falling victim to American-style paranoia here, where being attracted to a 19 year old girl is 'nearly' paedophilia etc? 3) Are we ignoring the clear links to freemasonry, while implying that every other guy out there is paedo?
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's keep perspective. All we know is that it's 1) more common that most would like to believe, 2) elites and very powerful organisations are working together to normalise and eventually legalise it..,so they have a vested interest in overexaggerating its frequency in the general population, while hiding and diminishing their own role.
             </p>
             <p>
              Beyond that, no. I'm sorry but I'm not prepared for strangers to imply that myself, my father, brother-in-law etc. are 'potential paedophiles.' It's rubbish and it's not a constructive avenue to go down at all..

             Disgusting to hear and we need to investigate every single Obama appointed judge who are giving lenient sentences to these Pedo  freaks.  The way the political blackmail seems to work, I'm sure many of them do not have clean hands

            Demmick (notorious pedophilebeing described in the beginning of this post) was the Ministry of Truth at The Hague...the war crimes tribunal. He was part of the Dutrox affair and was connected to the Royal family through Princess Beatrice.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is an open organization in the Netherlands that promotes sex between children &amp; adults. Some of the most horriffic stories of trafficking and child slavery occurred here where pedophiles live openly.
           </p>
           <p>
            As recounted by that brace Dutch banker regarding child sacrifice this is a very dark place.

             im quit sure that's not possible as far as i know, i think he meant a man from a other country that is married to a girl and this marriage is accepted by law.
(My interpretation because its not really clear and few sentences get mixed up that moment he talks about it. also i think he meant something like this because im quit sure its not allowed by law.)

Before the year 1795 Holland had no king. There was no Dutch Kingdom.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Netherlands were a Republic.
              </p>
              <p>
               How can a country go from being a Republic to become a monarchy?
              </p>
              <p>
               The answer is that the first king appointed himself in the 1800's.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Dutch 'Royal' Family were not Kings, they were 'stadtholders' which is like being a steward or custodian, that is all.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Dutch 'Royal' family seized the throne like virtually all of the phony current royal families of Europe did (e.g. Swedish= Bernadotte a French General)
              </p>
              <p>
               They took power from the people.
              </p>

               When will we rid ourselves of Them
