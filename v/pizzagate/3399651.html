            His cellmate was mafia and connected to the Vatican in many ways.

            Colours as in white or black nobility and the grey Pope. I have realised that its all a game the god/bad was created for us by us. The black team or in reality black magic vs the white team white magic. Duality... the both camps are owned and controlled by the Catholic church. To build right/left wrong/right and to build satan/god. They are the controllers of thought and you are their sheeps. They control both sides of the thought of good and evil.....and they have perfected it as an art.

             Cell mate (who was on death row) got a quick judgement. He was the one wheeled out. That's why he didn't hear anything.  Epstein was the "pulled cell mate."  JUST SPECULATION.

             In other words....WE KNOW NOTHING.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tartaglione looked like THE HULK. Perfect "cell mate" LOL!   Always something fishy.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the story is Comey's daughter arranged for THE HULK to share a cell and take out Epstein? But failed? Were ALL the cameras not functioning for BOTH incidents?  What are the odds?  Epstein and Maxwell are hiding out in CHINA.....just speculation.

             They intentionally did this to further deny justice to the victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barr's federal prosecutors refused to reopen the Florida case, although the plea deal was ruled to be illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barr is deeply compromised. He was AG under Bush, and covered up his crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             He worked for the law firm that represented Epstein during the Florida trial.
            </p>
            <p>
             He still refused to recuse himself from the case. He needs to go.
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI only raided Epstein's island after he 'died', and to my knowledge, they still haven't raided his Zorro ranch in NM.

               lol bro they already have your township by the balls for 30 years stuck to the federal titty, wrapped in microphones and probed with cctv so that algorithms can monitor and profile your pupil's response to the sight of a 5g tower, you are literally under attack on every spectrum that man can imagine

             "Epstein also was supposed to have a ROOMMATE after a July 23 incident in which he was found on the floor of his cell with marks on his neck. Authorities suspected he had attempted suicide; Epstein said he believed he had been attacked.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was placed on suicide watch for about a week after that - meaning he was monitored 24-7. He was placed back in the jail's special housing unit late in the month, and, for a time, had a NEW ROOMMATE."  (emph. mine)
            </p>
            <p>
             But that person was TRANSFERRED away the DAY BEFORE Epstein's death and a new roommate was NOT ASSIGNED - despite the fact that at least eight jail officials knew Epstein was not to be left alone in a cell." (WHY NOT?)

             Actually, a NEVER VERIFIED post said this about the cell mate during Jeffrey's FIRST "suicide" attempt. Always fishy.

            I heard reports that it’s common for those on suicide watch to have a cell mate as to prevent the act. Who knows, I feel like of all the questions of this case this isn’t in the top of my list. Really would like to know why he was in orange when those are for those ON suicide watch, as well as some of the NY Post fuckery with the photos.

             This is blatantly false. Inmates in danger of self harm are put under constant observation by guards, not felons. Although these days I'll admit it's hard to tell which is which.

            <p>
             REALLY? Why would a cell mate try to prevent it? Might even try to harm him.  Also, cameras everywhere should be enough prevention. According to reports, Epstein was NOT on suicide watch at time of his "death". This is the perfect cover for getting him OUT. Most researchers noticed the "body's" ears did not match Epstein's. This story is not over.....
