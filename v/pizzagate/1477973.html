&quot;California ranks number one in both pedophilia and ritualistic sexual abuse. In a study of 57 ritual abuse cases done by “Margaret Smith,” herself an abuse survivor, 37% of the cases occurred in California. She also found that 97% percent of perpetrators fell into four large occupational categories; 35% were professionals, either doctors or lawyers, 25% were teachers, 22% priests and ministers, and 15% were police officers.

            Laskar joined 2 days ago and is a "distracting shill," posting undocumented and unrelated crap. He is just making this crap up like we will jump on it. He sometimes likes to become "loony conspiracy" shill or "jew hating" shill, depending on the thread. Leave shill.

              i have really only heard about this recently. they did an effective job, of hiding this story, from my australian point of view. the likelihood that jeff gannon is him, is pretty extreme. and it is something, that could have been disproven, if it were false. the implications of that story, are so far reaching. They obviously, can not disprove it, so instead of even answering the questions really, they call them preposterous . It really would be a breakthrough, if we could do away with that  premise. If every claim, could be followed up, they would not be able to hide these activities. They would have been finished long ago, and we'd be living in a world of harmony and happiness. We are supposed to be equal under the law, and as such, any person, accused of a crime, needs to answer it. Were this actually the case, we would be seeing these people answering questions now, and proving if they are innocent, or  not. We would certainly not have them mounting press campaigns, and using the services that are supposed to be the people's, against people.

            jeff is a fan of the military. bonacci, the survivor who spoke out, said it was common for victims to get put in the military just a few years, and then get a cushy job, somewhere they can be of further use, for these modern day slave masters. this article shows them going to all lengths to gloss it over. similar to what we are seeing now

            his mother knows, but has to understand, that his life must be endanger. that lady is a joan of arc figure, who deserves recognition for helping the overall truth coming out. they have had to watch, while nothing was done, devoid of confidence that their case would get solved. knowing it would get buried probably. it will be heartwarming to see that finally change. there must be a lot of victims who cant speak up, for quite rational fear. were there a real hope of something being done, they would come through in high numbers. while any children are being abused, the world suffers. it is up to all of us to speak up. there is only one percent of people, who are evil.  like the impurity in gold, it is there to galvanise our real strength of will.  it will be a golden era, when children are safe, everywhere, and the truth is plain to see.

            I'm not sure California ranks number one in pedo-crimes. 
 Maybe they're going by reported stats only.
            <br/>
            Farm communities have  HIGH rates of pedo-crimes and incest types of things, but family members often don't come forward to report as stats.   I know this for a fact after receiving training to work on a  prairie location sexual-abuse hotline.

             California most likely has a larger population than all other states, what Florida &amp;/or New York might have more?
            </p>
            <p>
             Farm communities have far less people, maybe there are higher incidents of abuse, as a percent of the population, in farm communities as opposed to most places but still.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another common place for such abuse happens to be military bases, or military personnel and their family members living near them. Sometimes dad will get caught, sometimes brother will get caught, if it's brother he's liable to be offered a career while sister receives a psychiatric diagnosis, is drugged into oblivion and shoved in a corner, while everything about the crime is swept under a rug, no charges ever filed, no record kept. Which I've personally known to have happened in fairly recent history. Which of course I was threatened life and limb should I ever get very specific on those details, and those making the threats weren't joking, playing, or incapable of hiding more bodies.......

              Yes, these groups may seem small stats  in compared to large population,  but it encapsulates a social group wherein it's silent acceptability and cover-up is well known within  the  'help'   groups.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remember living in Killeen, Texas, and the surprise on finding out  about the   amount of rape etc  in the military bases  that never hits the media.
              <br/>
              I thought about this again when researching the  Project Flicker  military  investigation that was shut down.

             johnny Gosch still can't come forward. See my link above. I can hardly blame him, too much. He can't be very confident in justice. they are trying to make it, so victims are afraid to come forward and people are afraid to  say anything. They can never succeed, and will probabl just drive people more, in their determination, but it is interesting that they are trying to. I will be paying close atttention to every agency that comes out in defence of Alefantis and  othrs like victims, for just concerns and questions about them. I bet there have been no threats at all, but he says there is hundreds, and a stream of threats. I think people would rather know the truth, than threaten him.

             I agree, but if it is not reported it cannot be a "stat" can it? We've got to start working with what we have, but continue 'til we get it all exposed.
