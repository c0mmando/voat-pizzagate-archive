<p>&quot;So where are the children James Alefantis deals with likely kept/housed?</p>
<p>It\'s highly likely they are kept in neighbouring homes around New Hope Academy along Varnum Street, Hyattsville. Open this link and scroll down to see the number of residents listed in each of the single residential family homes that make up Varnum Street. Some of the homes are listed as having one bathroom ie. 7111 Varnum Street and happen to service 25 residents. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St</a></p>
<p>Children are also most likely kept in homes neighbouring 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 which is listed as the residential address of one Joseph T Scheve, Business Manager of the New Hope Educational Institute Inc and Nellie Hubbard (wife/divorced).</p>
<p>Note how 40 residents are listed at neighbouring property, 7308 Finns Lane. Next door, 28 residents and so on…Again, these are single family residences. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln7292">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln7292</a> Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln#expanded_map">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln#expanded_map</a></p>
<p>Behind Scheve/Hubbard’s address and at 7309 Riverdale Rd Lanham MD 20706, is a complex listed on Google as a Baptist Church which has a large carpark area and plenty of bush secluding it – interesting in that it’s very similar in environ to the academy location/setup in Hyattsville. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7309-Riverdale-Rd#expanded_map">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7309-Riverdale-Rd#expanded_map</a></p>
<p>Connection to Pegasus Museum and James Alefantis. The ‘Estate of Joseph T Scheve’ and ‘Nellie T Hubbard’ are both listed as parties on publicly available court documents involved in the transfer of the property known as ‘Pegasus Museum’, at 3518 11 St NW Washington DC, to James Alefantis.</p>
<p>Castellum Alefantis LLC (James Alefantis) borrowed to purchase the property at 3518 11St, NW Washington DC (otherwise now known as ‘Pegasus Museum’) from the Estate of Joseph T Scheve. Nellie T Hubbard is listed as Trustee of the Estate. Death <a href="http://analysed.com">http://analysed.com</a> shows a Joseph T Scheve was born on July 08, 1944 and died November 05, 2008, approximately 64.4 years of age.&quot;</p>
<p>This got me thinking about foster homes and how there should be a database which led me to <a href="https://childwelfare.gov">https://childwelfare.gov</a></p>
<p>There is definitely more potential from leads here but I focused on the Connecticut Ave one that I found. I\'m not sure if this place has been discussed but it is called Holy Cross Child Placement Agency, and as you can see is very close.</p>
