            I happened upon the show and watched the whole thing. It was a foster kid in their care for 3 months not a step kid. She was removed when CPS got complaints about him from other girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            The man was totally fucked up...wife was not that much better. Supposedly, she didn't know his secret until after the girl was taken out. They have 6 kids between them...several of which were girls. Now they have several granddaughters and the woman says he is no threat.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know how she managed to avoid "knowing" but she should have slit his throat when she "found out"...when CPS came to get the girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            So he's a piece of shit, she's a nutcase..BUT...the girl was lying one way or another.
           </p>
           <p>
            She said that he molested her 4 or 5 times....that he raped her 4 or 5 times...that she wasn't sure it was him that did it...that she never said because she forgot for a few months...that she didn't want to make a big deal of it...that she remembered before and forgot again....
           </p>
           <p>
            No doubt, she was abused at some point but her flip flopping avoidance and story changes doesn't help her cause...or anyone's.

            I agree and it is unfortunate because it devalues the whole story if his accuser is lying.

             Just under 3 minutes in and I'm already all HELL NAH about the wife. She is pointing out "cute" kids on the street to him?!?! This isn't a case of her pointing out a pair of shoes in the mall or a dog in the park. This is like when my husband and I oggle chicks on the street or tram or wherever. She is pretty much pointing out
             <em>
              girls
             </em>
             that he would find fuckable. Even if she doesn't find them attractive (like how I don't find some females hot, but I know my man does) she knows he's a chomo.

            Two phrases that show this fucker has normalised his disorder;
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I knew that it was wrong, but frankly
             <strong>
              in the fifties, every male I knew was sexually attracted to children and little girls
             </strong>
             . Is that true or not, I don't know, but I've talked to hundreds of other people who had the same experience. It seemed very normal to me.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had never called myself a pedophile, but for more than 50 years I have been sexually attracted to little girls. I choose not to act on it. It was pretty
             <strong>
              easy for me to pretend to be like a regular normal adult male
             </strong>
             , and I got married and for 25 years my first marriage went along pretty normally.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So every normal male was a pedo in the 50's, but later he had to pretend to be a normal male.  The twisted child abuser is lying right there.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is normal - paedophiles hide themselves and pretend because they know what they do is wrong.  Yet most of them do not seek help (psychological or otherwise) and this is the standard by which they should be judged.  And to be judged harshly I might add.
           </p>

             Right on the money! Also, I've read a couple of articles written by non-offending pedophiles, and the writers emphasized that they try to stay away from children so they're not tempted to offend. Instead of removing himself from temptation, this guy chose to bring foster children into his home, one of whom just happened to be a girl within the age window he's attracted to. That's incredibly irresponsible, at best. I'd like to hear from this guy's children to find out their version of why they don't bring the grandkids around.

              So it's called precipitation theory, and I'm undecided if it would help or hurt more... I guess if I'm real horny (for an adult) porn does help, but I would think maybe ADULT PORN. Would be a better idea because otherwise you're saying it's okay, as well as feeding the urge.

               He admitted that he sometimes watches child pornography, and that's a crime in and of itself. He said he doesn't "beat [himself up over it" because he "can tell the difference between fantasy and reality." Unless he's watching cartoons or something (and he didn't specifically say that cartoons were what he watched), any child porn is reality for the child involved; even if the viewer isn't personally committing the abuse, he's still perpetuating and enabling it.

             I haven't watched the full episode yet, but I have seen other Dr Phil episodes with sex abuse cases. Dr Phil plays the "nice ole country boy" role to get them to talk on stage, potentially divulge info, and get them into treatment. I don't think this is a way to normalize it at all.
