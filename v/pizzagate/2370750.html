<p><strong>Beyond Magic: Unclean Spirits; David Copperfield, Mulholland, Blaine, Geller; Mk-Ultra, Laurel Canyon, Carribean and Hellfire Club</strong></p>
<p>For days I have been brooding over a comment <a href="https://voat.co/user/exposethecriminals">exposethecriminals</a> left on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2358509">David Copperfields / New Allegations / Ties to Jeffrey Epstein / FBI Corruption</a> which stated that <strong>David Copperfield</strong> created the <strong>“Mulholland Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts\'\'</strong> which was about half of the collection of famed turn of the 20th century magician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mulholland_(magician)">John Mulholland</a>, <strong><em>and that Mulholland had Mk-Ultra connections</em></strong>. Well, that lead me on quite a path of discovery, weaving in and out of conspiracies decades old and connecting dots here and there where no other connection existed, corroborating many other previously known conspiracy theories,  <em>THAT ARE ALL OMINOUSLY CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER.</em></p>
<p>From here with David Copperfield, we will explore the strange relationship between magicians and the CIA, in particular THREE of the most prominent &quot;illusionists&quot; and &quot;seers&quot; of the day, David, David Blaine and Uri Geller, I will take you to the 50\'s with Sidney Gottlieb, George White, John Mulholland and his efforts against &quot;communism&quot;, to Ken Kesey\'s Acid tests and the spector hiding in the hippie revolution, to the Mk-Ultra shock treatment of Ewan Cameron and Dr. Green (Mengele) and finally back to where THIS whole episode started...  the Maccoby\'s and thus <strong>James Alefantis of Comet Ping Pong and Pizza.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;It\'s no illusion: <strong>Lacey L. Carrol</strong>l, who had accused magician <strong>David Copperfield</strong> of raping her in 2007, has been arrested in connection with another case where she alleged rape.&quot;, states an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/david-copperfields-rape-investigation-vanishes/story?id=9675140">ABC news </a>report from 2007.  what also was no illusion was that federal investigators took hard drives and computers, video cameras and over $2 Million in unaccounted for cash in their dawn raid of Copperfield\'s Las Vegas warehouse where it was also learned that he stores the collection of magician John Mulholland. Before we examine Mr. Mulholland let us take a look at a previous Crazy Days and Nights Blind that seems to corroborate this incident precisely:</p>
<p>FRIDAY, DECEMBER 08, 2017</p>
<p><strong>Four For Friday - Forget Me Not</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/four-for-friday-he-made-me.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/four-for-friday-he-made-me.html</a></p>
<p>About a decade ago, life came crashing down hard on this, at the time permanent A list celebrity. After what happened he has laid low for much of the decade which endangers that permanent A list status.</p>
<p>At the time, our permanent A lister was traveling all over the world. He was making a lot of money, but not enough to support his lifestyle. He wanted more. He also had a huge sexual appetite, but like most people in this spot, it was not anything anyone would consider normal.</p>
<p>It turns out, one of his best friends at the time was this now convicted child rapist/molester with the powerful friends. Much like his best friend, our A lister also owned an island and knew he could have something similar.</p>
<p>While the friend focused his attention on the US and Europe, our A lister focused his attention on Asia. While the friend focused on connections, our A lister focused on making money. A lot of money. On his trips to Asia, he met with some people who specialized in tourists wanting children or young teens. Our A lister arranged for a group of 20 of these teens to get visas to &quot;study&quot; in the country where his island is still located. The government of that country makes a lot of money from the A lister and also had many of their own government ministers at his home on the island.</p>
<p>The teen and tween girls were set up in a dormitory adjacent to the main house. Then, our A lister made bookings with Asian companies for his services. The thing is though, his services for years were one price and then beginning that year about a decade ago, his fees quadrupled. The difference was what men paid to visit his island. For close to 18 months or so, our A lister was making millions of dollars a month. Just a ton of money he was making so men could rape these tweens and teens. Every two or three nights, the boat carrying 10-15 of these men would pull up to the dock and then be replaced three nights later with another group of men.</p>
<p>At some point, our A lister got cocky. He started filming the tweens and teens and sending out little clips and photos of them across the internet to make the dollars flow even faster. He also met a woman who he thought would be into that kind of thing and invited her to come to the island so they could explore together. She came and then almost crashed his whole world.</p>
<p>She went to the feds. The next thing you know, our A lister has all his cash seized and they find evidence of the porn and money laundering and he knows he is going to jail for a very very long time. To make matters worse for him, all of the men who had paid in advance to visit the island complained to the companies they paid money to. Those companies were also mad because the agreement they had in place to supply teens for money was now canceled.</p>
<p>Our A lister was looking at decades in jail. Then, the most fortunate set of circumstances came to be. Some new people came to power and they decided to look the other way. They made everything just go away. They even managed to make the woman who turned on the A lister look like a loon. In return, this group of people got names and contacts and also all those clips. It is amazing what power can do. The A lister probably won\'t ever get his old luster back, but it beats spending all that time in jail.</p>

<p>This blind is also an indication as to my suspicions of what Mr. Copperfield does to occupy his time when he is not &quot;entertaining&quot; on stage. He seems to have some pretty prominent friends that turned him on to a little business venture, and with little doubt I understand that this friend of his is no other than our number one name to fame for sex trafficking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Our A lister was looking at decades in jail. Then, the most fortunate set of circumstances came to be. Some new people came to power and they decided to look the other way.

Carroll</strong> was taken care of quite expediently when what, the Obama administration came in and saw an advantage they could work with? Interesting.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the only incident of rape reported on <strong>Mr. Copperfield</strong>: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2008/01/whatever-happened-to-david-copperfield.html">Whatever Happened To David Copperfield?</a> -Crazy Days and Nights</p>
<p><em>&quot;The only news account about David Copperfield since October came from the National Enquirer. It is a story that ran the first week of January. It recounted the story of a limo driver who said David Copperfield attempted to rape a woman in the back of a limo in 1996 while he was dating Claudia Schiffer. The limo driver has offered to testify at any trial.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Michael Jackson</strong> and David Copperfield also have a &quot;working&quot; history together: <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2009/04/alleged-rapist-and-alleged-child.html">Alleged Rapist And Alleged Child Molester Working Together</a></p>
<p>Yet, with this latest discovery, we now know that <strong>Mr. Copperfield</strong> was ACUTELY AWARE and OBVIOUSLY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE FIELD OF <strong>MK-ULTRA</strong>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, <strong>John Mulholland</strong> was personally recruited by <strong>Sidney Gottlieb</strong>, head of the <strong>CIA’s technical services division</strong>, to develop clandestine and slight of hand ways to distribute lethal and narcotic substances to unwitting victims in his book entitled <strong><em>&quot;The Official CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/ISJLW#selection-117.1-117.23">THE SPHINX AND THE SPY</a> by Michael Edwards does a magnificent job detailing every aspect of Mulholland, Gottlieb and even George White, who carried out his infamously heinous experiments in Greenwich Village in NYC and the Tenderloin District in San Francisco with LSD in the 50\'s.  However accurate Mr. Edwards is, he is still painfully unaware that the projects he describes in his article were rife with Project Paperclip Nazi counterinsurgency elements embedded within them meant to transform the very work they were working on against them to begin the propagandization of America itself.</p>

           About a decade ago, life came crashing down hard on this, at the time permanent A list celebrity. After what happened he has laid low for much of the decade which endangers that permanent A list status.
          </p>

           While the friend focused his attention on the US and Europe, our A lister focused his attention on Asia. While the friend focused on connections, our A lister focused on making money. A lot of money. On his trips to Asia, he met with some people who specialized in tourists wanting children or young teens.

           The teen and tween girls were set up in a dormitory adjacent to the main house. Then, our A lister made bookings with Asian companies for his services. The thing is though, his services for years were one price and then beginning that year about a decade ago, his fees quadrupled. The difference was what men paid to visit his island.

They made everything just go away. They even managed to make the woman who turned on the A lister look like a loon. In return, this group of people got names and contacts and also all those clips. It is amazing what power can do. The A lister probably won't ever get his old luster back, but it beats spending all that time in jail.

            THE SPHINX AND THE SPY

           by Michael Edwards does a magnificent job detailing every aspect of Mulholland, Gottlieb and even George White, who carried out his infamously heinous experiments in Greenwich Village in NYC and the Tenderloin District in San Francisco with LSD in the 50's.  However accurate Mr. Edwards is, he is still painfully unaware that the projects he describes in his article were rife with Project Paperclip Nazi counterinsurgency elements embedded within them meant to transform the very work they were working on against them to begin the propagandization of America itself.

             This game is actually produced by the Magic Circle club in England, who had a couple of members kill themselves recently. I think Prince Charles is a member of the inner circle that accepts only 300 members.

               Yes. That's what I was pointing out in the comment.  However both the magician's club and the term coined in the Lawyer Magazine coined during Blair's time in office are deserving of our attention.   Quite a lot has been written about both here.

            Regarding the video you posted, there is a whole genre of YouTube clips that claim top magicians are assisted by supernatural forces. Interesting that John Mulholland appeared to be a staunch materialist.

             Perhaps not entirely: "John Mulholland authored the book Beware Familiar Spirits. Mulholland was generally skeptical, but at the end of the book he included a chapter with accounts of paranormal occurrences from others."

            Background on Mulholland, bit of a rabbit hole for conspiracy researchers:
           </p>
           <p>
            Mulholland was a debunker of spiritualism (also apparently skeptical of hypnosis and didn't use it). He was tasked to evaluate Andriji Puharich and was extremely critical. (Yet:     ".... It was revealed years later, in fact, that at the 1953 Chicago gathering magician Mulholland had become 'so frightened of something Puharich did' that he abruptly left the meeting, aborted his Chicago stay and immediately flew back to New York.")
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting that Frank Olson was also a skeptic and critical of Puharich. This source claims Olson et. al. stopped by Mulholland's office to drop off a check primarily.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently Mulholland was a womanizer, married but with a mistress known to his wife.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Also significant is the fact that Mulholland was extremely well connected with circles of power:the Rockefeller family, including Nelson, had been boosters of Mulholland; Mulholland's wife Pauline was related to Barbara Bush, George H.W. Bush's wife; and Pauline was a distant cousin of former U.S. President Franklin Pirece. Pauline herself came from a very wealthy family, and her father, Arthur J. Pierce, was a Brigadier General in the U.S. Army." Some think the Rockefellers funded MKULTRA and Mulholland was keeping an eye on things for Nelson Rockefeller.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Puharich was later a protege of Uri Geller and was involved in US parapsychological experiments (of "Men Who Stare At Goats" fame). He was also interested in free energy as a pal of Thomas Bearden.

             Definately implies a sort of psychopathy. I kind of wonder where this dude was in his head. Many accounts are, of course, glossing over his complicity as a matter of american patriotism against communism, but we all know that , while true to a slight degree, these men had MUCH more on their mind than just simple political ideologies. It has been described that Mulholland was VERY close to Harry Houdini and even served as his secretary in the last years of his life. If any of the stories about Harry's LA home are true, in which they are, Mr. Mulholland was DEEPLY into the occult. Not the fluffy hippie kind either.

              "Houdini said Hollywood was his favorite place. The nine or so months that he stayed here may have been the happiest time of his life.The house at 2435 Laurel Canyon Blvd. was built on solid rock and the hills around it were honeycombed with caves, some natural, some man-made. There was an elevator
which took passengers down through the solid rock to a tunnel that went under Laurel Canyon Boulevard and came up in the gatehouse of the Walker mansion.

               It's interesting that there's a rumor of a tunnel at Houdini's NY home, known as 278 from the address:
              </p>
              <p>
               "I then learned that a pub once sat on the corner, and neighborhood lore says that Houdini had a tunnel running from his house to the pub. Not sure I buy the tunnel story (sounds suspiciously like Laurel Canyon), but it was cool to learn there was a pub here in Houdini's day."
              </p>
              <p>

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               (There's a photo of a workroom, with two secretaries typing letters and someone else cataloging his library, says they were always busy. That seems strange to me, don't know.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's the same author on HH's Laurel Canyon home:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2012/03/inside-houdini-estate.html">
                http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2012/03/inside-houdini-estate.html
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Claims HH rented a guest house with elevator and tunnel to a mansion across the street, so many thought the mansion was his. Confirms existence of lots of 'caves' (perhaps alcoves) and tunnels. Claims the Rubin home is actually not this place.

            On John Mulholland:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Programmers like to manipulate. Children are set in front of circus mirrors that make them taller or smaller for programming. They are set in front of mirrors which duplicate their image. Here in Oregon, there is a site with a magnetic anomaly which bends light. It is called the Oregon Vortex. The Programmers take small children there for programming. Anything that creates an illusion, seems to be noticed by the Programmers and is put to use somehow.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The CIA has employed magicians like John Mulholland to help them create illusions
            </strong>
            . Magician John Mulholland wrote a manual for the CIA on how to deceive unwitting subjects. Under drugs and hypnosis, when a small child is set in front of a mirror that elongates its body and or then shortens, the reality of the programming script seems real. The programmer can hypnotically call upon the child’s mind to totally hallucinate seeing something, or he can support the illusion by handing the child a doll and telling it that it is a child, or handing the child a pencil and telling the child it is a flower. A great deal of acting and props are used during the programming.
           </p>
           <p>
            What child can tell fool’s gold from real gold? The bottom line is that generally, no matter which way the Programmers do it, whether by an illusion or an outright hypnotic-suggested hallucination, the event for the child is real. The majority of traumas are real events, but the scripts that are given are after the trauma are fictional."

             This makes TOTAL sense, I can even start to see the crossover and technique used in the Disney corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of Copperfields IDOLS is Walt Disney, I'd almost have to bet Mulholland and crew, maybe even Houdini himself, may have collaborated on illusions for Disney in the early years.

            From The Sphinx and the Spy link:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The three men arrived at Mulholland’s office around 3:00pm on November 25. Things did not go well.  'During this visit, Dr. Olson became highly suspicious and mixed up.  When this became apparent we tactfully cut the visit short.'
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            it was agreed that Olson should be placed under regular psychiatric care at Chestnut Lodge, an institution closer to his home and which had CIA-cleared psychiatrists on its Rockville, Maryland, staff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Arrangements were made for Frank Olson’s immediate admission to the hospital. In what was undoubtedly a remarkable coincidence, the doctor who served as the admitting physician for was Dr. Robert W. Gibson – the 25-year old son of Walter Gibson. [46] Walter Gibson was one of magic’s most prolific writers and editors, though the general public would know him best as the author of  “The Shadow.” He was also a close friend and colleague to John Mulholland."
           </p>
           <p>
            Olson died early AM November 28. I personally believe Olson was suicided by defenestration. It would seems Mulholland was by no means a bit player in the CIA and involved in this.

            What an amazing account.  UPVOAT and Thank you.  I have read it all except for some links that I will finish reading.  Can't help myself, you have done that wonderful of a job.  I knew about most of  of the names linked to Geller  but Pat Boone and Denueve were a shock.  I read Abel Danger's article about Leonard Cohen and Montreal U.  also I have read all of the Laurel Canyon history and could not put it down.  What a Red Pilling that was.

           <p>
            " Those who have attended Horace Mann include:
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA's Roy Cohn who ran a pedophile ring (Roy Cohn)
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA's James Schlesinger.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Mulholland taught industrial arts at the Horace Mann School.
           </p>
           <p>
            The very same day that Allen Dulles approved Project MKULTRA (mind control and sexual abuse of children), Sidney Gottlieb went to see John Mulholland.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Mulholland went to work for the CIA and MK ULTRA."

             Here's a NYT article about the Thomas Mann School, linked to in the Aangirfan post. Doesn't mention Mulholland but perhaps not coincidental that he would work there.

             Guess tards like you need standard answers.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I guess can't understand that no matter what nationality or religion you are there are those involved that got duped too, it's going to be a awefully damn hard job figuring out who the real culprits are but I'm DAMN SURE GLAD you aren't one of the decider's lol.... sounds like you got
             <em>
              strategery!!!
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             You know, I've tried to spell it out several times to you lazy fuckers that like to sit there and judge without taking that extra step but I'll take just this one more chance. See, Hitler was a fucking khazarian occultist and zionist that is PART OF A CULT THAT HAS MELDED WITHIN JUDAISM AND CLAIMS IT AS THEIR OWN WHILE EVEN JEWS OF THE LAND OF ISRAEL DO NOT RECOGNIZE. THEY ARE OCCULTISTS THAT BELIEVE IN THE OLDEN GODS AND GODESSES OF BABYLON AND SUMARIA, THE NEPHILIM AND ANNUNAKI. They are the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees of Jesus time. Hitler was only eliminating those jews that did not want anything to do with ZIONISM because that is what BOTH WORLD WARS WERE ABOUT.
            </p>
            <p>
             See, if you start LUMPING ALL JEWS TOGETHER AGAIN, we will have a another tragedy on parallel WITH THE HOLOCAUST, BECAUSE FUCKTWITS LIKE YOU DON'T DO ENOUGH RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONLY JEWS WERE MURDERED IN THE HOLOCAUST, BLACKS, HOMOSEXUALS AND CHRISTIANS, CROSSDRESSERS, THE POOR AND HOMELESS and anyone else that got in the New World Order Plans got stomped on, and this time IT MEANS YOU TOO. You are opening the door to your own death because of your hypocrisy.
            </p>
            <p>
             The con is obviously bigger than your little pea brain can comprehend.

            Great collection of research. You should look into the Manson murders a little more, too, people forget that there was a Folger who was murdered along with Sharon Tate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you should look at some veterans of the OSS, ONI...many of their kids wound up being pop singers and contemporary artists.

             The Buried Podesta Wikileak Email That Proves It's All About The Occult: The Thelema Favor
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            What is the glue that holds together and links Fromm and Maccoby to a Luciferian Nazi connected intelligence ring of blood oath secrecy?
           </p>
           <p>
            Part of the glue that binds PIZZAGATE together is buried in John Podesta’s WikiLeaks emails. It's in an email that came from Yale University Historian John Putnam Demos asking for a “Thelema Favor” to meet President Obama. A “Thelema Favor” could be interpreted as a communication of one’s will to another within a Thelemic (Thelemites) community. It could also be a communication of one’s will to a prophet of the Law of Thelema. The religion known as Thelema was founded in 1904 by the Satanist, the Great BEAST 666 Aleister Crowley, who is regarded as its prophet. Those who follow the Path of Thelema are called Thelemites.

            Dear Mary,
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope you and the family are well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since John is no longer with the email address I have for him, would you please forward this "thelema" (favor) to John ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Our internist, of many years, has a 95 year old mother who is in "Love" with President Barack Obama. In a recent visit, we got to talking politics and she mentioned how her mother would want to meet the President. On hearing of our relationship with John, our internist mentioned that her 95 year old mother would even make the extra effort to come to D.C. to meet with the president. Jean Houlihan, our internist, went on to say she would even make a special trip with her mother to D C. to accomplish this if she could not meet him somewhere in the Chicago area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edie Houlihan, the mother, was a social worker here in Chicago. She reared 6 children, 2 doctors, 2 lawyers, a nurse, and a successful business man. Edie donates to all requests from the Obama's. We know you are inundated with such requests but feel we had to give it a try. It's not something you can make happen but can you suggest an approach the family can take to help their Mom fulfill her "Bucket List"?
           </p>
           <p>
            The attached is a picture of Edie with a Harvard Hat from her Granddaughter, a recent graduate. I am not good at attaching Edie's picture, so I am sending it with a forward from Dr. Jean Houlihan's email to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope you are understanding and will give me a response -- yes or no.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope all is well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Love,
           </p>

            . You figured that out in only a couple of days?
           </p>
           <p>
            One note: I think the Dr. Green people refer to in the MK Ultra experiments was a different Dr. Green, not Mengele.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't found proof yet that Mengele ever went to the US, he died in South America.

             Hey have you ever heard of China Lake? Victims have discussed facilities there where MkUltra programming took place. I really wish I had the link but I remember reading something about the reason people believe Dr Green is Dr Menegle and it had to do with victims detailed descriptions of Green that matched Mengele. I never am convinced of anything since we are so lied to and manipulated, but it seems possible based on the victims accounts

               You know, I've tried to spell it out several times to you lazy fuckers that like to sit there and judge without taking that extra step but I'll take just this one more chance. See, Hitler was a fucking khazarian occultist and zionist that is PART OF A CULT THAT HAS MELDED WITHIN JUDAISM AND CLAIMS IT AS THEIR OWN WHILE EVEN JEWS OF THE LAND OF ISRAEL DO NOT RECOGNIZE. THEY ARE OCCULTISTS THAT BELIEVE IN THE OLDEN GODS AND GODESSES OF BABYLON AND SUMARIA, THE NEPHILIM AND ANNUNAKI. They are the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees of Jesus time. Hitler was only eliminating those jews that did not want anything to do with ZIONISM because that is what BOTH WORLD WARS WERE ABOUT.
              </p>
              <p>
               See, if you start LUMPING ALL JEWS TOGETHER AGAIN, we will have a another tragedy on parallel WITH THE HOLOCAUST, BECAUSE FUCKTWITS LIKE YOU DON'T DO ENOUGH RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONLY JEWS WERE MURDERED IN THE HOLOCAUST, BLACKS, HOMOSEXUALS AND CHRISTIANS, CROSSDRESSERS, THE POOR AND HOMELESS and anyone else that got in the New World Order Plans got stomped on, and this time IT MEANS YOU TOO. You are opening the door to your own death because of your hypocrisy.
              </p>
              <p>
               The con is obviously bigger than your little pea brain can comprehend.

            One key aspect of
            <strong>
             Mulhollands
            </strong>
            work was the clandestine and slight of hand delivery of illicit substances ranging anywhere from
            <strong>
             LSD to poison
            </strong>
            , this just happens to be the same Modus Operandi of another very influential countercultural goup called
            <strong>
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters">
              The Merry Pranksters
             </a>
            </strong>
            , a eclectic band of wandering 'hippies' that spurned generations of 'alternative thinkers' into the American lexicon, headed by "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" author Ken Kesey, who's notorious method of
            <strong>
             dosing strangers with massive amounts of LSD without their knowledge became standard practice.
            </strong>
            Here we have a direct antecedent to that practice with
            <strong>
             John Mulholland, a CIA operative
            </strong>
            . This only lends much more credibility to the work of
            <strong>
             Dave McGowan
            </strong>
            and his great work

           </p>
           <p>
            From there we wander into the darker and more clandestine operations of the head of the CIA’s technical services division Sidney Gottlieb, who worked with transplanted Paperclip Nazi's at efforts to continue and expand experiments in mind control conducted by Nazi doctors in the concentration camps during WWII.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gottlieb, Lashbrook and the tragedy of Frank Olson is where the rumor came from about the dangers of LSD making you "jump out of a window thinking you can fly" after Gottliebs many failed experiments at clandestine dosing. George White, another infamous agent among the CIA, set up clandestine two way mirror hotel rooms in NYC and later in San Francisco where thousands of unwitting participants, usually street people, homeless, johns and prostitutes were unwittingly experimented on with unknown substances and let off into the night with their own devices and mental illnesses.

            In 1943, Dr. Henry Alexander Murray was commissioned by OSS boss, U.S. Major General William “Wild Bill” Donovan (Phi Kappa Psi, Catholic Knight of Malta), to help complete an infamous “Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler.” The groundbreaking study was the pioneer of Offender profiling and political psychology, today commonly used by many countries as part of assessing international relations. Dr. John W. Gittinger’s CIA Personality Assessment System (PAS) expanded and refined Dr. Murray’s models in the selection, recruitment, assessment, training and hiring of CIA agents, clandestine operatives, and government department heads.

            Psychologist Dr. Henry Alexander Murray (May 13, 1893 – June 23, 1988) of Harvard University was the CIA’s preeminent elder statesman. During World War II, he left Harvard as the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as a lieutenant colonel. For Allied Forces, particular America and Britain, Dr. Murray developed special psychological assessment tests to recruit and select secret agents. He joined with the Schools and Training Branch of the OSS to write an entire book about the recruitment of special agents called Assessment of Men. The title was later changed to Selection of Personnel for Clandestine Operations: Assessment of Men.

            <em>
             “Murray was indeed a Cold War warrior—not, perhaps, as prominent a player as some, but a player nonetheless. He received steady funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, which had served as cover for his trip with Cantril to the Soviet Union for the CIA in 1958, and from the National Institute of Mental Health, also known to be a covert funding conduit. He apparently worked for HumRRo. He served as an adviser on army-sponsored steroid experiments. He helped found Harvard’s Social Relations Department, which had been generously funded by covert intelligence agencies. He served the U.S. Army Surgeon General’s Clinical Psychology Advisory Board and the National Committee for Mental Hygiene with the CIA’s propagator of LSD, Frank Fremont-Smith. Along with Fremont-Smith, Abramson, and Leary, he occupied a spot on the agency’s LSD pyramid.”

             In June 1960, Dr. Michael Maccoby received his PhD from Harvard in Social Relations at the same time Murray was a central figure in Harvard’s interdisciplinary Department of Social Relations who retired from Harvard in 1962.

             Just finished reading Weird Scenes Inside Laurel Canyon and McGowan brings up the most interesting points.  I have begun to think that Zappa, also, may have been involved in MK Ultra.  He never did drugs, but was everyone's mentor  (at least those who went his big cabin in LC).  He was revered like a god.  His movie, 200 Motels, has weird MK type symbology ie. spinning black and white circles.  It was a movie for people to watch on LSD as well.  Drugs spewed forth with wild abandon in Laurel Canyon at that time, as did all of the new rock idols and both seemed to come out of nowhere.  One big psyop it seems as almost every single musician/artist came from a military background.  Very curious indeed.

             <p>
              The powerful UK politician Paul Boateng (above right) is to be questioned by the UK's child sex abuse inquiry, led by chief Justice Lowell Goddard.
             </p>
             <p>
              Apparently, back in 1998, the police wanted to speak to Paul Boateng about his alleged links to a child abuse ring and to John Carroll the boss of a ­children's home (child brothel) in London.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G8zBCP3LuP4/VtiNrA3FT3I/AAAAAAAASzU/Ot5izu1BJFc/s320/boateng.jpg">

             </p>
             <p>
              One witness said that she saw Boateng at Carroll’s children's home (boy brothel) in Lambeth, South London, during the 1980s.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another witness said that Boateng visited a camp for children in care, run by Carroll.
             </p>
             <p>
              A third person, who worked in social services, said that Boateng contacted him after Carroll's bid to foster two boys was turned down.
             </p>
             <p>
              Carroll was jailed for 10 years in 1999 for abusing children during the 80s and 90s.

             <p>
              While Tony Blair was Prime Minister, Paul Boateng was the government minister reponsible for the police.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a belief that Boateng may know a lot about the child abuse rings that were allegedly used, worldwide, by the security services.

              Child abuse rings are used by the powers-that-be to control the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              A top people's child abuse ring made use of around 20 children's care homes in Lambeth in London.

              It appears as though these "magicians" act as "handlers" or controllers.

                 I have. Thank you. Mathis is a smart egg, however I seem to recall an article that was pretty scathing about pizzagate where he was TOTALLY off about the entire thing, and it seems to have disappeared. I find him pretentious at times.

                  'Mathis' is a definite fake. Undoubtedly not an individual - most likely a collection of spooks just like Q. Some of the stuff 'he' publishes may be true, though, and I have seen it said that the Manson stuff has a higher truth percentage than most.

                   I don't think I would go that far. I value some of his material and think he's a real person working alone but he really doesn't focus on much of value or contribute a whole lot, complains often, and is very long winded.

                    Well, check out 'his' recent article on fixing in chess and on the nature of chess in general. On page 7 of 16 'he' says, "For myself, I had no interest in winning by stalemate." and then, "A stalemate is an unmanly win." Now, if you know anything about chess what 'he' is saying there makes no sense - a stalemate is a draw, it is never a win. The whole article is full of similar rubbish. Unlike with most subjects, in chess I have specialist knowledge, so I find it very suspicious that when Mathis is tackling a subject about which I know quite a lot, I can immediately see lots of howlers. The method Mathis seems to follow is to mix truth with different levels of falsity - sometimes subtle untruths, sometimes blatant, even comical, howlers. And, of course, this is not a method which is unique to 'him'.
