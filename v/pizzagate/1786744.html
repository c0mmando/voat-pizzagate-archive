<p>Also, I\'m not sure what this means and I\'m not even sure if anyone else has posted or found this. If so, my apologies. But if you watch the I NO LUV video from Heavy Breathing and you pause it near the end 2:55 to be exact, there are only 2 frames that are different there. 2 fames is too short to be able to pause and let go of the cursor. You have to pause with cursor and hold it in place, then screencap the page to get them.</p>
<p>I have NO CLUE what these are. Just pictures? Hidden pictures in an already multi-layered creepy video? You tell me. Once again, these are stills from the video I NO LUV and are not visible in the video when you\'re watching normally. FOUND BY ACCIDENT TODAY. Also, I couldn\'t capture one. It has a small woman and a man and wood paneling. Good luck to anyone who can find more.</p>

            Seriously, you tin foil hatters see the Boogeyman in every corner or shadow. Not everything is related to crime or children being abused. They are music videos...meant for adults. Let kids be kids. Leave the Honorable Mr James Alefantis and his restaurant alone. It was one of you conspiracy theorists that stormed his restaurant not sane people like me who think you need a new hobby. Dionysius digs deeply.

             Who is this "James Alefantis" and some restaurant? What are you talking about? I have no idea what that means. I think you are on the wrong subverse or somthing. How does that relate to this topic?

              He is where this whole pizzagate conspiracy theory came from...he owns a successful restaurant called Comet Ping Pong. It has great pie...you should drop by the next time you are in DC.

                 I don't know who Alex Jones or "Fox" News channel is. I don't own a television so that's probably why a lot of your odd speech sounds weird to me. As far as I can see pedophilia is alive and well, and you're talking about a lot of things which don't seem to relate to anything. What's your point? Are you just trying to go onto posts and put confusing comments? If you have some proof or links, or evidence of some kind, please share it. OR you can at least explain what you are talking about better so it makes sense to people who are not zombies in front of televisions.

                Go do a Google search for Pizzagate and James Alefantis. It is a ridiculous theory that he runs a pedo ring out of his basement in his restaurant. Nutty stuff.

                 Oh, no  I think you're confused. That's not pizzagate. That's just a cover story that the Pedos made. That guy who shot up the pizza place, Edgar is an actor, so is his dad. His dad has a sec clearance. Jeez. where you been? You pretend to have info, but you can't even figure out the simplest thing about this. You sure you're in the right place buddy? You sound like a mainstreamer to me. How did you find your way here?? Besides, that pizza place doesn't even have a basement! It's at Pegasus Museum. Jeez, keep up.

            Been raising awareness within my social circles about these creepy toy channels.
           </p>
           <p>
            It helps for redpilling conversation's sake that Youtube is censoring, demonetizing, and agegate-ing anything that isn't an MSM acceptable opinion while still letting kids get to this sick shit without signing in. "Why do they block this while allowing kids to get to this toy shit?"

            I see nothing wrong with them. It is people like you who see the Boogeyman in everything. What a sad existence for you tin foil hat wearers. Let kids be kids. Grin. Pizzagate is fake news. Fake news hurts real people. Leave the Honorable Mr. James Alefantis alone. Hermes heaps heavy helpings. C3+P16+P16=cheese 3.16

             Yes we know that child rapists want to encourage children to be sexual. My hat is not made out of tin. I don't even know what that means. I don't know who James Alefantis is. Can you explain to me what you're talking about? What is "fake news"?

            There seems to be an entire culture around 'Hero and Princess'. Many videos depicting Spiderman, Frozen Elsa (they have a baby, creepy), Joker etc. The videos are disturbing and acted out by different groups of adults. Many issues witht he baby such as pooping, sick, needing drugs etc. Not for children obviously.  This is simply a YouTube link to a query for Hero and Princess.

             If I recall correctly, and I am fairly unfamiliar, but I recall people outside of Pizzagate research being confused by just how quickly these channels popped up and absolutely dominated in terms of acquiring views. Many of the comments on those Spider-Man/Elsa videos seem to all be bots spewing nonsense as well

               omg. That's really disturbing. Can you ask for her help? This is a great parent kid thing to help them see why this is dangerous. Ask her to let you know if there are more she sees so we can keep a list. I'll keep one on my computer or you can and we'll just keep publishing here until we figure out how to report it or whatnot.

                I will have to discuss this with my husband but I will definitely take this into consideration.  I just showed my son the whole video  (he is 4 yrs older) and he was really bothered by it and the fact that his sister has seen it.  So maybe I can get him to help... still it's up to the hubs.  I'll get back to you.  I might even take this on as my new hobby!!! I am so pissed off right now!! 😠😠😠

                 I hear you. This is a great way to sort of enlist them into fighting this, rather than be victims. I have been talking with one of hte mods. Mods daughters did not want mod to mod pizzagate out of fear. now they work together 'for the kids' and it brought them really close together. and Mod gets to "watch over" a bit more on their girls. I only say this because if she your daughter has already seen one, perhaps more...I just fear that means there are just more an more out there, hope she comes to you with them now instead of just consumes them. I'm convinced it's harmful even one time viewing for girls! ugh makes me so mad. It's so foul and dirty.

                  Really great points! Thank you for sharing with me and you are absolutely right.  I will be more open with my kid's about this.. I thought sheltering them was best but you made me see that's simply not the way to go.  I honestly thank you for opening up my eye's to this.

                    Yes definitely! My daughter is reporting back to me and I bribed my son with a video game to help as well.  So I will start compiling a list :) and will tag you probably weekly? Or so about it.
