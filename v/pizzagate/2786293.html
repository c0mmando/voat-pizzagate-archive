<p>&quot;Liberal Sherpa&quot; Cathy Areu said the hexing will take place in Brooklyn, and that it will include an optional $10 donation to take part.</p>
<p>The donations will be used to fund Planned Parenthood, in other words funding abortions or to the elites child sacrifice. A quick search off of wikipedia pulls up that there have been a total of 45 million abortions reported to the CDC from 1970 to 2014. &quot;Women\'s rights&quot; have lead to a genocide of unborn children in the US. No doubt their gods are pleased with their \'donations\'.</p>

<p>Of course hollywood and many of the celebrities fully endorse planned parenthood and its mission to slaughter/sacrifice children and donate to the cause. Then the most contentious supreme court nominee was attacked based on a fear that their sacrificing institution would be stopped. Now they cast hexes upon Kavanaugh! Planned parenthood is the child sacrificing institution of the US globalist elites and their devil worshiping followers.</p>
<p>To see the connections between the elites and the occult practices of ritual sacrifice, we must first look back into history to understand some of its origins and then fast forward to the present to see current incarnations.</p>

<p>From the page preview of journal: 
&quot;To this deity they made their sacrifices of various kinds, the most important of such sacrifices being that of a child. The child was either a witches child, or was unbaptized; in other words it did not belong to the christian church.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They burn their children when they have sacrificed them.&quot;</p>
<p>Take note how unbaptized children are chosen for their sacrifices. Aborted children make prime candidates for witches rituals today.</p>

<p>&quot;...it would be a “great idea” to burn the remains of aborted babies for energy. As gruesome as this sounds, Chelian isn’t the first to have this idea. Also in 2014, CBS reported that an Oregon incinerator may have been generating electricity by burning the remains of aborted children. That same year, a UK Telegraph report found that the remains of more than 15,000 babies were incinerated as ‘clinical waste’ by hospitals in Britain, with some used in ‘waste to energy’ plants.&quot;</p>

Nareshkumar Gandalal Patel, an abortionist, attempted to burn 174 fetuses in a field. Overall a terrible person it seems.</p>

<p>So what do these participants believe they\'ll gain from all these sacrifices? In Uganda people seem to believe they\'ll be bestowed with wealth and cure illnesses. &quot;These are some of the stories I have been told when meeting the locals in Buikwe district, 45 kilometres east of the capital Kampala. Here, superstition and poverty have created a market where witch-doctors and their agents have become rich because of people’s beliefs that blood and body parts from children create wealth, cure disease and ward off evil spirits.&quot; </p>

<p>So is there a connection between Planned Parenthood and the occult practices? Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was a eugenicist and involved with Rosicrucianism, an occult that claims to have secret knowledge. &quot;Ellis was an early member of the Fabian Society and served as Vice-President of the Eugenics Education Society and as President of the Galton Institute. He introduced Sanger to Rosicrucianisim, an esoteric cult, which introduces its initiates to ‘secret wisdom’. Sanger’s fascination with the occult extended to attempting to communicate with spirits.&quot; Margarets husband left her and said the her movement was &quot;not noble, but an excuse for Saturnalia of sex&quot;. With the origins of Planned Parenthood being steeped in eugenic philosophy and occultism, the claim that the death of the unborn has pure intentions is to mislead the general public.</p>

<p>Abortions have been encouraged amongst the general population to legitimize it the public consciousness and to lure in women and tell them it is their right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. They also seek the normalization of covens and their occult practices. This is of course done to the benefit of those practicing occult rituals. Many elites are affiliated with occults, most notably Hillary Clinton was given honorary membership to The Wing, a prominent witches coven in New York, they have their own website selling merchandise and outline events for community involvement. The wing has recently hosted Senator Gillibrand as a keynote speaker on women\'s rights, which includes support for Planned Parenthood.</p>
