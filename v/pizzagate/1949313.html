            What is it with the UK ? When the sexually liberal Romans invaded they were shocked at the barbarians' sexual activities that included incest and bestiality.  There must be something in their genes.

             The English have had a taboo against inbreeding since the Middle Ages. I would take those reports about the Romans with a pinch of salt. Also, bestiality is something I've never heard of here in the UK. That seems to be more Germany, Scandinavia and Canada. But hey, don't let me stop you with the unprovoked limey-bashing. Seems to be a popular sport around here.
            </p>
            <p>
             P.S. Maybe it's because the UK actually prosecutes these crimes? You then hear it about it in the news, accordingly. While in Berlin or Amsterdam it's probably a considered a normal spare-time hobby. Or in LA, NYC, DC, Rome, the perps are too powerful to be prosecuted. Something worth thinking about, for all the limey-bashers on here.

             Its The UK when it's vaguely tied to the royals, when is it England? When is it Great Britain? It's weird that the names of the jailed UK couple are not released though they took away 5 kids. Maybe isn't even important. Maybe it is important. There are no more articles I can find.

             the Muslim invaders even back then prized Western women for their harem because even in their lands the rumor was they have a big sexual appetite in addition to their blond hair etc.

             The only theory I've seen proposes for the gay gene was an Italian study suggesting some boys of promiscuous mothers inherit their sex drive and know that only other gays will be able to satisfy that frequency of rectal tearing, which then leads to HIV.

              I live in the UK. Honestly, there aren't that many gays around. It seems mostly the upper classes/crypto-Jews and kabbalistic Jews who push the agenda heavily in the media. Most people are pretty embarrassed about it, and tired of all the propaganda. Which is why the politics is now moving further to the right all the time. The Baby Boomers' grand-children are coming through, and there are lots of white babies everywhere. Most people are fairly 'normal.'
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes, our leaders are criminals. I get it. I still feel the general portrayal of chaos in the UK media is a Marxist agenda though.When I leave the front door, what I'm seeing isn't too different from places like Denmark or Norway. Yet the media makes the place look like a war-zone. In reality, it's a place that is highly socially engineered yet the normality always manages to pull through somehow in the end. And maybe that's why we get targeted so much.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's still a very conservative country. Most people here consider gays to just be weird and annoying.

               I don't know where in the UK you are but I live in London and must strongly disagree with a large portion of your assertions:
"Honestly there aren't that many gays around". Sorry but that certainly cannot be said of London, and I see no examples of "most people" being "pretty embarrassed by it".  Nor that they are considered "weird and annoying". On the contrary, in many parts of London the gays are almost celebrated and are massively represented in many ways, particularly within the nightclub/entertainment scene. Vast areas of the Capital, and particularly the West End are known to be selectively predominantly "gay areas" (i.e. Soho, Vauxhall, Hampstead Heath) and I have no understanding of your claim about  the "agenda" being pushed by the "upper classes/crypto Jews and kabbalistic jews" so I have no idea what "Marxist" media you may be referring to here.  But I can attest to there being a huge gay representation in London and in every walk of life.  Maybe you're further North where this representation isn't as high (I'm of Northern origin btw and familiar with their ooccasional ignorance of the real societal status quo based on their immediate surroundings) but I can confidently state that none of what you say is mirrored in my current experience as a long term London resident 
Edit to add that I agree with your comments about the "Limey Bashing" being common on here!  But I don't think we are necessarily "targeted"

             Funny!!!! Ive been seeing alot of that and also got freaked out by it. Trying to get in and out of GoodEarth health food store for a refund from them, a mexican woman who worked there was wearing a eye of horus n necklace and it was too bizarre. I skipped it.
