            Good catch on the basement story flip-flopping. Maybe the self-canned tomatoes are stored in the basement of a different building/location, but from the context of the conversation in that article, it does seem like he is referring to the basement of the restaurant.

            While the signed letter from Hillary is certainly proof of a connection between the two, it is not itself proof that they have ever met in person. That said, with how close Alefantis is with the Podestas, and his having gone to the White House multiple times and having met Obama, it is certainly possible (even likely) that he and Hillary have met in person before.

            PizzaGate is much larger than just one pizza place &amp; one man. Child/organ trafficking, child sex/torture, weapon trafficking, money laundering....basically treason against humanity. So, even if there is a basement under comet or besta, I'm sure it doesn't contain any evidence. I don't think illegal activities of sex occurred there as each business is used as a front, which is very common in these mafia type crimes. History repeats itself...

             I agree, but I'm feeling spread thin about all this stuff. We need investigators digging up dirt, but the core of the pizzagate movement should rally around something simple and obvious that they could call their congressman about and expect to get an answer.

             If everyone is spread too thin, nothing will get done.

              The scattershot research should continue but I also agree that a slightly more focused, consistent, and fact-based battlefront would be useful in countering the "fake news" narrative.

              Maybe an organized search for more examples of local businesses all over the world using pedo symbols. Show how pervasive and widespread the network is. It has long been referred to as the 'Open Secret', and as such, there should be plenty of thinly veiled references to expose.
             </p>
             <p>
              Start a massive campaign to get everyone to check the businesses, organizations, clubs, etc in their local cities and towns for
              <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols">
               these FBI's known pedophile symbols.
