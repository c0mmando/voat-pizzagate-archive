<p>&quot;A former priest at a Maryland church is behind bars after police report he was making child pornography involving underage boys.61-year-old Fernando Cristancho served as a priest from 1999 to 2002 at St. Ignatius Church in Harford County.&quot;</p>

Triplets born in 11/01 (2 boys, 1 girl). Baltimore archdiocese learned about the children and fired Cristancho from parish in 7/02. Privileges removed 2004. In 2006 DSS found sexual abuse of both boys, including oral sex. Mother reported possible 3rd victim. Maryland Appeals court gave custody to mother in 10/08. Cristancho denies abuse

<p>Maryland is a pedophile-friendly state,&quot; said Frank Dingle, of Catonsville, a member of the survivors group. &quot;The bishops\' and Pope\'s words have an impact, but if the bishops took action it would have even more of an impact. More needs to be done.&quot;

<p>Doesn\'t look like he did any time for the child abuse. Maybe now they\'ll yank his passport before he flees to Columbia.
