<p>When court staff interviewed Lehman in February to help determine whether he should be released, he didn’t mention working for Portland State University, court records show. He said he has a Ph.D. and sometimes drove for Lyft, DoorDash and Postmates. …</p>

<p>Redick said he was doing a photo shoot for MrPorter.com in New York City, and when the shoot was over, the company had a car to come pick him up. Redick was with his wife and her twin sister at the time, and he and his sister-in-law both had bags to put in the back of the Escalade they were going to be riding in. </p>
<p>When Redick went to put his bag in the back, he said he noticed a smell in the car, but it wasn\'t distinct or very obviously something disgusting. After driving through the city for a bit, the car came to a stop at a corner, at which point Redick\'s sister-in-law Kylee tapped him on the shoulder to tell him there was a person in the back of the car with them. There was a blanket over what appeared to be a cage or a box in the back of the car, and she was saying that there was a living person inside. ..</p>

<p>ISSOL’s Niles Lehman &amp; Templeton Cash Cow - <a href="https://oscillations.net/2018/04/05/issols-niles-lehman-templeton-cash-cow/">https://oscillations.net/2018/04/05/issols-niles-lehman-templeton-cash-cow/</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Templeton continues to pour millions of dollars into origin and evolution of life projects that result in fiasco: (1) the 2013 origins conference at CERN; (2) funding of religious scholars by NASA &amp; Templeton to investigate how the religious community would respond to the discovery of life in outer space; (3) the dig through 18 levels of civilization for religious evidence at 10,000-year-old Çatalhöyük—to cite just a few.  But science is not being compromised for big laughs, it’s being compromised by greedy academics and their university money managers who, with a wink, look the other way while Templeton’s Big Creep mission blurs the lines between science and religion.</p>
<p>One of the stickiest origins projects Templeton has recently funded is “Cooperation and Interpretation in the Emergence of Life,” which looks to find purposeful RNA fragments that agree to cooperate.  Six hundred thirty thousand dollars ($630,000) has been awarded for said project to the team of Christopher Southgate-–a British theologian/biochemist, and Portland State University chemistry professor Niles Lehman. </p>
<p>Lehman was recently elected president of the nonprofit origin of life society “ISSOL” replacing Sandra Pizzarello.  As ISSOL president, Lehman will now also be majorly soliciting funds, including more from Templeton. </p>

<p>RNA fragments that agree to cooperate... Been planning for a long time now to do a post on the science of cooperation which imo, is about transhumanism and eventually engineering humans to be more compliant and not fight back against the establishment and ties in the Brookings Institute and Santa Fe Institute. Anyhoo...
John Templeton Foundation - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Templeton_Foundation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Templeton_Foundation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Templeton Prize was established by John Templeton and he administered the prize until the Foundation was established in 1987, which took it over.[3][14] The prize has &quot;a value of about $1.7 million, making it one of the world’s largest annual awards given to an individual&quot;.[2]
The early prizes were given solely to people who had made great achievements in the field of religion; Mother Teresa received the inaugural award in 1973,[3] with other early winners including Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1975),[15] Chiara Lubich (1977),[16] and Nikkyō Niwano (1979). In the 1980s, John Templeton began considering the intersection of science and religion, and after he appointed two scientists to the judging panel, scientists who worked at the intersection began receiving it; Alister Hardy was the first, in 1987.[3] More recent winners of the Templeton Prize have included the Dalai Lama in 2012,[18] King Abdullah II of Jordan in 2018,[19] and Brazilian Jewish physicist and astronomer Marcelo Gleiser in 2019. </p>
<p>In 2015, the Santa Fe Institute was awarded a three year, $2.5 million grant to support the development of a general theory of complexity, constituting &quot;a concise, parsimonious, and potentially mathematizable framework for understanding complex adaptive systems&quot;. </p>

            This is the same Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who, together with Bill Gates, owns the Four Seasons Hotel that is located within the 5 top floors of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas.

            I remember the story of the Lyft with the cage in the back seat.  I relayed this to someone that tried to get me into a Lyft car for a short ride.  She's OK but another non believer.  Another one that makes excuses to serve their purpose.  It spoke so loud and clear to me.  Lyft and Uber and other ride sharing cos. have been started for one reason.  They are another way for traffickers to transport the trafficked.  Just like Amazon, Walmart and Fed Ex.  There is no way I will EVER use ride share.  Bus, train, walking or call a friend.

            Lyft and Disney?  A Toxic Solution for Our Children.  This could only spell DANGER for them. UGH.  So frightening.  Ugh.

             (As has been noted here, Twitter is some sort of black hole. "Twitter has lost $2 billion since 2011." "Twitter has never turned a profit.")
            </p>
            <p>
             Traverse is involved (investments) in all these things including film biz and Snapchat. Private global jet charters. SpaceX (rockets and space travel). This guy's got his fingers in everything.

            <p>
             "The friends successfully pitched JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co on a deal to buy more than $400 million worth of Twitter shares in 2011. Months later, Rizvi recruited Kingdom Holding Co, Saudi Prince Alwaleed’s investment company, to buy an additional $300 million in stock in a separate vehicle. JPMorgan Chase and representatives for Alwaleed did not respond to requests for comment on the deal." Also, "Rizvi maintains an elusive Web presence. The only readily found picture of Rizvi is a snapshot of him sitting with Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and Alwaleed in a New York hotel after the prince bought Twitter shares."

              Jeff Bezos
             </strong>
             and additional investments from past investors such as Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, and Sabet also accepted a board seat at Twitter.[14] According to Hatching Twitter, Sabet and Wilson played a crucial role in facilitating smooth leadership changes at Twitter in October 2008 and later October 2010—ousting Jack Dorsey to install Evan Williams in 2008, and ousting Williams to install Dick Costolo in 2010.
            </p>

             In December 2016, Spark Capital led a series B funding round for Pendo, a platform driven by data[clarification needed] that helps companies deliver experiences with respect to software.[clarification needed] This was in collaboration with

             Andre Dimitri Hurst runs an EB-5 visa business like Hillary's brother Tony did before the govt shut it down...He seems like a spook though..Couple months prior there was a news report of his arrest for ostensibly trying to brownstone someone...The victims stated they discovered the camera concealed within a carbon monoxide detector that they had not placed inside their room. The camera was capable of transmitting video via WiFi signal....During the service of the search warrant, the suspect was observed driving past his residence and he appeared to see the police activity occurring. He was stopped in the 800 block of Neptune Avenue in the city of Encinitas....here happens to be a pizza place a stone's throw away from the 800 block of Neptune Ave and it happens to have a Greek mythology name and happens to protest too much by identifying itself as "kid-friendly."

             Rainbow flags, brightly colored signs, and hundreds of loud, cheering counter-protesters met at least 10 anti-gay protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church on the streets surrounding Wilson early this morning. The counter-protesters, organized by Wilson’s Student Government Association and Gender and Sexuality Aligned organization, included representatives from the Wilson community, surrounding neighborhoods, other schools in the area, the D.C. government, Wilson alumni, and local churches and organizations. Both the protest and counter-protest remained peaceful throughout.

              Hmm...great observation. This sort of adds to the Brownstone Operation Theory about Epstein. Create these consortiums roping in "thought leaders", flatter the crap out of them, lull them into a sense of being elite "insiders", then gradually lure them into tempting perversities that can be used to leverage them.
