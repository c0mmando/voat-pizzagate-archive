            Don't expect a lot of replies to your CTA for Russian hacking evidence. It's a wild speculation, if not a blatant lie, pushed by the CIA to justify the whole shazam, I can probably provide you with some articles from MSM that push the hacking agenda, but the truth is they are poorly substantiated (pretty much 0 sources), which makes for poor evidence. On the other hand this whole subvoat is dedicated to proving (with quite some success) that this is certainly NOT fake news. So good luck finding the evidence :D
