<p>\'<strong>Roman Catholic bishops in the U.S. announced a series of new policies Wednesday for dealing with sexual-abuse accusations, the first concrete change they have publicly made since a series of new allegations this year plunged the church into crisis.</strong></p>
<p>While the church has had a system for dealing with complaints against priests since 2002, <strong>there was previously no formal method to address complaints against bishops</strong>, who oversaw that process.</p>
<p><strong>Now the church will establish a new system, run by a third party, for people to confidentially report misconduct by bishops</strong>, the administrative committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a statement.</p>
<p>The complaints will be directed “to the appropriate ecclesiastical authority and, as required by applicable law, to civil authorities,” the committee said.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, the committee is beginning to develop a “code of conduct” regarding sexual abuse and harassment by bishops or negligence of duties in dealing with such issues, as well as policies for bishops who have been accused.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The bishops also said they “support a full investigation the situation surrounding Archbishop McCarrick.”</strong> </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, the former top church official in Washington, D.C., became the first clergyman in more than 90 years to resign from the College of Cardinals, after an accusation that he abused an altar boy almost 50 years ago. </p>
<p>He has also been publicly accused of inappropriate sexual behavior toward adult seminary students.</p>
<p>The former cardinal has previously said that he didn’t remember the incident with the boy and believes he is innocent.</p>
<p>The case has unleashed a flurry of allegations about who knew about the allegations against then-Cardinal McCarrick. </p>
<p>One archbishop has accused a number of U.S. church officials, as well as Pope Francis, of ignoring the charges and abetting Archbishop McCarrick’s rise to influential positions. The pope hasn’t directly responded to the allegations.</p>
<p><strong>Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the USCCB, publicly called for a Vatican investigation</strong>, known as an apostolic visitation, into Archbishop McCarrick’s rise to power. He traveled to Rome last Thursday, where he met with Pope Francis</p>
<p><strong>The USCCB’s statement, however, doesn’t mention any Vatican investigation.</strong> </p>
<p>After his meeting with the pope last week, Cardinal DiNardo issued a statement that said only: “We are grateful to the Holy Father for receiving us in audience. </p>
<p>We shared with Pope Francis our situation in the United States—how the Body of Christ is lacerated by the evil of sexual abuse….It was a lengthy, fruitful, and good exchange.&quot;</p>',

            DiNardo  is one of THEM. Do not trust any of this. The are evil liars. Cupich has been chosen by the pope to be part of the Synod so that should tell you how serious they are. Cupich has priests living in the Cardinal,s Mansion that have been covering up abuses. The are hoping we will all cool our jets while it buys them more time to commit more evil crimes upon Our Children and rape more seminarians. May St Michael the Archangel reek havoc upon their leader, the devil and may they all burn forever in the fires 🔥 of HE77.

              They are not going to fool us but they want to fool the masses.  But I think many are awake. I don’t think they will fall for it. They are watching. Those signed letters to the pope were powerful message. We are watching.

              Thanks for brining up both the facts and the concerns. Anything other than ritual suicide seems to be pandering and pacifying to me. 
 However, I'm baptized not confirmed and somehow conflating priests with samurai soooo yeah,  Always curious how the official response is perceived by actual heart practicing Catholics.
