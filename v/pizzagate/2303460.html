We all want to see pedophiles put into the dirt, but this is one of the most obvious false narratives I have seen pushed and trust me, we have a lot of those being pushed.</p>
<p>Here\'s the false story you\'ve been told: Cyntoia Brown was sold into a child trafficking ring at a young age. At 16 an older pedophile paid her pimp to deliver her to his house where he could rape her. Fearing for her life Cynthia Brown took the pedophiles gun and shot the man. Afterwards she ran to the police where she was arrested. Instead of protecting her and understanding she acted in self defense, she was assigned a public defender and the corrupt justice system gave her life in prison.</p>
<p>Very sad, except, NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. Unfortunately Kim Kardashian and the main stream media lied to you, shocking I know.</p>
<p>Here\'s the <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/tennessee/court-of-criminal-appeals/2009/browncyntoiadeniseopn.html">Actual Case</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>She testified to not having sex with the man (Johnny Allen) she shot</li>
<li>She claims she was not a prostitute </li>
<li>She testified the man never got into bed with her naked. Yet died without any clothes.</li>
<li>She testified to shooting him with <strong>her own gun</strong> &quot;she bought off the street&quot;</li>
<li>The man died face down with his hands over his eyes and fingers interlocked. THIS IS EXECUTION STYLE.</li>
<li>There was residue on the pillow and the victims head. Meaning he was shot from a very close distance.</li>
<li>Immediately after the shooting she met with &quot;some black dude&quot; at a local Walmart who she wouldn\'t name.</li>
<li>She did not run to the police, she was tracked down and arrested in a hotel room. When arrested she yelled &quot;[Her boyfriend] had nothing to do with this&quot;</li>
<li>She testified that she stole $172 from the victims wallet which the police found in her purse as well as rifles from the mans house which she claims she intended to pawn.</li>
<li>She claims the man picked her up at a fast food restaurant, except the man\'s girlfriend was going by to see him that evening at 9pm. MAKES NO SENSE.</li>
<li>She stole the victims F-150 Truck, did she go straight to the police? NOPE, she went to get people to help her finish clearing the house out.</li>
<li>She <strong>bragged</strong> to another person about shooting a man in the head for $50,000 and a truck, and asked for a ride to clean the house out.</li>
</ul>
<p>It goes on and on like this. If you read this court case you are going to be FURIOUS that anyone is defending this woman Cyntoia Brown. The man she murdered wasn\'t a pedophile, he was a 43 year old white collar professional who was executed by a violent criminal and her 24 year old boyfriend named &quot;cut throat&quot; during a break in. They sadistically made the man undress and lay on the bed with his fingers interlocked only to be shot at point blank range. She was never in a child sex ring. The paramedics, police, prosecutor, and judge all came to the same exact conclusion. Absolutely none of her story is true. Do not be a sucker and fall for this false narrative.</p>',

             Not quite pedo, but I believe they had a 14-yo Kardashian Klan member dating a rapper in his 20's. Seems very inappropriate.

              And, they steal other people's kids instead of having their own so they can either not get fat or they are really men and have to steal the baby or use a surrogate.  You can't make this stuff up.  I can't even believe I am writing this.  Twilight Zone.
