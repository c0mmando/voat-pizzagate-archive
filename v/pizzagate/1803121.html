            , I'm not seeing the support for SRA in either of the links. The court found there was no evidence the boy was "roasted" as the media (CNN no less) claimed -- or even harmed. As I literally had cousins pull this very same stunt on me during a camping trip as a kid, the soldiers' claim they were rough-housing with Somali kids seems plausible. I need to remove this per Rule 2 (all claims need to be sourced). Can you repost with support for the SRA hypoithesis and a headline that more accurately reflects the content you've linked to?  Thank you!  That's some pretty badass digging, btw.

             , backing up what I posted better. I didn't post this one initially because the original link has been scrubbed. It's an article from the telegraph. What the peacekeepers did to these children, including burning, keeping them in confined containers, urinating on them in addition to sexual abuse and alleged murder to at least one of them - is all reported in SRA/MK accounts. Then there is the Belgian connection as well.

             "Belgian UN troops admit to 'roasting' Somali boy
By Robert Fox and AFP
            </p>
            <p>
             TWO Belgian paratroopers who were photographed "roasting" a Somali boy over a flaming brazier are expected to be jailed for only a month and fined £200 after admitting the atrocity in a military court in Brussels yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Privates Claude Baert and Kurt Coelus faced a maximum of a year in jail but the prosecutor demanded only a month. Sentence will be passed on Monday. The case against a third soldier accused of atrocities during the United Nations "Restore Hope" mission three years ago was adjourned until September.Sgt Dirk Nassel is accused of forcing a young Somali to eat pork, drink salt water, and then eat his vomit. The three soldiers were charged with assault and threatening behaviour.A fourth member of the 3rd battalion of the Parachute Regiment, based at Tielen in Flanders, is also due to go on trial in September. Sergeant Major Rudy Derkinderen is suspected of having murdered a Somali whom he was photographed urinating on.
            </p>
            <p>
             The circumstances surrounding the death of another child at the paratroopers' base near Kismayo in southern Somalia are also under investigation. According to the testimony of two former paratroopers, the boy, who had been caught trying to steal food, died after being locked in a container for 48 hours.The Defence Minister, Jean-Pol Poncelet, has promised that any of the paratroopers found guilty of criminal acts in Somalia will be dishonourably discharged. Baert has already left the army but Coelus is now in the navy and Nassel has remained at Tielen.Mr Poncelet has also ordered an inquiry to establish whether the incidents were part of a broader pattern of abuse of the local population. If it is, he has promised to disband the 3rd battalion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fifteen members of the regiment were investigated in 1995 for "acts of sadism and torture" against Somalian civilians.One paratrooper has been sentenced to five years, following the murder of a Somalian youth, who allegedly had uncovered illegal arms trading by the paratroopers. Belgium is the third country involved in the "Restore Hope" mission to charge its soldiers for serious misdemeanours against Somalian civilians, including rape, torture and murder. In 1995 a group of Canadian paratroopers were investigated for torturing a Somali to death and killing three others.
            </p>
            <p>
             The charges of indiscipline, racism, and the rituals for new members of the unit led to the Canadian Airborne Regiment being disbanded last year. Earlier this month gruesome photographs were published in a Milan magazine of Italian soldiers torturing a young Somali youth, and abusing and raping a young Somali girl. Two Italian generals involved in "Restore Hope" have subsequently resigned to clear the way for a major investigation of the unit involved, the Folgore (Lightning) Division currently deployed on peacekeeping duties in Albania.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Italian parliament has set up a major investigation and boards of inquiry of the Italian army are at work. Paratroopers of the Folgore claim that they were specifically trained in methods of torture to aid interrogation. According to one witness Italian soldiers tied a young Somali girl to the front of an armoured carrier and raped her while officers looked on.The witness told investigators: "When the officers wanted to have fun, everybody went along with it."
            </p>
            <p>
             Over the weekend an interpreter with the Italian force in Somalia accused a Folgore battalion commander of sexually abusing a 13-year-old Somali youth. The "Restore Hope" mission has become the most controversial of all recent peacekeeping operations undertaken under the UN banner. It was mandated in 1992 to provide medical aid and food after civil order in Somalia collapsed following the overthrow of the Marxist dictator Maj Gen Muhammad Siad Barré, after a 17-year civil war.
            </p>
            <p>
             The operation was directed by an American admiral, and spearheaded by American Marines. After the murder of 20 Pakistani soldiers in an ambush and the killing and dragging of two American Marines through the streets of Mogadishu, the American command moved from peacekeeping to offensive operations against the warlords running the main Somali cities, principally Mogadishu and Kismayo.
            </p>
            <p>
             Though they used helicopter gunships and area bombardment, the Americans failed to defeat the leading warlord, Gen Muhammad Farrah Aidid, and eventually the UN forces were ordered to withdraw. A common thread through the accusations against the Belgian, Italian and Canadian forces, is the racism of elite units, particularly airborne units, and their inability to adapt to low-intensity peacekeeping operations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last week an Italian paratrooper said: "What's the big deal? They are just niggers anyway."
            </p>
            <p>
             The head of the UN's peacekeeping department, Under Secretary General Bernard Miyet, said: "The image of the United Nations has been tarnished.""

              Thanks for the additional info 9217. The key is to make a less inflammatory headline -- so you don't have to provide as rigorous of evidence. The main problem was the headline claimed they roasted the kid alive, but the article linked literally said the opposite -- that they were pretending to during a rough housing incident. As we are documenting this stuff, it's important that we don't inflate events beyond the demonstrable facts or resort to innuendo, because these are the very tactics the enemy is using to discredit Pizzagate and the anti-globalist movement. That's the main objective of the

            "The newest photos, published Wednesday in the daily newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, include one of a Belgian paratrooper urinating on the face of a dead Somali.
           </p>
           <p>
            Photos released earlier show two paratroopers holding another Somali over an open fire, allegedly "roasting" him until he was severely burned. Two paratroopers were arrested last week and charged with assault and battery in the incident."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Members of Belgium's elite paratrooper unit served in the United Nation's "Operation Restore Hope" mission in Somalia in 1993. Two years ago, 15 paratroopers were put on trial for other abuses during the U.N. mission, including torture, killings and the mock-execution of children. Most were acquitted.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the photographs, which came to light in the last two weeks after two former paratroopers came forward anonymously, bolster accusations that Belgian soldiers tortured and killed civilians during the mission.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Belgian military promised that anyone found guilty of human rights abuses will be punished.

"First and for all, the Belgian army authorities never tolerate violations of humanitarian rights, martial law or penal laws. Those who are violating these rules are sent to military courts," said Col. Gilbert Hertoghe of Belgium.
           </p>
           <p>
            Military auditor Gen. Jean-Yves Minne says many of the paratroopers have been located, including those who held a Somali child over a fire. "The persons which committed these crimes have also been interrogated by magistrates and one of them is placed under arrest. The second one is released pending trial," he said.
           </p>

            Belgium to follow Canada's lead?
           </p>
           <p>
            Minne says the most serious action he's investigating involved an alleged Somali thief who was reportedly forced into a container and left in the hot sun until he died.
           </p>
           <p>
            Canada has wrestled with similar cases of torture and killings stemming from the U.N. mission, and in the end, disbanded its elite airborne regiment, whose soldiers committed the worst abuses.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Shouldn't we go as far as the Canadians and just disband the battalion?" Poncelet said in an interview with the Brussels daily De Morgen."

            BRUSSELS - A Brussels military court Monday acquitted two Belgian ex-paratroopers of maltreating a Somali child during a humanitarian mission in the African country in 1993 because of insufficient evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            ``It could not be established that physical violence had been inflicted,'' presiding judge Dirk Moereman said, adding that there also was no conclusive evidence that the child's life had been in danger. The men were given the benefit of the doubt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kurt Coelus and Claude Baert had been identified from a photograph in Belgian daily Het Laatste Nieuws earlier this year which appeared to show them swinging a boy over a camp fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            The prosecutor had demanded one month's prison for Coelus, now in the Belgian Navy, and Baert who has left the army.
           </p>
           <p>
            A separate case involving their Sgt. Dirk Nassel will be heard in September. He was also charged with threatening behavior and physical violence while serving in the same multinational peacekeeping mission in Somalia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nassel is alleged to have made a Somali Muslim boy eat pork and drink salt water.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coelus and Baert, members of the Third Paratroop Battalion, had told the court they had meant no harm. They had merely played a game by grabbing one of the children attracted by the warmth of the fire, proclaiming they would 'roast' it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The men had been playing with Somali children all day, mainly out of boredom.
           </p>
           <p>
            The court said there had been no conclusive evidence that the child's clothing had caught fire while it was being swung over the fire for 30 seconds to a minute. ``(The child) did not call out or cry...it started as a game,'' Moereman said.
           </p>
           <p>
            The court said the child had been treated roughly, but there had been no hostility.
           </p>
           <p>
            It dismissed charges of racism and inhuman behavior brought by the Belgian Center for Equal Opportunities and the Fight Against Racism. It disallowed an application by the Center the charges be upgraded to war crimes under the Geneva Convention.
           </p>
           <p>
            The court said there was insufficient evidence that the two men had had racist motives, although there might have been a generally racist atmosphere in their battalion or among other United Nations troops in Somalia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Luc Walleyn, the Center's lawyer, said after the trial the court did not reject the idea that racism had played a role in the incident. But it had been restricted to ruling on the two men's behavior only.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said that in the case of Sgt. Nassel there were ``more serious elements'' of racist motives. The Center was considering appealing the verdict against Coelus and Baert.
           </p>
           <p>
            Judge Moereman said: ``It is not this court's duty to try the Third Paratroop Battalion or Belgium's actions in Somalia.'' Nor was it up to the court to comment on the behavior of Italian or Canadian troops serving in the same humanitarian mission.
           </p>
           <p>
            Charges of maltreating Somali children have been made against Canadian and Italian troops who also served for the United Nations in Somalia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moereman reprimanded Coelus and Baert. ``I cannot congratulate you on what you did. It was unwise and dangerous.''
           </p>
           <p>
            He lashed out against the media, charging the men had been tried in public and as a result had ``gone through hell. For some parties the actual contents of the dossier did not matter. What happened with Italian and Canadian troops, other events in Somalia cannot be allowed to play a role here.''
           </p>
           <p>
            The photographs of Coelus and Baert together with others showing a soldier urinating on an apparently dead Somali and one with his army boot on the head of another Somali caused outrage among the Belgian media and cries of ``paras of shame.''
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite the dent to the paratroops' reputation, Belgian soldiers who served on humanitarian operations by the U.N. will feature in Belgium's traditional July 21 National Day parade.

            Belgian Soldiers Acquitted of Torture
           </p>
           <p>
            BRUSSELS, Belgium - Two Belgian peacekeepers accused of torturing a Somali boy by stretching him over an open fire were acquitted Monday by a military court.
           </p>
           <p>
            The court found that privates Claude Baert and Kurt Coelus did not engage in torture in 1993 but in a playful game meant to discourage the child from stealing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The two were also cleared of charges of assault and battery and threatening behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            ``The court considered there was no evidence that the attack was meant to hurt the child (but that) it was a form of playing without violence,'' Prosecutor Luc Walleyn told reporters.
           </p>
           <p>
            The prosecution had sought a monthlong jail term for both soldiers, who were among the U.N. peacekeepers from 21 countries sent to Somalia in ``Operation Restore Hope.''
           </p>
           <p>
            The 1993-1995 mission was to protect and feed a population suffering in the anarchy of civil war. However, there have been numerous reports that some peacekeepers -- including Belgians, Italians and Canadians -- brutalized the civilians they were sent to help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Monday's verdict raised questions about how successful prosecutors will be in obtaining guilty verdicts in similar cases of misconducts involving other Belgian peacekeepers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cases of Baert and Coelus came to light after a Belgian newspaper published pictures of the two holding a young Somali boy over an open fire. Baert has since left the armed forces, Coelus has transferred to the Belgian navy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed shock and anger at reports of violence and torture ``which are unacceptable and counter to everything peacekeeping stands for.''
           </p>
           <p>
            A Canadian government investigation on the Canadian experience in Somalia is due to be made public Wednesday.
