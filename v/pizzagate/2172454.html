<p>So I\'ve been playing recently and never used to go into events or socialize but started now because i wanted to see what it was like and if i could notice anything.</p>
<p>This one event was &quot;Join our Royal Family&quot; so i went to it (game culture is they have families- either mafias or royal families, there\'s one family that calls themselves the Owls- people join and they run around the game like a gang or tight knit circle of friends).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So i went to the event and the &quot;king&quot; who was vetting people who wanted to join, his user name had xxxMazzeiITLxxx . That wasn\'t weird though, the weird thing was some girl in the room said &quot;we eat babies&quot; . I couldn\'t stay in the room the game has been tricky lately where you always have to refresh and you go back to your main home. </p>
<p>Then there was this scavenger hunt game all of the users were playing, everyone ended up adding all of these random players walking around the street so we can get the items we needed. I didn\'t keep track of them all it moved fast but i checked my friend list (in game list) afterwards and i added a player named Skippy, so now i can go to his in-game home if i wanted, i didn\'t remove him yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the odds the few actions i take to socialize in game and i immediately come across 2 incidents right away that are similar to pizzagate reveals?</p>
<p>I have another story about the game but this one is removed from pizzagate, happened a long time ago but also exemplifies the types of people playing the game perhaps?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game started in 2008, i joined in 2009. Back then i tried the online dating thing, or would add and meet people from online a lot. I remember this one guy from my province added me on an FB dating site, i added lots back then and never talked to most of them. So i played yoworld constantly back then, decorating homes, and i noticed this guy also had a yoville account (back then it was yoville) so i could go to his game home. Pretty plain home and didn\'t dress his character up at all either. Through FB he messaged me and asked me out, i asked him for more pictures since his were like nature shots hard to see him fully in any of them. He didn\'t respond so i ignored him after that and didn\'t think much about it. Then i read an article in the news, a gentleman with his last name was found dead in a freezer in his home in leduc, the whole story was weird, the transient people who found him weren\'t charged. I remembered the name and dug a bit and found out he was related to the guy who added me on FB, they lived in towns 2 hours apart and shared relatives etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what are the odds, the few times i actually interact with people connected to that game i come across a guy named skippy, a royal family that eats babies and a potential serial killer type. </p>
<p>So basically now i feel there is enough of a pattern here, maybe i should play around the game more and see what i find. That would mean playing a part,a making friends and gaining trust to find out details to pursue.</p>
<p>Any ideas, advice, comments? I\'m not much of an online player socializer and do not have much skills in this area.</p>',
