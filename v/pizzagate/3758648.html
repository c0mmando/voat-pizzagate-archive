Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead!</p>

<p>This chapter will debunk certain culprit theories that have permeated this case. We can’t have false leads being pushed by Twitter normies as they make this case look crazy and absurd.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WZkrt1y5-70">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WZkrt1y5-70</a> Normally, I don’t buy into this kind of crap. I merely took a watch to try to look for more leads (since I’ve been stuck for a while). </p>
<p>Some very interesting commentary did came up in the video that I do believe is relevant. Namely two certain comments: “Mostly true but some falsehoods in there”, and “a culprit not being who people think it is”.</p>
<p>These coincide with something that’s been bothering me for a while and with observations I’ve made from social media discussing the case.</p>
<p>A LOT of people are connecting Stephen King with the crimes against Heather O’Rourke, while virutually no one is looking into Richard Vane as a culprit. If Mr Culkin’s story is true (I suspect its highly plausible), then Richard Vane is the man he’s talking about. Stephen King as a culprit makes no sense to me, which is why I’m going to check how likely it is for him to be involved in the Rocky Road incident (IF he’s involved, its here).</p>
<p><a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=">https://searchvoat.co/?t=</a>“stephen%2Bking”&amp;s=pizzagate&amp;b=on&amp;nsfw=on All hits for Stephen King on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King</a> Stephen King’s book after IT (September 1986) was in 1989.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000175/filmotype/actor?ref_=m_nmfm_3">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000175/filmotype/actor?ref_=m_nmfm_3</a> Looking for a potential alibi, I see Creepshow 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000175/filmotype/writer?ref_=m_nmfm_1">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000175/filmotype/writer?ref_=m_nmfm_1</a> Extremely active from 1986-1987. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepshow_2">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepshow_2</a> May 1, 1987 was the release date. Given the time it takes for editing (2-4 months), we have an alibi. Given this movie was based on multiple stories of his, it is logical to believe that Stephen King was very active in the making of this movie. He also had a physical role in the film.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0092796/locations">https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0092796/locations</a> The film was made nowhere near California. Filmed in Arizona and Maine.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while Stephen King is definitely a nasty piece of work relevant to our work, he is not the culprit....THIS TIME! His involvement in the rape/death of Heather O’Rourke is impossible as he wasn’t even in California at the time of the Rocky Road incident.</p>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           This chapter will debunk certain culprit theories that have permeated this case. We can’t have false leads being pushed by Twitter normies as they make this case look crazy and absurd.

           Normally, I don’t buy into this kind of crap. I merely took a watch to try to look for more leads (since I’ve been stuck for a while).
          </p>
          <p>
           Some very interesting commentary did came up in the video that I do believe is relevant. Namely two certain comments: “Mostly true but some falsehoods in there”, and “a culprit not being who people think it is”.
          </p>
          <p>
           These coincide with something that’s been bothering me for a while and with observations I’ve made from social media discussing the case.
          </p>
          <p>
           A LOT of people are connecting Stephen King with the crimes against Heather O’Rourke, while virutually no one is looking into Richard Vane as a culprit. If Mr Culkin’s story is true (I suspect its highly plausible), then Richard Vane is the man he’s talking about. Stephen King as a culprit makes no sense to me, which is why I’m going to check how likely it is for him to be involved in the Rocky Road incident (IF he’s involved, its here).

           May 1, 1987 was the release date. Given the time it takes for editing (2-4 months), we have an alibi. Given this movie was based on multiple stories of his, it is logical to believe that Stephen King was very active in the making of this movie. He also had a physical role in the film.

           The film was made nowhere near California. Filmed in Arizona and Maine.
          </p>
          <p>
           In conclusion, while Stephen King is definitely a nasty piece of work relevant to our work, he is not the culprit....THIS TIME! His involvement in the rape/death of Heather O’Rourke is impossible as he wasn’t even in California at the time of the Rocky Road incident.

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.
