<p>YingYangMom after posting in the thread points out that the man in the thread is singing the theme song to a kids show, and the part that was thought to be &quot;I\'m John Podes.....might just be the guy forgetting the lyrics and mumbling the melody.</p>
<p>This is the clip she used, but it\'s problematic.

<p>The audio is super noisy, so to try to isolate the audio to hear it clearly, you need to get a good audio tool to process it.  Specifically a tool with a &quot;Noise Gate&quot; filter is what you want.</p>
<p>You also want to try to find the original video because that will give you the least processed version of the audio.  (just by loading this video to the web, some processing has already occurred, but that shouldn\'t matter).</p>
<p>The video first appeared from worldcorpo or something like that.  That is probably the closest you can get to the original file.  However, that is a webm file.   I don\'t have a way of converting that so I looked and found on youtube an mp4 version here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7YBjGALEL0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7YBjGALEL0</a></p>
<p>Now, you need a good audio tool.  I\'m using a old version of Sound Forge.</p>
<p>You can find a free 30 day demo of Sound Forge here</p>
<p>The Studio version might be easier to use</p>
<p><a href="http://www.magix-audio.com/us/sound-forge/">http://www.magix-audio.com/us/sound-forge/</a></p>

<p>Sound Forge Audio Studio 10: 30-day free trial</p>
<p>You can open an mp4 directly in it.  And it will let you see the waveform of the audio.  The first thing I notice is the audio is &quot;clipping.&quot;  With all that screaming the audio signal overloads the input and it &quot;clips.&quot;  This means the top of audio waveform is a straight line.  In digital audio, once you hit the top, that information is lost and there will be some static/distortion because of this. And this is very hard, if not impossible to fix.  This is unfortunate, because looking at the peaks of a waveform can help you determine how many syllables in an audio clip.</p>
<p>There is a second background voice at the very beginning of this clip.   Sounds like a child in a normal voice.  I hear.....&quot;I think she said.&quot;     However, there also appears to be some sound effects happening at this point like a bell chime and a bird chirp (seriously.)</p>
<p>To separate the man\'s voice from the background, you can use a &quot;noise gate.&quot;  You can set the threshold of the &quot;gate.&quot;  For example, you may say only play sound that is above -20 decibels from peak and only sound above that level is let in the gate. I had to set the gate pretty high and it\'s only effective when there is no background screams.</p>
<p>You can try this yourself.  I\'ll post what I hear in a comment.</p>
<p>There\'s other tips and tricks, like you use EQ to only get the frequency of the mains for and drop the rest down, but that\'s a lot trickier to do.</p>
<p>if anyone has a better mp4.  I can try it.</p>',

              could be jon, but it's not Podes....or Podesta.   that line and another line he forgets the lyrics on and just sings syllables to the melody....do you know what I'm talking about?
             </p>
             <p>
              The second time.....he remember the word that rhymes but forgets the rest of that line and just replaces it with "something."

            This tool also lets you select a portion of the audio and loop it over and over, so you can really listen closely to it.  So I applied a noise gate and looped the audio

            I hear

            I'm just a kid who's four
           </p>
           <p>
            Each day I grow some more
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm don, the da dun  Sing               I think he just doesn't know the lyrics here.

            Each day I grow some more
I na na and something more
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT:  Using the original mp4 file doesn't change my conclusions.

            I also did an EQ when I boosted the lower frequencies from about 100 Khz to 700Khz to capture more of the man's deeper voice, while bringing down, all the frequencies above that to remove the kid's higher voice
Doing this I do hear more a J sound than a D sound In I'm Jon, the da dun  Sing
