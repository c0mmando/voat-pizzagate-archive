<p>How much responsibility did Rick Scott really take in Medicare fraud scandal? - <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/276048-how-much-responsibility-did-rick-scott-really-take-in-hca-medicare-fraud-scandal">https://floridapolitics.com/archives/276048-how-much-responsibility-did-rick-scott-really-take-in-hca-medicare-fraud-scandal</a> </p>

<p>Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. board members, including some who had helped Scott build the company into the nation’s largest and most profitable for-profit hospital corporation in the 1980s and ’90s, had painted him in news reports of the time as possibly being ignorant of the massive Medicare and Medicaid fraud allegations that federal officials were investigating in 1997. </p>

<p>Tenet Healthcare, which is a partner of the Clinton Foundation, has an exceptionally high infant mortality rate of 12.5% in Florida, almost 3x the national average. Instead of trying to improve their care, Tenet healthcare paid Florida Governor Rick Scott $200,000 in campaign contributions and Scott then repealed all of Florida\'s pediatric heart surgery standards. ..Since Tenet Healthcare may be illegally harvesting organs it stands to reason that removing these heart surgery standards would only make their job even easier by removing even a pretense of responsibility. </p>

            Bill Frist, as senate majority leader under g bush campaigned hard to do away with overtime for nurses, firemen and policemen...The dems. were right on this one and fought hard against it. The death rates would have sky rocketed for hospital deaths if the republicans had gotten their way. Working 2 shifts is hard enough giving medicines , but knowing you won't get paid would have made it harder. The plan was to give a day off at the hospital's discretion would have made for some mad nurses....and dead patients. Firemen and policemen, cannot imagine.

            Dyncorp A-Go-Go
           </p>
           <p>
            For an example of how just one transgression can lead to endless bad publicity consider the movie titled The Whistleblower  that was released earlier this year. To summarize the plot, in Bosnia in 1999, Kathryn Bolkovac, a U.S. policewoman served as a U.N. peacekeeper. Her post was with the International Police Task Force which was arranged by DynCorp Aerospace.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was assigned to run the IPTF office that investigates sex trafficking, domestic abuse and sexual assault. She ultimately alleges that peacekeepers, U.N. workers and international police are visiting brothels and facilitating sex trafficking by forging documents and aiding the illegal transport of woman into Bosnia. DynCorp responds by firing Bolkovac, who returns to the U.S. and files a wrongful termination case. She wins the suit but says she’s still blacklisted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Put bluntly, DynCorp was involved in a sex slavery scandal in Bosnia in 1999, with its employees accused of rape and the buying and selling of girls as young as 12. Dyncorp, hired to perform police duties for the UN and aircraft maintenance for the US Army, were implicated in prostituting the children, whereas the company’s Bosnia site supervisor filmed himself raping two women. A number of employees were transferred out of the country, but with no legal consequences for them.

On November 2005, Keith Allen is appointed the principal liquidator of DynCorp Aerospace Operations UK LTD and Colombian citizens are granted the authority to finalize “labor contracts for employees of this branch.” On this date, the latest registration also appears with the names of Curtis Adams and Robert Knepper to pay taxes to different Colombian authorities.

              A United Nations study reported that elements within the Colombian security forces, which have been strengthened due to Plan Colombia and U.S. aid, do continue to maintain intimate relationships with right-wing death squads, help organize paramilitary forces, and either participate in abuses and massacres directly or, as it is usually argued to be more often the case, deliberately fail to take action to prevent them. One of the larger examples of this behavior was the 2008 False Positives Scandal, in which the Colombian military murdered approximately 1,400 innocent civilians in order to make false claims that these cadavers were Farc soldiers.

              The son of a Fort Worth grocer and a J. C. Penney sales clerk, Richard Rainwater got his start at 26, when Sid Bass stole him away from Goldman Sachs to manage the Bass family portfolio. Rainwater’s particular genius—buying troubled companies in faltering industries, installing new management, and turning huge profits—was most famously on display in 1984, when
              <strong>
               he and Sid invested $478 million in the then-floundering Walt Disney Company, a deal that reaped billions
              </strong>
              . Rainwater set up his own shop two years later and became a kingmaker, putting together the 1989 deal that allowed
              <strong>
               George W. Bush to buy a stake in the Texas Rangers and generating most of the future president’s personal wealth.
              </strong>
              Rainwater has largely retreated from view since 2009, when he was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy—a rare, incurable, degenerative brain disease.

              Slim does not appear to be the only person tied to the Times that has given money to the Clintons. Also on the Clinton Foundation list of donors are James A. Kohlberg and Mark Thompson. Kohlberg contributed between $50,001 and $100,000, and Thompson contributed between $10,001 and $25,000.

              James A. Kohlberg is the name of a member of the New York Times’ board of directors, and Mark Thompson is the name of the president and CEO of the New York Times Company.

            , I can't for the life of me see how Markle and HCA are related to pizzagate based on what you've included here. HCA buying several facilities from Tenet is does not really connect HCA to Tenet, unless you can show it was some kind of cozy insider deal. Also, what does Markle's healthcare have to do with abuse of kids by the global elite? What's the pizzagate thesis here?

              Liverpool leads new £4.7m Zika vaccine project

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The University of Liverpool is leading on a major new collaborative project to develop a Zika virus vaccine that is suitable for use in pregnancy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Supported by a £4.7million award from Department of Health and Social Care, managed by Innovate UK, the new project aims to take two new vaccine candidates through to a clinical trial in humans within the next three years.
             </p>
             <p>
              In collaboration with the University of Manchester, Public Health England and industry, the researchers plan to confirm the safety of two new vaccine candidates, based on a safe derivative of a pre-existing smallpox vaccine, before moving into Phase 1a first-in-human studies at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital’s Clinical Research Unit.
             </p>
             <p>
              The work builds upon initial vaccine development research funded through the UK’s Zika Rapid Response Initiative in 2016, which identified the two potential vaccine candidates and immunological studies undertaken at the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections at the University of Liverpool.

            <p>
             I did some more digging into DynCorp and the affiliates of RTI Surgical. One of the things I had learned before was DynCorp likes to have their Florida locations next to places where they can drop off bones and organs. I had first noticed this trend that there was a RTI Donor Services location very close by DynCorp in Melbourne, Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another big find. In West Palm Beach Florida, Bioflorida which encompasses such businesses as RTI Surgical and Tavistock (type in Palm Beach in the ctrl-f to find on the page) is located at the zip code 33401 with Dyncorp located at 33404.

as the genetic memory of the horrific medical procedures become more 
ingrained into the family’s genetic makeup. In the 1950’s, a genetic 
bloodline study was started by the NSA based at Harwell Laboratories to 
find suitable candidates, especially children, to be used in Project 
Mannequin.

              The Harwell Space Cluster is the gateway to the UK space sector and benefits from the presence of leading public space organisations, including the European Space Agency, RAL Space, Satellite Applications Catapult and UK Space Agency. Harwell is also home to the Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council, with over £2 billion of infrastructure for both public and private research and development.
             </p>
             <p>
              Global space companies such as Airbus Defence &amp; Space, Lockheed Martin and Thales Alenia Space have established a presence at Harwell, with activities ranging from the design of propulsion subsystems to satellite navigation systems. These are joined by a range of SMEs from start-ups in the European Space Agency Business Incubation Centre to rapidly growing companies such as Oxford Space Systems, Deimos Space UK, Rezatec and Neptec.

              Neo’s key product is called Neo4j, and it is used by a pretty diverse range of customers. They include Walmart (to figure out what people might like to buy); banks and government organisations (to detect fraud and criminal activity); and the science community (NASA); and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The ICIJ notably used it to parse and make sense of the Panama Papers, a trove of documents that implicates a wave of corruption among politicans, business people and their offshore banking accounts.

             <p>
              The Series D comes from new investor, London-based Greenbridge Partners, along with several of Neo Technologies’ existing backers, also out of Europe: Creandum, Sunstone and Fidelity’s Eight Roads Ventures. The funding, coming almost two years after its Series C, takes the total raised by Neo to $80 million.

              Headquartered in San Mateo, Neo Technology  actually got its start as a smaller project within a content management startup out of Malmo, Sweden.. Other startups in the same space include Datastax and Dgraph.

Now I don't know him, but the next thing I know, he's like, "She's such a beautiful girl." Have no idea what he's talking about so I turn. And he repeats it. I'm like, "Who's beautiful?" "Her," he says nodding his head towards the mess of tabloids on the rack in front of us. Now there's fifteen different magazines that have pictures of different personalities, but the one directly ahead .... at eye level ... yup, it's the skanks Kate Middleton and Markle. I had that sinking feeling, but responded, "I have no idea who you mean." He nods again and I repeat what I said. He finally points at ... the God awful Meghan Markle. I'm like, "Dude, don't get into fantasies. She's a nasty woman and there are better choices out there to hang a dream on." I then went into how Photoshopped the image was and about her blog where she bragged about putting out to get jobs. He gave me an expression equivalent to telling a kid there's no Santa Claus.

            But I was supposed to agree because that's the narrative being pushed. When you're not with the program, it breaks down the indoctrination and they're forced into thinking which is uncomfortable. It's why they probably stay in one herd. So they don't get startled into thought.

            They're not used to it.

             Excellent lol!!! I like the way you told him how it is. I have not heard about Markles blog where she bragged about sleeping with men for jobs. I had heard she was a yacht girl aka prostitute for the higher ups but would you mind talking more about her blog? Wow how embarrassing for her, no I’m not a fan she’s weird and so is her best friend Jessica Mulroney who married into a political family. Thanks!

               Wow thanks it’s hard to believe coming from the Sun uk paper but things definitely fit for it being her writing it. Amazing how fame hungry she was and is. Sad and pathetic actually. So many weird things about her and the baby being a home birth then it’s born at a hospital and Harry not knowing what to say during the statement he gave after the birth. These people are just bizarre.

                And they're again taking the privilege and honor of giving birth away from women and reducing it to a paid chore. Vaccum the rugs! Make me some tea! Have a child for us!

              Probably why celebrities stayed away from Meghan's bridal shower in NY too. Not many speaking out about massive pedaphilia in hollywood but they know.... Of course Gayle King is up to her eyeballs in it. ...Serena Williams, who knows.
