            I was hoping for some comparisons to drug, theft, petty crimes etc. It would be highly suspect if Pedos got the lightest treatment.

            But are these the elite? Or are they doing this for regular citizens as well? What does it mean to have your jail sentence suspended, does anyone know? Do they just drop the sentence for no reason??

             My understanding is that a jail sentence is suspended if the perpetrator plea bargains or has already served most of the sentence. Sex Offenders have to register with authorities for the rest of their lives which some feel is enough of a sentence but not all are doing this. Sex Offender in each state are listed and accessible to the public through the state police office.
