<p><strong>Wonderful news. Although I think the sentence isn\'t harsh enough, Harvey Rapist Weinstein has just been sentenced to 23 years in prison.</strong></p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&quot;Weinstein, who has been accused of violating scores of women, was convicted last month of raping a once-aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on former TV and film production assistant Mimi Haleyi at his apartment in 2006. He faced a maximum of 29 years in prison.</p>
<p>“It takes a very special kind of evil to exploit connections to leverage rape,” said the 2013 rape accuser.</p>
<p>“Rape is not just one moment of penetration. It is forever,” added the woman, who recalled a moment during the trial when she left the witness stand in tears and then could be heard screaming from an adjacent room.</p>
<p>“The day my screams were heard from the witness room was the day my voice came back to its full power,” she said.</p>
<p>Asked later about her reaction after the sentence, she wiped her eyes, raised her arm and nodded her head.</p>
<p>The Associated Press has a policy of not naming people who have been sexually assaulted without their consent. It is withholding the rape accuser\'s name because it is not clear whether she wishes to be identified.</p>
<p>Weinstein, who has maintained that any sexual any sexual activity was consensual, showed no visible reaction to the sentence. Beforehand, he broke his courtroom silence with a rambling plea for mercy in which he said his “empathy has grown” since his downfall.</p>
<p>He told the court he felt “remorse for this situation” but said he was perplexed by the case and the #MeToo climate in which it unfolded. “Thousands of men are losing due process. I’m worried about this country,” he said, arguing that men are being accused of “things that none of us understood.”</p>
<p>“I’m totally confused. I think men are confused about these issues,” he said in a calm but creaking voice, adding that he had fond memories of his accusers.</p>
<p>Looking back during the trial at emails they exchanged, he said, he thought they had a good friendship: “I had wonderful times with these people.&quot;</p>
<p>Just as jury selection was about to get under way in January, Weinstein was charged in California with raping a woman at a Los Angeles hotel on Feb. 18, 2013, after pushing his way inside her room, and sexually assaulting a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel suite the next night.</p>
<p>Weinstein could get up to 28 years in prison on charges of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery in the California case. Authorities have not said when he would go there to face those charges.</p>
<p>Three more sexual assault cases under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department and Beverly Hills’ police could mean that he’ll face additional charges. No details have been provided on these cases.&quot;</p>',

            Well,many of you may disagree but Paul Haggis is next and I personally don't believe it is Scientology behind his charges. I know personally of women that were stalked by him and so far, no link between the women accusing Haggis had any dealings with that crazy cult Scientology. Haggis tried to countersue the women for defamation of character but the New York judge threw that out. Haggis is going to have a hard time now,with the Weinstein case setting a precedent.Haggis is also a thief and those in the know understand that he had a habit of taking other people's scripts and putting his name on them. Haggis used the Scientoloy goon squad to clean up his messes and I thin they got fed up with that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am very excited about this Weinstein decision and although it isn't dealing with pedophilia it does disclose what Hollywood scumbags do and the fact that they hire companies  like Black Cube to terrorize it's victims, whether that be women who came forward about being raped or children that have spoken out as adults or even writers that have had intellectual property theft and ended up gang stalked and destroyed. Black Cube,for those that don't know,is a private investigation agency made up of 'ex' MOSSAD agents whose job it is to follow and harass,death threaten and plant any and all kinds of dirt on their victims so as to discredit them.Many victims end up committing suicide. Bring on the pedophiles and expose their tactics of destroying their credibility.

              I surely hope they are needing cover. Did they perhaps flee the country for another reason? Yes and then they hide in quarantine. Didn’t we hear recently that Hanks will be next?  Can’t wait.

            This moron said the sex was consensual. Not on their part. No. But on his. He says he doesn’t understand.

            Just because you want it Harvey doesn’t mean you can take it. You may have consented but they did not.

             Yup. The double digit rape stories ive read against him... Are violent and horrifying.  I dont believe for second he was confused. I do, however, believe he is evil.

              These sickos want us to believe they are weak and frail when that is far from the truth. Power is what it’s all about. Now he will have none. I am hoping.

             Get fucked... Care to explain? YES- this is not enough. YET- i see progress. After HATING Woody Allen for decades and no one listening to me, now he's nearly blacklisted. Nickelodeon's former Dan Schneider? No, he's not locked up and is still rich. YET, with our work here, we Finally saw his permanent removal from Nickelodeon. People say the MeToo movement was a cover-up or psyop whatever, and i will continue to vehemently disagree. We have seen major progress since MeToo began. And i believe- no...i KNOW... There is more coming. I'm not saying it's enough or happening fast enough. Again, ive gone 20 years abhoring and speaking out against Polanski and Woody Allen, watching it fall upon deaf ears. In the last year or 2, I've seen the most progress and awareness-building I've witnessed in my lifetime.
