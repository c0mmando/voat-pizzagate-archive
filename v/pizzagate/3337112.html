<p>Hello and welcome to this edition of SPOTLIGHT ON. Today it’s on Debbie Nathan, a woman who has taken the entire subject of psychology, ritual abuse, and children speaking for themselves on by the power she has granted herself. It has to be that because she has absolutely no credentials to be speaking on anything except maybe being a globalist whore. Here’s her bio taken from the above Wikipedia link: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nathan was born in 1950 into a Jewish family in Houston, Texas. She received her B.A. from Temple University in 1972, after first attending Shimer College, a very small Great Books college in Illinois.[7] She went on to receive a master\'s degree in linguistics from the University of Texas El Paso.</p>
<p>Nathan taught English as a second language at Brooklyn College, then moved to Chicago in 1980, where she began her journalism career at the Chicago Reader. She returned to El Paso in 1984 to work for the El Paso Times, then became a freelance journalist. In 1998, she took a job writing for the San Antonio Current, then moved to New York City in 2000.[8] Nathan is a board member for the National Center for Reason and Justice, non-profit organization that aids people likely to have been falsely accused and/or convicted of harming children.</p>

<p>Do you see any advanced degrees in behavioral psychology, children\'s development, family dynamics. No BS, MS, PhD, PsyD degrees‎, nonetheless, she\'s thrown herself in there as an authority. Believe that was Pelosi\'s definition of a Wrap-Up Smear. Tell a lie, have an authority give it credibility, and you something everyone will be repeating. Well, apparently, Ms. Nathan provided that credibility for being a leftist, raving lunatic feminist. </p>
<p>Before I get underway, I want to say that I believe we\'ve veered off the very effective methodology of turning spotlights on those involved in supporting the elite cabal. It happened wonderfully when applied to James Alefantis and his squad (that\'s the new buzzword for posse), and I would like to see more of it done. This is the resurrection of old school pizzagate and Debbie, my girl, you\'re tagged \'\'it\'\' for today. It’s in shining lights on people we make the rats scatter. We can also make new connections by seeing who they support and who supports them. </p>
<p>I came across Ms. Nathan\'s name when doing research on another subject. I came across an article on Michael Aquino and the nefarious Presidio Day Care Scandal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FALSE ARGUMENTS</p>
<p>The subject of ritual cult abuse of children is so loathsome and provocative that it is at risk of being regarded only in extremes. Those drawn into believing that there is such a thing become fascinated and terrified by its limitless implications while those who remain skeptical seem determined to quash and disqualify any evidence that it might exist. ... </p>
<p>Having met Ms. Johnson in February, 1984, I am convinced of the first option. Judy Johnson was quite sane and emotionally contained even as she described the improbable complaints of her child “He doesn’t like to talk about being buried alive or about large animals or that he was sodomized by a lion”. (3) Such complaints were unheard of in 1984, but they made more sense as older, less credulous children in the Netherlands (1987), England (1988) and North Carolina (1989) made quite independent observations that the wild animals had zippers on their costumes. … </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the above example of how the human mind can interpret what a child says given, it then recites physical evidence of the McMartin case including the excavation of those tunnels. He also says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point in the vastly larger, festering issue of ritual abuse, there is little hope of hard evidence for anything, especially for specific, ultimately trivial issues of individual criminal culpability. Frank Fuster’s conviction served best to excite more ingenious efforts toward blaming the victims. In the absence of a published tunnel report, the last word in print remains with award-winning Debbie Nathan:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that point, I went looking for this Debbie Nathan. It\'s how I discovered she\'d written an article published by the Village Voice and whose traces appeared to have vanished. She complains that it\'s a censoring conspiracy, but is it more likely that in light of more evidence, it was taken down so that it couldn\'t be hacked apart? But through perseverance, here it is, posted on the National Center for Reason and Justice\'s site: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ncrj.org/get-informed-2/the-ritual-sex-abuse-hoax/">https://ncrj.org/get-informed-2/the-ritual-sex-abuse-hoax/</a>

<p>Irrationality pervaded the McMartin case from the beginning. The first allegation came from a woman alter diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. After Judy Johnson noticed one day in 1983 that her two-year-old son’s bottom was red, she told police he said something about a man named Ray at his nursery school. In the next few weeks, Johnson accused 25-year-old Buckey of donning a mask and sodomizing her child while sticking his head in a toilet; of wearing a cape while taping the boy’s mouth, hands, and eyes; and of sticking an air tube in his rectum. She also said Ray made the child ride naked on a horse and molested him while dressed as a cop, fireman, clown, and Santa Claus. Later, she claimed that the McMartin teachers, including Ray’s 57-year-old mother, Peggy, jabbed a scissors into the boy’s eyes and staples in his ears, nipples, and tongue; that Ray put her son’s finger into a goat’s anus; and that Peggy killed a baby and made the boy drink the blood. She also told the D.A.’s office than an AWOL marine and three models in a health club had raped her son, and that the family dog was sodomized as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did everything in the above happen as stated? I\'m not sure, but I\'ll bet it\'s not off the mark by a lot. A lot of this has been stated by other children who were proven to be victims of SRA, but Ms. Nathan knows it\'s all hysteria. </p>
<p>I went to her Twitter account and found this: </p>

<p>Yes, Baphomet needs protecting from victimization. No doubt. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Debbie Nathan has also debunked multiple personalities vis a vis her book Sybil and that pornography is  harmful: </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Nathan">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Nathan</a></p>
<p>Pornography, published in 2007, is written as a concise &quot;guidebook&quot; on the subject of pornography.[15] A Canadian reviewer described the writing as &quot;frank and cool&quot;, and made note of Nathan\'s assertion that no connection has been established between the use of pornography and criminal behavior, as well as her focus on the &quot;connection between porn and shame&quot; to define pornography</p>
<p>Yes, even though Ted Bundy attested to it being an integral part of what made him want to rape and kill and Elizabeth Smart’s testimony that: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/elizabeth-smart-her-captivity-pornography-made-my-living-hell-worse-n635066">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/elizabeth-smart-her-captivity-pornography-made-my-living-hell-worse-n635066</a></p>
<p>\'Pornography Made My Living Hell Worse\'</p>
<p>Ms. Nathan knows better. Or perhaps she’s the type of feminist who feels women should suffer more? Ms. Nathan is quoted on numerous sites and is featured whenever a Satanic debunking takes place. Here’s a site that I’m sure you’ll find amusing. </p>
<p><a href="http://theisticsatanism.com/asp/intro.html">http://theisticsatanism.com/asp/intro.html</a></p>
<p>This one lists five key points to debunking Satanism. Number 2 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no evidence of a generations-old worldwide Satanic conspiracy. And the most influential and seminal Christian books alleging such a conspiracy, such as The Satan-Seller by Mike Warnke, have been shown to be outright frauds.</p>

           Here is one of Nathan’s bizarre tweets. I’ll see if anything about this case is on the web:

           Goddamn, yeah! I believe I did find. Quite a story. Just about every story found debunked it, but what's this? After a few years, there are two arrests for a story that isn't true?

           Debbie Nathan has also debunked multiple personalities vis a vis her book Sybil and that pornography is  harmful:

          <p>
           Pornography, published in 2007, is written as a concise "guidebook" on the subject of pornography.[15] A Canadian reviewer described the writing as "frank and cool", and made note of Nathan's assertion that no connection has been established between the use of pornography and criminal behavior, as well as her focus on the "connection between porn and shame" to define pornography

           Yes, even though Ted Bundy attested to it being an integral part of what made him want to rape and kill and Elizabeth Smart’s testimony that:

           Ms. Nathan knows better. Or perhaps she’s the type of feminist who feels women should suffer more? Ms. Nathan is quoted on numerous sites and is featured whenever a Satanic debunking takes place. Here’s a site that I’m sure you’ll find amusing.

           This one lists five key points to debunking Satanism. Number 2 is:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            There is no evidence of a generations-old worldwide Satanic conspiracy. And the most influential and seminal Christian books alleging such a conspiracy, such as The Satan-Seller by Mike Warnke, have been shown to be outright frauds.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Really? Then I guess we can all pack our bags and go home.

            in a survey of 2,709 members of the American Psychological Association, it was found that 30 percent of these professionals had seen cases of ritual or religion-related abuse (Bottoms, Shaver &amp; Goodman, 1991). Of those psychologists who have seen cases of ritual abuse, 93 percent believed that the reported harm took place and 93 percent believed that the alleged ritualism occurred.

             To insist all claims are based on hysteria does a real disservice to victims. If I had to guess, I'd say the above is just the tip of the iceberg. I keep going back to that one case where the video was found in a parking lot. It turned out the video was taken about eight years ago and that the girl was now ten and didn't remember anything that had happened to her at two. The mother knew nothing about it because the man that sexually molested that baby was her boyfriend and used to babysit. Nobody would have known anything and, yet, the NYPD said it was the worst case of child abuse they'd ever seen. Hardened detective were in tears after watching it. But I suppose it was from hysteria.

               Which case? The Presidio? Here's a link to a NYT article that gives an overview.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190123234535/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/us/army-will-close-child-care-center.html">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               The McMartin link is this one:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial">
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Pretty much any overview you find will be debunking both and calling out kids as liars. But the physical evidence of the Presidio case is astonishing and the parents were smeared and the kids lying to please adults. One caseworker had her life ruined by going after Aquino and refusing to back down. I don't know what they used on her, but she did crack, but never faltered in her determination to see Aquino pay for what he did.

            If we no longer use Satanic in the lead in then it will cover MKUltra.

            They both use Sadistic Programming to enslave individuals. A mortal master who controls broken minds and the body attached. Not necessarily ritualistic 100% of the time. In fact the ritual is few and far between. Most of the programming is one on one torture.

             The ritual is very much alive in the symbology. Everyone uses those symbols and CRAP! I just remembered something I left out of the post ... an important something!

             Thanks for reminding me ... and, yeah, torture can be a ritual. Take the number of times you see these MK Ultra Sex Dolls climbing in the tub and taking a bath at the beginning of their video.

              Symbology is what glazes the eyes of the normies. The goal is to impress the almost awoke clueless, not you or I.

              Posting it here is like group masturbation. Why pervert the information flow. To make it exclusive? Defeats the purpose of intelligent memes.

               If you take the way Epstein groomed these children, you'll see it was a ritual to him. Very similar approaches with variances where needed. In other words, some were more compliant, submissive or dominating and the ritual would change, but it was a ritual.

                A ritual requires a group. Think of it as a once every full Moon thing for the first visit. It takes months, if not years to get there. That's a one on one thing and is the real horror. Hell, after a few months death would be a mercy. Some less intelligent beings can break in less than a week, if not a day or two. Think mentally slow.

                 No, a ritual requires a ritual. Like ritual magic. You can be alone and follow the well-worn path ... or start a new path.

                <p>
                 Rituals are formalized behavior. Or steps to get you somewhere. A ritual can be a whole bunch of things and ritual satanic abuse is real.

             Ritual abuse is real and you don't have to look any further than the court documents surrounding the New Mexico compound/terrorist training camp.

             This is a legitimate post. Spamming would be if Debbie Nathan's PR firm hired useful idiots to mock open forums to deflect and ridicule the messenger.
