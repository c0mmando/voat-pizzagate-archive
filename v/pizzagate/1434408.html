            Here's the
            <strong>
             short explanation
            </strong>
            : Child exploitation, sexually and mortally as a means of leverage, a business, recreational pursuit and satanic occult adherence - all at the highest levels of governance in our society. It is protected. It is common-place. There is some evidence that it's not just children, but also women. #pizzagate came from the connection between John Podesta and and pizza shop owner, James Alefantis. From there...things really started moving. Keep in mind, this is not just about this scummy pizza shop owner, ironically one of the 50 most influential in DC, but is about the much larger and corrupt structure. Many of us believe and the conclusion can reasonably be drawn the the CF is, for at least one objective, an instrument to obtain children for these purposes as it typically sets up shop (orphanages and schools) for gaining access to children of whom no one is really aware of or looking out for.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first thing I would tell you is to
            <strong>
             follow the money
            </strong>
            . I know that seems elementary, but that's the key. So much of the stuff is so very tempting to dig into, and easier because people like to wear their sexual adventure on their sleeves apparently, but the money trail is really where the connections are drawn and that is rarely just out in the open. What you've seen and heard exposed is the surface albeit a repugnant part of it.

            </strong>
            on the old reddit page - very good for some rational perspective, motivation and if anything a good reminder that there really is something to all this:

             not 100% objective

            and jumps to some conclusions,

            There are a number of other things around that you can find. Be sure to read the sticky post here which was allegedly came from an FBI leaker "FBIAnon", which many of us now believe to be true as it started back in July and much of which has turned out to be true. Keep in  mind that FBIAnon stated that few would really be able to handle the depravity and depth of the darkness at the bottom of these pits, so just be prepared to be affected in some way...

            visual map, not to sure about this one, but gives an idea of the scale of investigation needing to be done. You can easily see how the FBI and a team of 50-100, even 500-1000 could get overwhelmed with this pretty easily:

            FYI, the major "news" outlets have posted hit-pieces on #pizzagate providing literally 0 evidence refuting the above, other than James Alefantis say "it's crazy". So, yeah, not worth mentioning here. If you want to find them, you can just google it.

             Thank you very much for this information. I will certainly be jumping into this when I have an afternoon to spare, and attempt to objectively absorb it as best I can.

             I asked this question in reply to another comment on the thread; Do you think there would be a way by which we might construct the actual skeleton of a proper investigation on this site? I firmly believe that most people who visit this site are so overloaded with information that the scope of it all becomes lost on them, which probably prevents us from getting the man power we need to really kick things into high gear; myself being an example of one such a person initially.

              I'm sure that there is one that would do basically that...but, the best one that I can just pull out of back side is that one that I pasted above at:

              BUT, it might be a good exercise to reproduce it here...I'll think about doing it. There's just so much information and it comes so quickly that it's hard to keep up.

               I think a reproduction of a timeline is certainly in order here if we're to assume the label as the official nexus of pizzagate investigation. As for the information being released at such speed, I think be that as it may, leaving it outside of "official"(and I use that word loosely to fit the context here) investigative timelines is a positive thing as the info has more exposure to criticism. I feel that a comprehensive compilation of evidence is a must if the investigation is to carry forward. I think its a matter of making sure the community has faith in the person's in charge of said compilation. The post or archive (or whatever form it comes in) should obviously then be stickied and modified as new and vetted exhibits are brought to light. I think we should really take this to the mods. Assuming it hasn't been done already(then again, even if it has, we should press the issue).

            Look, this thing has become a tangled mess. We have pedocrats.com site but even that is just an organized compilation of the strongest threads which contain good evidence. The strength of this investigation to researchers has been the unveiling of it. You see we tracked Wikileaks closely with baited breath for every release. We saw these code words being used. Then we got the HUGE spirit cooking email and that set off a firestorm. Then we looked deeper into Podesta and unearthed Comet Pizza. People kept pulling on the rope and it has all burst out in a near cacophony of circumstantial evidence. I, for one, would like to take it on as a trial lawyer by offering up exhibits in sequence to build the case. We desperately need someone to do that. Right now we have a couple of great researchers like pleadingtheyiff putting together solid threads and a community of evidence collectors who are tossing items onto the carpet. There a few mods here and practically zero organization for FAQs, stickies, wikis, sidebars, tags and the like. There are plenty of posts and articles to go through. I myself have posted what I believe are two solid articles worth looking at. I also recommend this contributors YouTube channel and this particular video which helps contextualize and summarize:

             https://youtu.be/Z4OP--ZXOjc
            </a>
            We need help with this issue. We need web developers, lawyers, journalists and researchers for sure. But mostly we need an editorial board above that to help collate and present into a digestible format. I realize that this is just more talk and not what you're looking for, but for the time being you are going to have to dig. Watch that video and tab through the pages here, you'll find something.

             Yeah as I have come to understand, the investigation so far has been a lot of shock and awe, but not much of any actual compiling is taking place in an organized manner; at least from what I can tell. Is there any way we can take action on this? Is there a way to create a straw poll by which we can-as a community, vote for a board of oversight pertaining to an "Official" timeline of sorts? I would be interested to see what the mods may think of this, though I'm sure they're absolutely inundated with messages or calls to action.

              I don't know. I'm new to this forum shit and voat is much worse than Reddit in terms of response, mods and functionality. Did you watch that video? I thought it broke down the sequence quite well. Also, apparently Wikileaks approached us and offered us a research infrastructure. Nobody here wants to use it because they believe that Wikileaks is compromised. However, I said we can learn from the structure they have laid out. The title will take you to Wikileaks page and here is the thread with people freaking out :

               Yes I did. I also read a few articles that have been linked to me since I posted this. All seemed quite objective, and certainly what I was looking for; as opposed to the more pitchfork-y type of stuff. I even took a pass over the comments to find some dissenting opinions and tried to objectively absorb them. The conclusion I've come to thus far is while we do have boatloads of circumstantial evidence, there are no real slam dunk's that seem actionable in a legal sense OUTSIDE of the money trails, which prove only cohesion rather then collusion (though the evidence, circumstantial as it may be-is VERY compelling.)

                For me the connections to the power structure and the money trails are quite compelling for a criminal ring. Quite an extraordinary achievement for a pizza joint.

                 Yeah no kidding. As I said extremely compelling stuff. Not having a law degree though I suppose does prohibit me from speculating outside of saying that in my humble opinion, as it stands now; nothing is yet concrete or actionable in a court of law. Again we have a lot of cohesion, without much evidenced collusion.

                   Ahh, excellent. I think this is in the right direction as far as what I was looking for. As far as what you linked me before that in regards to the menu; that guy seems to be making some extraordinary claims. Unfortunately I fail to understand how any of what he is saying is more then conjecture. It would seem he is divulging a sting operation he was involved in with a foreign intelligence? I feel like I am missing a lot of context again with this one. If you know the framework of whats being suggested there I'd love to hear a coles' notes explanation.

                    I think that was the coles notes version. Did you see the image, the so-called menu? If it were all to come crumbling down, then this perhaps is the type of internal documentation that would be found.
