           <p>
            You know that those two pieces of evidence are not about "James Alefantis' Ties To The CIA" right?
They are about a children's performer - a man who did a show/s at CPP.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not correctly tied together -  just because he did a show at CPP only very tenuously ties him to James Alefantis.  It in no way proves a James Alefantis tie to CIA.  Please change and make it accurate.
