<p>Hello you all. It\'s been a while since I last posted. I have been in quite some turmoil at the beginning of this year, after the events endured and uncovered back in late 2017. Case in point, in 2017 I ended up at an organization where I uncovered presence of Satanic school of thought, leading up to the identification of two Talmud Kabbalist Satanists along with allies. </p>
<p><strong>This at the same time is the link to Pizzagate NL, for this addresses a covert inventory system of body parts of the youth in our nation</strong> It\'s a continuation of this post: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2277083">Reallife Zionist-Satanist Encounter + International Heads-Up on Healthcare IT</a></p>
<p>After I left them, I went through a reasonably difficult time where I was harassed by various kinds of means, including EM assaults that resulted in spontaneous bleedings. At the same time, my finance was also being drained by not having a job. I had been on the edge and through micro management of my finances, while searching for a job, I managed to get a new job. This was in the beginning of March 2018. I have been keeping you posted about various events and witnessing over the first few months of 2018, and told about the new location where I would get to work. That\'s where we start this continuation. Ultimately this whole thing is bigger than just Pizzagate. It is about a malevolent cult, that has hobbies like what pizza gate is about, but that\'s not the only interest the have. Their interest is world conquestt, through the various false flags that we know about. And that is exactly what got going my involvement with these malevolently oriented people. But first, I will chronologically start off where I left the updates. Further more, this essay is split up in a number of chapters, since it\'s so much it won\'t fit a single post. I numbered them so you can read it all in a chronological order.</p>
<p><strong>2. Current Job</strong></p>
<p>In April 2018 I got this new job. A recruiter was able to place me somewhwere where the job description seemed to match really wel. One caveat: It was some 27 miles away from my house and suffers a lot of traffic jams at the end of the work day, and even at the start of the day. All in all, I spend 2.5 up to 3 hours traveling per day, which is up to 15 hours a week, 60 hours a month. This is one of the reasons why I have not been posting a lot around here. I basically have no time to do anything else but to sleep, eat, work, eat and go back to sleep after an hour of unwinding and reading some stuff. It is exceedingly hard to keep up to date on things.</p>
<p>The recruiter didn\'t work against me as in, not willing to find a job for me. Instead, I noted, the recruiter was adamant about convincing me to take this job while not offering any jobs very close to my location. Since I had no choice I took it. The other option was to go financially bust and loose my house. I already got into mortgage additional debt. So, I went along with it.</p>
<p>Well. It didn\'t last no more than 2 days before words were said that were aimed at me. It may sound strange, but we\'re dealing here with a nation wide platform that talks with one another. More on this later. Basically, the mental harassement continued at this company. Not by all employees. I can tell exactly who are of the cult and who are not. Those who are, are the ones placing tactical remarks that they know of they will land with me. If you have read anything about targeted individuals, well, it\'s that stuff. Amongst those remarks (I often, at times, can hear them talk in the rooms next by with doors open) they were referencing this Mariel H. that I have described in part one of this essay. It\'s black-ball profiling that they commit. Those connected to this malevolent network black-ball profile me to unsuspect employees. And as such, they at times referred to this Mariel H. and tried to claim I was a \'Haribo\' that just wanted to fuck. More on this later.</p>
<p>In any case, I\'m enduring the mental harassement simply because I have no choice. Another anomaly happening is, that, since working there for about one and half a week, I began to experience something strange that I once experienced before. Unnatural excitation. You may wonder.. what? Yes. Unnatural sexual excitation. With no apparent reasoning, I experienced a burning sensation inside the head of my penis that lingered about large parts throughout the working day. Mentally, I can block the sense of arousment and mute it and not be mentally disturbed and distracted. However, it\'s quite annoying. And like said, there\'s no apparent reason. No naked women about attempting to seduce or whatsoever. I simply focused on work. I have not had this anywhere before. And the thing was, in the evening at home it was gone. It only manifested during the working day. The burn is similar (males will know) to what one feels when one takes a pee just after ejaculation, leaving a burning sense. Since I mentally disgarded the excitation there was very few to no precum building up. This continued for a number of weeks, and then it was gone for a week or two. Now I endure it not so much any more. Either my mentals and or biophysics have adapted on fending it off. This by no means has been natural. I\'ve never been walking around with this ever before, whether there were males and females around or not. </p>
<p>However, it added to the malevolent gossip. I was supposedly a &quot;jelly bean&quot;, a refernce to being horny, which apparently they, in the gossip channels used to bolster the black-ball profile of a \'Haribo\' with libido that wants to just fuck. Another goal of this is to mentally disrupt me so that I would slack on my mental work, which is coding software, to the point where they can state &quot;he performs like crap, he\'s not extremely capable at all!&quot;. But I\'m disappointing them there; I keep mentally focussed and get complex stuff done. Austrian customers of the product will be happy with me. Also this is targeted individual stuff. </p>
<p>At present day, it\'s not nearly bothering me as much, however, the mental harassement and the throwing around refence remarks persists, though this happens mostly behind my back. Another interesting thing is, that very recently the two CEOs got a new lease car at the same time. Of this one guy, the license plate was: <strong>ST-666-B</strong> . Seriously. Now what is the chance, given my situation, that a guy at the company I work at, ends up with such license plate? In any case, it was used to ridicule Satanism for a day and by extension, me. You have to keep in mind these are higher level employees that take part in circles of CEOs and so on. I don\'t think the owner had the license plate be customly assigned. However, it\'s likely that members of the national network of covert Satanists assigned it in order to enable this ridicule. Secondly, this is an illegal license plate, our RDW does not give out plates with offending letter combinations and or numbers.</p>
<p>Further more, I have made a number of sound recordings with my phone throughout working days and indeed logged actual proof of them talking about me with bad taste remarks, including their code-words (like the \'Haribo\') and up an including them referencing this Mariel H., which in their circles, is called \'Deborah\'. Which of the two is a pseudonym, I don\'t know. But I\'m not too far off when I say, based on the profile of this Mariel H., that \'Deborah\' is her mistress elite escort name. The twitter profile (with the leather) is suggestive of that. And secondly, input from the STN (Syntethic Telepathic Network) affirms her to be that (and more).</p>
<p>Anyways, I\'m just taking it as it comes, fending off physical anomalies and making myself immune mentally to the harassement while just performing my work. I still work there as needed. And while I act indifferent and \'light\' at times, I know what\'s surrounding me. So to those on the good side that might keep an eye out: No, I\'ve not been subverted. No, I\'m not part of a psy-op. I\'m a target. Financially, I have recovered due to salary and a tax-return.</p>
<p>How did this all start, and what is the scope? Well, it\'s much bigger than you may think. We\'ll move on.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Today, 6/20/2018, I witnessed the following when I went for a smoke and overheard a few workers talking..&quot;..because he had to call, indirectly, an extremely capable mistress a \'Babylonic fuckface\'...&quot;. They were referring to Deborah, a.k.a. Mariel H. I also recorded audio throughout the day with my phone the day before and got these gems: &quot; .. Trojka .. you want <strong>goyim</strong> ..&quot; and &quot;.. f\'king yup being Deborah\'s achilles heel..&quot;. I\'ve annotated the positions within the audio files. They\'re on my drive and all originals still on my phone. The \'Babylonic fuckface\' was a reference I posted under the name \'ArtificalDuality\' on ZeroHedge about a malevolent statement from a Dutch politician on 3/22/2017 : <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-22/dijsselbloem-must-go-solves-nothing#comment-9240901">https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-22/dijsselbloem-must-go-solves-nothing#comment-9240901</a> The comments are gone by now apparently.</p>

             UPDATE
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been taking a look at the twitter of Mariel H. to see whether the number of followers was steadily kept at 33. I checked in May of 2018 (05/2018) and yes, it had been on 33 throughout since October 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, now today, (7/7/2018) it in a sudden was at 34. So now, it was no longer at 33. But, when you look at the Twitter wall for the account, you will see that the wall has been DEAD for
            <strong>
             1 year and 2 months
            </strong>
            !! This means, that nobody in their right mind would follow a dead account. And one as such can conclude 2 things here:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) An account was added to dilute the satanic signature.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) People testing to see whether it would remain at 33 by adding a follower, where either manual control or a bot within her circle of acquaintances would then remove an account from their controlled pool of fake accounts to keep it at 33, hit the limit, where no controlled accounts could be removed because they were all removed. External followers they can't remove.
           </p>
           <p>
            Further more, the woman began working there as a consultant at Feb 13th 2017. The 13th of the month is another occult numeric signature, enforcing the other occult numeric signatures associated. For the purpose to get WmoNed to be "rolled out nationwide", competition be damned; the woman would charm her way in with the product any ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            Profile 'R' that I have mentioned before complained about how my filing with the Authority of Privacy and Personal Information in Holland would have sabotaged the "nation wide roll-out" of WmoNed,
            <em>
             denying them of access to their delicatesse
            </em>
            ". Delicatesse being children / body parts.

           <p>
            Profile 'R' : Deborah (Mariel H.) managed to convince the Oath Keepers that it was just a yup with 'love woes', that the visa was rightfully denied.
           </p>
           <p>
            My comment: If they indeed let themselves convince by her, then I can state they experienced Debora's 'siren calls' a.k.a. charms.

            No, I'm not controlled opposition. These malevolent Jews try to create the illusion to the outside that I would have been subverted to them. It's about illusion fabrication. Just a heads-up.

            SRA are not individual cases. Those are the drips coming through the dam. Look behind the dam. It is systemic. It is cultural.

           <p>
            Further more, I'm sending this to our National Police as well as AIVD. The first I'll write through an online reporting. The second will receive a USB stick with a data cache containing transcripts, logs and findings in regards to MH-17 and my experiences at the various employees since my findings about MH-17 as well as the recovered e-mail backup and everything related to the relationship with my former American fiancee. So no, there won't be sent a bomb letter (that malevolent elements may cock up as a narrative to prevent people from receiving this data cache). It will be sent through delivery ensurance mail (aangetekende post).
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, I've not been subverted. No, I'm not part of a psy-op. I'm a target. I will never abnegate my conscious choice for the good side of the absolute duality. For love and equality. I will not succumb to them.

             3.2. 2015: Out of the Woodworks
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Around the same time, it was this woman's birthday. Nothing too special. Three kisses to the face, as is common with birthday wishes, although, with one of the kisses I touched her cheek with my nose as well. This is noteworthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            At one time, head-dev stood up from his desk, walked around the other desks (no collegues were present at the time) and halted at my desk. I looked up to him, having noted he had walked around to my desk and anticipated him. He made a brief remark. "You know a cat has 9 lives right?" then he turned quickly, and walked out to the hallway as if nothing happened. I mulled this over and knew I just received an explicit death-threat. And concluded the earlier threat about Prince Iepe was also directed at me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then we end up in early 2016. It came to an explosion between me and head-dev. One of the things this guy did, was to manage people's individual truths. Both to save his arse out of situations and always stay in the clear when things would go wrong. He never did anything wrong, it was always other (former) colleagues. It also caused a fuckup between an assignment, an extra project I did for them, when it appeared that the customer's expectations went way beyond that what was asked from me. He, in real-time, told the project guy I worked with "Oh, that's phase 2"; trying to brush away the discrepancy in expectations. It pissed me off and again proved he was fudging up individual people's truths. And so this happend again at a meeting where he had been telling a web-dev something different over what was agreed prior in conjunction with me. I got pissed with head dev. I slammed down my cup of coffee (it was empty). I walked towards the door of the meeting room, turned around and faced head-dev, slowly, but firmly stating "And now I am thoroughly and thoroughly done with it!". (The truth fucking of individual people). This was the drop that flooded the bucket and made me decide to leave the company and look for something else. There was this strange thing where head-dev wanted to talk things over. I was repellant towards him, but at the end of the conversation, he stepped towards me. Then grabbed my neck. Began pulling feverishly a number of times. Talking amical words (the situation wasn't there to be talking amically). And left it. He never touched me before. The acting he was performing was quite excessive, an overly 'amical' buddy-tap. More of a buddy-yank-his-fucking-neck-and-make-sure-the-stuff-sticks-well tap.
           </p>
           <p>
            They offered me more money to stay. I refused. I can't be bought, I responded. I'm willing to stay and transfer knowledge, but that's it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now let's talk about about head-dev. This guy, besides fucking truths all the time and blame everyone but himself on everything that went wrong, he also had, even by own admittance, a short fuse. Whenever he had trouble with source code, one shouldn't be near him lest you'd get an arm in your neck if you happened to say something wrong.
            <em>
             At home
            </em>
            , I called him a 'Badr-Hari' over this, a Dutch sports fighter that's known to have a short fuse as well, at least in the past. Mind you, I've never called him that directly. Only spoke that out in private in my own home. This is key.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a link to head-dev's Facebook:

            Note the verse? A 3-pack of 6'es. And in reality, it's even the wrong verse. The verse text displayed, is in actually John 8:31-32. The '36' had been picked with intent. He's allied with Debora / Mariel. There's more I can tell about this (it fits his profile well), like having like 5 Christianity related pages open in his browser at all times on his work laptop, often visible during any work meeting where he displayed stuff on his laptop, but save to say, this guy is part of the national division of the Dutch Deep State.

            SRA are not individual cases. Those are the drips coming through the dam. Look behind the dam. It is systemic. It is cultural.

           <p>
            Further more, I'm sending this to our National Police as well as AIVD. The first I'll write through an online reporting. The second will receive a USB stick with a data cache containing transcripts, logs and findings in regards to MH-17 and my experiences at the various employees since my findings about MH-17 as well as the recovered e-mail backup and everything related to the relationship with my former American fiancee. So no, there won't be sent a bomb letter (that malevolent elements may cock up as a narrative to prevent people from receiving this data cache). It will be sent through delivery ensurance mail (aangetekende post).
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, I've not been subverted. No, I'm not part of a psy-op. I'm a target. I will never abnegate my conscious choice for the good side of the absolute duality. For love and equality. I will not succumb to them.

           </p>
           <p>
            For a very long time I have been aware of the black / false profile created around me. Unfortunately I could not 'prove' anything, because I had lost the backup files. I only had that letter left in Dutch, translated from the original of which they said it was just forgery of a schizophrenic. I've always regretted the loss of those backup files because of sentimental, emotional and nostalgic value to me. I did however, still have a copy of a physical file from the immigration lawyer, T. R. Bakken. Likewise, STN profile 'R' tried to vehemently pass it off as another forgery to internal service / rank &amp; file. I did have a backup of my mail database containing conversations and mail between my former fiancee and me over the full span of the relationship, however, that backup was bust (DVDs got borked by sunlight) and I thought I had lost these forever.
           </p>
           <p>
            Untill I figured, let's take a look in a case containing all sorts of old CDs.. and there I found a prior backup, from 2007. My heart began to race. I took the disk that held both my backup folder and the ICQ logs folder and put it in the drive. I went to look for the files... and guess what? They were there! The backup worked. I spontaniously began to cry. That feeling I can't describe, having back the files, all the conversations between her and me. Actual tangible proof of my past was retrieved. Besides the spiritual and sentimental value, it was also proof of reality as truth transpired.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing I did, was to file a report with the FBI, telling parts of this story and how our BVD/AIVD had been presenting a completely false profile of me and sent them a link to the e-mail database that contained everything surrounding the former relationship. Including everything related to my K1 visa application. I had zipped it and uploaded it to a filesharing site. I explicitly stated to make sure it would end up with the 'Oath Keepers' given the nature of this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            This STN profile 'R', after some time, when apparently the FBI had reported to our service the database was authentic and real, then changed narrative and adapted the false profile, stating "
            <em>
             at present
            </em>
            he's no longer a 'belisimo'*" and various other types of downplay. He now no longer could get around the existence and validity of my past and is now, currently, trying like hell to state that the K1 Visa was justfully rejected, trying to save his former complicit members that caused / adviced the rejection. Together with trying to pass off true love as placebo, it's absolutely clear this STN profile 'R' and likeminded colleagues are out to destroy the notion of love. Only that what mental Satanists would attempt to do. Further motive was to mentally quarantaine me to avoid people in the Dutch sphere from believing my past, my life, my personal mission that I began over 22 years ago. I wrote about this bit 1.2 years ago, here
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1729882">
             The Big Picture
            </a>
            . 5 months ago, when I already did the exposure on the Satanism at this Zorgned company, this STN profile 'R' was threatening the hell out of me and (likely) conducting a malevolent psyop at that, which gave rise to the thread to which the following contextual post leads:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2339246/11729194/10#11729194">
             It's Real. And I am the Prize (Adult)
            </a>
            . I've had and still have many metal heads-on exchanges with STN profile 'R' and one of them was that I noted that "The Oath Keepers are on to it and are not to be messed with". STN profile responded with, in a resolute fashion, "They don't have juristriction here!". How's that for admitting you're not righteousness aligned?
           </p>
           <p>
            The direct post linked, tells about an event that happens that relates
            <em>
             directly
            </em>
            to the e-mail database lost and the relationship I had with my former fiancee. In the linked post, I wrote about the evidence of my relationship that was taken and again, returned, but put back in a different place. It was the suitcase with the file hardcopy of the immigration laywer mr. T.R. bakken, the hard-ship case he handled for me and my former fiancee. The sequence went like this: When I decided I were going to leave the house, took the case, and
            <em>
             threw it to the table top of the livingroom table
            </em>
            , stating the following words: "Well... whoever [good or evil operatives] gets here first!" and I left. As written in the linked post, I returned shortly, only to have found the coffer
            <em>
             in
            </em>
            the table, in one of its open miniature cabinets where I normally put shoes. So I
            <em>
             knew
            </em>
            someone had taken and returned it, but put it back in the wrong place in a hurry since I returned so fast. They could likely hear my car come back after they had confiscated it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, that suitcase did not hold ANYTHING of monetary value. The only value in there were documents of my past, of which the documents that would prove the existence and validity of my relationship with Claudia being by far the most significant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Malevolent elements in our AIVD and their guides, the Mossad (STN profile 'R' loves calling 'anti-Semite' every chance he gets when I point out his malevolency mentally) along with their nation wide network were and are out to eradicate all evidence of my past for aforementioned reasons. Of which one prime objective is to take out the notion of spiritual love. (and make sexworkers the norm at the same time, porn industry?). STN profile 'R' you see, is adamant trying to prove I would not know what is true love, all the while stating it is placebo. Tries to delegitimize and demonize my person. Well I'll tell you, true love is no placebo. I will below, add two secions of the letter Claudia wrote to my mother to convince her our relationship was real, to ease her. It deals with their 'schizophrenic pedo' allegation quite well at that too. Showing they are indeed following Saul Alinsky to the letter. Here are the pieces:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              I don’t know if you believe in God or not, but I do.  And if I believe in God, I have to believe in Satan.   Thus.. I believe in good and evil.  I know what both stands for and what both is capable of producing in life.  I believe God is good and only from him can come pure, true love.
             </strong>
             Joke, I’ve met many people and experienced many things in my life, but I can honestly say that the love that shines from your son is nothing less than a miracle in my eyes.  I can’t help but feel that this love that pours out of him can only come from one source… God.  God works through people.  And God is definitely working through Arno whether he knows it or not.  God has given Arno and I something very special.  A pure, love that I’ve never felt from any other man in my life.  I know what infatuation is.  I know what lust is.  I know what sometimes love is.  I know how it is to love someone when they are around and then forget about him when they aren’t.  But Arno and I have something that expands far beyond that.  I can’t get that man off my mind for one second during my day.   He’s in every pore and every cell of my being.  Never have I felt this for anyone in my life.  His love gives me the strength to work through anything I have to face.  I also feel that the love I give him gives him great strength also.  I have never shared so much of my life with one person.  I have never let anyone come close to tears down the walls that I have built.  Arno is the first person to ever be able to do that.  This man knows more about me than I know about me.  He understands me better than I could ever understand myself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your son may not have tons of experience, but by god, he has tons of goodness in him.  He has an outpouring of love so big it fills my heart to overflowing.  He has flaws.  Don’t think I don’t see them.  He’s as stubborn as I am.  Hehe  But he uses that stubbornness for good.  He won’t let me walk away from a fear that I might have.  He makes me deal with it in a very gentle, loving way.  He doesn’t criticize me for my fears.  He listens, he loves me for sharing it, and he understands and helps me through it.  I hope I do the same for him.  I think I do.  Will we end up in divorce?  I hope not.  I don’t ever want to lose him.  We are very lucky to have found each other.  The miles between us have made us so much more stronger.  If we can endure being apart physically for months and months, we can endure anything I feel.  My kids love Arno. They feel he is a very stable individual with loving qualities.  My daughter Hannah is usually very reserved with men I’ve introduced her too.  But she warmed up to Arno immediately.  The kids all want him to come back.  They were very taken with him.  My daughter Rebecca cried when he left in December.  I wouldn’t pick just anyone to be a father-figure to my children.  Anyone I was serious about would have to pass a hard test from my children and me.  Arno has far exceeded that.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            NOTE: To our rank and file, they highly likely classified the e-mail database, that is, if they (the overseer STN profile 'R' and fellows) have gotten it from my system or from the FBI. I hereby give full permission to the entire rank 'n file to demand access to the e-mail database uncensored for review purposes and discover the upper compartments have.... let's say... some really rotten apples where nothing is as it seems.

             5. 2017: First Encounter
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is where I identified two Kabbalah Satanists (two women), a pedophile sympathizer and more shady, highly likely human trafficing related entities. I'm not going to elaborate in this post as I've done an extensive write-up on my experiences with this company here:

           </p>
           <p>
            Since in this post the link towards the Twitter / LinkedIn screenshot of Mariel H. no longer works because of having removed it, I'll reinclude it here as I have uploaded it again:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Important to know though is, that I've reported my findings to the National Police (that I did not get any responses from. Even the promised officer never came by). Though, I know, through the STN that the case is currently going and people are actively on the case. Including Zio-Satanist shills within our secret service and associated entities, that are acting as gate keepers. More on this later.
           </p>
           <p>
            One big thing to them is a currently running discussion amonst them on whether I am an expert on databases, and therefore could legitimately tell whether the database record I uncovered had its primary key (666) manually entered or not. Well I can tell you; I have been doing software development for over 20 years, all administrative database applications. One would think one would know about primary keys, their data types and all the semantics that come with it. I'm a current author of a custom entity/business object framework that is compatible with any number of SQL databases as long as one adds support to the data access layer, another framework layer I have designed to be a future product. I've worked with many databases, and designed my first database as early as 1998 on Paradox, using Delphi with the Borland Database Engine. It was a stock management tool for a repair center and covered the entire logistics process for that company. There's simply no discussion here. I repeat: NO DISCUSSION. Read the previous link; it has a section about the Zorgned database and the forensic analysis I ran on the database to be sure for myself on whether it had been entered manually or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was another gem at this company that delivered me the ultimate proof that these Zionist-Satanists, their malevolent cult have been on me since 2001 at least. More so. It was the ultimate proof to me that this cult and their lakeys, their Dutch department are behind the destruction of the relationship I had with this American woman in 2001 up to 2003. More so, that they have been tapping my phone conversations with my other half back then. I knew back in 2003 already that local folk were behind the negative advice to the American Consulate that resulted in the denial of my K1 visa. I've had various reasons to be suspicious back then already, given the acting and behaviour of former colleagues and CEO of the company I worked for during that time, Kooijman Bouwcomputing and its then CEO Martin S., my former manager Leonard S. and other assorted folk that have been rather derogatory about the relationship I had with this woman, her name is Claudia. One of the first questions one guy, Erwin M. , asked me when I got back after the first week of meeting Claudia in the USA, was.... "Did you fuck?" . I mentally blinked my eyes and said.... "NO." I didn't 'fuck'. We made love. But I wasn't going to tell one shred about it, deeming the guy unworthy any further conversation.
           </p>
           <p>
            This employee at Zorgned, Anton W. made one remark when he walked back into the office with the guy Albert P. walking in behind him. As he came through the open door, he exclaimed a word. The word "Olifant". The Dutch word for 'elephant'. It's not so much the word as it was the way of pronounciation. Huge emphasis on each sillable as if you're trying to teach someone on how to pronounce a word: "O-li-fant". Well it was exactly that: In 2002 I spoke on the phone identically to Claudia the word "Olifant" because she wanted to know how it was pronounced. She was learing some Dutch words here and there. The exclamation of Aton W. cleary was for intimidation purposes.
            <strong>
             However, to me it wasn't intimidation. To me it was the ultimate salvation. The ultimate proof. The confirmation of knowing what I have always known.
            </strong>
            Evil people destroying the most beautiful thing I had. Claudia and I had. On purpose. Because they hate love. They call it placebo. No, instead, they want everyone to use their whores and that being a norm. The Satanic cult is out to destroy the notion of love in this world. And, after 20 years of research, dropping breadcrums that I would recognize at later points in time, I found them. I found them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have already contacted the FBI since my case spans not just Holland, but the USA as well. Here in Holland, so I've noted the psychopathic cult has been mentally quarantaining me for years on end since the destruction of the relationship. I would just throw myself at work which benefitted them. All the while presenting me outwards as a schizophrenic doofus (they still try to do so) and a schizophrenic virgin. For the longest time Dutch intelligence (Mossad primarily) revolving around me has been trying to pass off and convince everyone just that. That the relationship with Claudia was a mere schizophrenic fiction. A letter Claudia wrote to my mom being a fabrication of my own. This letter describes in detail my person, my traits, my real me. Which is completely the opposite of the profile these evil fucks are portraying to the environments around me through their network.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, I could not prove I was not a virgin, that I had intercourse with this woman, that we had a real relationship, that we were going to marry. It had been claimed by these higher-ups in our service it was just schizophrenic babble, this thing about true love. These malevolent actors (STN profile 'R' as described below) try to pass off spiritual mental love as placebo. I also could not find any backups of all the e-mail traffic that was between me and Claudia. Somehow, some way both the e-mail backups AND the ICQ backups no longer existed on my harddrive in a designated backup folder. I lost them between 2007 and 2010. Savegames of old games (1998) were still there. Just the e-mail and the ICQ backups were gone. I just couldn't put my finger to it, because I always transfered the folder to a new harddrive in whole. But today, I know, BVD/AIVD/Mossad evil actors have been remote deleting these files from my system.

             4. In Between
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I left the company early March. Another significant thing happened not much later. It was the night of 19th to 20th March. All in a sudden, it was like my head was in a micro-wave. My saliva changed structure, it was as if bloodplasm started to mix up with it and many other anomalies to the point I called the 112 emergency line. When I did that, the phenomena stopped in a sudden, for a little. I decided, am I going to the hospital in the middle of the night or not? I was refused an ambulance. The operator did not want to send in an ambulance. I decided to leave my brother's place and go to my mom's place. The phenomena returned. Burning sensation on my tongue, palate and the saliva being much different in structure and taste. At the same time, I noted I began to get this irritation on my nose. Where like, if I would touch one place of the reddish inflamation, it would flare across the whole of the inflammation. Even the lightest touch. On the 22th of March, 2016, the terrorist attack in Brussels happend. This was on a Monday. The inflammation had developed into a reddish area over my nose and was highly irritating.
           </p>
           <p>
            One noteworthy thing here, was the following. My mom has a dog, a cute small Romanian breed dog. There was something up with the dog. Since I hadn't been feeling well with all these anomalies, I was resting on the couch. The dog jumped on me and was feverishly adamant about getting to my nose. I kept pushing him away gently a number of times, though it kept wanting to reach for my face. He was stubborn and adamant about it. Eventually, I was like ok. I'll give in. And let the dog have access to my face. If he wants to lick me so bad, then go ahead. Next, the dog got back to my face quicky. He reached for my nose. He then clenched his teeth around my nose, though not biting it off; it was no aggression. He was in fact rubbing that inflammatory spot on my nose, clenching it between its teeth, being somewhat liberate with his saliva. I think he held my nose for like a minute like that and then in a sudden he backed off, and jumped to the other side of the couch, towards my feet and went to sit there, looking at me. It was like he was saying "Ok, I finally got to do my thing! I'm done now!". I grinned and talked a bit to the dog, and from then on, he no longer had any urge to get to my nose.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few more days later, my nose seemed to cure rapidly. It was clear to me that this was not a normal something. It appeared to be a microbial organism that extracted itself from my skin, being repelled from my skin and eventually it fell off. Given the situation and the suspicion of the past months, I had made a photo series of the development of this anomaly on my nose. See here:
            <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZaaVo">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it was a fungal type of microbiome that was quite nasty. Could it have something to do with the touch of the cheek with my nose of the woman? I knew for sure that no other person had touched my nose in a similar surface pattern for uhm.. some years.
           </p>
           <p>
            From then on, I kept living with the mouth anomalies. I still have it, but at present day it's a minor nuisance. I think over time my immune system stems it, though can't kill it. My saliva is still stink.
           </p>
           <p>
            Up until 2017, I had been working at home on private IT projects, and had another 3 jobs at companies where another set of events happened. It's almost out of scope of this posting, but, it is related and even much so important. The reason why is, that Deep State / Satanic agents have been on a mission to achieve a number of things.

              Blackball me like nuts, I've told about this before.

           <p>
            At job 1, there was this one guy that in speech, flashed 3 6'es, verbally. (6 months, 6 weeks, 6 days) as if it was supposed to be a joke. Circumstancials with this guy add to the identification of this guy as a (Zionist) Satanist.
           </p>
           <p>
            At job 2, the IT guy I worked with tried to do a number of things:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Incriminate me, by requesting me to get an illegal key for Microsoft Server Datacenter Edition (A lot of $$$) during work time. I refused. He wanted to make me responsible for ordering the MSDN Enterprise subscription where he would then roll out Office into this company, which is illegal because these are development licenses and may not be used in production scenarios. I clearly worded the buy-request in a way that shows I did the order for the MSDN thing under his command. I was gone though before anything was rolled out though.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Marginalize my skill set, acting extremely derogatory. All the while I made the guy fall flat on his face where I purported actual lies and I was the one correcting him.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Also flashed in speech the number 17 a few times. Also noted he enjoyed the show Lucifer on Netflix.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            At job 3, some of them there were discussing me. Whether I would or would not be a 'hairy Esau'. Inverse assimilation. I'm a human. A spiritually autonomous human. So no, thanks. A woman there again had an outgoing approach towards me. Overly touching, you know, this politeness touches to the shoulder, these taps and trying to engage into small conversation, being extremely amically. One time I was smoking a cig out the door, it was lunch time. She walked by me and walked away to the exit of the parking lot. I knew what I noted. I
            <em>
             thought
            </em>
            : Honeypot. The second I thought that, she jerked her head around and looked me straight in the face. Too timing-ful. More STN. At this company I threw out more mental throws and did get responses that proved to me already their STN.
           </p>
           <p>
            I left all these jobs pretty quick, staying home and find a new job on my own financial expenses. The mental harrassement persisted on most of these jobs. And then, after having been home for a while, my finances almost depleted, I got this new job at Zorgned. And that's where things really got to show.... colors.

             3.2. 2015: Out of the Woodworks
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Around the same time, it was this woman's birthday. Nothing too special. Three kisses to the face, as is common with birthday wishes, although, with one of the kisses I touched her cheek with my nose as well. This is noteworthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            At one time, head-dev stood up from his desk, walked around the other desks (no collegues were present at the time) and halted at my desk. I looked up to him, having noted he had walked around to my desk and anticipated him. He made a brief remark. "You know a cat has 9 lives right?" then he turned quickly, and walked out to the hallway as if nothing happened. I mulled this over and knew I just received an explicit death-threat. And concluded the earlier threat about Prince Iepe was also directed at me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then we end up in early 2016. It came to an explosion between me and head-dev. One of the things this guy did, was to manage people's individual truths. Both to save his arse out of situations and always stay in the clear when things would go wrong. He never did anything wrong, it was always other (former) colleagues. It also caused a fuckup between an assignment, an extra project I did for them, when it appeared that the customer's expectations went way beyond that what was asked from me. He, in real-time, told the project guy I worked with "Oh, that's phase 2"; trying to brush away the discrepancy in expectations. It pissed me off and again proved he was fudging up individual people's truths. And so this happend again at a meeting where he had been telling a web-dev something different over what was agreed prior in conjunction with me. I got pissed with head dev. I slammed down my cup of coffee (it was empty). I walked towards the door of the meeting room, turned around and faced head-dev, slowly, but firmly stating "And now I am thoroughly and thoroughly done with it!". (The truth fucking of individual people). This was the drop that flooded the bucket and made me decide to leave the company and look for something else. There was this strange thing where head-dev wanted to talk things over. I was repellant towards him, but at the end of the conversation, he stepped towards me. Then grabbed my neck. Began pulling feverishly a number of times. Talking amical words (the situation wasn't there to be talking amically). And left it. He never touched me before. The acting he was performing was quite excessive, an overly 'amical' buddy-tap. More of a buddy-yank-his-fucking-neck-and-make-sure-the-stuff-sticks-well tap.
           </p>
           <p>
            They offered me more money to stay. I refused. I can't be bought, I responded. I'm willing to stay and transfer knowledge, but that's it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now let's talk about about head-dev. This guy, besides fucking truths all the time and blame everyone but himself on everything that went wrong, he also had, even by own admittance, a short fuse. Whenever he had trouble with source code, one shouldn't be near him lest you'd get an arm in your neck if you happened to say something wrong.
            <em>
             At home
            </em>
            , I called him a 'Badr-Hari' over this, a Dutch sports fighter that's known to have a short fuse as well, at least in the past. Mind you, I've never called him that directly. Only spoke that out in private in my own home. This is key.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a link to head-dev's Facebook:

            Note the verse? A 3-pack of 6'es. And in reality, it's even the wrong verse. The verse text displayed, is in actually John 8:31-32. The '36' had been picked with intent. He's allied with Debora / Mariel. There's more I can tell about this (it fits his profile well), like having like 5 Christianity related pages open in his browser at all times on his work laptop, often visible during any work meeting where he displayed stuff on his laptop, but save to say, this guy is part of the national division of the Dutch Deep State.

            At this time, I worked at a company very close to my home. I began working there in January 2014. All looked good. It was a nice company, relatively young people and the getting along was nice. I soon received responsibility over the development and design of the underlying framework for their software. It was initially written by their head-development. This guy is going to play a key role in this essay. He's been a former member of the 'mareschaussee', which is Dutch Elite police force, in between the police and army, however, he's been in IT. This guy appeared to be quite an ego-maniac over the course of working there but I largely ignored that and let that be while doing my work and getting along well with the rest. After my employment, he apparently wanted to get rid of one of his employees, a web developer. I found out about this motive, because he stopped me from helping this developer on stuff. I knew immediately: the web developer was supposed to fail the assignment he had gotten so there would be grounds to fire him. So I had no choice and could not assist. A few weeks later indeed he could not carry out well and head-development started to ask the other web dev on what he thought of the one failing the assigment. A negative comment was the result, and so head-dev and the web developer went into a meeting where he, apparently got to hear he was not suited and wasn't a company groupie. What happened next, that in order to try to keep his job, he went along the desks, moving his hips, exclaiming "fucking fucking fucking". The guy was actually trying to coform to an image, an impression presented to him by head-dev, in order to be seen as fitting in. It was facepalm worthy, because I knew the guy is totally not sex oriented, depraved or what so ever. He merely tried to keep his job. It was just an easy-going, decent guy that went out of his way to keep his job, trying to conform to a perceived image presented to him by head-dev and the other junior programmers. Head-dev being the example setter and endorser of such behaviour.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, a lot more happend at this company. And here is where I get involved.
            <strong>
             7/17/2014
            </strong>
            A date many Dutch people remember. It was the day, the plane MH-17 was shot down. At that time, I chalked it up as an unfortunate event, and didn't pay much further attention to it. It wasn't untill 2015 where I began to take a second look at this event. Early 2015, in Europe, there was already this thing with the Greek elections, where Greece was assimilated into the European Union and thrown into MASSIVE debt. This is where I really learnt about the dissynchronization of truth, by reading news from various sources (American, European and Greek). Each continent / region got its own tailored news and narrative surrounding this happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Halfway 2015 I began researching into the take down of MH-17 much further and deeper. The reason for this was, that our local news, without any real evidence, had been pointing its fingers at Russia as being behind the take down. Reading about, and viewing presentations (of UN gatherings, the (in)famous emotional Jan Timmermans pointing at the Russians) it struck me: It is a friggin' false flag. The whole development surrounding this event was SO OBVIOUS that I knew it was a false flag with the purpose to incriminate Russia and enable a war with them. Invoked by the Global Criminal Sectarian Syndicate (Global Deepstate) I was already aware of. This made me really dig into the case and I found plenty enough circumstantial evidence to indeed conclude it was a false flag for the described purpose. I uncovered fighter jets have been involved in the take-down, contrary to a BUK rocket as pushed and propagated by MSM. These were Malaysia's intial findings as well, they were blocked from further investigation at that. And much more. I for one, had uncovered that the Deep State front "Bellingcat" had produced totally fraudulent fake photo materials. The Joint Investigation Team and the Dutch Public Ministery uses these materials as the basis for their case building. See here how I prove one of the images to be fake, scientifically proven:
            <a href="https://magicboxy.imgur.com/all/">
             https://magicboxy.imgur.com/all/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not going to elaborate massively on this particular case right here because it's out of scope of this essay, but the importance here is that I began to present arguments and counter evidence on Facebook under the name "Ons Vaderland". I still have the account, but it is disabled because Facebook wanted identification from me which I refused at that time. Not much later, the ability to post Facebook comments to any and all articles posted by MSM was destroyed. Nowhere on any MSM, comments could be left. Censorship hell. Before this, Facebook itself already censored posts and weblinks like no tomorrow.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is when the whole thing started and where things come together. At this company, in the 3rd quarter of 2015, there was this reorganization. A woman was moved from one sister company to ours at this time and was assigned to do company administration. On its own nothing special. However, this woman began to reach out to me. Greeting me with emphasis, including my name with emphasis. When there were work meetings, at one time, she chose explicitly to come sit next to me (while there was plenty room elsewhere) and subliminally draw attention from me. Every time we did cross, she was extremely reaching out mentally, with this emphasis on calling my name included with greets. At one point when I got home after work I was like "It's like this woman keeps pulling me" which I found a bit surprising. Maybe she had an interest in me and since I was a single guy, and this woman seemed mentally attractive, I was open for things. I spoke this out loud. That "It's like &lt;her name&gt; keeps pulling me". The next day, breaking the trend, she ignored me when seeing her at the company bar. Which I found odd given the previous encounters. I thought, maybe she/they somehow got aware of my remark at home. Mind you, at this time I was not yet aware of the STN (Syntethic Telepathic Network) and the ability of its assorted members to witness my mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Similarly, head-dev made a remark during that time, when the other two developers were present as well, that appeared to look like a covert threat. He noted "Nou, volgens mij gaat Prins Iepe wel over lijken". In English, "Well, I think Prince Iepe walks across dead bodies". This guy is a high-placed official of a customer company to us. I didn't take note very much. However, before that, when MH-17 came up as a subject in a conversation, I told him to look at Erik Toonen, a guy that wrote this piece:
            <a href="http://delangemars.nl/2015/07/23/mh17-een-jaar-later-door-erik-toonen/">
             http://delangemars.nl/2015/07/23/mh17-een-jaar-later-door-erik-toonen/
            </a>
            (It's Dutch, pull through a translator). This guy Erik Toonen has received death threats forcing him to stop publishing. Head-dev ignored my comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the end of the year, I noted more and more harassement coming from head-dev and one of the new employees that were hired at the development department. It was a tester. They also didn't seem to be very ethically. At that time we also had a prospect Morrocan customer for whom a diplomat was a Morrocan guy working at the City of Amersfoort, yet another customer. He had visited us and head-dev, during a lunch break, acted somewhat amically towards him. It was an older guy. After lunch, I and hed-dev and the other 3 collegues we had went into a work meeting. But before it started, head-dev in a sudden made a remark: "Islam is such a ridiculous barbaric faith" and began to make pig noises. The tester guy responded, laughed and began joining in making pig noises. I and the remaining colleagues just sat there letting it pass by.
