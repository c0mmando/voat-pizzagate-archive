            Repetition repetition repetition 
I agree. Ie Make stupid quizzes on fb.  Use leading questions. Make it antitrump to draw in the sheep. Then subtly get your point across. Entice people to share.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look up the psychology of how to make someone question them selves.  Gas lighting might be the term. Then use their own weapons against them.

            I'm a Democrat and very much anti-Trump, yet I have been following pizzagate closely and am trying to get others to look into it themselves. This is not about political affiliation- it's about exposing government deception, corruption, and abuse. Maybe the recent players of whom we are aware are predominantly Democratic, but I have no doubt that this goes much deeper and pervades many facets of our society at local, state-wide, national, and international levels (I'm talking religious organizations, Hollywood, media, schools, sports organizations, military, multiple branches of govt., non-profits, NGOs, law-enforcement, etc.). I think this is something people on both sides of the fence can and should acknowledge, but by posting comments that deride the Left, you could alienate potential allies.

             I thought this may alienate the left. But I'm afraid if it was Trump being attacked, many on the right would be ignorant to all of this evidence.

            Anti-Trumpers don't care about facts so, while this probably won't hurt him, it won't have the effect you want it to.
