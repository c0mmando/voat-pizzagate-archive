<p>He is trying to make money and faked it all to get traffic and support. Highly unlikely due to that it would be highly illegal and dangerous to make such false, fabricated allegations.

<p>It\'s real, Jimmy is apparently an uncontrollable, maniacal narcissist on coke.

<li>
<p>Jimmy is being set up as the fall guy. If you check any other pedo ring story across the globe and recent history, when the pressure became too great on a case, one lone pedo convict is found to satisfy the public thirst for justice. Dutroux Saville etc. We got historic precedent here.</p>

<li>
<p>Gear Guy is a shill, Alefantis won\'t sue him. see <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1543687/7514541">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1543687/7514541</a> <a href="https://voat.co/user/waxdino">@waxdino</a></p>

<p>In which case, if you consider that, we shouln\'t be spending any time on this as it will lead probably to a narrative like &quot;ok you were right it means I love kids in French and he is guilty most def. kk thx bye&quot;</p>

            I think the name is just a coincidence. He has siblings with the same name. Sometimes there a coincidences, that's the randomness of life.

           <p>
            Talking of coincidences Edgar Welch randomly hitting the hard drive of the CPP computer system is not a coincidence. Rather it's validation there's something very very wrong here. And the DC police lied about them investigating CPP, not a coinkydink.

            Real or not, this has gone negative fast, in too many ways.
           </p>
           <h1>
            1 - I read the chat, and there's no doubt, the comments displayed, and the inclusion of the family pics were terrorizing. That shit should be considered extremely serious by LE, but so far not. Why? We've seen a paper-based police report, citing "terrorism" in this incident, displayed on this site, with comments that say this report is essentially being ignored until something happens. Why, and is anything being asked about and followed up in real life about that?
           </h1>
           <h1>
            2 - WHY Is any terroristic threat, fake or real, receiving total dismissal and disinterest from media and LE? Has dismissal of Pizzagate gone so far that a threatening, personal encounter is so easily written off? Even when it involves a recently, high-profile socialite and person of recent interest such as James Alefantis? A guy whose business establishment was just involved in a gun incident that garnered an appearance and exoneration on The Kelly File? Why would LE put such as that aside?
           </h1>
           <h1>
            3 - The person who was so shaken up by his personal virtual encounter with JA, it lead to his removing of a YouTube video, at the request of JA, out of fear for his family (whose pics were posted on his FB chat with JA), then proceeds to immediately display his entire, even more damning, JA FB chat, describing and analyzing the threats in detail.
           </h1>
           <h1>
            4 - Pizzagate investigators are actively debunking the FB chat story, to the point of repeating the process used to fake a FB chat, and arguing here over results. Plus accusations of faking, this story for profit are still being thrown around.
           </h1>
           <p>
            This JA encounter story has taken a life of it's own.Maybe this controversial and highly argued topic merits it's own subverse?

            "Real. Jimmy is being set up as the fall guy."....BINGO! That's exactly what I think is going on here. This story has all the markings of some shady characters using JA as a Fall Guy. And shady as in I bet someone told him to make his restaurant as Gay and Occult as possible. That explains the murals with decapitated heads and leaving the "Shut up and Fuck" on the bathroom wall.

            Jimmy Comet thought he was fighting for his "Culture". Comet Ping Pong was his giant middle finger to the Religious Right. Little did he know that friend who suggested it was repping some very dark and sinister characters. They wanted a "bag man" if they ever got discovered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus that's what FBIAnon implied. He said the sex trafficking was just the tip of the iceberg. The Clinton Foundation was the real crime scene. What better way to throw off the dogs than place a red hearing in the form of Comet Ping Pong?

            I tend to feel like it's a mixture of 2,3, and 5. (It's real) However I do feel like 4 is a possibility. (OP is a shill) the 4 seems unlikely to me, but possible. I don't see 1 as being an option as he appears to have mostly proven it happened, that he did talk to the real JA.

            I think we should quietly give him the benefit of the doubt. We don't have to keep going on about it, or take any action or anything to draw attention to it. We just carry on as normal and see what happens.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't definitively say it is either real or faked, so I think we just keep it at the back of our minds. I personally think he's being honest, but also acknowledge I could be wrong. However, I think that it would be terrible to ostracise this guy or be mean to him because if it's real then he's done something pretty brave (if stupid) and he is probably shitting himself and the last thing he needs is this community turning on him. If it's fake, then not doing anything does no harm. So the way with the least harm is to just carry on as normal and not really discuss it anymore - if something new comes up then consider that at the time.

            6?  Real.  I don't think he's (intentionally) being set up to be the fall guy, I just think his powerful friends/customers are hanging him out to dry, trying to create as much distance as possible.  If you tread through his threats, he makes several threats that he can't accomplish, example: he can't remove youtube videos himself, he can't afford to handle things with a lawyer. etc.  He's doing this to flex as much as possible, which is really a swing in the dark.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think what we are seeing, if true, is what happens to most animals when backed into a corner; they lash out with everything they got left in the tank, and hope for the best.

            Not to repeat this question that I used as a comment in a similar thread, but does anyone know of any other YouTubers or vocal advocates who have tried to contact JA directly? My problem with this whole story is that it seems so unlikely that this random guy with relatively little notoriety contacted him and managed to get a response, and an engaging one at that, not to mention that he continued to post videos about the experience even after JA asked him to delete his previous vids. How does any of this make sense unless it's a false flag or poorly thought out hoax? Wouldn't he continue to be fearful for himself and his family if this were real? Hell, wouldn't he have stopped the investigation completely? The police report does little to convince me that this is real.

I would just like to point out one thing about the claims of things being fake. The information gained on Pegasus in the last few days is legit, it was me that found the link, me that posted the thread here on voat that the video was about. Unfortunately for isthisgameofthrones, his desire to get the attention for himself backfired and he landed himself in the shit instead. Note that he didn't give credit for the findings to anyone and in the video about the messenger texts he actually even says that he found it. I think they call this 'karma'.

              Yes you did misinterpret my post because I pretty much said don't be so quick to believe this. See below.
             </p>
             <p>
              This guy spoke to Alefantis TWICE and didn't record it? He even "threatens" this guy on the phone call we that was never recorded. This is the same guy trying to profit off this.
             </p>
             <p>
              All I'm saying is don't be so quick to believe this. For all we know this guy could be staging this and trying to scare people or create fake news or who knows.
             </p>

              Give me your thoughts.

               Filing a police report and putting skin in the game trumps his failure to record. Unless more conflicting info comes in, I'm about 70pct that the O'Neal actually had a convo with Alefantis.

               Yes. I also included the 'unlikely' part of this theory right? That's what you're saying... don't let the fact that Alefantis is capable of doing that make you conclude that this is true.

            My theory is that he's been trying to keep quiet, had one too many to drink or coke or whatever and had a SEVERE lapse in self control; let loose on pizzagategear. He'll probably go silent after this. I messaged him on FB but he hasn't seen/acknowledged, just to ask if it was him in the conversation and to advise him to post a public photo saying that he doesn't intend to kill himself in case he gets offed.

            Another possibility: He's a shill willing to make a false police report to further the allegations that pizzagate researchers are fake-news obsessed. It can be reported in the MSM, "This guy is nuts and a liar, made a false claim, other pizzagaters believed it, showing how they can't discern 'fake news' and condone illegal, reckless behavior."
