<p>Known as ‘Dark Room’, the police operation revealed sexual assaults against children as young as babies, according to The Local.</p>
<p>“The material shows the abuse of children of all ages, including infants,” Hilde Reikrås, head of Operation Dark Room, said at a news conference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the operations, a large number of photos, movies and text messages were seized and examined. The seizure is so far overall of 150 terabytes, which corresponds to 35,000 DVDs, and is one of the biggest seizure of pedophile materials in Norwegian history.</p>
<p>The material has led to charges of sexual intercourse and rape of children from infancy to 15 years, serious trafficking and production, storage and sharing of material depicting sexual abuse of children, and luring of children to show off or sending nude photos or masturbate over the internet.</p>
<p>Police also found examples of offenders who have planned atrocities against their own children with other men.</p>

<p>Material seized by police was greater than what police standardly considered child porn; the stereotypical movies and pictures were certainly prevalent, she said. However, some of the worst content came from the chats between the men.
“The material [videos and pictures] shows including penetration of toddlers, children being tied, children who have sex with animals and children who have sex with other children,” said Reikrås.
However, the chats spoke of planned child abuse, Helme added. One of the men spoke about his pregnant girlfriend; he planned to abuse the child once he/she was born. Others talked about about the acts they wanted to perform on their own children and some ultimately uploaded videos of the acts being performed.</p>

            This story was covered heavily a month ago, especially when all of the MSM scrubbed their sites of the true story of the take down of the pedo ring in Norway. The original post is here:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This particular story seemed to hit a nerve center because of the potential connection to the Clinton Foundation and the fact that Norway is a very strategic transportation hub that could be very important in trafficking. It created some heavy shill activity (nothing here), which can be the best indicator that it should be pursued further.

            The Daily Caller documents the pattern in CF donations by Norway (down nearly 90% this year):

           </p>
           <p>
            I am sure someone can document this via the direct CF records, but I do not have time right now.

            You've been exposed as a CTR shill. Look at his history. The fact is that the drop of nearly 90% in the Clinton Foundation donations for Norway is well documented and consistent with the claim in this post. Verbatim from the article:

            "Norway Donations To Clinton Foundation To Fall Nearly 90% Off Peak
By Chuck Ross
           </p>
           <p>
            The Norwegian government’s planned contribution to the Clinton Foundation next year will be nearly 90 percent off its peak, news outlets in Norway are reporting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Norway will donate 35.9 million kroner this year — or around $5.1 million — to the Clinton Health Access Initiative, a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, according to the Norwegian news outlet, Hegnar."
           </p>
           <p>
            Norway donated $25M dollars to the CF in 2015, down to $5.1M this year. Don't misrepresent the reality and act like some authority when you can't even read the facts. The issue is clearly not that you do not see the facts. You just don't want others to see this real connection and are trying to distract us from the truth. The more you (CTR) say, "Nothing here to see here," the more we know that Norway is a central element to this.

            You are a hack who supports Clinton, opposes Trump, and encourages the "citizen investigators" to infiltrate the dark web posing as pedos, which could expose people to entering illegal sites.

            Internet is not only providing a very profitable outlet for the child porn via cable companies -- Comcast and Verizon making tens of billions and more every year from pornography.
It's also providing communication for these pedophile rings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of our "liberal" websites are also providing chat areas for pedophiles ----- !!!!

            I'm inclined to agree with you... but I'm inclined to agree with OP's link too. I'm conflicted because
            <a href="http://yournewswire.com/court-trump-required-pursue-clinton/">
             this story
            </a>
            lines up with it. On the flip, they've posted some
            <a href="http://yournewswire.com/buckingham-palace-admit-queen-elizabeth-is-not-human/">
             Icke-like
            </a>
            stories that are well...
            <a href="http://yournewswire.com/the-queen-says-four-more-icons-must-die-in-2016/">
             conspiracy heavy.
            </a>
            Scary thought: they're 100% accurate.
