I am a firm believer in #Pizzagate and Cheesybay. I find all of these so-called ‘coincidences’ overly suspect and have been digging non-stop for weeks. But I’m trying to be as unbiased and professional as possible, meaning that as I look into this I keep stumbling upon shitty research, lack of concrete evidence, etc etc. Right here, right now, I’m going to boil down to the most irrefutable and convincing evidence we’ve found while simultaneously debunking some of the falsehoods.</p>
<p><strong>A Quick Throwing Away of the Bullshit</strong>
Alright everyone, I’ve just gotten back from work and drank heavily to numb the headache (shitty idea but it’s gonna be a long night, might as well). Let’s do this.</p>
<p>First things first: When presenting Pizzagate to an outsider or anyone, really, you should put your strongest foot forward while also trying to think about the whole situation as though you were an unbiased party. If you were a Hillary supporter, how would you rebut this? Prepare for a legitimate debate.
Sooooo
Can we all agree that this right here isn’t evidence?

There is like no relation between these two symbols, don’t kid yourselves. Stop bringing this up, you’ll lose credibility. </p>
<p>Also: James Alefantis is the guy’s actual name so any ‘j’aime les enfants’ theories can also stop. The similarity there is merely an unrelated coincidence. Take it from someone who speaks french, they don’t sound very similar either.</p>
<p>The video in which you can hear a child screaming outside Comet Ping Pong is also hard pressed for actual evidence of anything sinister because, although it may have been coming from the restaurant, it could’ve also been from literally anywhere else on the damn block. So it means nothing.</p>
<p>I have to say, as well, Terasol and Besta Pizza I don’t think are involved. The agent of Besta Pizza\'s name was similar to that of the man who used to work on the human trafficking unit, but it has been proven <em>they aren\'t the same person</em>.</p>
<p>People think that these businesses close to Comet having those logos and then changing them after PG grows is suspicious. I just think they’re being rational, ‘oh looks like our logos slightly resemble that of these pedophile symbols. Maybe we should change that!’. Tell me that’s not what you’d do.</p>
<p>Also, Comet’s sign itself has symbols that allude to the devil BUT!!! After a bit of digging I found that it’s not even James’ sign. It belonged to ‘the Comet’, a liquor store. He kept it and used it when he opened CPP. Again, just a coincidence.</p>
<p>There’s an instagram picture on James’ account of people digging in an undisclosed location. It was thought he was probably digging for the rumoured tunnels beneath DC but as a sharp-eyed anon pointed out, the digging they were doing wasn’t actually permanent. It was more likely, seeing as they weren’t using a cement saw and had a bag of filling cement off to the side, they were doing some repairs. This, too, isn’t evidence for suspicious happenings.</p>
<p><strong>The Cold, Hard Truth</strong>
Now that I’ve thrown all that evidence out the window, we need to get to the good shit. I’d like to begin this segment with a very good quote from here&gt; <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1450608">Link</a></p>
<p>--Quote--
* If #Pizzagate is not real, then we have to believe that:
* John Podesta is just a foodie, he loves pizza and pasta and talk about it all the time
* Podesta loves pizza so much that he draws &quot;pizza-related&quot; maps so he doesn\'t forget where are his favourite pizzerias.
* Podesta also loves hot dogs, and he dreams about opening a hotdog stand in Hawaii.
* People play dominoes on pizza and pasta, but it\'s difficult to decide which one is better
* Marina Abramovic was just inviting Tony Podesta to a normal dinner at her place. She called Spirit Cooking like an inside joke, because of the strange and satanic shit she\'s been doing all her life.
* Marina Abramovic is not a satanist, she\'s a lovely lady in real life, the bizarre shit she does is just her artistic self.
* Tony Podesta is a lovely guy who happens to have a strange taste for art. He likes some disturbing pieces of art, and that\'s all.
* James Alefantis is just a family restaurant owner who happens to have a very dark sense of humor and also a strange taste for art, based on the artists he invite to his family restaurant. He just like to post photos of lovely kids and babies, and make very dark comments. His followers also have that dark sense of humor and they just have a good time.
* It\'s perfectly normal to &quot;really want a pizza for an hour.&quot; Next time you go to the pizzeria you can order &quot;2 hours of pizza&quot;.
* James Alefantis love chicken so much he accidently post a man holding a baby , instead of him eating chicken ...#chickenlover
* Price of chicken is high , that\'s why its a sacrifice to give one to the puppy name Moloch. Moloch here is NOT the name of a god associated with child sacrifice. He\'s really talking about Chicken.
* The Majestic Ape is just a creepy artist (not a cryptopedo/satanist at all), and that is totally appropriate for a &quot;family restaurant&quot; like Comet Ping Pong. Bring your kids there to play some ping pong. Also they have a very creepy painting on the wall, just don\'t let your kids see that, they may have nightmares.
* The pedo symbolism in Sex Stains video and Besta Pizza is just a coincidence.
* Podesta also bought pillows and forgot them in someone else\'s home. This person was getting a hard time finding the pillows in her home, because pillows are very small and hard to find, I guess.</p>

SO! Those are some strong points to bring up to those skeptics out there. We have reason to think what we do, not just because of a few pizza emails as the news would have you believe.</p>
<p>While I’m on the topic of news, there’s something I’d like to bring up. Several articles (I won’t link to them all, just the major ones) have tried to dismiss/discredit our investigations. To be honest, the attempt was rather pathetic as it was evident that not a lot of research into pizzagate was actually done. What does this mean, you may be wondering, why wouldn’t they care enough to scrape more than the minimal surface?</p>
<p>My theory as of now is that Shill is endorsing them, telling them what to say (loosely asking them to scoff at Pizzagate without giving them enough context) and they write the articles off of that. Every small news page from there just piggybacks off of them and provides literally no new insight so reading them isn’t worth the effort.</p>
<p>Here are some articles, and I’ve included a few noteworthy quotes.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html?_r=0">&quot;Fact Check&quot;</a>
That there is the NYT article that preceded most of the others. It claims ‘fact check’ and then checks no facts. Just a little stupid for a supposedly credible news source, wouldn’t you say?
<a href="http://www.newnationalist.net/2016/11/22/new-york-times/">New Nationalist</a>
That’s an article linked to in the NYT article, that they say is ‘fake news’. They have a very interesting reply that I’d say is worth the read. Fake news is something you start hearing a whole lot once you read a bunch of these articles.
	<em>A fake story published before the presidential election accused the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, of being part of a child abuse ring led by Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, the New York Times reported.The entire story was false.</em>
What you’ve just read is a quote from ‘Fortune’. Link&gt; <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/11/22/comet-ping-pong-hillary-clinton-fake-news/">Fortune</a>
‘A fake story’
‘The entire story was false.’
Is anyone else wondering why they have the prose and adamance of a stubborn 3-year-old? Again, they offer no reason as to why these stories are indeed false.
Ahh, here’s a quote that just makes me laugh.
*	Since it’s clearly impossible to simply enjoy pizza, Reddit and 4Chan immediately delved into an in-depth investigation into what “pizza” could be a code word for, and naturally, the evidence led the Internet sleuths to uncover a multi-city pedophile ring.*
That was from here&gt; <a href="http://heatst.com/politics/internet-is-obsessed-with-bizarre-hillary-clinton-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/">http://heatst.com/politics/internet-is-obsessed-with-bizarre-hillary-clinton-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/</a>
One of the things I’d like to point out is the mention of the handkerchief and then no explanation or further comment. Even these people can’t find a reason anyone would have a pizza map handkerchief.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, I’d like to say that Pizzagate may not be 100% accurate, but there is something going on that can’t be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
If you have any other misinformation debunked, please post it here. Remember: Before you go posting about \'smoking guns\' or \'breakthroughs\', thoroughly fact check. If I were part of a CP ring and wanted to debunk all the conspiracy surrounding me, I\'d post some fake information to an investigation site so that once it catches on, the news finally has a good leg to stand on about how \'fake\' and \'groundless\' the conspiracy is.</p>',

             Completely disagree mate, except your last sentence, totally agree.  Yes these things are being normalized in modern art and certain music genres.  What these artists show is mild compared to what they don't show.  I don't find their work good or worthy in any sense, but rather repugnant.
            </p>
            <p>
             In elite circles, it is about power and freedom to do whatever nasty stuff they feel like.  These activities fit my definition satanic even if they don't explicitly name Satan or any other deity.  Yet they often do involve occult symbolism and ritual.  Look at Podesta's 14-fish.  Look up Alistair Crowley.  This is their thing.

              Pedophilia was already (almost) normalized, in the 60s. That was the closest it ever came to being totally normalized.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since the 70s the trend went into the other direction, and it's now seen by most people as the worst crime...
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't see pedophilia being normalized. I see the opposite trend. Pedophiles are reviled and detested, just look at #PizzaGate

             I have to say, as well, Terasol and Besta Pizza I don’t think are involved. The agent of Besta Pizza's name was similar to that of the man who used to work on the human trafficking unit, but it has been proven they aren't the same person.

            Terasol could be a coincidence (although I doubt it), but Besta's logo is spot-on, the same one shown as THE FbI boylover logo, on boylover.net website, AND Elpida's logo.  It's true we have no other evidence against Besta or Terasol at this point, but the logos are not to be ignored.

            Andrew Kline is not the owner of Besta Pizza, only an attorney for the owners.  Also the Andrew Kline in the DOJ is a different guy.  Besta is owned by Uptown Pizza, INC.  That means it is owned by shareholders.

            It's as important to debunk as it is to come up with leads. Skepticism is fundamental. There is too much wold speculation going on and people just take it as fact for some reason. We need to stick to what is solid. The best way to proceed when approaching new people is :
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              tell them about Dutroux and Saville to prove to them that such things do happen and the media does cover it up
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              then show the podesta emails which cannot be explained other than being a secret code
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              then show the suspicious Instagram screenshots etc.

           </ul>

            Unfortunately so many infographic that are spread around are pushing the "je aime Les enfants " thing. Or saying James Alefantis is the guy with the l'enfants t shirt. It's all so wrong, so many misinformation spread around!

            Personally I also don't think Marina Abramovic / Spirit Cooking is essential to pizzagate. I dont see it. Yes she's a crazy postmodern artist you knoe how many there are out there? What she does is not that crazy in the context of modern art. It's almost the norm.

             Owner of Besta is Uptown Pizza, INC.  It's a corporation, folks.  That means multiple shareholders.  Find out who the shareholders are, or if Uptown is owned by a larger entity.
