<blockquote>
<p><strong>Esperanto</strong> (/ˌɛspəˈræntoʊ/ or /-ˈrɑː-/;[5][6] in Esperanto: [espeˈranto]   listen (help·info)) is a constructed international auxiliary language. It is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world.[7] The Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof published the first book detailing Esperanto, Unua Libro, on 26 July 1887. The name of Esperanto derives from Doktoro Esperanto (&quot;Esperanto&quot; translates as &quot;one who hopes&quot;), the pseudonym under which Zamenhof published Unua Libro.[8https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto</p>

            I have a feeling Michigan is about to be scammed big time.  If they fall for this, they will continue the scam and they will run him as Pres.  Another clone of Obama Trudeau and Macron.  Carbon Copies. Hot off the Press.

            I get the feeling people still don't understand this whole process. The future leaders are chosen as children are through bloodlines. They are placed in the possession of CIA mind control programs where trauma induced compartmentalizations occurs. The alters are taught the skills they will need such as Marksman, sexual blackmail, etc. They are also trained to tell stories (lies) without even blinking. It is called being a sociopath. Rhoades Scholars are not what you think. Most of it is BS as is their college degrees, law degrees, etc. These are provided for them.

            He delivered the commencement speech alongside Bill Clinton and is a Harvard Rhodes Scholar like BC.  This award from Paul &amp; Daisy is for New Americans which implies he is an Immigrant (at least that is what it sounds to me).  But he was born in Detroit. WHAT is wrong with this whole picture?  Do they really think that enough people will vote for him as Pres. Candidate?  Nope I doubt it.

            I wonder if any of you will see the subtext here.  Only an ethnic minority stands to gain from ridiculous utopian goals like an artificial global language.

            Since Soros is evil he obviously isnt just being generous: every prominent immigrant is another brick in the "melting pot" wall, the ONLY RESULT OF WHICH is an improvement in the position of the Jews as the demographic gaps narrow between races.
