<p><strong>Rule 6: No Link Posts</strong> -- <strong>Only</strong> editable submissions made with the &quot;Discuss&quot; button are allowed. &quot;Link&quot; submissions have been banned by the community for the reasons described <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods/2460205#submissionTop">here</a>.

<h1>Six Reasons &quot;Link&quot; submissions suck for <a href="https://voat.co/v/Pizzagate">v/Pizzagate</a> research</h1>
<ol>
<li>They can\'t be edited to meet our submission rules, and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2418023">frequently have to be removed</a> because of this</li>
<li>They can be used by trolls to direct-link to dangerous sites (examples in Removed Submissions)</li>
<li>They make it easy for trolls to spam &quot;PGisStupid&quot; style memes and shitty YouTube videos</li>
<li>They make it impossible for authors to edit posts to incorporate the often stellar crowdsourced research contributed by other users in the Comments.</li>
<li>When shared off-platform such as by retweet, especially by phone where only headlines show depending on screen settings, they inadvertantly bury the crowdsourced analysis and discoveries that shed light on events mentioned in MSM articles, destroying the redpill value. Non-Voat users clicking a Voat submission shared in a tweet, will probably click the headline, taking them directly to the MSM article (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2328393">for example</a>) and never see the crowdsourced analysis in the Comments.</li>
<li>It seems unfair and inconsistent to require Discuss posts to provide short descriptions of all linked content and their relevance under Rule 3, but allow Link posts that only have a headline from which such matters must often be inferred.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, our developer <a href="https://voat.co/user/Heygeorge">@Heygeorge</a> will also soon be able to tweak our CSS to remove the Link button. Until then, please resist the temptation to submit with it.</p>
<p>Soon, PuttItOut is supposed to institute a referendum system that will allow us to easily revisit the ruleset, so we can consider this an experiment we can change later, if the consensus after trying it is negative.</p>

            Control freaks are blind to see their own arrogance, in the name of political correctness. Seems like its time to create a NEW Board, where?

            I have 2 new threads for this forum. The posting rules are way, way too confusing to me re my lack of tech ability. Is there a Mod I can send the info directly? Otherwise I'll have to pass as it's just too stressful given my current physical health condition. Know you would like to know the new info but it is what it is, so sorry.

             I think you are misunderstanding. Please include links in posts! That's what we're all about. This rule just means you can't use the "Share a Link" submission button that only presents a url and a headline. You need to use the Discuss button, which has a headline field and a discussion field allowing 10,000 words -- plenty of room to share as many links as you want and explain why they're important to Pizzagate. :-)

            This place became a ghost town because of moderator faggotry, now it will be a haunted house with a few kike mods jerking  eachother off wondering where all the visitors went. Perhaps thats the plan anyway. As if we cant decide for ourselves what is strong or weak eveidence. Relevant or irrelevant. We need a fucking babysitter to tell us whats valid information? We cant figure it out ourselves. We need mods to frame it. We'll see how this experiment goes. Kiked. Soon there will be nothing to moderate. Hot New and Top, will all have the same 3 posts! Lol
I had fun sifting through all the weird and random shit that used to pop up. It was half the reason I came back. "Sorry, Deleted submission, Jewish rabbis sucking baby dicks is irrelevant to pizzagate" or "Talmud says its ok to fuck 3yr old babies as long as they are not jewish is also irrelevant, Deleted"
Bull. Fucking, Shit. It is.

             well said.  I was on this forum from the start, the info being shared back then was free and leading to important discoveries. Now its not given a chance by oppressive rules that limits potential leads. Who are these people that moderate?

            Big deal if they can’t edit the original post. People read the comments. Your excuse is nothing more than that. You may present a valid reason why one is better but absolutely fail in your attempt to prove this somehow INCREASES the share of information.

            Stop being a faggot. The claim made by vindicator was that this rule change actually increases information flow. Nice try at deflecting.

            What's interesting, the New Yorker had an article on REDDIT in the March 19th, 2018 edition.  It spoke of the pizzagate sub being shut down. They said it was because people were listing people's names and contact information. This was a big fat lie. If people break the rules, they are banned. If they try and get in with another name using the same IP address, they are banned from REDDIT. That is how they operate. To remove a popular sub for any other reason, is subterfuge.

             Well there was a hell of a list of people's names, address and phone# during the Hamstead Kids thing. I don't recall what sites they were posted on. I am presuming the huge DOX was one reason the brits took the free net away.

              Really? Limiting the ways information can be spread and disseminated while giving the mods more selective power over what meets the standards will result in more information being spread?! Interesting. I’d love to hear how

               How does this limit the way information can be spread any more than the focused nature of this subverse always has? It doesn't. Submitting Discuss posts that can be edited to meet submission rules if they have problems means fewer removals, not more.
              </p>
              <p>
               How does it give mods any more "selective power"? The content-related rules have not changed in the slightest.

                How does the change increase the information flow as you claim? Any censorship is bad. If something is shit it will be proven as such.

              I, for one, actually approve of this change.
It's not so much lazy research, but poor sportsmanship sorta (can't think of the proper term right now) to just throw a link up without any details, and then someone clicks the post link from the Hot/New or whatever to get to the post and the comments as a page so they can read the article and the comments inline, and end up on some hack news posting place that just chops up and reposts other sites' articles to make something sound so much worse than it is or make someone much more of a criminal than they really are.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even if you have to spend a whopping half-hour typing up a post, and paste the link at some point in the post, that's not a bad thing, people.  You can expound your personal views on the content of the link, bad mouth people left and right, get into a week-long debate in the article, say that everyone is a Satanic child-molesting Jew who's sacrificing kids to feed Hillary, just put in some effort into the blasted post!
People can spend days back-and-forthing over one little nitpicky point, but can't spend ten minutes to make a half-assed post? (raised eyebrow) Really? (/end raised eyebrow)   (it's been too long since I tried to make comedy HTML tags)
             </p>
             <p>
              (And, yes... my average post takes over an hour to type up... it's called Notepad... sometimes, MS Word is used to make sure the grammar makes sense if alcohol has been involved)

              It's been taken over by the shills. May have been a project of theirs the entire time. Now they're just peddling "Q", the storm, and cheerleading for Trump. Total psyop.

              I was always one of the sticklers for true pizzagate posts, not general abuse by non-political elites.  Pizzagate whatever is for that stuff.

               What you're calling for is compartmentalization, which is how the elite work. The tentacles are deep and widespread, so if we kept it to just politicians, we wouldn't be able to talk about Hellywood. How many times did Obama have closed door meetings with Hollywood elite?

               I don't feel the need to expand further. If you don't understand why or how Pizzagate is beyond DC politics, I can't help you.

              Controlling the narrative to clutter up a post to "your" standards will never be understood if one dictates the content.
If he was a bot, I can see why deleting it must happen, yet this site archives posts so comment can't be added. That is censorship at a base level. Then you make the same red tape that the Pedo protectors use to shut down comments and you think this is good?
             </p>
             <p>
              Any form of censorship is evil. This site is now helping pedos with rules, regs and Bloated pervert protectors.

               . This is a sub for research. Share-a-Link posts in which the OP provides zero content and merely links to something somewhere else are not research. The submitter is not exercising his right to free speech because he is not saying anything, so how in hell can it be considered censorship?

              More content to nitpick at. Most people are aware these rules come in increments. It wouldn't surprise me in 2-3 years from now the subject of pedophilia is completely banned from this sub, elite or not. Especially elite.

               We only remove posts in which the submitter does not explain how it's directly related to the sexual abuse of kids by the elite, with links to support for all major claims, and an accurate title, and that is after giving folks 24 Hours to edit. We only ban users who show a pattern of disrespecting these requirements.

                That's putting a lot of trust in the moderation team and not a lot of trust in the users who upvote and downvote what they think is important and relevant to the topic at hand.  More control rather than less control is gaining popularity all over the web lately.

                 Well, it's what the sub voted to do after we had CP linked. Also, the submitter has total control over whether his submission is exposed to votes.
