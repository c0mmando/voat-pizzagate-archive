<p>this is a signal that the White House is trouble with regards to Russiagate.</p>
<p>There is not one snowball heading down the mountain aimed out the White House there are multiple.</p>
<p>Here\'s one of the major stories that broke today. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/blackwater-founder-held-secret-seychelles-meeting-to-establish-trump-putin-back-channel/2017/04/03/95908a08-1648-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html?utm_term=.646d3dda625c">Blackwater founder held secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump-Putin back channel</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladi­mir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump, according to U.S., European and Arab officials.</p>
<p>The meeting took place around Jan. 11 — nine days before Trump’s inauguration — in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean, officials said. Though the full agenda remains unclear, the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is related to Pizzagate?  Prince is a major figure in the pizzagate story.  In fact, he was responsible for deliver one of major pieces of propaganda to the pizzagate research community.   After Comey\'s first letter to Congress on the Weiner laptop, but before it was known  that the FBI could reveal all the material before the election. Erik Prince went on Steve Bannon\'s radio show and <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/">dropped a batch of propaganda</a> to drive the story in way most damaging to Clinton.  He made many outrageous claims including Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin &quot;had flipped&quot; and become government informants against Hillary and the emails proved multiple crimes against Hillary Clinton.  Unfortunately for Prince, Comey had a team of FBI agents reviewing the actual evidence.  Three days later, Comey released his review that there was nothing damning on the laptop destroying the entire Prince propaganda effort.</p>
<p>Many people are still convinced there is something to Prince\'s story.  However the very basis of his story is fake.  He claims his sources were in the NYPD.  One problem with this story NYPD never had the laptop.  The US attorney subpoenaed the laptop and the FBI seized it.  
</p>
<p>In addition to Prince working a back channel to Russis before Trump became president.  Another piece of Russiagate involves Prince.</p>
<p>CNN reports the FBI is still looking at a Trump Organization server that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/09/politics/fbi-investigation-continues-into-odd-computer-link-between-russian-bank-and-trump-organization/index.html">80% of its communications were with a Russian Bank</a>.  That, in and of, itself is odd.  Another odd bit is 19% were with Eric Prince\'s sister company, Spectrum Health.  His sister is now the Secretary of Education despite not having an education background.</p>
<p>Why would a server exist were 99% of the activity were a bank in Russia and a Health Company in Michigan?  Some citizens researchers think they have found an answer.  This was discovered before the election and computers couldn\'t figure what was going on.  Now so new info has come out.</p>
<p>The timing of these communications were not random. The Trump server was communicating with Alfa and then Spectrum every hour. Then it would go to sleep. 
<a href="https://teapainusa.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/ping-duration.jpg?w=436&amp;h=453">Timing of Server Pings</a></p>
<p>This is similar to how you keep databases in sync.   Now that we now Prince was working with the Russians, this Trump-Russia-Prince/Devos connection is going to become a big story.</p>
<p>The way Devin Nunes acted last week.  The big attempt to try and change to story to Susan Rice this week (guess what, there\'s nothing illegal in what she did and she did not have authority to approve an unmasking to this Cernovic thing all tell a story.   The Trump White House is very worried about this investigation.</p>',

            Trump tweeted about Cernovic today.   I stand by my accusation.  They leaked info to him.  He lied about where he got it.
           </p>
           <p>
            They want the story to be about Rice. Not the fact that the FBI has confirmed they are investigating the Trump campaign for Collusion with the Kremlin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Report today is that the FBI is creating a special unit to conduct this investigation, because it's getting too big, there's so many avenues of investigation to track down.

             AreWeSure your Democratic Party is dying. The truth is coming out, all of it. 9/11, Sandy Hook, Claude d'Estree's doppleganger at the Boston Marathon, Brownstone Ops, everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             What do you think is going to happen when this country finds out Sandy Hook was a Fema "Capstone Exercise" and each parent was paid $281,000 for their "performance".
            </p>
            <p>
             All the secrets are coming out AreWeSure. Your mind is going to have a tough time handling reality this Summer. Many Democrats will melt into a puddle of ooze.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Truth will out. It always has and always will.

            This is not true. His letter only addressed the Hillary email server: "Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton." So, Hillary was extremely careless and sent &amp; received classified info, but the FBI did not recommend prosecution.

           <p>
            Again, this is not true. The NYPD’s Special Victims Unit was in possession of the laptop while they were investigating Weiner.

             Your link doesn't show NYPD had the laptop.  That article is the day after the story broke.  It just shows the feds and the NYPD we're interested. 
 Read the first sentence of that article.  The feds got the subpoena first.  The NY times confirmed the FBI seized the laptop. .

            What an entertaining post, AreWeSure. We've got the Twitter talking points from this morning now formalized into a carefully laid out post on Voat. And then we get to enjoy AreWeSure vs. ArmySeer (InfoWarFailedPsyOp) pretend to battle it out. Are they two different users, or one LARPer? It's Mystery Science Theater: You get to decide!

              This is the beauty of shilling -- the more they do it, the more they teach people how to recognize it. If it were just a crumb here and there, the pattern wouldn't be obvious. But their message is so weak, and their position so tenuous, they can't resist frequent repetition.

            Epic. You're quoting an article from the Washington Post, a.k.a. the CIA's press office. The WaPo is literally a division of the CIA. It's not even debatable. To give some perspective of how hard they try at pushing disinformation here's an article from 1994 telling people that nothing happened in Mena Airport and that people really need to "move along" because "there's nothing to see here":

            There is nothing there AreWeSure. Even Barack Obama didn't think there was enough evidence to act on. All the Democrats are doing is helping to accelerate the collapse of the giant house of cards they've built for themselves the past 8 years.

            Democrats are their own worst enemy. There are 1000+ examples. My favorite is Hillary Clinton calling 100,000,000+ poor and destitute Americans just shit out the bottom of the Middle Class a "Basket of Deplorables".

             The Susan Rice is a smokescreen. It's legal for the NSA to ask for the identity of miminized names to see if there are any other national security issues raised by the names. She cannot do this by herself.

             A Former Trump Adviser Met With A Russian Spy
            </a>
            Carter Page told BuzzFeed News that he had been in contact with at least one Russian spy working undercover out of Moscow’s UN office in 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            Page confirmed he was the person identified as MALE1 in a court documents about a Russian spy ring seeking information on sanctions and that he passed documents on the energy industry to someone later outed as a Russian spy.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's still unclear how Page got on the Trump Campaign.  Supposedly through Jeff Sessions.  EDIT he may have just been on a list that Sessions presented, but somebody else put him on that list.  This was always a big question, because they presented him as a foreign policy expert and nobody had heard of him before.  He was only know for making deals in Russia.  Somebody wanted this guy on Trump's Team and it wasn't for his expertise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was revealed
            <a href="https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a">
             to be paid $10 million a year to promote Russia by a Russian Oligarch.
            </a>
            .  Manafort is also being investigating for money laundering as it came out this month that he bought millions of dollars in NYC for cash through shell companies and also is connected to 15 different bank account in a suspect bank in Cyprus.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know folks here dismiss the mainstream media, but there is a lot to this story AND the White House behavior indicates they do not welcome this scrutiny.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN16Y1H6">
             Jared Kushner met an executive from a Russian state bank under sanctions.
            </a>
            The exeutive, Sergei Gorkov, chairman of Vnesheconombank was appointed by Putin and is a graduate of the FSB Academy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole Devin Nunes story turned out to be a lie.  He claimed to receive info from a whistleblower.  A few days later it was revealed to two low level WH aides.  Aides would probably would not have done this on their own.

              Carter Page admitted to ABC News tonight that Russian Spies tried to recruit him in that case I just mentioned.  The spy who tried to recruit worked for the same bank Kushner met with.

               Kushner and Trump are too rich to care about making money. Unlike career politicians who use their political power to make their money, these are rich guys who made money first, and now want to help America.

                Both Trump and Kushner have giant debts.  Kushner owes a billion dollars on one building 666 5th Aven.  Until Wednesday,
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/nyregion/talks-end-between-kushners-and-chinese-company.html?_r=0">
                 Kushner was working with the Chinese company tied to the families of the Communist leaders to invest in his building.
                </a>
                Real Estate folks are not very liquid.   High payroll costs and assets they can't turn into cash quickly.
               </p>
               <p>
                Kushner' family bought the office building at
                <strong>
                 666 5th Ave
                </strong>
                in January 2007 right before the financial crisis.  The vastly overpaid like double the price.  Then rents dropped.
               </p>
               <p>
                They have a 1.2 billion mortgage just on this building alone.   The building doesn't cover its current debt payments.  It's already costing them $10 million a year out of their pocket and they have to scramble to get finance to cover this 1.2 billion which they have to pay back in two years.  If he doesn't work this out, his family is about to be poor.
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                A few years ago had to sell half their interest to Steve Roth's Vornado Company and give veto power over any deals with the building.  Roth is going to be in charge of infrastructure spending under Trump.  A chance to make billions.
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember Trump won't release his taxes and his financial disclosure report was pretty vague.
               </p>
               <p>
                He reported 365 million in debt prior to the election.   The WSJ reported this year, it might be $1.5 billion more than that.

                He created his own mortgage securities cover over a billion dollars of debt and sold them to about 150 different institutions.  Some of this debt he has personally guaranteed.
