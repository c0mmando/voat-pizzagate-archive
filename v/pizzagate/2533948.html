            What should also be mentioned is Branson's part in the privatisation of the NHS.  In this TED talk the speaker points out that in the future doctors working under Virgin Care may decide not to treat older people for a variety of reasons:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/Cz5dl9fhj7o?t=10m28s">
             https://youtu.be/Cz5dl9fhj7o?t=10m28s
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that he was in Epstein's black book and Epstein is a eugenicist. This recent article details the £1Bn contracts Branson is getting out of UK healthcare:
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/29/richard-branson-virgin-scoops-1bn-pounds-of-nhs-contracts">
             https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/29/richard-branson-virgin-scoops-1bn-pounds-of-nhs-contracts
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            and in this article he sues the NHS because he lost out on an £82M contract to provide
            <strong>
             children’s health services
            </strong>

            Aargh, Narcissism, I'm just in, and saw that the thread was deleted due to not being edited. It's a great post, and there are great user contributions - would you consider editing, and reposting, please?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you shouldn't have the time, maybe someone else could do it? Thank you!

            <p>
             This is EXTREMELY important info! Since this thread has been deleted, PLEASE put this in its own post and submit. Header should link to STORM Model Management and MADDIE MCCANN. I'm really afraid this is going to get lost and that no one will see it now so it should be in its own submission.

             Our beautiful friend Emma Chambers has died at the age of 53.  We're very very sad.  She was a great, great comedy performer, and a truly fine actress.  And a tender, sweet, funny, unusual, loving human being.
            </p>
            <p>
             Emma Freud is the daughter of Sir Clement Freud
            </p>
            <p>
             She is the great-granddaughter of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud
            </p>
            <p>
             Her younger brother is Matthew Freud, the ex-husband of Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth Murdoch

               The MISSING PEOPLE UK Charity and some very questionable patrons - further connections to paedophilia
              </a>
              you'll see Branson's involvement with a charity that Kate McCann is an ambassador for.  It also mentions Pete Townsend and Simon Cowell.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In 2003, Who guitarist Pete Townshend was arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography. Police officers impounded seven computers from his £15 million ($25.5 million) home in Richmond, Surrey. Four months later Townshend received a warning as no evidence was found on his computers.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              It just so happens that Sarah Doukas has connections to Pete Townsend of the Who.
              <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/john-doukas-earthquake-sarah-doukas-husband-has-died">
               In this article
              </a>
              about her first husband :
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Doukas met John whilst she was a young model, hanging out at The Who's Ramport Studio in Battersea where they were recording.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              And the Simon Cowell connection is via Simon Fuller who bought STORM

               Simon Fuller snaps up Storm model agency

             </p>
             <p>
              So, the McCanns, Missing People Charity, Porton Down, intelligence services, half of the British entertainment industry - they are all linked.

             RB

            gossip from my london friends, one used to work in the fashion scene:

            ) based in the ultra expensive
            <strong>
             Chelsea

            area of London. It is best known for
            <em>
             'discovering'

            herself has a well documented history with drink, drugs and violence all stemming from being repeatedly raped by pretty much the entire industry when she was just 14. Kate spent a lot of time with RB when she was 14.

             On Necker Island, we are currently supporting The Robinson O'Neal Memorial Primary School. The Robinson O'Neal Memorial Primary School was one of the first schools in the area to be built for education purposes only in 1971. Prior to 1971, schools were housed in churches until the government began providing public buildings dedicated to education.

             Sunshine Daycare/Pre-school is located in Handsome Bay, Virgin Gorda and is run by Marcia Jessop and a team of loving carers. The nursery, located upstairs accepts children from 3 months and up to enable parents to return to work following the allowed government maternity leave period. The pre-school downstairs is focused on teaching the children the fundamentals to start their education early before heading off to kindergartens and primary schools in the territory.

             Valley Day school is situated in the middle of the Valley, Virgin Gorda. It was started in the late 70s by the Holders, who had passion to teach young children to read. The school educates children from the ages of 4 through 12 years old and is now run by a mix of like-minded local and expatriate teachers. The teachers focus on educating the youth of the community, focusing on those who need financial assistance or special needs.

                   Probably because they cannot trust the phones/emails, have to make sure the deals are done in person.  They cannot trust anyone these days I guess, people previously 'in on it' are probably doing deals left right and centre trying to save their own necks!

                  Very interesting indeed.  He and BC are involved with so much dealing and wheeling their feet never touch soil.  We have now discovered RB has this nefarious charity for school kids and who knows what else.  There is no end to the evil these people will do.  Everyone of them almost has a foundation if they are anyone.  They are all fakes.

               By accident.  Shocked me actually.  In the FB pgs.  There are children pic shots where only 1 child is pictured, and there are a slew of them.  I have always been suspicious by that.  For Sale?  Pretty obvious to me, imo.  There is something pretty sketchy about this Pack for Purpose.

               Go after the puppet masters ... there's only a handful. Lots and lots of perv followers, but they'll be rounded up easily. It's the big guys that have to be taken down and given a lifetime of luxury at Hotel Gitmo.

And there he is ... now on his own island and trying to do such good for the planet in eliminating carbon emissions ... meanwhile ... in his underground tunnels ...

            Pretty interesting that Obama left office and immediately went on extended holiday with Branson (without Michele).  One of the photos looks like wrestling lovers.  See [

            There is so much wrong with this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please stick to facts. Sure, ask questions, but many of your "assumptions" are weak at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having actually been to Necker Island, I can assure you whilst it might be "next door" in a global sense, it really isn't that close. In fact Necker is in British Virgin Islands, and Epsteins pedo island is in US Virgin Islands.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your "link" about his use of the word "Virgin" in his company name - does that mean ALL Virgin islands should be included?
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately Jimmy Savile ran a cover where he helped hundreds of children as part of his TV show, and literally hundreds of people and companies would have been involved in helping provide these experiences.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously, I've been here in voat since Pizzagate, I am woke. I'm well aware of the global epidemic of child trafficking and satanic bullshit, BUT a lot of your statements are just opinions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please stop your bullshit and focus on facts. If you have legitimate questions, then phrase it as a question. Don't just write statements as if its a fact. Fuck sake.

           <p>
            This statement is factually inaccurate, Narcissism. It's not a "book of people who visited the island." It's his address book. There are many many people in the book who have not visited the island, including people who he only met once, briefly, at events he didn't even host. Asserting that the book is a list of island visitors is disinfo and will be labeled as such if not correctled.

             , fair enough that they may never have visited, but I must say after reading Dave McGowan, Cathy O'Brien and Brice Taylor, their are a fair few on this list that are SERIOUS molestation suspects: Kissinger, McAlpine, Elizabeth, Andrew, Jimmy Buffet, Alan Dershowitz, Ghislane Maxwelll, Charlie Rose etc. And these are only people I've read somewhere that are accused of these things in books. Maybe they aren't all guilty of molestation, but they certainly do hang with some icky people and fruit doesn't fall far from the tree.

            Have not tied JP to RB yet.  Still looking.  Richard Branson is on the Board of Dir.  of ICMCE and so is Tony P.  There must be some connection here.

              Dick Gregory was a comedian and Civil Rights activist that spoke out against the New World Order. He just died in Washington DC in 2017. In this interview he speaks out about how he believes the global elite killed Prince. The day Prince died, Queen Elizabeth turned 90. She was in Washington DC with Obama. He also believes Prince was killed while on a plane owned by Warren Buffett who’s in with the evil cabal. He owns many airline companies and I wonder if he also owned the one Carrie Fisher “ODed” on. Anyway, this interview is interesting. Maybe this is one of the reasons Chris didn’t board one of his flights and chose to rent a car shortly before his death. See his interview here –

              There is much in here connecting Branson Hillary etc. with lots of others.  Amazing.  The things you find while researching are astonishing sometimes.

            Good thread, but yeah, links next time. You got the info, so share even simplistic links to what the source of your knowledge is. Very well thought out however. You nailed it how obvious all the connetions are. Just needs some documentation.

            Just one of these things may not raise suspicions.  Add them all up and his Sorry Bum is in Trouble.  Again, only a Narcissist would name his business Virgin.  Another Look at Me Ignoramus.

            Each one of these pieces of evidence, if not common knowledge, needs to be sourced with a link.  Please ping myself or another mod after having done so, so that we can remove the flair...otherwise this will have to be deleted in 24hrs.  Please do try to dig up some links (I'm sure the community will help), as RB
            <em>

              please can you ask Ben to remove the 24 hour flair? Do not want to be disrespectful to the fantastic mods whatsoever, but as you can see Think, there are some excellent contributions to this thread and its clear how integral RB is to the overall PG research, correct?

               has to edit his post to add links for every claim. If he doesn't do so, you or someone else can make a new thread with proper documentation that doesn't make unsourced, speculative claims using everything that has been gathered here. The entire mod team nearly got the boot a couple of weeks ago from kevdude because we allowed unsourced discussion with a 24 hour flair. We aren't allowed to remove the flair on a rule-breaking post until it has been fixed. Sorry.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, no one is saying this isn't relevant (Rule 1). But it does need to have links to sources (Rule 2).

               I think we should at least make an attempt to look into his Pack for a Purpose, among other finds.  I feel there is something sinister going on with that place.  These people do not spend time doing things for kids unless they can make money at it or get money for them.  Do they put them up to be ordered for guests, Idk, it looks pretty fishy.

             this is the LAST place every claim would need a source.

            <p>
             fabricating disinfo is INTERWOVEN between proven facts to bolster an argument;  this is clearly stated as OLD EVIDENCE ALREADY PROVEN on a known person of interest.

            There's cooncidence.. then there are too many coincidences... right now, all of this puts him in the right places and with the right people, and that's deeply concerning...  also, they tried to recruit him to nxivm, and apparently somewhere, there is evidence of that.

             Let's not forget Branson's account of the recent 2017 Caribbean hurricane that ripped through the Virgin Is. including Branson's Necker Is:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Besides detailing the storm's aftermath, Branson wrote about his experiences before the storm. He shared pictures of him playing games and crowding in two bedrooms with other team members on the island before they all headed into the wine cellar at Necker's Great House to stay safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             "All of us slept together in two rooms. I haven't had a sleepover quite like it since I was a kid," Branson wrote in one post. "Strangely, it's a privilege to experience what is turning into possibly the strongest storm ever with such a great group of YOUNG people."
