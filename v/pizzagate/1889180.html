            This is some truth. Wikileaks received several tranches of documents including direct hand off of thumb drives. That is why three of their attorneys were murdered last summer. Seth was involved. The Russia story is false and it is in their own writing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI "discovering" the hack was based on their monitoring of Wikileaks not a foreign government intrusion. This is why the DNC servers were never examined by the FBI. CrowdStrike was not just a Ukrainian founded security research deeper into the history of the father and his knowledge of nuclear technology.
Obama used CrowdStrike as well and there are rumors they actually installed "cryptic" keys that would make them indispensable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would like to point out that Warren Flood was Joe Biden &amp; Barack Obama High Tech official. There are pictures of him.
           </p>
           <p>
            On June 15th the day this was done there were a group of exclusive visitors to the Whitehouse. They were Ukrainian. Not sure they ever checked in but pictures have been provided &amp; names. W.Flood was also their and there are pictures.
           </p>
           <p>
            This might not be his real name but instead be a CIA indentity but he did work in the Obama campaign then Administration the whole 8 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            This means the DNC was aware that an insider was the leaker all along. As well as the media, the intelligence communities, the FBI, &amp; the Whitehouse.
           </p>
           <p>
            They all lied and even worse used the lie to surveille US persons on the Trump campaign in violation of their constitutional rights. They tapped them, recorded phone calls, and even unmasked them in absolute violation of the 4th ammendment.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Russia story was bogus &amp; they knew it and conspired to not only use it and falsify documents making attribution to Russia, they used it to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens.
           </p>
           <p>
            And on top of that they unmasked Seth Rich and knowing he could blow their cover they set up an operation to interrogate him to see who he had told them kill him.
           </p>
           <p>
            The players involved were at the Whitehouse 4 days prior to his murder including Joe Capone &amp; Bob Creamer. After the shooting Seth was still alive because it was botched somehow. The D.C. Police were ordered to stand down. He was initially saved through surgery which was relatively safe and he was stable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suddenly the hospital is swarming with Officers and Seth is moved to a seperate area as a VIP &amp; residents are not allowed to check on him. Dr. Sava takes over his care and within s few hours he is suddenly pronounced dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Sava has been to the whitehouse 26 times on record and is friends with John Podesta, Tony Podesta, Heather Podesta who happens to be on D.C. Police board.
           </p>
           <p>
            UN-fuc..ing believable.
           </p>
           <p>
            And this happens while HRC is under FBI investigation for the classified emails, the corrupt Foundation, Benghazi the year before.
           </p>
           <p>
            These people all knew including Obama. For those who do not yet know it was released yesterday that the FISA court had discovered 2 weeks before the election that the Obama whitehouse &amp; Administration had been violating the constitution continuously over the past 5 years of millions of American citizens. Searching emails, phone calls, texts, etc. without following any of the minimization standards. Obama allowed massive abuse giving many people easy access to search in violation of the law. This was not the "bad guys" this was American citizens and anyone who opposed his policies including spying on Supreme Court Justices, politicians, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            The court stated it is the most damning abuse of power they have ever seen. The Obama Whitehouse even lied to the court. This is not BS it is a scathing legal ruling handed down by the FISA court. MSM will not report on it. A whistleblower from the NSA went to James Comey personally two years ago &amp; was granted immunity to expose this. Comey did nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Trump was talking about being "witetapped" this is what he meant. Comey knew it was true and allowed it saying nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fired.

            What a bunch of hooey.
           </p>
           <p>
            The DNC hack does not begin in June 2016.  And it does not begin with the DNC.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI discovered the hack and informed the DNC about it in 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hacking groups behind this have been known to security researchers for years.  They have labelled these groups Advanced Persistent threats 28 and 29
APT 28 has been around since at least 2007.
APT 29  has been around since at least 2008.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no way the DNC could have faked being these threats.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the Warren Flood documents.  Flood is the original author.   However, he is not the last person to edit the file.

            The Malware control servers used in the hack of the DNC were the same servers used when Russia hacked the German Parliment and other institutions throughout Europe.

            I just have one major question about this:
            <strong>
             Do we know the dates on the files that WikiLeaks received?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            If they are dated June 15 and contain the "Russian" fingerprints, then byecomey's claim that WikiLeaks received the info from a different source (Seth) would fall apart.

            Hmmm....this is good stuff. I though the whole Seth rich thing had nothing to do with PG, but if it can be shown that high level intelligence was responsible for illegally working with the dnc, it can show that the letter agencies are corrupt. If they are not working for our country, who are they working for? If the dnc is not working for our country, who are they working for? (Same with rnc, btw). Who is colluding and calling the shots?

             Of note (to me at least)
"I cannot say if Crowdstrike is competent, but I can say that their co-founder and CTO, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, a think tank whose policies could be termed as anti-protectionist."
            </p>
            <p>
             Atlantic Council:
            </p>
            <p>
             The Atlantic Council has, since its inception, been a nonpartisan institution, with members "from the moderate internationalist wings of both parties."[8] Despite its connections, the Council is by charter independent of the US government and NATO, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.[1] In March 2016, the organization met to discuss strategies for dealing with the populist movement in Europe, which they believe is threatening the globalist agenda on the continent.[9]
             <em>
              today we can see that as pure Soros Open Borders agenda and the term 'nonpartisan' hardly applies IMO
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             From Zero Hedge recently:
"In lieu of substantive evidence provided to the public that the alleged hacks which led to Wikileaks releases of DNC and Clinton Campaign Manager John Podesta’s emails were orchestrated by the Russian Government, CrowdStrike’s bias has been cited as undependable in its own assessment, in addition to its skeptical methods and conclusions. The firm’s CTO and co-founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank with openly anti-Russian sentiments that is funded by Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk, who also happened to donate at least $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2013, the Atlantic Council awarded Hillary Clinton it’s Distinguished International Leadership Award. In 2014, the Atlantic Council hosted one of several events with former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who took over after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in early 2014, who now lives in exile in Russia."
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              I always think of Soros War Franchises when I think of our involvement in the Ukraine...
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             The Atlantic Council, as I've mentioned in other posts, seems to be an important link. WaPo article claiming an anonymous source leaked to them  info of Trump's meeting with the Russians, they named Thomas P. Bossert, Trump's Homeland Security Advisor (who worked with Flynn btw), a former senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and G.W. Bush ties, as the one contacting the CIA and NSA by telephone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other Atlanta Council names:
Harlan Ullman has served on the Senior Advisory Group for Supreme Allied Commander Europe (2004-16) and is a senior adviser at Washington, D.C.'s Atlantic Council and Business Executives for National Security, chairman of two private companies and principal author of the doctrine of shock and awe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Harlan Ullman: DCLeaks emails reveal his involvement in seeming to encourage Ret. Gen Breedlove to push for war or hostilities with Russia:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, until recently the supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe, plotted in private to overcome President Barack Obama’s reluctance to escalate military tensions with Russia over the war in Ukraine in 2014, according to apparently hacked emails from Breedlove’s Gmail account that were posted on a new website called DC Leaks."
(btw, Seth Rich's death was only 10 days after General Breedlove's retirement.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Given these observations, Harlen Ullman's statement in this May 15, 2016 article
             <a href="http://archive.is/xi890">
              http://archive.is/xi890
             </a>
             regarding Russia's concerns over perceived US hostility towards Russia is curiously misleading...
"...He (Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov) also wrongly implied that Supreme Allied Commander had the authority to deploy forces and hence start a war."
             <em>
              yes but do they know you've been pushing the General to have Obama become more militarily aggressive towards Russia?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             "Obama defied political pressure from hawks in Congress and the military to provide lethal assistance to the Ukrainian government, fearing that doing so would increase the bloodshed and provide Russian President Vladimir Putin with the justification for deeper incursions into the country.
Breedlove, during briefings to Congress, notably contradicted the Obama administration regarding the situation in Ukraine, leading to news stories about conflict between the general and Obama. 
But the leaked emails provide an even more dramatic picture of the intense back-channel lobbying for the Obama administration to begin a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine."
            </p>
            <p>
             Other notable former Atlantic Council members:
"February 2009, also left to serve the administration: Susan Rice as ambassador to the UN"
Yes the same Susan Rice we've come to think of as a liar about the video, involved in unmasking, and her old but notable quote: "At the time of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Rice reportedly said, "If we use the word 'genocide' and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November election?"

              The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc, the U.S. State Department, and NATO ACT.

              Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations.

              The firm’s CTO and co-founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank with openly anti-Russian sentiments that is funded by Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk, who also happened to donate at least $10 million to the Clinton Foundation

             <p>
              Pinchuk became particularly friendly with Bill Clinton. In 2010, he invited the former president to his 50th birthday party in the French ski resort of Courchevel. In return, Pinchuk attended Clinton’s 65th in 2011, and was a guest at the inauguration of Clinton’s Presidential Library. The Clintons spoke at Pinchuk’s Yalta European Strategy conference, which seeks integration between Ukraine and Europe

            I avoided mentioning The_Donald because many people have a bias against the forum and will dismiss anything they see outright because of it. I still gave credit to the thread poster, byecomey, though, so I hope it's okay.
