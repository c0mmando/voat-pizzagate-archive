And he <a href="http://imgur.com/a/7cnac">likes them young</a>, too. He also likes kids (<a href="https://washingtonlife.smugmug.com/2016-PHOTOS/CityDance-DREAMscape-VIP-Dance/i-zGcGZkb">I guess</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Webre</strong> was at the Washington Ballet for 17 years. In that time, after <a href="http://www.ballet-dance.com/200406/articles/Webre20040401.html">initial</a> success and wild years he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/washington-ballets-septime-webre-turned-the-company-into-a-big-tent/2016/05/03/0927024c-0cba-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html">ran it into the ground</a>. Intense labor disputes, huge management turnover, failed prestige shows - a mess. But, even though his company shrunk to <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2015/08/23/washington-ballet-director-septime-webre-is-larger-than-life-so-why-is-his-company-still-small/">barely viable</a>, the YOUTH department expanded fourfold to over 1.000 kids of all ages over 5.</p>
<p>So, his first team selection has come down to the smallest of line-ups, while his youth system churns out hundreds of dancers a year. All for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_danc/the-least-shall-be-first-in-washington-ballets-nutcracker-kids-are-the-stars/2016/12/03/733a4612-b98a-11e6-9fa1-ff5eb54db157_story.html?utm_term=.2901c9efb11d">The Nutcracker</a>? Where do they go? Or should we ask, where were they from? Well, all over the world. Underage ballet dancers are the easiest trafficked minors. While a ballet student is usually older than 12, with the right connections earlier \'talent\' is often easily moved in.</p>
<p>And Webre has the easiest access of all to visa for his dancers: Geofrey Smith is a lawyer specializing in <a href="http://visasfordancers.com/index.html">visa for dancers</a>. He is also a former WB chairman of the board, and a <a href="http://www.thegeorgetowndish.com/thescene/mary-day-still-soul-washington-ballet">close friend</a> in any case. So Webre gets hundreds of visa a year for free for minors older than 12, and sometimes younger, from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Deborah Sigmund</strong> is <a href="http://www.georgetowner.com/articles/2012/jun/13/music-man-innocents-risk-honors-septime-webre/">well acquainted</a> with Webre. Sigmund\'s on the board of the WB too. She\'s the founder and CEO of Innocents at Risk, where Izette Folger is on the board. <a href="http://www.innocentsatrisk.org/about/what-we-do">Sigmund</a> is also a <a href="http://www.soroptimist.org/">Soroptimist</a>.</p>
<p>Sigmund\'s husband Donald was director of Meltzer Group Insurance Services. But at his death in 2014 gifts were to be addressed to<a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?pid=172838895"> three different non-profits</a>: Innocents at Risk, the Washington Ballet, and the Bishop John T. Walker School for Boys.</p>
<p>Now those names I recognized because they connected to earlier research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_Hall_Education_Arts_Recreation_Campus_(THEARC)">THEARC</a> - Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus - a &quot;cultural and social services campus in Washington, DCâ€™s Ward 8 (SE)\'. Its initial building cost: $27mn.</p>
<p><strong>THEARC</strong> is a 16.5-acre campus across the Anacostia in SE Washington, developed by DC Realtor Chris Smith and his associate John Ritz in 2005, via non-profit BBAR (Building Bridges Across Rivers) with support from <a href="http://www.liscdc.org/tag/thearc/">LISC</a>, an entirely <a href="http://www.lisc.org/about-us/board-of-directors/">Clintonite outfit</a> called the \'Local Initiatives Support Organization (spot the paradox?). </p>
<p>Alefantis is on the <a href="http://www.thearcdc.org/news/afterdark-thearc-gala-celebrates-nine-years-providing-services-ward-8">Host Committee</a> of THEARC fundraisers, &quot;after dark@thearc&quot;, which feature many usual suspects.And yes, despite its billing as a \'social and culltural campus&quot;, THEARC\'s focus seems to be almost exclusively on (young) children. </p>
<p>THEARC houses the Washington Ballet, the Corcoran Gallery (now defunct), Covenant House DC, the Washington School for Girls, Levine School of Music as well as a medical, dental and psychiatric clinic for children. </p>
<p>A $34 million <a href="http://www.liscdc.org/home-story/the-thearc-is-expanding/">expansion</a> will see a new facility to be finished this year will also house the John T. Walker School for Boys, the Children\'s National Health System clinic, the Phillips Collection, the Appletree Institute, and the David Lynch Foundation. It\'s a prestigious project with a lot of prestige attached.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2015/10/wc-smith-to-embark-on-34m-expansion-of-thearc-have.html">On THEARC</a>:
&quot;The celebrated Mississippi Avenue SE venue has hosted President Barack Obama twice. Its story was narrated by Gen. Colin Powell. Yoko Ono premiered her &quot;Imagine Peace&quot; exhibit there. NASA hosted its 50th anniversary event there. Doug E. Fresh gave a lesson on health there. It is home to nine nonprofits and a 365-seat community theater, and serves roughly 85,000 individuals annually.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong> I am not saying there\'s anything untoward about elite DC social circles sponsoring and supporting facilities for underprivileged children - even if I find the role of this Christopher J. Smith - who not only built and runs the facility through BBAR but also partners it with his WJ Smith Inc - rather dubious. Well I guess he has much <a href="https://www.bisnow.com/washington-dc/news/commercial-real-estate/the-10-biggest-dc-real-estate-stories-of-2016-69040">bigger fish</a> to fry now anyway.</p>
<p>However, most if not all of the non-profits involved have numerous intricate ties to the particular circle under investigation in Pizzagate: Alefantis, Maccoby-Folger, Webre, Sigmund etc, as well as the institutions (the Corcoran was founded by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilson_Corcoran">master freemason</a>, Phillips Gallery was run by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughlin_Phillips">CIA operative</a>). I could go on. </p>
<p>So I considered this worth a post, even if rambling at times, even if only for archiving purposes (I only archived locally, too tired now).</p>

            My God there has to be away to stop these freaking Evil Pedos from raising money and donating money to anything with children! 
Freeze All their assets and send them to an isolated island. Make sure they have no way of escaping! Let them fend for themselves! Evil Bastards!

             And send them no food,  just provide them with Abramovic  to teach them  cannibalism desensitisation skills.  That ought to clear the problem up real quick, since the global politicians and their helpers  appear to be doing almost nothing to check this situation.

            I was just following a potential lead and encountered Covenant House, which was founded by a priest who took in homeless boys and then banged them and resigned when it all came out.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was from looking at Maria Otero as POI, to whom Hillary recommended a Mr. Whitehead

             https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Whitehead
            </a>
            Since his bio includes high positions at Goldman Sachs, bilderberg, state dept 80s, the Fed, NYSE, the UN, and the Rockefeller group, I searched his name on voat and found a recent thread from a few days ago about a pedo called kloman who was defended in a signed letter by MARGARET WHITEHEAD  who I subsequent confirmed to be his sister. Sorry can't link cuz phone
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: LOL the connection is john whitehead founded another covenant house with a huge grant

            I'd upvote this if I could, but I had to restart a new account (forgot password). Charity upvotes welcome.

            In any case, keeping track of all of these connections is very important. I don't trust our DOJ to do their job. Somebody has to keep their feet to the fire.
