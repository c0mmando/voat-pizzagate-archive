<p>&quot;Jamie S. Gorelick (/ɡəˈrɛlɪk/; born May 6, 1950) is an American lawyer who served as the Deputy Attorney General of the United States from 1994 to 1997, during the Clinton administration. She has been a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr since July 2003 and also serves as a director of Amazon.com since February 2012.  Gorelick served on British Petroleum\'s Advisory Council, as their top legal counsel after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  She was appointed by former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle to serve as a commissioner on the bipartisan National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, which sought to investigate the circumstances leading up to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and also served as Vice Chairman of Fannie Mae.&quot;</p>
<p>Her views on privacy:</p>
<p>&quot;While serving as Deputy Attorney General under Bill Clinton, Gorelick spoke in favor of banning the use of strong encryption and called for a key escrow system to allow the Federal government access to encrypted communication.  Gorelick is a lobbyist for the lending industry fighting student loan reform]&quot;</p>
<p>She did a fantastic job while heading Fannie Mae:</p>
<p>Even though she had no previous training nor experience in finance, Gorelick was appointed Vice Chairman of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) from 1997 to 2003. She served alongside former Clinton Administration official Franklin Raines.During that period, Fannie Mae developed a $10 billion accounting scandal.On March 25, 2002, Business Week interviewed Gorelick about the health of Fannie Mae. Gorelick is quoted as saying, &quot;We believe we are managed safely. We are very pleased that Moody\'s gave us an A-minus in the area of bank financial strength – without a reference to the government in any way. Fannie Mae is among the handful of top-quality institutions.&quot;One year later, government regulators accused Fannie Mae of improper accounting &quot;to the tune of $9 billion&quot; in unrecorded losses.In an additional scandal concerning falsified financial transactions that helped the company meet earnings targets for 1998, a &quot;manipulation&quot; that triggered multimillion-dollar bonuses for top executives,Gorelick received $779,625.A 2006 report of an investigation by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight into Fannie Mae\'s accounting practices and corporate governance revealed that from 1998 to 2002 Gorelick received a total of $26.5 million in income from Fannie Mae.</p>
<p>And on 911:</p>
<p>According to Gorelick\'s op-ed letter in the Washington Post she states that: &quot;At last week\'s hearing, Attorney General John Ashcroft, facing criticism, asserted that \'the single greatest structural cause for September 11 was the wall that segregated criminal investigators and intelligence agents\' and that I built that wall through a March 1995 memo.&quot; However, the report from the 9/11 Commission, co-authored by Gorelick, asserts that the \'wall\' limiting the ability of federal agencies to cooperate had existed since the 1980s and is in fact not one singular wall but a series of restrictions created over the course of over twenty years.</p>',

             <p>
              What do you think we as Americans should be more worried about? The three Allegations you hastily made against JR (Kushner) 1)meeting in public with a known ambassador that spent time with Obama, Shumer, Pelosi, and the rest of congress...all the time and who McCain &amp; others sought campaign contributions from, or 2) the Russian bank guy who you allege Jared met as an intelligence asset? Apparently you have no problem with John Podesta &amp; HRC making what $35 million involving Russian money and Uranium One sales with their Canadian friend Frank Guistra.
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh yea what email was just released yesterday between Secretary of State HRC &amp; then FBI director Robert Mueller involving him personally and a sample of highly enriched Uranium on a tarmac....that is right it involved Uranium One I believe. But I am just a stupid citizen trying to do uphold the constitution so what do I know.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is odd that the then FBI director Mueller is on a tarmac meeting over samples of highly enriched uranium. And now he is Special Counsel after Obama gives the FBI job to his Protege' Comey during the HSBC terrorist money laundering scandal involving the Clinton Foundation of course. I am sure you are shocked the NYSD DA was Loretta Lynch at the time who settled the case with HSBC for $1.9 billion with no criminal charges, even though a whistleblower went straight to congress and the senate &amp; testified risking his life with documents proving the massive fraud &amp; terroist ties.
             </p>
             <p>
              Well It would not be shocking to you then that President O Attorney General Holder who at the time was being investigated by the house &amp; senate committees for fast &amp; furious, Benghazi, etc signed off on that deal and James Comey was placed on the board of the corrupt HSBC. Just a few months later Pres. Obama played musical chairs as AG Holder was held in Contempt of congress, Benghazi truth began to spill out, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              AG Holder resigned, Obama moved L. Lynch from NYSD after just settling HSBC with no criminal charges  to Attorney General.
             </p>
             <p>
              FBI Mueller retired, Obama took Comey from HSBC to FBI director.
             </p>
             <p>
              HRC had left and numerous people attempted to keep a lid on things as Libya, Syria, Somalia, &amp; refugee crisis completely ransacked the world. Around 500,000 people died in Syria &amp; Lybia since. Lybia is now involved in open slave trading of African migrants, organ harvesting, child trafficking are rampant.

               A.  Kushner was a private citizen at the time.  If he discussed the lifting of sanctions like Flynn supposed did, that could be a violation of the Logan ACT.
              </p>
              <p>
               B.  These meetings were NOT public, do you think Jared Kushner was going to ask about setting a secret communication channel using Russian diplomatic facilities and secure Russian Communication equipment in PUBLIC????? Do you think he is that dumb?  Do you think he would openly commit espionage? That meeting was in Trump Tower.  The meeting with Sergey Gorkov the intelligence agent who is close to Putin and heads up a Russian State Owned Bank wasn't revealed until March of this year.  That State Owned Bank is under US sanctions.  The White House won't even reveal where this meeting took place
              </p>
              <p>
               C.  Kushner then lied about these meetings on his security application which is a felony.   This is what Gorelick is trying to defend against.
              </p>
              <p>
               D.  When the meeting was revealed.  The Bank said the meeting was about non official business and the White House said the meeting was in Kushner's official capacity.

               Of course I have no problem with this.  Neither did any part of the US government.  There is a process to determine if transactions like this pose a threat to the US and they are evaluated by inter-agency government board.  The board is made up of like 19 different US agencies and is chaired by the Treasury Department, none of the members of
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Foreign_Investment_in_the_United_States">
                the CIFUS board
               </a>
               raised an objection because the sale of this Canadian company posed absolutely no threat to the United States.  Mainly because uranium is easy to get and has gotten even cheaper recently AND because export of uranium from the US is very tightly controlled and Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed this company does not have an export license for their US mines.   They can bring the uranium to the surface, but they can only sell it within the US.  Also Giustra was no longer the owner of this company when the deal went through.

                 You spewed a bunch of "whattaboutism" - most of which are big, juicy nothingburgers.   And you did all to try to muddy waters and deny the fact that there is a very serious case involving the President and his associates.

                 A case so serious, that the President has interfered in the investigation and is not is in legal jeopardy for obstruction of justice.

                <p>
                 And when that failed, you called me a pedo defender.   Because you know you're argument is weak.

You play games like an adolescent let me guess you are 19 yrs and work in goverment IT, or a covert Disrupt &amp; Destroy campaign agent working for the government against your fellow citizens in violation of your oaths to this country....I believe that is called Treason.

                 Look at you, pretending to care about treason.  How adorable.   And you guessing at stuff, fabulous.  You guessed incorrectly.  Would you like another try, I could give you a clue.

               And BOOM! Somebody was just bitch slapped! Upvoat and you are absolutely correct. Comey never seemed to win in any of his cases involving the Clinton clan. He did get I believe a $7 mil bonus when he left Lockheed Martin though.  They, of course, were awarded lots of gov contracts and Comey had it coming for being a good boy.  I can't remember if he received a big bonus from HSBC.

                He took the 7 million, closed his eyes like he has on everything Clinton, smiled for the cameras, walked over to HSBC to give them a good Boy Scout image for a few then said "really you are considering me for FBI Director I had no idea Mueller was going to retire! That wasn't planned at all ;) between him and I.  You mean the only FBI director (Mueller) to hold the position since 9/11, who was given the job on September 4, 2001 just 7 days prior and who was part of implementing the Patriot Act and stood "faithfully" by his young protege' James Comey while he had to go to John Ashcroft hospital room.
               </p>
               <p>
                Could not be they spoke of this plan? HRC will be the next President. Mueller retires in 2013, Obama moves Comey to lead FBI then Loretta Lynch (Bill Clinton op) to AG...All tracks are covered bury the documents, etc.

                Then Bengahazi, Lybia, Emailgate, ClintonFoundation, Syria,

                FBI anons, CIA anons, etc. It has gotten so desperate ordinary citizens are calling and openly investigating top FBI &amp; Special Counsel and have lost all confidence.

                 You I so agree with you.  Hopefully, we can clean some of this up.  I do believe as America awakens we will never go back to trusting our elected officials to do the right thing.  Citizen journalism will only get better. We are better prepared.  I know  where to look when I want find something. I have never looked at maritime maps in real time in my life before, but I will now when I am questioning something not looking right. So many research sites are saved and people are watching.

             Larry Nichols was with The Clinton's for years. He also came out and admitted he was a hit man for them. You can read about it and listen to the podcast of him admitting this

             He has said several times on different podcasts that Hillary Clinton has a horrible odor. He was on Alex Jones and said that. Others have said that too. That's really weird!

              Well, I will not be offering you a cup of coffee or a bite to eat while you are here.  I don't usually put out My Welcome Mat for Shills that favor Pedophiles. Sorry.  The time is getting near for their Confinement.

            Gorelick is a Deep State operative and her representation of Kushner is very problematic, to say the least.

             I wonder if Kushner is Deep State.
He has plenty of friends among the elites &amp; he and Ivanka are good friends with Chelsea &amp; her husband. Chelsea's husband and Kushner are friends at least as far back as college.. I don't know about before.
I think both fathers went to jail for financial crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thought Gorelick decided not to be his attorney recently. Maybe she got all the info needed by the Deep State
