<p><strong>This is an interesting and early bio of James Alefantis, from a 2007 Transformer (D.C., \'art\' gallery) newsletter:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>James Alefantis is an entrepreneur as well as a creative and passionate supporter of artists. James is the owner of two of Washington\'s finest, art-centered restaurants, Buck\'s Fishing &amp; Camping and Comet Ping Pong. These businesses support a diverse array of Washington\'s most talented emerging artists and venerable institutions - including the Hirshhorn Museum &amp; Sculpture Garden, the Washington Ballet, Transformer, and more. Additionally, <strong><em>James, with his husband, David Brock</em></strong>, politico and Founder of Media Matters for America, support the improvement of the national political and media environment. Their art collection focuses on emerging artists working with social identity as well as work by artist friends and Transformer artists. James joined the board of Transformer in December 2003. He was elected President of the Board of Transformer in December 2006.</p>

<p><strong><em>This newsletter literally calls David Brock his \'husband\'</em></strong> (before gay marriage passed ... maybe they eloped?). Has anyone ever seen any information claiming that they ever broke up/divorced? I haven\'t, not that it would change their business relationship if indeed what we are all assuming is true and these are all nefarious front companies. The above newsletter says that Alefantis became the <strong><em>President of the Board of Transformer</em></strong> ... oh so, petty bourgeoisie ... though he was already on the board in 2003.</p>
<p>Considering that CPP and Buck\'s were not opened until 2005, it would seem that David Brock\'s rectum was Alefantis\' entryway into the upper echelons of the post-art stratosphere of Washington D.C. \'art\' and foodie circles - <strong><em>PIZZA/HOTDOG PARTIES 4EVER !!!</em></strong> His entry onto the board of the D.C., art world preceded his interest in founding two <strong><em>\'art centered\'</em></strong> (as it says in the quote, and which is key) restaurants on the corner of Connecticut and Nebraska in Chevy Chase. </p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------- A QUICK CONTEXTUAL DETOUR ------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>[SIDE NOTE]</em></strong> <strong><strong>CONNEB = CONnecticut and NEBraska</strong></strong> -- a convenient anagram for a real-estate holding company ... lest someone else claim a Saudi connection to these properties based on a loose Google boolean search to some Arabic dudes LinkedIn page which just happened to string together Con.n.e.b., in the text somewhere - which theory holds no water and is erroneous. <strong><strong>Comet Ping Pong Pizza</strong></strong> was bought <strong><em>FREEHOLD</em></strong> by James Alefantis on June 23rd 2005 from the CONNEB II LLC holding company created on January 15th 2003 by the previous master plot owners -- <em>thus the $0 sale price which shows on multiple property records</em>. The previous owners and perhaps current owners/part-owners of CONNEB II LLC (which still owns the Politics and Prose and Besta Pizza land <strong><strong>Title</strong></strong>, spanning both sides of the street), are the Jewish Cohen family of the late Carla Cohen (nee Furstenburg) and the late David Cohen (her husband), both the owner operators of the super <em>\'liberal\'</em> <strong><strong>Politics &amp; Prose</strong></strong> book shop across the road, which actually used to be on the CPP side of the road once, apparently. David and Carla are from a super <em>\'liberal\'</em> Jewish element of the Democratic Party - multi-generational political families named Cohen and Furstenburg, especially within the <strong><strong>Americans for Democratic Action</strong></strong> organization (65,000 members and founded in 1947 by members of the <strong><strong>Socialist Party of America</strong></strong> -- not the Democratic Party -- Joseph McCarthy went after them until Eleanor Roosevelt accepted the Presidency of ADA in 1953, covering their Communistic tendencies, though they swore black and blue that they despised Communists and were only half-pregnant as \'Socialists\'). </p>
<p>Bucks Fishing &amp; Camping is still in some kind of <strong><em>LEASEHOLD</em></strong> relationship with CONNEB II LLC, which arrangement is not publicly available, but the management corp BIG BUCKS LLC (or BIG BUCK$$$$$$$ ? ...what a pun), which is owned by James Alefantis, was incorporated on August 1st 2003 ... meaning that James for some reason decided to span out, but not to buy the land Title to, this second restaurant, within less than 7 months of opening CPP. Now, in 2013 it is reported that Politics &amp; Prose was sold to Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine, a married couple and both former reporters and editors for The Washington Post. Muscatine is of course longtime speechwriter for Hillary Clinton since 1993, and a leading member of the so-called <strong><em>Hillaryland</em></strong> core advisors to First Lady then Senator Clinton ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillaryland">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillaryland</a> ). <strong><em>Hillaryland</em></strong> was/is made up of Clinton-cult groupies listed as follows: Huma Abedin, Patti Solis Doyle (credited with coining the name &quot;Hillaryland&quot;), Mandy Grunwald, Neel Lattimore, Ann Lewis, Evelyn Lieberman, <strong><em>Tamera Luzzatto</em></strong> (of the infamous &quot;Evie\'s Crib&quot; family), Capricia Marshall, Cheryl Mills, Minyon Moore, Lissa Muscatine, Neera Tanden, Melanne Verveer, and Maggie Williams. All of these members were/are female, except the token gay Neel Lattimore <strong><em>(NO testosterone allowed in this Coven! &quot;Y-Chromosome BE GONE! Unless self-repudiating&quot;).</em></strong> </p>
<p>The reason I bring all this up, is that CONNEB and its environs, seems to be a spook-house for Clinton hacks with very strong Soros leanings, and a <em>\'liberal\'</em>, heavily female and gay only zone, especially once we consider the Alefantis-Brock gay duo extension for fund raising and media manipulation. Now, if Graham and Muscatine are the new <em>\'owners\'</em> of Politics &amp; Prose since 2013, it means they also own the Title of Bucks and Besta which are attached to CONNEB II LLC. Essentially it seems they must have bought the whole holding company, outside of some ownership sharing arrangement with the heirs of the Cohen estate, who unfortunately would be hiding behind their registered legal agent and are not publicly visible. No wonder the WashPo is going gangbusters against the Pizzagate researchers together with David Brock\'s media allies. This CONNEB block is seriously a spook-house which I believe TPTB in <em>Soros-Brock-Hillaryland</em> are shit scared of being exposed; David Cohen was heavily political, with intimate Soros connections across many organization, especially his advisory council membership of <strong><em>J Street</em></strong> -- Soros\' super \'liberal\' and Zionist Jewish lobby, hated by the likes of conventional Zionists like Benjamin Netanyahu (who is close with Trump). J Street believes in the globalist UN two-state-solution (which is actually a three-state-solution where the UN gets an International City sovereignty over the City of Jerusalem and Bethlehem), whereas conventional Zionists like Netanyahu won\'t compromise on anything but a single Jewish only State. The Cohen\'s are the real connection here, and the registered owner of Little Red Fox restaurant is still Barry R. Cohen, who <strong><em>\'bought\'</em></strong> the Title in 2007 before Carla and David both passed away (2010 and 2015 respectively) for $0 from CONNEB (though the store Lease is \'owned\' by different operators since 2013 when it renamed as Little Red Fox). David and Carla only had two adult children Aaron and Eve, so Barry R. Cohen must be a side relation ... but importantly the Cohen\'s are still represented in respect of ownership in this weird Democrat twilight zone of restaurants and shops. <strong><em>[END SIDE NOTE]</em></strong></p>

            This is all so interesting and it makes a whole lot of sense!

            I was researching old threads in connection to Besta Pizza and their owners to gather material for thread #2 of a "Consolidation Threads" project

            , that 3 others and I are working on, when I stumbled upon your post. I would love to put an emphasis on your theory by posting your thread, using it as a reference piece and highlighting quotes from it, but we would need more sources to back it up. Could you provide sources for your research? I mean, your theory is so much better in terms of quality and "simple logic" than the Saudi/DOJ Andrew Kline Connection ever was, however, the only downside to it, is that it lacks sourcing and that is very much needed for our project :I
           </p>
           <p>
            We'd at least need the Conneb LLC documentation that shows what was purchased when and by whom. And some on the Cohen Family to completely discredit the other theories and focus solely on yours. Our project will ultimately (when finished) be used as an-easy-to-go-over, connecting-the-dots-through-potential-leads-that-got-lost-on-the-way, consolidated-material research tool for Voaters as well as investigative journalists and law enforcement personnel.

             Sorry this reply took so long ... I've been offline for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically, you need to get the details from proprietary online property records/real-estate companies ... I used PropertyShark (
             <a href="https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/">
              https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/)
             </a>
             ).
            </p>
            <p>
             It cost money to get the records, and the records themselves were covered by a Terms Of Use that restricted my ability to share the records in document form.
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically, I don't want to post the ones I retrieved for personal reasons, though anyone can access the same records and post them up.
            </p>
            <p>
             CONNEB II LLC is easily searched in a corporation database, and the Cohen's of Politics and Prose show up as the owners. Carla Cohen's brother Mark also owned the bakers on the other side of the road where Little Red Fox is now situated.

             Lots of links exist in my comments on the following threads:

            <p>
             ... it takes a hell of a lot of work to piece together the facts of the story I weaved in the op, but I made sure they were all verified before posting them.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for 'documentation', it is the
             <strong>
              <strong>
               preponderance of the evidence
              </strong>
             </strong>
             that made this research possible, so because LLC's hide behind a lot of legal privacy, I had to discern thsi info from contextual information available about the Cohen-Furstenberg family that is quite famous for being Democratic Party hacks with a Socialist Party of America history, and maybe a deeper history in the Bolshevik Revolution!

              <p>
               For what it is worth, I searched for almost a week, heavily, on Besta Pizza connections to the Cohen-Furstenberg family and the Brock/Alefantis mini universe, and I could find no links at all between the owner of Besta and the rest of them, other than the fact that the 'owner' of Besta seems to only own a lease, with the Title still being owned by CONNEB II LLC, which seems to be owned/part-owned by the new owners of Politics and Prose (the Washington Post husband and wife duo).
              </p>
              <p>
               This is why the Washington Post always led the pack against the PizzaGaters, because they are super connected to Brock-Alefantis-Clinton, and perhaps still the Cohen heirs, if in fact they part own CONNEB II LLC with the heirs (but they could be sole owners after Carla and David Cohen died). The problem with an LLC is that it hides behind legal corp secrecy laws, and the only way to find out the owners would be if a lawsuit is filed against the owners for any reason and the details made public, or if a federal agency investigates the LLC, taking it into court and getting a conviction ... then all the gory details of the corporation are splashed all over the press, but no such luck in the case of CONNEB II LLC, because it is simply a real-estate holding company, so I wouldn't expect it to be involved in the legal churn that many operating businesses get caught up in by default.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hope this helps a little, and sorry that I couldn't find Besta links ... I searched for so long I decided to let other, more autistic people, search for those links.

                Excellent, thank you very much for your response. I believe you're absolutely right. When I sort through and resume the facts and evidence related to Besta Pizza, I have to be able to consolidate and present every investigated lead and every theory previously presented on Voat. I really hope that people will understand, like I do, that your theory is the right theory.

            I know the ancient Semitic cultures other than the Mosaic Hebrews would build up piles of ash on sacred ground where their sacrifices, animal and human, would be immolated. Later on, in rituals of Aleister Crowley's Thelema, the ash produced from burning of certain bodily fluids (usually semen and menstrual blood as an analogue of binary procreation; substitute a real baby and you get my drift!) is recombined in the next batch of 'sacramental' hosts: known as 'cakes of light'
            <strong>
             <em>

            </strong>
            to be used in blasphemous inversions of the Christian Eucharist. The reason they use some of the ash of the old ritual cycle in the next life-death ritual cycle, is because of the symbolic Phoenix mythology; where the newly re-born bird is birthed from a pile of its own ashes --
            <strong>
             <em>
              Ordo ab Chao.
             </em>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In this ritual the 'Phoenix' is thus an Egregore of the group-Will of initiates, feeding off of the life-death energy of the groups actual procreative power/potential; which they believe to be 'magickal'. In lower level Satanism/Thelema they use semen and menstrual blood, sometimes obtained from actual sex magick rituals as a ritual analogue (thus the prominent use of handkerchiefs) ... but who knows what happens in the top echelons of initiation: Do they believe that actual Moloch rituals of the combined male and female components into an embryo, or baby, or child, is more 'potent' as a magickal operation to invoke their desired evil spirit/s?
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, I tend to believe, that if I can conceive of an evil operation as possible and logically beneficial for a group of highly networked despots, then it must already be happening somewhere. Call me cynical, but I know the human race is fallen, and that there is something highly evil that dwells among us all in the dark hearts of men and women who are drunk on the spirit of evil. People like Jeffrey Dahmer, Albert Fish, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and Mao, wouldn't exist if this were not totally true. Though these men might or might not themselves have conceived an occult presence to be behind their actions, there definitely was an evil spirit driving their

            Interesting about Hinckley Pottery ... I'll look into that. I'm certain that the 'art' connection and it being a front for black-market services in D.C., is the common link between all these shops except Politics &amp; Prose and Besta. Terasol doesn't fit in otherwise.

            (the client-to-artist matcher) as some kind of a third party service to allow payments to pass to the provider of some other service (the real reason the purchase is being initiated). Would this not supply an actual artist an entrepôt to sell what is otherwise a rather cheaply produced prop --

            -- in what is otherwise a very competitive profession, allowing their name to become known in the right circles? Would it not also allow the intermediary (Transformer?), to transform a plausible purchase into a shielded payment vector, which in itself would be perhaps a much desired service in this particular city, of all cities?

            Let's say you wanted to restock your D.C., underground pleasure grotto with a moderate quantity of cocaine for an upcoming party and/or personal use. No problem, go down to your local

             'artisan'
            </em>
            restaurant/cafe, buy (wink ... wink ...) an artisanal pottery collection (doesn't have to be delivered or produced, just on paper and invoiced), or shitty wall canvas with paint drips for $5k, give the intermediary some transactional instructions, then the intermediary takes his/her fee and ensures that your payment reaches your actual supplier - the 'artist' gets paid a fee as well, to keep quiet. Your financial statements will be squeaky clean and, no need to riskily lurk around back alleys avoiding the cops with an envelope full of hard cash, dealing with unsavory drug dealers or pimps - especially if you are a

            Is this why the Podesta's, Alefantis, Brock, Clinton's, Obama's, et. al., seem to have such a predilection for mixing political fund raising with the art-centered restaurants and the 'art' crowd? This would also help for making donations to political recipients outside or above normal reporting laws and/or limits. Tony Podesta with his large lobbying industry and corporate connections would be the financial fixer, John Podesta would be political realm liaison officer and fixer (Podesta brothers being the ultimate private-public power duo), Jimmy Comet would be the man-on-the-ground, Brock would be the backup with media power to threaten anyone who stepped out of line once they were a known customer, and the Obama's and the Clinton's would be the Kings and Queens on the chessboard, providing the Executive mechanics and legislative hammers to keep the entire Congress in check. Washington D.C., could bee their eternal Vice Wonderland ... or Hillaryland that might have been [holding in laughter].

            Thus, as a second to the thesis related above, I present the following important context for the existence, perhaps, of the Terasol restaurant/cafe across the road from CPP, which was sporting the very strange

            device on its website (before removing it). Without this device having been placed on its website, this niche business would have never been considered as being linked to the operations of CPP/Buck's across Connecticut Ave. The website is a bit of a giveaway in the context of my hypothesis, because this restaurant website is

             Interested in a quick visit to Paris?  Reminiscent of many little bistros you will find in many neighborhoods and "quartiers" of Paris,  Terasol celebrates local artisans while offering a true European experience.  Whether you are interested in new artistic creations, in simply sipping a nice café au lait or enjoying a gratinee, a hearty quiche or boeuf bourguignon while being serenaded by local musicians or Edith Piaf, Terasol is sure to tease all your senses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Terasol is a dream come true, a return to textures, bringing local artisans and their crafts to our community.  It is a place where the arts marry, whether of the table (arts de la table) or unique handcrafted creations and live music.

            -- you can see the assortment of local artists officially offering and exhibiting their wares in this cafe. Now, I'm not saying that these people aren't (some/all) actual artists -- mostly in the upmarket pottery field -- in fact, like the real pizza's sold at CPP, it is essential that these products be of a legitimate quality, and I'm sure this is in fact these people's primary profession. What I am proposing, however, is that on top of these businesses, a very convenient on-the-side business opportunity is undertaken as payment and service arrangement intermediaries for illegal black-markets (including child trafficking/porn/ritual initiation), in order to service the vices in D.C.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might also be possible for a prostitute, or a pimp of women, men, girls, boys, to advertise through these outlets as an 'artisan', using the restaurant as a front for whatever services they really promote, including the supply of drugs or whatever vice you require in this politically sensitive city.
           </p>
           <p>
            As such, I would advise further research into, specifically, the people behind the Transformer other than Brock and Alefantis (Jayme McLellan and Victoria Reis were the founders in 2002, are they connected in other ways with Podestas-Brock-Alefantis-Hillaryland?), and the Artisans listed at Terasol, not to mention artists that CPP/Bucks has promoted in the past. This might provide further circumstantial evidence of the tropes contained in this Satanic sub-culture, or might even provide solid leads to somewhere more unsavory (which is where we are all attempting to get I believe, if, indeed, this destination exists).
