            so, yeah somethings deff up here, it seemed to have been worked out with the host but now I'm getting a 404 error half the time, and the other half things barely load. if anyone wants to see if it loads up fine on their end thatd be cool.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't want to go yell censorship since I'm not sure its not just a shitty free web host.
           </p>
           <p>
            but man, Ive been having more and more problems with this site since day one, and I ran many free web sites in my time and never ran into anything like this. and whatever the problem is, its very inconsistent, and definitely something server side.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will find a new host I guess. sorry for the delay

            sorry if I end up having to go through with major changes like finding another web host, I am serious about trying to get up some kind of community revolved around publishing stuff, but this web host sux.

            the speed is absolutely terrible today. If I cant work things out with them, it will give me an opportunity to find something better than wordpress for us as well

            I think I'd be interested as well. I was planning on publishing my findings as articles and have been keeping them in that format as I go along anyhow. Figure Reddit and the Chans are pretty much worthless for publishing any REAL information without it getting scrubbed or spammed with inflammatory ridiculousness.

             if you'd like, or sign up for the temporary wordpress if you can get it to load up and you can get started whenever ya feel like it. feel free to add/change the subject/topics as well, I sort of just threw things together as it is
            </p>
            <p>
             unfortunately at the moment this free web host is giving me issues, and the site is loading slowly, so I have to check it and see whats up.
            </p>
            <p>
             I may have to move to another free web host, but honestly, I might be able to find one that gives us free email accounts too (which this one doesn't)

              Roger dodger! Got a few articles going, but I think the first I'll publish is one on the STRATFOR connection, or hub, as I call it. Their associations are huge and fuzzy, but when you drill down are strongly connected to the DNC political machine and suspicious merchandise trafficking. They are an intelligence consulting firm, so by all means they have no "product" to be shipping.

             anyone that's interested in the pursuit is welcome to. itd be helpful to have people who've been active here contribute :). I know its not much, but its one more voice on the web
            </p>

             really I kind of want to find something to replace wordpress with that works more like an interactive forum so Its easier for people to contribute (not sure if I have to make someone an admin with wordpress and its kinda... cheap feeling but it works for now)

              if you want you can either email me at

              , or just sign up for the wordpress if you can get in. as stated below, this free webhost seems to be throttling the bandwidth/speed so I may end up switching hosting servers. but I can take the domain name with me anywhere, all its free and registered elsewhere

              I have not been real active here... I'm not a fan of the format, plus got burnt when they did away with
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
               r/pizzagate
              </a>
              . As I did a lot there... Now mostly on 8ch
             </p>
             <p>
              Good source of legit info is needed so you might have success 
I'm not real up on what forums are out there outside of what's offered in some c-panels etc
