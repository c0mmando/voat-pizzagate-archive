            So Sawyer is clandestine CIA working inside USA domestically-since the F* CIA RUNS DRUGS GUNS HUMAN TRAFFICKING I think my former  point to the JERK who was razzing  my ass because I didn't BOW to a Navy Seal has  been more than AMPLY  proved-THIS is the reason we don assume someone  is  trustworthy  because someone has a  badge, or a title etc.

            Timothy Holmseth has an agenda and whatever he is saying you'd better check and double check for accuracy. People wonder why I call Holmseth a troll but he's been outed by me personally in more than one instance. He's an asset paid to spread disinformation to fool people just like you. But of course, I must be a disinformation agent if I'm spreading lies about this courageous man fighting child trafficking, right? Holmseth is full of shit and I despise him for being a troll instead of an honest truth seeker.

             Wrong, "Timothy Holmseth" has no "agenda" you know he started his investigation and got threats from 2009 right, you need to research your information and stop making up lies about believable people vs, liars you claim things that are clearly false and make up shit like "Shillman" You and your ignorant smears of a person who has endured, attempted break ins, real government run gang stalking, threats, false arrests are sick. And yes you must be a shill, or someone with no understanding of history and no care for real information.

            Is there anyone on this board left who hasn't either posted a verbal selfie in the title of their post while calling out the shills, or who hasn't been accused of being a CIA disinformation shill, or who hasn't been accused of being a secret pedo? I'm starting to think pizzagate has turned into a psy-op to cover for Uranium One. Notice how children don't seem to ever get rescued but all of us pretty much hate each other's guts at this point.

            , thank you for adding a working link to this thread. Unfortunately, we still cannot remove the flair, because you have multiple claims here that need links supporting them, especially these:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <ul>
             <li>
              "Sawyer's webpage says Sawyer "utilizes his military experience to run covert tier one operations all over the country"."
             </li>
             <li>
              "Tier One operations are clandestine CIA black operations - and Sawyer openly states that is what he is doing."
             </li>
             <li>
              "Sawyer...claims he is acting in the capacity of law enforcement - making "arrests"."
             </li>
            </ul>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I poked around on the site you linked and eventually found the "tier one" reference on his Bio page, but just a few lines later on the same page, he highlights in bold that
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              All operations and activity while assigned to DEVGRU remain classified and are not represented here.
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            so your claim that he admits he is working for the CIA with that statement is not accurate. You're going to need a link supporting your claim that "tier one operations are clandestine CIA black operations".
           </p>
           <p>
            I saw nowhere that he claimed he was making arrests. If that's in a video, you need a link to it and a note about the timestamp in the video where the claim is located.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, please go through this post and turn each claim into a hyperlink to the specific supporting source material. That's what will be required for this to meet our submission rules. If Holmseth is making these claims, he should be able to link to the sources for each one of them as well. If not, this belongs in

              That means he is CIA-SAD

             <li>
              TIER 1 operations are "black ops"

             As a former Marine. I can tell you based on my own experience you shouldn't  flag this. CIA-SAD&lt;JSOC&lt;Tier 1 control is common knowledge. My own personal experience meeting and talking with these people.

             The quote you are using is not the basis for the situation.
Sawyer himself says it, his own website.
            </p>
            <p>
             To run "covert Tier 1 Operations" and you are supposedly "retired". He is CIA-SAD-Propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has made no "arrests", participate in no arrests, the numbers are fake its bs. They have a propaganda division. Smith-Mundt was repealed.
Tie all that in see what I see. No "3k" arrests no 160 kids saved, just fake numbers to make you thing he is "a good guy" and doing something.
He was used to cover up Tucson. His fake org is stealing money for gullible idiots to other things, Self financing propaganda, while he does PR stunts, and covert smear jobs.

              I referenced exactly the same page you did, but you are ignoring that literally sixteen lines further down the page he says nothing on the page represents the classified ops he has been involved with in the past:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               All operations and activity while assigned to DEVGRU remain classified and are not represented here.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              It looks to me like you are deliberately ignoring or playing dumb in response to my comment, since you are ignoring what he points out on the very same page, and you also know "my personal experience" isn't support that satisfies Rule 2, nor have you linked to any place he claims to have made "arrests". You just keep repeating your unsourced claims.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sawyer may well be CIA; I don't know. But you are doing a really shitty job making the case for it.

               Look Vindicator. You aren't udnerstanding "classified" ops. There is only a little bit of "documentation" to go by, and CIA-SAD I personally know to be dirty and highly secretive. Also I suggest you look at his background. You think the CIA is gonna make it easy to prove someone is "CIA". I know what I'm talking about, sorry, personal experience and years of personal convos with people who were SOCOM, understand the JSOC layout and the "indocs". Tier 1 is CIA, plus this fraud pushed the OBL hoax

               I can talk about that but its off topic. From that fricking helo with non DEVGRU that blown up on the ground to all types of foreign media exposure of that "Event" to that stupid lie about a burial at sea.

               Tier 1=SOCOM JSOC=CIA its simple black ops, anyone claiming otherwise is not well versed in how that shady crap works. My good friend had a Seal father he murdered someone stateside on orders in the 90's. There you go you happy.

             Its in the video with Timothy Holmseth the original one that got scrubbed. Also I'm former Marine Corps, DEVGRU and Tier 1 is CIA.
Holmseth used his own words and got struck,
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v4on6rNfds">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v4on6rNfds
             </a>
             The video playing his clips was struck
So the next video TH's read his statements...his direct quotes.
            </p>
            <p>
             "JSOC, a subdivision of SOCOM, is responsible for commanding the Special Mission Units. They are comprised of Delta, DEVGRU and the Air Force's 24th STS. Tier 1 "Operators" are CIA, they are run by the CIA, they aren't military assets. they are black operators. He is claiming to be running Tier 1 Operators in his own words. I have my personal experience to rely on anyone claiming they are running T1 in the US means black operations in the US, that is illegal, btw making ARRESTS as a military in the US is a violation of posse comitatus. In addition all "Staffing" is done literally from every case I've ever heard of by the CIA's Special Activities Division. In other words Black operators, recruited for special missions run by the CIA-SAD.
            </p>
            <p>
             BTW Holmseth once again in his original struck video played Sawyer's own words.

            Old news that Alex Jones is controlled opposition. He is a terrible actor to boot. When he wants to show he is thinking, he will say "ummmm", while he grabs his chin and ponders and squints his eyes. He doesn't even know to act natural, and that reminds you that he is performing a character. He protects Rothschild and Israel.  When asked who the humans are behind all this crime, he says it is impossible to know. He sites the banks as criminal apparatus, but refuses to mention who owns them. Those that own the apparatus of control, are the controllers. Guy is entry level cointelpro to keep people asleep.

            Maybe you can find a blog article by Holmseth or another video by him?

            Per Rule 2, we'd need at least one working link:

             How about asking for a citation for these claims.  I sure don't see anything on V4CR site which remotely comes close to this other than Sawyer's bio which clearly states that anything DEVGRU (tier 1) related: All operations and activity while assigned to DEVGRU remain classified and are not represented here.
            </p>
            <p>
             The site clearly states their mission: "Our Mission
            </p>
            <p>
             Veterans For Child Rescue is a non-profit organization whose mission is to assist law enforcement and NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) to eliminate Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our strategy involves educating the public, raising awareness through the Contraland Film, training law enforcement, and empowering our children."
            </p>
            <p>
             It says nothing remotely like the OP claims.

            The way you know you are not just having a friendly discussion is to note when you are downvoted. That's a red flag for an active troll.  Speech is far more important to me than either up or down voting. Have at it.

               I know all I need to know, you aren't competent and don't care about truth why don't you get yourself down there and look at all they are finding like Dark Night Skies. Huge DOWNVOTE...you want to ignore the truth, get ready for the pain. Infowars, Snopes, "Sawman" all the gatekeeping shilly liars out there you go to for fake information. CEMEX, Pedogate, Pizzagate is all real. Get over it. Inaccurate and false information/disinformation will be exposed.

               Thank you for speaking. It's good to have support and Alex sticks his neck out so far I hate to hear that he's misunderstood OR just plain hated. I suspect the latter in this case. He's a trooper.

              I believed Alex was sincere too until he began blatantly lying about his own reporting on Q and I got banned off the InfoWars comments section just for pointing out the discrepancy. Jones claimed the White House told them to cover Q and then later he and Corsi changed their stories. With a straight face he said shit I knew not to be true and after that I could never look at him the same way again. A con man and jackass. He acts over the top for a reason.

               The only reason the Q phenom got any notoriety was because of Alex Jones's involvement. Look at this chart that reflects the Q traffic and mentions online. The day Alex Jones got involved is when the Q phenom went on the rise. Then Jerome Corsi gave it a boost.  Now all the Q people hate Alex and Corsi. Oh the irony.

                Bullshit. Jones refuses to cover it at all for something like two months or more before it finally blew up enough that he had to address it on his show. And then he started bringing on his own “real” Q etc.

                 Of course Jones is a bullshitter, we all know that. I remember the first night he covered Q. He had one of his "oh so important" emergency type broadcasts, looking like he had been drinking and close to crying, telling us how important and real Q was. Then after he dropped Q like a hot rock Q's popularity went with it.
