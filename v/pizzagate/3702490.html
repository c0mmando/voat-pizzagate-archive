<p>The staircase that prompted my journey down this &quot;rabbit hole&quot; is at the Guggenheim Museum in NY. It was planned as early as 1945, with <strong>Blue</strong> - prints from 1953</p>
<p><a href="https://www.archdaily.com/873259/frank-lloyd-wrights-early-blueprints-of-the-guggenheim-reveal-design-ideas-that-didnt-make-it">https://www.archdaily.com/873259/frank-lloyd-wrights-early-blueprints-of-the-guggenheim-reveal-design-ideas-that-didnt-make-it</a></p>
<p>That means that the triangular staircase was originally depicted w/ blue....just like the BoyLover logo.</p>
<p>Odd Coincidence: While researching, I listened to this: <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/audio/track/triangles-and-other-shapes">https://www.guggenheim.org/audio/track/triangles-and-other-shapes</a></p>
<p>(Now it\'s 404\'d)</p>
<p>Much of Frank Lloyd Wright\'s art uses the interlocking/repeating triangle motif (Not the exact boylover logo, but perhaps a precursor) Apparently some of these images have been licensed to the <strong>White House Gift Shop</strong> by the FLW Association:</p>

<p>Brass, finished in chrome, genuine turquoise beads, sealed with a non-tarnish finish. Handmade in the USA by the Official White House Gift Shop Ornament makers. Authorized by the Frank Lloyd Wright Association. Comes in an official Frank Lloyd Wright white gift box with a White House Gift Shop Gold Seal on the bottom. The subtle combination of the triangles and the repetitive pattern of the diamonds created at the intersections add to the repeated verticals of the magazine cover and are visible in the jewelry adapted from this concept. Cuff Bracelet </p>

<p>Researching the Frank Lloyd Wright Association, I found another instance of a triangle spiral. I call this one the Tri-Triangular Spiral</p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/n1xhwy.jpg">https://files.catbox.moe/n1xhwy.jpg</a></p>

<p>&quot;sustainability&quot;</p>
<p>P.S. A Guggenheim architecture exhibition also uses the triangle spiral in 1973 to create a life sized maze:</p>

<p>P.P.S. Isaac Kappy\'s art uses a lot of repeating, interlocking triangles....they are reminiscent of FLW if not homages...was he giving us clues?</p>

                 This quotation by Viktor Schaumberger suggests that water can aid in remote viewing:

                 Here is what I have gathered so far from this video:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   warm water freezes more quickly than cold water
                  </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   when falling through copper spirals, thin strands of water produce high electrical voltages and tiny water droplets reverse their direction of fall, contrary to the laws of gravity, and move UPWARDS (ie, levitation). This is observed in waterfalls, which have a beneficial effect on health. Specifically, waterfalls ease asthmatic complaints.
                  </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   whirlpools are formed from the same force that creates spiral galaxies and the double helix dna strand
                  </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   swirling allows you to carry heavier loads

                  <p>
                   there is a lot of talk about alternating between the "right hand and left hand path" of the water. Then there's these diagrams of water currents which looks like "666" to me:

                 I don't exactly understand this, but someone else is thinking along the same lines as I am with the '666' symbolism. This site also claims that Schauberger showed that a natural river flowing sinuously across the landscape recharges its energy towards the positive or yang on
                 <strong>
                  right-hand

                  left-hand
                 </strong>
                 bend.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Question: are occult symbolism, beliefs and rituals such as '666', the baphomet symbolism and the phrase "as above, so below" really just an elaborate misdirection to keep people from figuring out these principles of nature?
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are a lot of interesting claims on this site. Here are some examples:

                 This is in line with the above quote by Schaumberger about his remote viewing experience.

                 <p>
                  The most important function of biological water is to facilitate rapid inter-communication between cells and connective tissues, so that the organism can function as a coordinated whole. Though not recognised by mainstream science, living water in fact performs this intercommunication function between all organisms, groups of organisms, populations, natural kingdoms and the world, creating a network of sensitivity throughout all of life, even between life on Earth and the Cosmos, so that nothing can happen without affecting other processes; all are linked together by water. In this way, it drives evolution.

                 <p>
                  If we say that water builds the physical structures of living organisms, this begs the question of where are the templates? We believe they are held in the etheric or quantum field, often encoded in sacred geometry.5 For example the indispensable container for the emergence of new life is the egg shape, the only shape in which water can circulate spontaneously: the egg and similar shapes like the pine cone, or spiral structures such as seashells or leaf designs have a symmetry defined by phi (Φ) or ‘The Golden Section’.

                  Masaru Emoto studied the structure of ice crystals to determine the quality of their liquid water origin. He demonstrates how poor quality water cannot build good structures, while high quality water produces the most beautiful crystalline designs. Amazingly, water that has been exposed to harmonious music or exalted human energies can produce pure beautiful crystals, while when it is exposed to disruptive energies it cannot produce well structured crystals.

                  When water is flowing as its nature dictates, energetically in spirals and vortices, and continually changing its state, the molecules, if conditions permit, organise themselves into structures, layers or clusters of vibrating energy centres which carry constructive information, constantly receiving and transmitting energy from every contact the water body makes.

                  These clusters or layers can store vibrational energy impressions or imprints, rather like a magnetic tape. If these are beneficial, they may be able to restore healthy resonance in the human body

                  Water does have a memory. When we think we have ‘purified’ water of the chemicals and hormones we have mindlessly thrown in, in order to make it drinkable, the energy of these contaminants remains, polluting our energy bodies in the same way that chemicals affect our physical bodies. Because of its nature, water sacrifices itself entirely to the environment, for good or for bad.

             Mandatory vaccines combined with microchips? We know that Jared Kushner is making the RFID chips at 666 5th avenue and George Soros helped him finance his purchase of that building. It also appears that George Soros is invested in a bio lab located at  666 Gaoxin Road East Lake High-tech Development Zone Wuhan 430075, China, called WuXi PharmaTech Inc., which is only a few miles away from the BSL-4 lab in Wuhan that was researching bat coronavirus, and about an hour away from the Wuhan seafood market.
