            Childrens organs are only useful for other children as transplant patients. There's a black market for organs. This has little to do with Pizzagate.

              Good point on the brain, but still. Assuming the organs are harvested around time of death, most of them usable for transplants. Just because a child is involved doesn't mean it's a link to PG, much like just because you see a weird swirly symbol doesn't mean it's necessarily tied to PG.

            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             WASHINGTON — The Justice Department appears to be laying the groundwork for an investigation into the transfer of fetal tissue by abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, picking up where several Republican-led inquiries in Congress had dropped off last year.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Stephen E. Boyd, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, requested unredacted documents underlying a 2016 investigation by the committee into the exchange of human fetal tissue that had been donated for research by women who get abortions.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             “At this point, the records are intended for investigative use only,” Mr. Boyd wrote, adding that it might take a vote by the Senate to allow the documents to be used in formal legal proceedings.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             His letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, did not name Planned Parenthood or other groups implicated in the Judiciary Committee report. Nor did it give much indication of how expansive or developed the department’s work was. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, declined to comment on Friday, citing department policy against commenting on or confirming the existence of an ongoing investigation.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             But the decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s Justice Department is sure to breathe new life into a bruising fight over abortion and particularly the handling of fetal body parts after an abortion is complete. And it appeared to offer social conservatives a long-sought victory, moving the Planned Parenthood probes out off Capitol Hill to the Department of Justice.

            <hr/>
            <p>
             The issue has long inflamed the right, but most recently flared up in response to the release in 2015 of a heavily edited video purporting to show a Planned Parenthood official discussing the illegal sale of fetal parts. That video prompted House Republicans to form a select investigative panel that spent 15 months examining fetal tissues sale. The panel produced a 471-page report last December but no charges.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             On Friday, anti-abortion groups welcomed the news that the Justice Department may have picked up the cause, and they urged Congress to cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood, a favorite target, in light of the investigation.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             “March for Life welcomes any action taken by the D.O.J. that signals a serious, thorough investigation into Planned Parenthood’s profitable practice of selling baby body parts,” the group’s president, Jeanne Mancini, said. “Taxpayer funds should not support an organization under federal investigation for such serious matters.”

            Child traffickers and child molesters are using Planned Parenthood as a clearing house for abortions. Planned Parenthood is then selling the fetuses for a profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            These children need a remedy for this situation but the people in charge need to be jailed and responsible people that care about the well being of children need to be put in charge to find the best solutions.

             By Josh Brown - The Washington Times - Tuesday, February 1, 2011
A Planned Parenthood manager in New Jersey has been caught on video helping a person posing as a pimp trying to hide his underage sex ring, according to a video posted Tuesday by the pro-life group Live Action.
The video was shot at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Perth Amboy, N.J., on Jan. 13 by two undercover operatives — a man pretending to be a pimp and a woman posing as his prostitute.
In their video the “pimp” had a conversation with Amy Woodruff, the clinic manager, in which he said he was involved in “sex work.”
When the “pimp” tells Ms. Woodruff the girls are around 14 and 15 years old and speak no English, the clinic manager is shown saying “so long as they just lie … we just kind of play it stupid.”

            The disruption of their human trafficking operation is hurting them monetarily... More effort and focus on organs. Excellent post 4warned. Important to investigate all their evil operations, by following the money.
