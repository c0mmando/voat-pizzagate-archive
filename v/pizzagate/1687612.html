<p>Mentioned in some of the articles are associations with Joy in Hope. It looks like during the first arrest when they removed him from leadership they didn\'t give a good reason either.</p>

<p>It really looks like Joy in Hope was going through something more than just a guy getting arrested without cause if you read the rest of the post.</p>

             Jay Sekulow has been famous -- at least in Christian conservative circles -- for a long time (decades now).  This is going to be relevant to many people's interests.

             Also, this is a good video on Pye:
