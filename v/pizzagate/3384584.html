             I thought Jojo immediately.  Jojo is very talented, always loved her music. Then she got into a disagreement with her record company and they wouldn't release her rights for years and years. I think last year she was finally released and was going to do another album.  I always wondered how she never did anything else, her first album was really popular.  This all makes sense why her parents wanted to fight the label.

             I’m pretty sure you are right. It sounds like JoJo. Check out this article from 2005, mtv interview. Read definitely the last part, sounds weird to say for a 14 year old.
