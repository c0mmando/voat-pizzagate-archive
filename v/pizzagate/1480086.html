            I said it before and I'll say it again, we cannot be pacifists this time around. It cost us greatly during Gamergate, and it was all effectively over when, guess who, Colbert invited that lying skank Sarkeesian onto his show. This time it's more than personal, it's a fucking war. And I'm telling you all to FIGHT.

            </p>
            <p>
             I hope you got a chance to see the The Colbert Report's two special episodes i had them do about CGI U that we taped in St. Louis this weekend. This is the link to last nights with a sketch about commitments and the monologue and WJC interview aired Monday. Hope you enjoy and looking forward to your feedback. Next will be your Colbert appearance!

            I suspected this. Colbert is in full cahoots with Google and others driving the "Fake News" narrative. They protect him on youtube, boost his visibility by artificially injecting his clips into the recommendation lists, so even though nobody watches his show he's somehow "popular".
           </p>
           <p>
            He's a fucking late night talk show host. WTF is a video if him talking about Pizzagate doing the rounds as if it's important?
           </p>
           <p>
            He's sold out and they're now rewarding him with exposure and VIP treatment.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is a fucking establishment piece of shit. An actual, honest to god shill. Just like Barry. Who I think they've got booked for the show, so expect "clips" of that to suddenly get extremely popular and be wall to wall narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuck you Stephen. You protected abductors, traffickers, rapists and murderers of children. I hope other Catholics come out against him and regain some credibility of their own, because now's the time.

            yeah we're sub geniuses and that wikileaks and citizen journalist need to grow the fuck up. Oh whoa stephen colbert really told us gonna have to go sob in a corner because colbert is so clever and humorous with his ability for wit and scripted insults Well anyone who challenges his mere dismissal will realize that this is a contrived act because he acts as a gatekeeper (using his humor as acover) for proper investigation and independently arrived understandings. You've been exposed and clearly are as shameless as the rest of your corporate media cohorts.

            Looks like critical comments have been upvoted back to the top since your post.  Regardless I tried to further upvote critical comments but clicking on that thumb icon kept causing the "create a channel" screen to load and not add an upvote.  After a couple of minutes, back on Colbert's youtube clip, it now says "comments currently unavailable".  WTF

            Did anyone else get served the ad for UNICEF before the video? Ironic, given that the head of UNICEF was accused of using it as a resource to source children for a pedophilia and CP ring (except for a single source that comes up early in results, articles on this are not easy to find with a simple google search:

             Definitely should be screen capping and archiving to show. Then link that in all the comments so they can see what a bunch of fucktards run that channel/show. I'm in my 30's and have never seen something so suppressed in my life. This is fucking crazy.

              Its a different type of fear. There's a fear of being outcast from those who deny this is real, and a fear that this is never going to end. I hate that we are so desensitized to this stuff, because the physical acts of torture rape and murder that are going on are truly the worst thing that I can imagine in this world. Killing someone with a swift shot to head on a jog around the block is NOT the same as what these children and even young adults are going through. This is the worst evil that exist without a doubt.

               "the physical acts of torture rape and murder that are going on are truly the worst thing that I can imagine in this world. Killing someone with a swift shot to head on a jog around the block is NOT the same as what these children and even young adults are going through. This is the worst evil that exist without a doubt."    THIS is why the threat of blackmail and exposure is 100% effective. Trust me, not all of the powers-that-be are doing this to kids. But all it takes is a photo of a Senator with a 15-yr old boy in a compromising position for the entire world to also believe he's raping and torturing babies. The depths of filth these people have on each other keeps everyone very much in line. And it's this that should scare you - it almost guarantees that very, very few people in positions of power in our .gov are clean, or they wouldn't be there. And it's for this reason that Trump + Co. are not our saviors.

               The vast majority of "regular" people believe all the lies we've been told about the nation's history, 9/11 and other false flags and the believe only what they see on TV. They pride themselves with being knowledgeable. Part of the challenge in enlightening people is that it puts them in the position of surrendering to the reality that they have been duped and this makes people angry, if not resentful and some stay in denial. It's an incredibly selfish and immature response but that is the majority.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an enlightened, you have a choices:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <p>
                 you can either help them first understand who owns the major news outlets and then reason through why they're clamping down on "fake news" and alt-sources. Once you do that, you can help guide them through some of the lies. This is difficult.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 you can soldier on, do what you need to do, let them be ignorant and avoid the subject (which these days is most subjects). The only way they "cast you out" is if you openly question the status quo. This is stressful.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 your 3rd option is to spend less time with people who wish to remain ignorant and controlled. You can love your family while living your own life. This is not easy but I've been doing it for 20 yrs and there is significant peace of mind that comes with it.

                Great input. I'm still a recent enlightened, only having learned about 9/11 specifically about 5 years ago. It blew my mind. To this day, I haven't brought it up to more than maybe a dozen people in my friends and family circle. Sandy hook was an immediate false flag thing for we where from day 1 or 2, can't remember, I immediately explained to my wife that it never happened. It was a lie. The wife right now doesn't want me talking about pizzagate at all. We just had a kid and she can't handle the details. Even now, I'm hiding the phone as I'm typing. She says I can't do anything about pizzagate. I argue everytime about it and explain that this isn't just about pizzagate. This is government wide corruption. I'm printing qr codes and dropping them off in stores and on product shelves constantly. People are going to know. If I can get just 20 or 30 people to research this that never knew Anything about it, that is a success.

                 I get very agitated when people just can't be bothered by anything that makes them uncomfortable--when in this case, children are suffering the unimaginable so I'm a little more vocal about this situation than I have been about others. But on the other hand, I also lead a very busy and packed and stressful life and aren't we all just trying to get through the day intact most of the time? Those of us who have children feel even more terrified of the future. So, I get it.

                 I was blocks away from the towers on 9/11. I lived in a mausoleum after that for a year - the entire neighborhood was plastered with the faces of "missing" people, I lost friends. I could not process what I saw on MSM with what I actually experienced that day and I shut down in many ways. It took many years before I felt ready to re-engage and looked into what really happened and I felt guilty about that. But I think the 9/11 red pill helped prepare me for the other false flags and the pedo truths.

                 Like you are, we MUST continue to reach out and share and learn and educate. We likely can't stop anyone or anything, but we can stir a fire in the American public who has lost their country and don't even know it. Not only is it really our only viable resource (to band together en masse) but it might be our only hope.

            REMEMBER that Colbert depends on CBS for his livelihood. He even made reference to CBS John Dickerson as a more "appropriate" news source than alt-news. Be sure to include in your rants that they have Colbert in a vice and he walked right into that vice.  The YT video above has appx 30,000 up votes and 20,000 downvotes out of 1.9m views - I think that is outstanding.

            I also did a post on this. I think it's ridiculous because I had top comments that got deleted. The SNL video is the one that's getting shilled to death now

             And the vid has 35k up votes and 22k DOWN votes. Given the level of cognitive bias on this subject (especially considering Cobert's viewers generally have giant blue pill suppositories crammed up their asses) I'm pretty impressed.

              You have to see it for yourself. It's about techniques of gaslighting and grooming, what progressive liberal politicians are like to be doing to people all the time, manipulative techniques. If you don't believe me, you're a racist. You don't hate women and gays, do you? Just go along with whatever I say and you won't get cry bullied by shills and trolls, okay?

               first of all, you are reading a lot into a dr. seuss story.
secondly both liberals and conservatives are guilty of using manipulative techniques.
third the rest of your comment is nonsense.   "crybullied"?

             I can confirm this is the case. The current top comments, while fortunately mostly on our side, are way less powerful and have a lot less likes than the ones that virtually ruled the comment section for days, with 1-2k likes each. Let it rain upvotes on the new ones, goats.
