            To those on here defending CPS, calling something CPS doesn't mean it's child protection. If a child is abused, police can take the parents to jail. Simple. Kids can still go to foster care then. You don't need an agency of do gooders with less education than a cop deciding who legal child abusers are. Get the cops and lawyers off non-serious crimes and speed patrol and onto serious crimes and child abuse. Home schooling and not vaccinating are not child abuse.

            I agree, George Webb is not some all-knowing wizard. He has actually been wrong quite a few times since he started his videos, but then he adjusts his theories as new information comes in either through research or people correcting him.

            The sad truth is, if a child hasn't been sexually abused before they go into foster care, then they are more likely than not to have been sexually abused when they leave it- usually by other kids but not infrequently by adults too. If you ever see judge on the street who supports the CPS system- rape him as punishment for enabling this evil institution. These idiots know the statistics and either willfully disregard them or actively participate in the corruption.

            Holy shit. I'm not a parent so I can't really empathize but that is downright disgusting.

             TL;DR I understand the meaning behind your words and it's completely acceptable. But the way you phrased your words made me feel like writing my very lengthy thoughts about what the words empathy and sympathy mean to me personally. Empathy is feeling part of what you imagine they're currently feeling. Sympathy is feeling a bit happy or sad for them, but not really feeling what you imagine they're currently feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please don't consider me to have made any assumptions or judgements about your understanding of the words. It kind of came out as if I was making such assumptions, and that's precisely why I'm explicitly stating that I don't actually have any such assumption or judgement. Lastly don't feel obligated to read it, I wrote it because I was in the mood to ramble. It doesn't need an audience but I'm fine with it having one.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also I make lots of mistakes while typing on my phone and I haven't gone back and fixed many of them, so it may be a mess.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your saying that you can't empathize made me want to reply, but I went overboard in my ponderings on the subject, so please don't take any of this as directed at you unless you want any particular part to be directed at you. It's really just my very verbose thoughts on the subject generally, which came out as a reply to your comment, but I don't want it to be interpreted as a direct reply because I I'm sure you understand empathy and sympathy fine, the way you worded what you said just got me thinking and writing a bunch, but I totally get what you'le saying and although my thoughts sound like a correction, really they're just thoughts that were prompted by your comment, but not really directly applicable to your comment. Also, I'm not any kind of expert, so if anyone feels my distinctions are off, it's all just my personal perspective and not any kind of authoritative description. And I may be completely wrong about all of it, lol.
            </p>
            <p>
             You don't have to have shared first hand experience to empathize. If you can imagine this happening to yourself and imagine it happening to this person and feel a portion of the kind of hurt that you would feel, but feel it due to your brotherly love of a fellow decent good human being who did nothing wrong but was deeply wounded, then you can empathize. It doesn't have to hurt as bad as it hurts that person, it would be unhealthy if it hurt you that bad, but if it pains your heart and brings sorrow and shared loss to your soul, that's empathy. Letting down your walls and allowing it to hurt is empathy. But sometimes it's not easy to drop one's own walls and defenses at a moment's notice and that's alright. If you feed bad for the person's suffering but can't for whatever reason feel to much of any degree the same sort of hurt, that's sympathy. Sympathy is actually usually the more healthy response because there's a hella lot of suffering in the world and being too empathetic for an individual or a little bit empathetic of everyone in such a way that it accumulates and becomes overwhelming, that's generally unhealthy. But being completely empathetic towards someone you personally know is fine so long as it doesn't go on for so long as to be detrimental to your own life. And it's fine to be momentarily completely empathetic towards a stranger, but it shouldn't consume your life and you're under no obligation to feel empathy in any particular instance. I just think that to say you can't feel empathy for a parent's loss of their children because you're not a parent, is probably not accurate. Another way to imagine it is to imagine how whichever of your parents you're closer to had lost you in this way is another way to empathize. To imagine how your parent would have felt and to realize that a real mother pretty much like yours is going through that horrific nightmare and panic and grief and suffering and misery and hopelessness and anger and rage and frustration and despair and confusion and regret and shock and inability to process at times and feeling too much ef everything at times and sobbing uncontrollably at times, that's empathy.  You don't have to feel all of it, but if you feel it enough for it to hurt, that's empathy. If you sincerely feel bad for her, but don't hurt and ache inside, that's sympathy.

            Yes the CPS system as it currently stands is very flawed and there are way too many cases of kids who are taken from their parents who shouldn't be. The over reach and intrusiveness is out of control. However, there are awful and horrific parents out there who do disgusting things to their kids. Those kids need to be protected from the abuse they endure because their own parents are doing it. There are kids who are raped by their own parents, their mom allows men to rape them so she can get drugs, parents who burn kids with curling irons and cigarettes, put them on scalding hot baths that cause their skin to fall off, starve them so badly that they don't even have enough water in their system to cry, and beat an infant to death just because he was born a boy. These examples are awful, and all cases I have personally been involved with. Some people should just not have kids. Without some type of protection for kids these abuses would not likely stop for those kids. The system is broken and needs to be fixed. Unfortunately as it stands it is ripe for abuse.

            sorry this is probably not the place for this post, but have you seen George Webb's parts 2 and 3 videos today? He mentions that Comet Pizza may be a site where they grind up the children's dead bodies after harvesting organs...and perhaps using it in sausage...I could not make this s**t up...

             The Luciferian cult sees us as prey. They are cannibals and eating children is part of their path to achieve enlightenment. It also helps cull the masses. They probably get off on knowing the shepple eat their own children in the disposal process.

             A couple of weeks ago, I had asked somewhere in the Pizzagates subs if any researchers had done somekind of digging into possible connections between all of this and the fact that they are finding human meat at Mcdonalds... Forget all of these debunking sites who are part of the coverup.. Some while ago, the headlines appeared before any type of debunking in the search results.. Thanks SoroS !

              I noted that, also. Plus, Alefantis was said to have a pig farm, and it was mentioned as a possible alternative to "disposal of bodies"...soooo revolting. I'm off pork and pizza forever. McDonald's went away for me years ago...argh.

               Same here! No meat for me..  The only times I've been to McDonald's in the last 22 years were when I needed a restroom. That's all they're gonna get from me!  Sickos.

             someone should run very specific dna tests on the pork used... the tricky thing is, porcine (piggies) dna is similar to humans... so is the texture and structure of the muscle...  it would be so easy for them to mix in human flesh with the sausage mix then dispose of the leftovers at the pig farm itself... swine are notorious for eating everything they can get to (esp. pigs improperly cared for), including bone... i know this sounds gross and seems outlandish but logistically it would be so easy and convenient for them...
            </p>
            <p>
             then there are those extra-large pizza ovens... i hope someone forensically investigates them to see how hot they've been fired...

            There should be a special department created for oversight of the CPS. And the oversight committee should have the power to hold the people or employees responsible for allowing such things to happen to be held accountable.

              Absolutely: abolish. They do nothing but follow up on verified criminal LE reports to place kids in foster "care" at best, at medium level, they harass and stress out families beyond anything reasonable with their social-conformity "investigations" that temporarily (or possibly permanently) destroy children's reputations with the children's natural communities and supportive relationships (i.e., neighbors, doctors, teachers, etc., etc.), and at worst, of course, they send children directly into pizzagate.
             </p>
             <p>
              How's that for choosing an occupation and making a living in "helping" our most vulnerable?
             </p>
             <p>
              Furthermore, "parent" agency of such a domestic citizen's enemy, DCF, gets paid federal dollars, and probably more, out of their performance through the CPS arm, or its contracted agencies that do the same work for... DCF. In other words, the hand is feeding its own mouth, and the hand is its only supervisor.
             </p>
             <p>
              At this time in history, -ONLY- LE would not be directly paid for its real performance in arresting criminals and keeping children safe. Quite frankly, these are the very good people we need to understand that children. deserve. protection! And yes, this protection includes protecting from domestic enemies.

               Very well said. Putting this all into a big picture is essential for our survival and freedom.

               And these fuckers have convinced themselves that we need protection from ourselves. Here is an article on a pentagon training video, where americans are apparently the biggest threat to themselves!

              I'd totally agree with you except that you're completely ignoring the fact that most victims of SRA are actually abused by their own parents or family members. Fiona Barnett, the Hampstead children and so many more are being raped, tortured and even impregnated by their own for the sole purpose of having the foetuses aborted and consumed by the Satanic Cult members. If there's something we've learned here while investigating pizzagate, is that the Satanist elites are known to force their children to do the same and become Satanists themselves as they grow up. 
What do we do with those cases? How are these children saved and protected?

               YingYangMom, SRA victims are more numerous because of tyrannical laws and enforcement agencies. Your argument is deeply flawed, and supports the satanic agenda.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is one Universal Law: Don't harm others. There are always repercussions for violating this Law of Nature. If an adult rapes a child, then he/she should be punished accordingly. If the local community takes it upon themselves to eliminate abusers, then I fully support that. In fact, if I caught an adult raping a child, I would shoot him/her square between the eyes with my 9mm semi-automatic pistol.
              </p>
              <p>
               But you don't build an agency of the state that enslaves people in the name of ending slavery. That is the definition of insanity, and that is precisely where this country is right now. We are trying to end slavery—yet we have been increasing it instead—with these ridiculous false arguments and laws. This must stop.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are many solutions for helping victims of generational SRA. For one, I propose that we end all standing armies—including the police, and use local militias to clean up this mess. Families and communities care, but their hands are tied by these ridiculous laws that disable them from helping one-another. Think about it.

                My argument isn't supporting the satanic agenda at all. I enumerated the facts and asked how we could solve the problem. You suggest ending all standing armies, including police, and using local militias. You also suggest families and communities should care. It is the same system, except presented differently. Same laws, same tactics, what's the difference? Fix the broken laws and provide oversight.

                 Yes, unfortunately your argument is, very precisely, supporting the satanic agenda.

                <p>
                 You don't understand the concept of Care from a spiritual level. The conditioned mind represents the worst form of satanism because it is unaware that it is supporting the Satanic agenda. That is largely the problem with the planet right now. In order to truly begin your spiritual journey (i.e., if you are to break free of your conditioning), it will require years of contemplation, reading, and reorganizing your mind. The path to enlightenment is very narrow, and the key to Heaven dangles by a thread.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                 In the meantime, I am going to point out a few important differences that you are taking for granted:
                </p>
                <p>
                 1a) armies &amp; police = paid shills = in it for the money (satan's currency) = can be bought = can be paid off = order followers = they'll do anything for the right price = slavery
                </p>
                <p>
                 1b) militia = volunteerism = true care = cannot be bought = cannot be paid off = self-governed = freedom
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Individuals of an enlightened militia are aware of Natural Law and Free Will; they understand that they have a choice to act according to Natural Law; and they understand that there are Karmic repercussions for their actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                 2) my proposal (True Freedom) is the complete opposite of what is in place right now (tyranny) = the two ideas are diametrically opposed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 3) my proposal is to abolish all false (man's) laws, and recognize Natural Law as the only true authority over mankind. The Golden Rule, the path of Christ, living in Dharma, enlightened spirituality, non-duality, etc.

                  Wrong. I do. What I also understand is that you know nothing about who I am and where I come from and what my beliefs are. I'll give you a hint. I'm in agreement with you about the path of Christ and his teachings. 
What I gather from your comment here is that you seem to be an idealist and an avant-garde visionary. I'm not trying to insult you, on the contrary. You are way ahead of our times. It is a utopia that you are describing when you propose militias that would truly care and could not be bought and where no false man's law would be abolished. Sadly, we are still at an Age where corruption, evil, Satanism and pedophelia are still very rampant and even if we were successful in building such an ideal society, at this present time, it would fail because many pedophiles and nefarious people would volunteer to fill in such positions as militia members. I still believe that not all police officer are in it for the money and power and some really good people occupy important positions in our present society. 
If you wish to have a beautiful and heavenly garden, you first have to make sure to unroot all the bad and rotten seeds and weeds and spend time watering and nurturing your weed-free garden to finally be able to see it blossom into an amazing and peaceful space. So long as you've not accomplished that first, you will NOT succeed and your garden will NOT blossom as you'd wish it would. 
And by the way, Natural Law and Free Will have many flaws too. This kinda reminds me of the Waldorf education system somehow... Seems legit, but when you dig into the underlying agenda, you realise that it's not only fake, but it's also a satanic trap.

                   Of course they would, but they wouldn't have asymmetrical power over good militia members. I am a good militia member, but I can easily be overpowered by an order-following cop. Get rid of the police forces, let the good and bad cops become militia members, and we'll be much better off on equal terms.

                 Humbly and gratefully, I had opportunities of professionally seeing the inside of social work systems (sorry, rehabilitated of course, yet my ONLY work with families [of disabled persons, our programs' client "participants"... or "consumers"] was in asking why they had given up their advocacy power to those they deemed as "experts," and then later helping a disabled mom as an LE officer, to hold her child under our squad's emergency blanket after a wintertime accident), LE, and state appellate court. And humbly, while realizing the common positions of the front line, I disagree. I hold to my position that LE is expertly trained to identify and document criminal activities to a standard of proving such activities in court.

                 The few CPS agents I have had the opportunity to speak with, upon a few months' followup after our conversation(s), had ended up quitting their position. Humbly suggesting... you, iPleadThe2nd, sound knowledgeable. How did you last for 8 years in CPS? And just out of curiosity if you feel like answering, why is your status of CPS agent framed as being in the past (I mean, to ask hopefully not too boldly, did you quit... and why)?

                  I quit because I wanted to just be a mom. I stayed so long because of amazing co workers and really liking the actual work with clients. Despite all of the negative attitudes of CPS, my experience with clients was mostly positive. The clients are in shitty situations but I always found if you treat someone with honesty and respect, you will get that back. I had great working relationships with probably 9/10 of the clients I had.  I often tell others that some of the best parents I know of were my former clients. I met a lot of great people who just needed help to get their lives on the track that they wanted it to be on. Most people don't want to be shooting drugs with their little kids watching, but that's all they know and they don't know how to stop.

                  The beauracracy there is terrible and made the job harder than it needed to be. In any type of large, over bloated government system there are the high ups who sit in offices all day and demand things from the lowliest that either are unnecessary or wasteful, such as unnecessary paperwork or documenting when you used a printer (I'm not joking). I'm not sure if it's because they want to feel like they like they are in charge or because they want to justify their high salary job. Whatever the reason, the "great ideas" from out of touch people who sit in offices all day makes he job difficult. I love law enforcement and in addition to working with them for so long I have many officers in my family and close circle of friends. They are all wonderful people, but they relay stories of other officers performance that are worrisome, but seem to be common in different departments within the area that I live. They often will lose evidence in cases including drugs and bloody weapons. These items will later be recovered, sometimes in their own patrol cars, but if that evidence is ever needed in court, there's a big problem with how they are going to explain that the chain of custody was followed correctly. So many times they just rely on self incrimination or plea bargain here instead of moving forward with having to prove their case with a trial. That is all I was saying, it's not a hit against LE, it's the way the cases are handled where I'm from.

                   Thank you for your thoughtful response! I thought of a longer response too, but the whole thing is a bit scary, as too many children are missing from CPS placements. Clearly, you're in here concerned about PG with everyone else. Although you lasted a long time there, your prior agency lost yet another good person when you left. No crying for the past though; I imagine once you would have moved up into admin, you would have seen more about agency strategy around necessary funding sustainability. And then, my guess is that you would have been preferring to supervise your subordinates documenting use of the printer to anything else; it's much more palatable to the alternative... program sustainability management thoughts. Everyone needs to be able to live with themselves and what they do for a living. So, you very likely have a brighter life now; best wishes!

               This is a fallacious argument. You are under mind control. CPS causes more child rape and death, by literally stealing children from their parents and giving them to pedofiles. It is systematic, and by design. I've seen the inner workings firsthand. Wake up, or take your satanic views with you to hell.

                Oh please, I worked for CPS for 8 years and while I will be the first to admit there are huge problems with that system, there are also huge problems with many parents who subject their children to severe abuse and neglect! I can't speak for the entire country, but where I live a shit ton more kids are raped and killed living with their parents than in foster care! I'm not saying foster parents haven't done hideous things, but the numbers just don't back up your claim. And before some CPS system hating person jumps on me for working there, just realize that every sector of government or big business has evil people there as well as good guys typically at the bottom levels. Good people are needed within bad systems to help create change from the inside.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pretending CPS completely responsible for the problems shows ignorance or someone who has a vendetta for some reason. It is "satanic" to sit back and do nothing when any child is being raped or harmed wether that is by the parent or foster care system. What should happen when parents are pimping out their kids for drugs or puncturing internal organs through beatings? Should we just look away and let the parents continue on until the kid dies?  Don't be so naïeve and think all parents are treating their children the way God expects them to! And that was big of you to wish hell on me but I'm saved through Jesus Christ so that was a waste of your typing skills!

                  I know about her and I completely agree with you on the topic of corruption and cover up! This needs to be exposed! I'm just saying that there are also innocent kids who are being harmed and someone needs to stil be there for them. There has to be a solution to stop the bullshit and still ensure kids aren't abused. People who are awake and aware fighting with each other about it isn't going to ever solve anything.

                   Let me explain your error in logic. The world is full of psychopaths, so you think that the solution is to hire psychopaths to police the world. All you do is give unnatural power to a specific class of paid and armed psychopaths. Can you see the error in your reasoning? The solution is to raise the consciousness of society, but you are too fearful to take cues from natural law. This is the crux of the form of evil that you erroneously fall victim to in your thinking. I do appreciate your willingness to contemplate this issue.

                    I would love to raise the consciousness of society, but do you really believe that could happen? There are psychopaths everywhere and are they really able to have their consciousness raised? I think they would be resistant to that since that would take their power away and they would have to acknowledge their own flaws. So I guess I'm at a loss as to what happens to abused kids in the mean time before everyone's consciousness can be raised? Here's just a hypothetical, a few weeks ago a lot of people here were very concerned about little Caris because of her parents connections and apparent lack of judgement. If it is discovered that they are harming her what is the solution for her? I'm not being a smart ass here, I'm really asking for input.

                     If you have the time and energy, I highly recommend looking at the work of Mark Passio. He provides a synthesis of the problem, with a series of YouTube videos and a 400-hour podcast series. It's not for the faint of heart, but it will help you get started on the path to enlightenment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I believe Mr Passio has the problem nailed down, however he is very passionate, and shows his love in a forceful tone once in a while. His proposed solutions are generally well considered, but I believe we need to rehabilitate and empower families through the generative principle of Care. This last statement has profound meaning in the esoteric traditions, but will be revealed to you in his work. From there, you will have a foundation for further exercises in your understanding of our spiritual nature, and how to help humanity become free again.

                  Dude, I don't work there anymore, and even if I did would you prefer to only have crap social workers who don't value parents rights and will make it even harder for parents to get their kids home? I worked my ass of to get kids returned to their mom or dad because I believe the best place for a child is with their parents if it is in any way possible. Most of my co workers felt the same. We would go to battle with the higher ups to get the kids home and would even go in front of the judge and go against what our agency wanted us to do so that the judge would side with us (social worker and parent) to place the kids back home. Once again there is good and bad in everything and the good ones need to be supported and the bad ones exposed and outed.

                    Because at the agency I worked at the social workers who removed the kids and handled the initial part of the case would transfer it off to long term workers who were tasked with helping the parents get the kids back home. I did the second job and handled the cases long term.

                     Seems like a pretty shitty job... I would probably want to kill myself if someone took away my kids. CPS is cruel and unusual punishment 99% of the time. So you think more parents are abusive than aren't who come across CPS? I guess that's where we completely fucking disagree. Yes there are some abusive parents in the world. No, the state does not own us and shouldn't be taking kids away without extreme abuse and lots of evidence. Go after the pedos, go after the really bad parents and don't let them out of jail to have more kids.

                      It is a shitty job. You see the results of how shitty people are to each other. No actually most of the kids I saw in foster care where I live are there for neglect- specifically drug or alcohol addiction of the parent. Most kids were not abused, but weren't being fed, had no place to live, or were being left to be babysat by people their mom or dad met 5 minutes ago. As you could imagine that is dangerous for a kid and a lot of them are preyed on by pedos .

                      Drugs do awful things to otherwise good people. And I don't mean weed.  I believe what I said before is that more kids were abused and killed by parents than by foster parents. Not that the majority of kids who came to the attention of CPS were abused. I agree completely with you that kids should ONLY be removed as an absolute last resort and that of there is any way possible to keep them with their parents while their parent gets a place to live or goes through drug treatment that's what needs to be done. It's wrong to take them away unless absolutely necessary and it would piss me off to get handed a BS case where the kid could have been kept home but someone made an overzealous call and removed the kid.

                     <p>
                      One of the saddest parts of all of this is that the parents who have drug problems were typically abused as kids, and mostly sexually abused. They turn to drugs to numb their pain and inadvertently expose their own kids to more pedos.So yes, pedos need to be dealt with severely so they stop ruining lives.

                        I'm not here to argue with people. You're perfectly entitled to have you me views. As a group of investigators I thought people here would want some info from someone who has been on the inside of a system that most people know very little about. I absolutely do not agree that if one parent is an alcoholic kids should be removed. The law where I live says the same thing. If there is someone in a household that can keep a kid cared for and safe, that's all the kids need from the CPS standpoint. The other parent can be a massive alcoholic or drug addict, but as long as the kid is taken care of there's no grounds to remove them.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with about more kids being killed by natural parent, but all I have said and continue to say is from what I have seen, more kids here have been killed or raped by their parents than by foster parents. That absolutely does not mean foster parents haven't done those things, it just means that the stats show more kids are killed/raped by their parents. What you maybe should be arguing is that based on percentages and more kids living with natural parents, of course there would be more kids killed and raped by natural parents. If you broke it down and looked at the percentage of kids in foster care and how many of them were killed/raped by foster parents then There may be a significant statistical difference that would show a higher likelihood of a kid being killed by a foster parent. I'm not sure if that's the case but I would never say it's not a possibility.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I'm not an "expert" and never portrayed myself that way. You are being very hostile towards someone who is just trying to offer insight on a subject. If this is how we as a community approach everyone who has even been on the inside of what we say we are trying to fight and reform then we are only alienating people and making it harder to reach our goal.

                         No, I'm just pissed off by CPS, and having seen more than enough cases of CPS being completely wrong and ridiculous and abusive, it is difficult to find the common ground with someone who makes broad statements like more kids are killed by parents than by foster parents. You may have some special knowledge I do not but I have always heard the opposite. I work in the legal field and I know the standards for termination of rights. I got a very bad grade on my research paper in law school when I chose the topic of CPS and why the legal standard is wrong and in my opinion, unconstitutional. People who work in the system, including the judge who was my professor, don't usually like my opinion on CPS. Personally I've been through enough in my own life with the courts and custody and divorce to know what I am talking about which is that it doesn't matter what great parents you are, if someone doesn't like you enough, or if another party has more money, they will take your children from you. CPS is absolutely corrupt and there are a lot of complete bitches who work there. Finding a good CPS worker is a lucky thing. But the entire system is completely wrong. The state doesn't own our kids and shouldn't be able to take them except in severe abuse cases. You said that parents being alcohol and drug addicted constitutes neglect. I know enough lawyers who are alcoholics to believe that if we were to apply that standard to all parents, probably half of the lawyers I know or maybe even 80% of them would not have their children. Personally, I'm a teetotaler and completely against all drugs as well. Yet all it takes is a false allegation and a parent can lose their kids. I am more worried about the children, than the parents. But the parents were given those children for a reason as their protectors and our entire philosophy that the state owns them and can take them at whim until the parents shape up is the huge problem here.

                          A system that is given such immense power is just ripe for abuse and corruption. They do have way too much power and the only way it seems that they ever get put in check or reformed at all is by being sued. The most effective suits I have heard of were from people who had been in foster care. There was a huge class action case in LA county several years ago that caused massive changes to be made as a result. It is wrong that so many young and poor parents end up being the ones who lose their kids because they don't have the supports and experience needed to navigate such a huge system, so I get what you are saying and why you are pissed. I can see it too and my biggest problem is the "medical neglect" issue. If a parent disagrees with a recommended treatment, they can be considered neglectful. That is bullshit since parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children AND basically every doctor you see will give you different advice! Yet too many times CPS and the courts just blindly side with a doctors recommendation. The unquestioning hero worship of doctors needs to end too!
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And on the numbers of child deaths, every state tracks children who die from everything that is not an obvious "natural cause" like cancer or health issue. These cases are reviewed and are overseen by child fatality task forces that report to the state legislature. It is good for average citizens to monitor these boards in their state to watch for trends or anything out of the ordinary. The info is public record and can be found online.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I know the system is screwed and have tried to come up with ways to cause change. I also see the positives and my views may likely be biased by my own experience. I was In foster care. My parents are awful people. I needed help to get away from them because I knew if I didn't I would kill my self or they would kill me. It was that desperate of a situation and no kid should be told by their parents how they were going to be killed and their body disposed of. I went to CPS myself for help and they helped me. I had heard the horror stories but had no where else to turn. I had a great foster mom and social worker, which is what led me to get into that line of work. I had several co workers who had also been in foster care and wanted to help the system from the inside. It's a shit system but not everyone in it is I guess is the overall point I was trying to make.

                   Same old story. You don't work there anymore because you didn't advance. You didn't advance because you weren't psycho enough. Do you see the pattern yet? I believe you're almost enlightened to the patterns of the corrupt system of domination. There is no alternative. Power is corruption. Political and police power over families is a major aspect of the cult of ultimate evil.

                    Actually I had advanced to training and supervising new workers. I ended up leaving after I broke through the feminist brainwashing and realized all I wanted to do was be at home and raise my kids. It's true though that at the very top is where the weird ones are. Power trippers or just psychotic in some way. It's kinda scary.

                     I got a chill when you said you wanted to be at home and raise your kids. That is exercising the sacred generative principle of Care that I just spoke of. The sovereign empowered family is literally what the powers that should not be are trying to topple. You are getting into alignment with Nature. Seriously, that is exactly the solution!

                      Exactly! And that is why I am so against the feminist agenda that tells women to be happy, they must go against what is natural and sacred. It's all lies! And I know if feminism is selling lies to us, thaf other movements and systems are doing the same. I'm still waking up to it all and trying to wake others up too as I learn.

                       We are emerging from what was called "The New Dark Age". The feminist agenda was created by the dark occultists to destroy families. You will learn about this in Passio's podcasts and videos. In the mean time, Take Care, blessed mother. You're doing well on your journey to enlightenment. And we're all doing this for our children's freedom. It's all about Care.

                         Why? I've studied his work extensively. But the main issue is that it is a segway into understanding the occult. You cannot stop with Passio. You don't even have to start with his work. It's simply how I transcended the red pill and began my journey into enlightenment. Enlightenment is initially, and ultimately, a personal journey. If you don't like Passio, that's fine. Get your information on Truth from somewhere else. You have to sample from an eclectic variety of writings and publications to get to the Truth anyway.

                          I gave him a shot, couldn't get through some of his clips. I could try again. He'd probably be at odds w/ my Christian beliefs. That said, link me one of his clearest and best pieces, I'm open to a lot of things.

                            Uh oh, my buddy Eric Dubay (though Dubay's agnostic) apparently likes him. What does Passio think of Icke (sp.)?

                             Passio specifically thanks Icke in his work. I had a hard time with Icke for a while, but I have accepted he is either using metaphor/allegory to save his hide, or perhaps there is some literal truth to his assertions. Either way, Icke has helped me understand the occult as well. Hope this helps..

                               Hey, check out the free your mind conference videos if you need an uplifting break. Some of the work is dark (like the shit we're researching here), but some of it provides solutions. Check out Lenon Honor at the Free Your Mind 3 Conference, 2015. It's my favorite uplifting talk that year:

            CPS is nothing more then another government run pedo, child collecting ring......there was a Senator investigating them a few years back, ( can't think of her name a the moment)...and she turned up dead at the hand of her husband in a murder/suicide.....isn't that the way it always ends when someone is getting to close to the truth.
