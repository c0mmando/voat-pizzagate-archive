characteristics provided him the latitude of appearing to share the principals and

international level. He won Reagan\'s respect through their shared diplomatic 
ties to the Vatican, and his Irish-Catholic heritage. While he appeared publicly 
to oppose Byrd on Senate Appropriations issues, they actually worked together 
behind the scenes in their shared world dominance efforts. Again from my 
perspective, Leahy was a loner who had his own agenda and answered to no one 
I knew. Leahy\'s intelligence was often manifested to me by triple depth 
meaning to his words and actions. Everything he did was for a deeper purpose.&quot;</p>

            There have been a lot of suggestions that the gray's are a robotic or alternate form of life.
Who knows if that precludes procreation in some way?  And they're short.
           </p>
           <p>
            You may recall that John Mack at Harvard had begun quite some time back to study UFO abductees
-- Bud Hopkins got him interested in the subject of abductees and Mack did work with them and came to
understand that this was something real.  Mack took a kind of different spiritual approach to his studies.
I really liked John Mack but can't say that I totally understood the direction he was going.  But Harvard
at some point seemed pushed to get rid of him.  Obviously, those keeping these secrets don't want 
scientists involved in studying abductees.  A few years ago, John Mack was killed by a hit and run driver
while he was in London for some kind of lecture on this subject.  Turned out that there were two John
Mack's killed that night in the same way.  Seems like they got the wrong John Mack the first time.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, coming back to the gray's -- in one of John Mack's books he related the story of one female 
abductee who was being repeatedly abducted where she woke up at some point in the morning
to find a gray standing near her dresser ... and trying on her high heel shoes!
           </p>
           <p>
            Seemed to me that no one would ever make up a story like that -- had to be the truth!   :)

            They are not just pedophiles remember, they are practicing satanists, luciferians, sabbatean frankists, or however they see themselves... Blood ritual and sacrifice... the Circle of Trust... Schumer, Gilibrand, Leahy, Podesta, Clinton, Weiner, Abedin, Pelosi, Cuomo, Eric Schneiderman, Lindsey Graham, McCain, Claire McCaskill, Eric Holder, Maxine Waters, Soros... most of the CNN reporters... as FBIAnon has said, up to a third in D.C... tens of thousands in power across America.
           </p>
           <p>
            The alien aspect is an attempt to distort truth... they always use the truth as cover, as a trojan horse. Like how they've twisted religions. The know full disclosure is coming, which they cannot stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of you have to understand that many of these people are incarnated Reptilians and other negative races. They are nothing but parasites here to consume the lifeforce of humans.

            Interesting and certainly it's not the first time we've heard this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bob Lazar got a lot of the story out and faced some dangers, but it seems also at 
times like some of those keeping this story hidden may want the public to have more 
information, presumably just in case they would have to download it all on us at one time.
There does seem to be an education program running at the same time as many want to hold
onto the power and the secrecy.
Our government now treats Whistleblowers on all subjects by hitting them with the Espionage
Act which was intended for those who commit treason against US government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know if you saw SNOWDEN movie on Showtime, but somewhere in it, someone says ...
something like, "When a government keeps secrets from the public it is a conspiracy."
           </p>
           <p>
            Disclosure Project is also doing a great job -- 
(It seems like a lot of nations -- including Russia at the time the Wall went down -- thought that 
the subject would then be opened/revealed, but very quickly our government/CIA jumped in to
prevent them from releasing information to us here.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly, greater "intelligence" doesn't seem to guarantee non-violent, compassion, truth.
What we're seeing right now read more like the old story by Twilight Zone which was 
titled "To Serve Mankind" and which it turned out at the end of the story was a cook book!
           </p>
           <p>
            When our astronauts began, they were calling aliens the "Heinz 57 Varieties" but from I read
today there may be something more like 300 plus species known to the US government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Allegedly, Nordic are our allies -- Reptilians are very aggressive and they seem to have 
gained control over our planet.  Whatever has been going on it's been going on for at least 
100 thousand years.
           </p>
           <p>
            We may think we're accepting this reality, but emotionally ... I'm not sure.  :)

            Notice one of his favorite movies is 'My Wifes a Vampire' lol, Also on Wikipedia He Pro-Abortiion, Rejects School Prayer, but says he is Catholic and attends Holy Trinity Catholic Church when in DC, (maybe that church needs checking?) -

            -  Something different, I did not know there were good functioning tunnels right into the whitehouse/government officies? etc., I had only seen those dodgy ones: Dupont Circle, these working tunnels up to the White House seem the most obvious way to take children in and out -

            Obviously, Sen. Pat Leahy wasn't anxious for this stuff to be known as he cautions Kathy O'Brien to "Keep your mouth shut."
Despite the lack of conscience or shame there seems at least to be FEAR of this stuff being known.
That's a plus for these investigations.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the rest of the psychobabble, imo there are two possibilities -- either what he is saying is further confirmation of alien existence and control on this planet, or what he is saying suggests that he is a victim of MKULTRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was never a "god" until Elite patriarchy needed a single-all-powerful god to proclaim males superior to females.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that was done first with the Old Testament which was written to create the "one god" theory and to cement patriarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The New Testament offers a less violent "god" but still follows the Old Testament's "one god" and continues to underpin patriarchy.
The "Jesus" character is in rebellion in many ways against the Old Testament and its teachings and male-supremacy seems to be one of those issues.  With so many changes to the "Bible" and so many contradictions it is clear that it is history changed for the convenience of powerful people at that time.  "Eat only what grows in the Garden" also suggests to me that a primary act of violence against animals -- likely first in sacrifice, but later as animal-eating -- may have been the actual act which caused the "shame" in the Garden of Eden.
And, Eve continues to stand today with her message -- holding the Apple.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do have to agree with Kathy O'Brien's thoughts that Leahy is one of the most intelligent of these manipulators.

             The New Testiment offers a less violent God because Jesus Christ paid the price for your and my sins if we should believe on Him.
The age of mercy began...but do not be deceived Jesus Christ is gearing up for war!
Read Revelations...war against those that love darkness more than the light and truth.
There will be blood shed.
            </p>
            <p>
             But first there is mercy...overwhelming love...a drawing of ourselves to our creator.
One way God says He proves that He is the one God is that He foretells what is to come and He has done that and we are in the middle of it.
Every word of His will come to pass...
He says it's like labor pains...little by little they get worse and worse until His kingdom will be birthed here on earth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Satan is an imitator...not a creator...he imitates God.
There is a video out there that talks about this big tunnel that has been dug in Switzerland the Gotthard Base Tunnel it opened on June 1, 2017.
They had big bizarre demonic ceremony depicting the anti christ being born into the world...crazy stuff.
Well that is an imitation of what is really going to happen...because the day is coming when as it says in Revelations 11:15
"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever."
            </p>
            <p>

              The right wing is really nuts about violence and a "violent" god.
Revelations was written by another insane guy.
Oh ... can't wait ... more bloodshed.  How wonderful.
Let's all celebrate -- a violent "god" is spilling blood again!!
             </p>
             <p>
              Wouldn't you think that any real "god" would be able to get things done a bit more compassionately
and neatly?
             </p>
             <p>
              If you're insisting on a "Creator" .... then who created your Creator?
             </p>
             <p>
              Mercy ... from a "god" that clearly will throw you in Hell to burn forever?
             </p>
             <p>
              "god" talked about labor pains?
             </p>
             <p>
              Every human being is capable of wrongdoing, capable of evil, capable of violence.
And that's something which everyone has to understand.
             </p>
             <p>
              If there is a "god" she is not a fascist -- she has given you free conscience, free thought, and free will ...
and she expects you to use it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Middle-men to "god" are not necessary -- as your "god" himself (Jesus) said .... "Ask and you shall receive."\
             </p>
             <p>
              This video is obvious porn by whomever created the program -- low level -- didn't watch all the way through ...
             </p>
             <p>
              and the tunnel is symbolic of birth canal.

               I've been thinking about my reply...
First of all I have lost all faith in either side.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sometimes we post without thinking of how others may take it if they don't know what you do...I certainly do not like violence, yet it sounded like I was looking forward to it.
I am not!
I do believe in Gods great mercy, the Bible says it is as far as heaven is from the earth.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yet I also believe in a day when evil will be defeated for good.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus Christ is gearing up for war...against your and my enemy, satan...and those that follow him...
The Bible says that he, satan, roams the earth looking for who he can destroy, he hides himself  (but these days he is starting to reveal himself)
              </p>
              <p>
               Many times God gets blamed for satans handy work.
The pain and destruction he causes is to try and make us hate God...as he does.
              </p>
              <p>
               My reference was to the fact that there is a great amount of satan worshiping going on, and that the people in that play in Sweden were depicting the anti-christ being born into the earth...because they want him here...they are horribly deceived.
If you do listen to it the narrators even tell you what is happening.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is frightening to think of, but it is happening just as the Word of God has said it would.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Word of God has also told over and over again of his great love and protection for those who trust in Him.
I am not a theologian by any imagination...just someone who has had a great amount of help given to them by the LORD in times when I did not have anyone to help.
Also, it's not God who is in labor, it is the earth, earth is in labor pain.
Mark 13:8 "For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be earthquakes in various places, there will also be famines.
These things are merely the beginning of birth pangs."
              </p>
              <p>
               God says that this is the way that He proves He is the one real God...that He tells us ahead of time what is to come.

                artfully --
               </p>
               <p>
                One of the primary motives of organized patriarchal religions is Mind Control through FEAR.
To get members to believe and OBEY and not to question.
Yet, if there is a "god" that god has given you the ability to think freely, to question, a free conscience and free will and 
expects you to use those gifts.
Further, you do not need middle-men to "god" --
Everything that you need to know comes from within you -- from your conscience.
               </p>
               <p>
                Granted, because there is much information hidden from the public by secrets kept
by organized Elites, we don't have all of the pieces of the puzzle.
Certainly, knowledge of alien visitation to this planet and the fact that we may be related to
some species of ET's is a big missing piece of the puzzle.
ALL of the information which seemed to have been obvious to our ancestors was hidden 
away from the public.
To further complicate things, some groups of Elites seem to have made pacts with one or 
more species of aliens who may want to exploit humankind, abuse humankind.
               </p>
               <p>
                But I do feel very strongly about
                <strong>
                 a universal spirituality
                </strong>
                , that we are all one.
That whatever exists, we are all part of it in some way.  We are ALL part of nature.
               </p>
               <p>
                Very few of us could identify a "god" of mercy in the Bible - quite to the contrary.
               </p>
               <p>
                **It is up to us to defeat evil **- the struggle against SLAVERY is part of it -- and that attempt to enslave 
others is not over by any means.  It is total enslavement of body and mind they are after.
GENOCIDE is still ongoing; it didn't end after our government murdered 112 million natives here.
And our corrupt government continues still to steal from the natives/reservations and natural resources.
               </p>
               <p>
                WOMEN who are the majority of the population everywhere, continue to be murdered and oppressed
simply for being the opposite gender.  We are the only species where males are at war with females.
In order to destroy evil, this oppression of women must be ended.
               </p>
               <p>
                AA's and Africa, itself -- and ALL exploitation of citizens of other nations and the nations themselves
must be ended.  We will have ended evil when we close down our for-profit, privatized prisons where
so many people of color are imprisoned.  Certainly evil is present in this history and continuing oppression.

                HOMOSEXUALS have been abused over the last 1,000 ears and more because of the teachings
of the RCC which was so successful in its preachings that even the families of homosexuals 
abandoned their own children.  The RCC spread intolerance and hatred for homosexuals which
took hold in our society and resulted in beatings, oppression and even murder of homosexuals.
The new boogey man now is "transgender" and it's their turn in the barrel.
This is evil at work.
               </p>
               <p>
                NATURE itself has been under constant attack by white males -- including animal-life -- since they
invaded this land.  If you want to defeat evil on this planet then end the insanity and violence of 
animal-eating which would be a huge step in the right direction.
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember that the Bible was written by human beings -- men who took control by violence and
who wrote books to support their delusions of supremacy.
               </p>
               <p>
                The "Satan" gimmickry is an effort to make you NOT see what is actually going on.
Who is actually responsible for the violence.  Whose hands committed those murders?
               </p>
               <p>
                It is organized patriarchal religion which has brought a "SATAN" into the minds of members to make them 
fearful.  Of course that invented "Satan" had to be all powerful ... in order to sufficiently frighten you.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you look at the list above with an open mind, you will see that those mentioned are not the 
enemies of "god" but the enemies of Elites who STOLE this land from the natives people here.
               </p>
               <p>
                From a Patriarchy which finally debased women to a point where they were being burned at the 
stake for their knowledge of medicine/plants, of child bearing.  Where women were denied access
to even their own children and/or to inheritance.  Women are the eternal threat to patriarchy's existence.
               </p>
               <p>
                Homosexuals may be nature's way of balancing life on this planet -- using them as caretakers
for orphaned children, preventing overpopulation of the planet.  And because each homosexual
male and female share characteristics of heterosexual females and males, they may provide 
insights into our behaviors and serve as a bridge between males and females
But they were a threat to an alleged "norm" of heterosexuality which Elite patriarchy was
trying to enforce on the population.
               </p>
               <p>
                This Elite Patriarchy is underpinned by organized patriarchal religion whose "god" allegedly
declared them superior to others on this planet.  Also look to "Manifest Destiny" and 
"Man's Dominion Over Nature" which gave Elites license to exploit Nature on this planet, to
exploit our natural resources and animal-life .... for their own personal profit.
               </p>
               <p>
                Many of us have found a higher self when we have been in need.  Perhaps we are all "god"?
               </p>
               <p>
                The earth is suffering the activities of humankind -- most notably the Industrial Revolution -- which we
call Global Warming.  Many don't understand that there was a 50 year delay in our beginning to feel
these effects and what we are feeling right now only reflects the damage done to our planet up to about 1967.
Our scientists immediately saw the damage being done to Nature by the Industrial Revolution in the 1880's.
               </p>
               <p>
                We will also actually see increasingly more extreme weather events due to Global Warming
as it progresses -- tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones, droughts/floods.
And, yes, we will see increasing numbers of earthquakes and increasing severity of earthquakes
due to the melting of the glaciers which changes the pressures on the tectonic plates.
In act, this was the subject of a Pentagon Memo to "W" warning him that Global Warming was a 
more severe threat to the US than "terrorism."
               </p>
               <p>
                This Memo originally included "earthquakes" but that subject was scrubbed 
after a few years ...

             You don't know what you're talking about.  There is more manuscript evidence for the Bible's historical consistency than any other single piece of literature in the world.  You can see the manuscripts lined up and follow any tiny "type-o" down through the ages.  And that's all you'll find are minor, harmless little errors that change not a single doctrine.  If people repeat a foolish myth long enough (IE. the Bible has substantially changed down through the centuries) it become a fact in the mind of the uneducated.

               I know the Bible very well thank you, and the amazing historical reliability of the document.  And, "yes" God is a violent God, EVERY human being EVER taken down has been taken down by God's own decree.  Because EVERY human being has broken God's laws and therefore only continues to live another day by His mercy alone.  But the most consistent Judge ever is also the most merciful Judge ever.  He personally paid the price to commute your death sentence, if you would quit spitting in His face long enough to hear Him out.

             Or are "aliens" synonymous for "demons?" Never thought of this idea before going down the rabbit hole, but it's good to keep an open mind.

              You might be on to something there ...

             <p>
              We seem to be learning more about Hitler these days where there may have been some kind of Elite
contact with aliens where he had expectations of weapons like UFO's - time travel.
Don't know who made out better in the deal, Hitler or Aliens???
             </p>
             <p>
              But US/Ike primarily is also said to have had Elite contact with aliens -- something like what you saw in
the movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" w/Richard Dreyfuss.
             </p>
             <p>
              At any rate, US supposed found three Atomic bombs in Germany -- one used for test here -- and 
other two dropped on Japan.  Why didn't Hitler use them?
             </p>
             <p>
              Nixon also was fond of showing off the "aliens" we had found or captured later preserved in
fluid and floating in glass enclosures.
             </p>
             <p>
              But co-opting other nations as the US has regularly done, wouldn't be much different from aliens 
co-opting this planet.  Seemingly some would be hidden, some in oceans, whatever.
And some in our government, Congress -- !!!

             Thank you!  I love your red pilling of the bible.  We know they changed many things to get the outcome they wanted. Gay Saints used to be married in a ceremony many centuries ago, possibly the 15th or 16th.  As for ET stuff, remember Molly Macauley?  She was killed the same weekend as Seth Rich.  She was a scientist working for NASA under Obama and supposedly discovered they could control voting machines by satellites

             </a>
             among other discoveries that she found.  These are not bazaar things, these are all possible for they have been working on this for years Why do you think NASA has been privatized? Remember, they are at least 50 yrs. ahead of where we think they are.

              When I hit your link and saw the picture of Molly I realized that I had seen it before and somewhere had been made aware of her death and that likely it was suspicious.  BUT it's the first I remember hearing that she had "discovered they could control voting machines by satellites among other discoveries that she found."  AND, I certainly do not consider that bizarre.  Our government put these voting machines in beginning about 1967 (1965 for the large computers used by MSM) so we are 50 years into this REMOTE manipulation of our votes.  Satellites would certainly have been a step up on telephone poles which seemed to be the way the votes were stolen electronically via telephone lines at the time of Sununu.

               The aide said that guys like me were "in what we call the reality-based community," which he defined as people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality." I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off.* "That's not the way the world really works anymore." He continued "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors … and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."

              And I pretty much take that for granted -- 
If you simply look at the Constitution which we were all taught to honor and esteem you see that what our Founders actually did was  to create an Elite Patriarchy, endowed them with land grants and gave them immense influence and control over our "people's" government, the nation's wealth and natural resources, animal-life.
And the Founders did all of this while proclaiming "All are equal" and carrying out Genocide against the Native people here now thought to have been 112 million of them.  They also saved the system of Slavery for the wealthy even down to the "Runaway Slave Act" and by so doing guaranteed the Civil War which also benefitted Elites by separating the nation into two separate camps of hatred which still echo today.
(See:  Manifest Destiny and Man's Dominion Over Nature, license to Elites issued by organized patriarchal religion which underpins Elite Patriarchy.)

              The Old World Religions of course were based in Nature and had no Satan, Devil or Hell.  These were the inventions of Elite Patriarchy in order to frighten members of male-supremacist religions which they invented many thousands of years later.

               UpVoat4U.I saw Snowden in the Theater with an open mind.  I am waiting for the rest of his story.  "we create our own reality" is a sign of the False Flags and Fake Actors that are creating Lies that they have invented.  Kind of New Fake History they are creating while re-writing our old history and burning them down.  We must stop this.  The night before the winning of Macron was announced I copied some emails that were hacked from him, they were on 4chan.  His mission is to create a controlled belief of what happened and is going to happen.  They are planning to re-write European History to include somehow Muslim history to appease them, the Muslims, and this will make up for the overcrowding, no jobs, and disrespect for their religion, etc.  This is what they are planning for our country, Europe is the Blue Print.

                True -- though these events are faked -- 9/11, Vietnam and many others -- we do suffer the consequences.
Our MSM and Congress act as though these events are valid, true and act accordingly.

               </p>
               <p>
                Our government created Taliban and Al Qaeda (actually Al Qaeda was an ancient cult which had petered out and which came
into the possession of the CIA from the Nazis at the end of WWII) -- and it was all fakery that Jimmy Carter took us out of the
Russian Olympics -- (See Brzezinski)
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, the US has worked very hard to create a violent strain of Islamic beliefs -- jihad, etc.
PLUS, the US has created these war situations which has created Muslim refugees and refugees
from all over the ME fleeing these wars.

                Religion has long been a tool of the US government for conquest just as Capitalism has been a major tool of conquest.
Why not Islam, as well?

                 The CIA's Intervention in Afghanistan
Interview with Zbigniew Brzezinski,
President Jimmy Carter's National Security Adviser
                </strong>
                Le Nouvel Observateur, Paris, 15-21 January 1998
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Question: The former director of the CIA, Robert Gates, stated in his memoirs &lt;"From the Shadows"&gt;, that American intelligence services began to aid the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months before the Soviet intervention. In this period you were the national security adviser to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this affair. Is that correct?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Brzezinski: Yes. According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise Indeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Q: Despite this risk, you were an advocate of this covert action. But perhaps you yourself desired this Soviet entry into war and looked to provoke it?
                </p>
                <p>
                 B: It isn't quite that. We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Q: When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in Afghanistan, people didn't believe them. However, there was a basis of truth. You don't regret anything today?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Q: Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter. We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war. Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Q: And neither do you regret having supported the Islamic fundamentalism, having given arms and advice to future terrorists?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Q: What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war?

               <p>
                They also spent millions producing jihad preaching, fundamentalist textbooks and shipping them off to Afghanistan. These were the same text books the Western media discussed in shocked tones and told their audiences were used by fundamentalist teachers to brainwash their charges and to inculcate in young Afghanis a jihad mindset, hatred of foreigners and non-Muslims etc.

                <p>
                 Because it has been almost unreported in the Western media that the US government shipped, and continues to ship, millions of Islamist textbooks into Afghanistan.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Only one English-speaking newspaper we could find has investigated this issue: the Washington Post. The story appeared March 23rd.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Washington Post investigators report that during the past twenty years the US has spent millions of dollars producing fanatical schoolbooks, which were then distributed in Afghanistan.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "The primers, which were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines, have served since then as the Afghan school system's core curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books..." -- Washington Post, 23 March 2002 (1)
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to the Post the U.S. is now "...wrestling with the unintended consequences of its successful strategy of stirring Islamic fervor to fight communism."
                </p>
                <p>
                 So the books made up the core curriculum in Afghan schools. And what were the unintended consequences? The Post reports that according to unnamed officials the schoolbooks "steeped a generation in violence."
                </p>
                <p>
                 How could this result have been unintended? Did they expect that giving fundamentalist schoolbooks to schoolchildren would make them moderate Muslims?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nobody with normal intelligence could expect to distribute millions of violent Islamist schoolbooks without influencing school children towards violent Islamism. Therefore one would assume that the unnamed US officials who, we are told, are distressed at these "unintended consequences" must previously have been unaware of the Islamist content of the schoolbooks.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But surely someone was aware. The US government can't write, edit, print and ship millions of violent, Muslim fundamentalist primers into Afghanistan without high officials in the US government approving those primers.

                 It worked so well, the repeated it with ISIS.  Our govt. NOT US.  Yes.  They have done this without our knowledge and behind our backs.  We have a bought and paid for MSM that has not done service to the American people but to our Kangaroo Govt.  and the CIA Rogue Outfit that is a global org. not of the US.  It needs to be abolished at once.  I remember hearing something about this book program a few years ago on the news, but then it went away.  This is also what they are planning here.  People, read your children's text books, I am sure they are not the same as YOU remember.

                  True -- our government has long created dictators all over the world and supported them ...
and now they're busy creating "terrorists."

                  Yes, the "news" about the books on TV showed classrooms full of children reading violent
passages from these books about Jihad written by the CIA ... 
though no one on TV mentioned that part of it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Many people actually believed the story which played over and again on TV.

                   And no outcry from the American People.  This is why it is continuing.  We are all on here trying to shut this down and hoping that people come to our site and read  what they have been doing.  When they wake up, and I believe they will, it will be phenomenal.

             If you're imitating a native American by calling yourself "Chief Crazy Horse" you should be aware that the first question
that the natives here asked Columbus was whether he and his people were aware of visitors from the stars.
Not only is native American lore very much based in a story of being created underground but of many visitations by people from the stars.

             Hey ponyclubgirl anyone who has gone through the MK Ultra programme is bound to be a little crazy. After what she went through I think we need to at least listen to her story - and then make our minds up.

             chiefcrazy - are you an Indian?   Just curious.
            </p>
            <p>
             My reply to you is this:     The satanic pedo networks  count on people calling victims "crazy".
            </p>
            <p>
             Outlandish torture is ----  for that reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would anyone "sane" believe a child who says -  "they wore masks.  they squirted blood on me.  they put a tube in my butt and stole my poop"
            </p>
            <p>
             Crazy? Just crazy?
            </p>
            <p>
             How could a child even think of such things?      Are they watching Satanic Ritual Abuse videos on youtube?   Are these things being portrayed on TV?      Otherwise, children only  say what they see.  They are very literal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry for you --
            </p>
            <p>
             If you ware still saying they are  "opportunistic tales",  you are not getting this at all
            </p>
            <p>
             Please READ a few books   such as  Blood on the Doorposts   or WATCH a few videos on youtube by former Satanists  before you spout off and sound like an idiot.    You are either  uninformed  or you are a troll.   Likely a Troll

            "It was also my experience that Bush Sr. adhered to Hitler/Himler research that sexually abusing a child would heighten their suggestibility and intelligence in accordance with creating the perfect race.  This formula was used on his own son for Presidential placement to ensure the 100 year plan for global domination was ushered in." Kathy O'Brien. She goes on to say that Bill Clinton refused to carry on this grand tradition with Chelsea - to his credit.

             Thanks for your comment.   Am glad to hear that Chelsea wasn't tortured.   Bill rarely shows mercy so I wonder how he came up with that

              As much as I despise Billy Clinton, by all accounts he adored Chelsea and he was her primary caregiver when she was little and Hillary couldn't be bothered with her. There is said to be a spark of light in the heart of the even most depraved of souls, I guess Chelsea is his.

               Chelsea is a Jew married to a Jew--not likely they would be on that side of the torture scenario---more likely the perpetrators. Think of it--Ghislane Maxwell at her wedding, etc.

             I believe possibly Chelsea is not his child.  There have been pictures of another man that could be her father and she has an incredible likeness to this man.  I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not.  But she is Hillary's child of course.

              I'll eat my hat if she isn't Webb's daughter.  Helen Keller could even tell.While unrelated likenesses happen in nature, those are some unique characteristics Webb and Chelsea share.  Kinda like WJC's son.  I'm surprised they haven't sent the "Mouthy Negro Silencing Unit" to Arkancide him yet.
             </p>
             <p>
              Random fun fact: The Clinton's used a loophole in AR law which allowed them to get "house niggers" from the state correctional system without having to pay them (leaves money in the budget for other things).  Of course they only picked the highest-stepping, most domesticated yellows.  I wouldn't be surprised if ole Billy Boy checked out and inspected the merchandise before allowing it in the Gubner's mansion?

              Note: My use of racial charged language is intentional.  The only "racism" which seems abundant on Voat is that against the Jews.  So I thought I would wake up a few people with reminders that this can cut anywhere.  The shills do not get to use the power of racism against us.  A brief reminder that other groups have been at the short end of the persecution stick throughout history, at the hands of the PedoNazis, enabled by the cuckolded shills.

               Yes, I worry about that young man, his son.  There is another uncanny resemblance.  Another coincidence I presume?  One, but not two, imo is a possibility, but both of the children are not a byproduct of their union with each other.  Yes, racism does rear it's ugly head, but there is way too much of it on here.  It has gotten out of hand in this country, I fear.  We have always had a problem with it, but I fear it is much worse than a few decades ago.  People are being pushed to their limits and blaming others and the hatred is coming out.  This is how they win.  Divide and Conquer.

               Juanita Brodrick spoke about Hillary not wanting to be pregnant and abusing herself by punching herself in the stomach repeatedly. Chelsea wasn't wanted, she was needed to give the appearance of a happy family.

               The proof is that genes will out. Chelsea is obvioiusly Hubble's kid and HIllary is well know to have suspended her lesbian/pedo activity to have an affair with him. Bill is sterile, and the whole womanizer persona may be a convenient fiction to hide

               Yes, I believe that is the name and yes there is a remarkable likeness.  There is a way to prove it, but I am sure it will never happen. They don't have to prove anything, we are just suppose to believe their lies, just because of who they are.  Elites. Boy were we dumb. That is changing.

            This is really scary.  I had only read something about him one time, and now this. How many of them are there?  I feel like I am watching Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Every time they horribly abuse a child they may be creating a carbon copy of themselves.  Stop them for they are multiplying.

             Interesting how she mentions '...they were alien themed.....' Podesta tweeted about Aliens being real just a few months ago. Evil twisted freak. We are dealing with a mentally deranged cult that's been allowed to run amok - globally!

               Yes, project Bluebeam is real. This "cult" believes in aliens, but not the traditional extra-terrestrial from another planet. They believe in inter-dimensional beings.

               Lam is an inter-dimensional being, Aiwass is said to be an inter-dimensional being who helped Aleister Crowley write The Book of the Law (1904). Thelema is based on that book.

                Project Bluebeam is a creation of the Intelligence services.

                Aleister Crowley was a crypto Jew who came form a long line of agents, and created all his crap as a psyop and it has worked well on fools. TPTB would like you to think aliens and Satanism are legit. Crowley was MI6 agent 666. The word "thelema" is jsut a bastardization of the Greek phrase :do what thou wilt"--the slogan of all narcissists and sociopaths. The nobly reality of it is the minds of the brainwashed masses.

                Aiwass was Crowely's holy guardian angel.
               </p>
               <p>
                He often refers to "obtaining the knowledge and conversation of your holy guardian angel" in his work. What it really means is training the conscious mind to communicate  with the unconscious mind. 
So an "inter-dimensional being" will be found within the infinite scope of our sub-conscious.

                Liber Al &amp; Liber Abe. Book of the law. Crawley broke away from OTO and formed religion of Thelema. He 'died' at age 77!!!!! 77 is Crawley's number - think back to flight 77 (non existent in FAA database, a made up flight) It was a tribute to Crawley.

              I very much agree.  While we thought we had somewhat of an somewhat organized chaotic but crazy govt., we now find it is just Pure Evil.   Podesta needs to be watched, he may be coming unhinged like Pelosi and Agnew.  There have been some really weird comments.  Yes, this is a mentally deranged cult run amok, and This Will Be The Fight of Our Lives.

               It's not a possibility we can dismiss so easily.
               <br/>
               While, again, we don't have access to actual evidence because it is our secret government (or present government at this point) which controls it, this again points to humans as having been created in labs/Garden of Eden's and that we are hybrids, possibly created on this planet as slave labor.  This would have happened hundred thousand years ago, perhaps.
              </p>
              <p>
               Unfortunately, neither are we talking about a few or a handful of aliens -- last count I heard was over 300 different species that our government is aware of.  And at least one species is know to be "aggressive."
              </p>
              <p>
               We also have suggestions that Princess Diana was made aware of this in regard to the "Royal Family" just before her marriage to Charles.

              Kathy O'Brien, co-author of the book Trance Formation of America, was basically "given" to the government for MK Ultra  program in order to get her father off of child porn charges. Her mind was already splintered and they knew it --thus she was a perfect candidate for mind control, which requires compartmentalization of the brain. These people are subjected to tortures and abuses  which are  extreme; indeed unspeakable. It was through the help of former CIA operative Mark Philips (now her husband) that she was able to break through all her "programming." She is blessed (or cursed) with a photographic memory and because of this she has been able to document all that occurred to her from early childhood through adulthood  as an MK ultra subject. Her book Trance Formation of America was to be used as testimony in Congressional hearings back in the late 70's or early 80's . The hearings were discontinued on the basis of  national security.   This book is the prologue to the Pizzagate/pedogate  conditions we are seeing today. Without going into too much detail, she alludes to witnessing animal and child torture and children in cages, black masses, human hunting parties. I read it 15 years ago, couldn't imagine it being true but now am seeing the very things she wrote about then. and she did write quite extensively about leahy, Byrd, both Clintons and many others.

                Yes, an Upvoat for Rmm.  We cannot see this in print often enough. Also it is a Radical Red Pill for Newcomers.  It is a shocker for sure, but we have read these reports from others as well.  The more this comes out the quicker they lose their stature, for they are in love with their importance.  Truth shall set us free and put them in a cell.
