Given the thread linked in the GA thread, I have reason to believe a high level priest is involved in some of these murders.</p>

<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>The Pool: Notice the red stains on the ground. Those are most likely bloodstains via not cleaning properly. If you zoom in the ropes to the left, you’ll notice dark discolorations near the bottom of the loops. I believe this is blood mixed into the ropes. This actually tells me quite a lot about how the murders are being done. I believe the victims are being suspended from ropes, then have their throats slit in a form of sacrifical murders.</p>
<p>The Gym Painting: My theory has changed here. Given the thick woods around the Biltmore estate and the Vanderbilts “interests” I suspect that its possible that human hunting (targeting children) is taking place. In addition to the possibility of the dogs being used as murder weapons, I suspect they are being used as hunting dogs. However, it is equally possible that the site for the dog related murders could still be in the gym.</p>
<p><a href="https://animalso.com/breeds/rottweiler/#tab-con-2">https://animalso.com/breeds/rottweiler/#tab-con-2</a> Rottweilers are HIGHLY intelligent animals and CAN be used as hunting dogs. Their role in the hunt is not conventional tracking or fetching like a typical hunting dog. A Rottweiler’s form of being a hunting dog is as a “take down” dog. Basically they get involved in the kill. Can fight things like bears and coyotes, so being used against humans is logical.</p>
<p>Given the butcher’s belts pointed out by <a href="https://voat.co/user/Blacksmith21">@Blacksmith21</a>, I believe that the victims of these hunts are butchered, then eaten with the dogs getting the scraps.</p>
<p>Possible Suspects: A high level priest, Anderson Cooper (known cannibal), Barrack Obama, the Pedosta brothers (I believe those paintings are mementos of some of the murders they were involved in), possibly James Franco. Will update if given valid reason to suspect some of the people who have been to the Biltmore Estate.</p>',

            In the shade of the farm’s old oaks, a herd of young Berkshire pigs recently acquired from a heritage breeder in Lexington is foraging for acorns. Inside the barn, a new litter of piglets almost a week old rests in the sawdust near their sow. These are the first purebred Berkshire hogs farrowed on the estate since George Vanderbilt’s Berkshire operation was phased out in 1909.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could barely read about the pigs (hogs) I could not stop focusing on what this might mean.  We have had articles and researching done on the horrid methods they may be using to make Our Children and their Victims disappear.

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/darkknight111">
             @darkknight111
            </a>
            . Thanks for posting. Always good to dig into the Vanderbilt / Biltmore Estate stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have some edit requests, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Please explain about which murders you are actually talking about. Please remember that we have many newbies who are not familiar with the topic, and also, users shouldn't have to click several links until they find info that you might be referring to.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess you are referring to a painting Tony Podesta owns, by one of his fav painters, which shows children in a circle, possible dead? If so, please provide a jpeg or png of this painting here in the thread, so that users can click on it directly. Thank you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please also elaborate why you think an actual murder has taken place (one or several murders), and why you think the children were murdered on the Estate. If your connection of dots is speculative, please point that out. Thanks.
           </p>
           <p>
            2)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Given the thread linked in the GA thread, I have reason to believe a high level priest is involved in some of these murders.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Please add a sentence as a short summary, so that people don't have to click through the links. Ty.
           </p>

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            We've discussed the Cannibal Club before multiple times IIRC. It turned out to have been an elaborate hoax, 'art project' etc., at least it didn't seem to be an actual restaurant where human meat was served. You might want to use searchvoat.co, and look at the old threads. At least the alleged membership of Anderson Cooper in the - most likely ficticious - 'Cannibal Club' isn't proof that he really is a Cannibal.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Please note that I'm not saying it's totally unlikely he might be, but the alleged 'membership' in the 'Cannibal Club' isn't proof.)
           </p>
           <p>
            4) It would be great if you could link the actual pics, so that people will immediately get what you are referring to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you. Please keep up the excellent work.

              . Since you state both in the headline and in your first sentence that the murders took place, while this is possible, but not proven, I will change the flair to 'Unverified'.
