            Are you saying the swirls making the wheels on the pumpkin carriage are what stand out? How else would one design a pumpkin carriage wheel made of vine without swirling it? Overall, good info and thanks for sharing, but people have been really reading way too much into swirls around here.

            Pedos prey on the weak. I highly doubt Chael Sonnen, one of the toughest dudes on the planet, would be their target...Especially if a physical confrontation was involved. Just my 2 cents.

            Shanghied would be the term. In Portland and San Francisco they would have seats in front of bars that would send them down a wooden chute. Next thing would be awake in shackles on a chinese junk.

            Did I read somewhere that Rahm Emmanuel's brother owns, UFC?
I had a very hard time understanding Chael's story that he repeated over &amp; over &amp; over again.

             I read that too but have forgotten what it stands for.  Ari and Rahm and Zeke are set or life.  The bad thing is Rahm has kids.  They will surely follow in his footsteps.

            Great find! I think the "trap door" is possibly a metaphor in this story.  Perhaps a metaphor for pedo activity?  As in,  they had a child there and were trying to make John do some lewd act with the child to prove he was "one of the boys"...?

            Chael could be bs'ing, but, when I saw the picture of an actual mining well, it occurred to me that if the story is true, the other men might have been trying to deliver John/Jon via the well to a group underground that had a sacrifice area somewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought I should post this here.  It's a memory from my life, anecdotal, and can't be proved (as of now.)
           </p>
           <p>
            My memory might not be exact, but in approximately the 1970's, when I was a child, not sure what age, I witnessed someone I think was a professional wrestler get sacrificed.  (I don't remember details of that part.)  My relatives are involved in Pedogate, although the victim was a young adult.  It happened at Disneyland (or Disney World, I don't know.)  The room where it happened was large, brightly lit, and decorated in oversized Egyptian "kitsch," if that is the right word.  I entered it with another person from a corridor; we had also just walked in a fake stone tunnel that had a sidewalk, where we needed a flashlight for some reason.  I didn't see any other children in the room.
           </p>
           <p>
            The room was round and had graduated seating.  These areas could have been below or above ground, it could have been day or night, but I do remember we were near the It's a Small World Ride.  The young man was on an altar in the center.   He had long blond hair with dark roots, and he was tan.  He had an armband above his left bicep, it was medium brown plain suede, brand new, and looked Native American style-costumey and "fake."  The side(s) of the altar was/were red, shiny, with gold trim at the bottom.  The gold I think was plaster or something painted to look like fringe on the edge of fabric.  Someone had put gold paint on the lower half of the victim's abdomen.
           </p>
           <p>
            I recall being used when I was younger as a hypnotist, Illuminati witch type practitioner - I don't know how to do that in real life, nor would I.  I recall at the ritual described above I was wearing a shiny red robe/"dressing gown" trimmed with white marabou, and a headdress which was around a 12" tall, tallish triangle, made of medium-sized red and black feathers, which also had some metallic or jewel-like items among the feathers, and white shoes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember more as time goes by about different things I had forgotten.  I posted this particular memory once before as a comment on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            (I since deleted it,) before I remembered the young man's dark roots in his hair, the outfit they had on me, the adults sitting in graduated seating in the room, and some other things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately there is no one among my relatives who talks about these hidden things, nor anyone I can safely ask about not-family-approved memories, I already tried.

            Sooo. His friend John was jumped by three supposed friends, the first, Steve,  trying to push him in a trap door in the floor, without explanation. When each of the other two entered the room one by one, they were ordered by Steve to help push John into the hole. The first one refused, and then was threatened he would be fired if he didn't help. He then helped and entangled johns legs while Steve tried to push him in the hole, the last one came in and was told to help throw John in the whole, he immediately started punching John and helping the other two push John into the whole. John the grabbed Steve and said if I go in, you go with me. Steve then pulled out a knife and put it next to John's ribs, and told him he would cut him open if he didn't let go. Everybody stopped after this. John and Steve drove together to pick up Chael to go and eat. Neither were mad at each other except Steve thought he was the victim, reasoning that John got what he wanted, he didn't go in the hole. Steve said he didn't get what he wanted, to throw John in the hole.  What the actual fuck is this? John is obviously mind controlled and the other two friends are part of that underworld. And yeah, the pedo symbol.

            Trap door in stuntman's room in Hollywood studio, leading into a dark pit, with 3 employees trying to throw a 4th into the hole without explanation, and none of them have any problems with each other, still deal with each other. No explanation given why it was important to throw the victim in the hole, the victim still deals with the others and never called the authorities. That's it folks, these people are messed up freaks.

              It might be completely fabricated and have esoteric meaning. But we know that possibility, we are trying to take it as a true story, and figure if it might mean what we think it does.

               Let’s wait and see what else comes up. If this is important, we’ll know when there’s more context. For now, it just seems like an odd puzzle piece that doesn’t quite fit anywhere.

            I listened to him talk about on his podcast and I couldn't understand why he was so disturbed and it felt like he was leaving something important out of the story.  That being said how does trying to wrassle a great big wrassler into a hole fit into PG?

             Hollywood studio, trap door n floor, bizzarre attempt to throw a worker into the pit, pedo symbol on one of their wife's company logo. Well, regarding Hollywood being part of the SRA abuse, tunnels, attempted murder and 2 culprits mindlessly helping the instigator. This looks like some behind the scenes madness from the industry that has a big hand in child trafficking and murder.

              Haha it would be a lot more clear if they were trying to tie a red scarf around his neck "for goofs".  The intended target of a 200lb+ pro wrestler/stuntman doesn't seem to be of interest to pedos

             Tunnel/hole on a movie set got my attention...but when I looked at Jared's wife's company logo, that is definitely PG related.  This just came out also, kinda curious where this is going.
             <br/>
             Also, Chael seemed pretty disturbed and it surprised me that he used the people's real first name.  Several of the comments also mention Pizzagate, which was pretty cool.

            That is a disturbing story.  I see the movies he has worked on include Indiana Jones, this movie seem to pop up all the time.  Needs even more checking?
