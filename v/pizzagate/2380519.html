<p>Blind Item #14 - <strong>Mr. Hedge</strong></p>
<p>This off-Broadway magic show just announced another extension to it\'s successful theatrical run.  The show originally launched about a year ago, at a theater named for, and controlled by, the mogul you all know about.  The show is produced by a beloved gay A-list mostly television actor  / former child star, who dabbles in magic.</p>
<p>Since the show\'s creation, a certain recently revealed serial child molester\'s company has been listed in the credits, also as having produced the show.  The company was included in the press release announcing its extended theatrical run.  Hours later, that company was mysteriously scrubbed from the very same news article.  It\'s obvious the show\'s owners are trying to cover up the likely continued involvement of the serial child molester\'s company in the show.  After all, his company is heavily involved with the design of the sets, sound, and visuals. </p>
<p>When this serial child molester was first revealed a couple months ago, his company allegedly claimed he was &quot;taking a leave of absence&quot;.  The amount of time was unspecified.  The total lack of specifics indicates the whole thing was a very likely thinly-veiled PR sham.  The serial child molester\'s company was hoping they could continue to function with clients and on projects, despite being controlled by this despicable human being. </p>
<p>It is also strange that this otherwise reputable and beloved A-list mostly television actor / former child star is doing business with these vile and disgusting people.</p>

<p>“In &amp; Of Itself,” the Frank Oz-directed magic show that played L.A.’s Geffen Playhouse last year, will get an Off Broadway run this spring from a varied team of producers that includes Neil Patrick Harris.</p>
<p>The hybrid show, which fuses magic with storytelling, is created by Derek DelGaudio, the magician whose “Nothing to Hide” (seen in New York in 2013) was directed by Harris. Joining Harris and his Prediction Productions on the project are Werner Entertainment led by Tom Werner, the prolific TV producer (“Roseanne,” “The Cosby Show,” “Survivor’s Remorse”) who is also the chairman of the Boston Red Sox, as well as Gary Goddard Entertainment (Broadway’s “The Encounter”).</p>
<p>I would say this is a rather interesting development, especially considering NPH VERY EARLY START in Hollywood and his quite abrupt coming out. Hmmm.</p>

             Definitely an upvoat srayzie for having the resolve to quantify this for us. This seems to be the first time  I've seen such a clear and defined clue from this "Q", and most surprisingly an aangirfan reference. Quite profound. AangIrfan has spearheaded these revelations for over a decade now, and ALL of it began and was orchestrated from the 'home office', London, The Queen, Royal Family, GCHQ and Tavistock under the head of the Rothschild family AND SELIGMANS WHO INSTITUTED THE GRANDE LODGE OF ISRAEL.

             In one of the most significant , and odd, posts to date, I believe Q is finally indicating a sizeable chunk of the top of the chain. Not super surprising to us since we've been neck deep in these revelations for years now. What this confirms for me is that "Q" is indeed a 4chan or reddit creation or bot designed to redpill the normies. What else could explain such a slow trickle of obscure and vague clues meant to lead some on a rabbit trail, this is for slow absorption for those that haven't been doing this for a while. I'm getting the feeling whoever Q is they are just as close to everything known as we are here, and are trying to build an army with this information. It's nice, it great to see, but the bad guys already have quite a foothold on everything. Interesting clue on the Black Forest, a totally and horrifically typical place for these monsters to conduct these activities. Go figure. That's got to be where the bodies are buried.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think what we are witnessing here is an indication at the direction of the heartbeat of the extortion rings that have existed for the past 70 plus years that had their nexus in the government of the UK and spread from there, as an ORCHESTRATED EFFORT AT CORRUPTING AND TOTALLY TAKING OVER THE WORLDS DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS WITH HOMOSEXUAL AND CHILD SEXUAL EXTORTION TO EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE REBUILDING OF YHWH'S  (BAAL;LUCIFER;ENKI) TEMPLE.

             Edward Heath‘s chief mentor and friend was Madron Seligman (above right), who was descended from a family of German Jewish bankers.

             The

              Seligmans
             </strong>
             are friends of the Rothschilds. Seligman and Heath were friends at Balliol College, Oxford. In the months before the outbreak of World War II,
             <strong>
              Heath and Seligman were on a ‘camping’ holiday in Germany.“In 1937, Edward Heath met Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler at an SS cocktail party
             </strong>
             . Heath became godfather to Seligman’s eldest son,
             <strong>
              Lincoln

             How do you explain that IBM landed in Germany the very month Hitler was elected (March 1933) to help him start using IBM punch cards to catalog the Jews in Germanic territories (in preparation for the takeover which happened in 1948 three years after Hitler passed from the world stage)? How do you explain the numerous public awards to Thomas Watson of IBM with no protest from the New York Times .. even though IBM was headquartered in New York City. (!!!!) This is one of HUNDREDS of examples?” Joseph Goebbels, four step grand children are now worth millions due to an inheritance of the German gun and missile industry which includes BMW. Goebbels was Jewish also and apparently had a capitalist streak in that socialist heart of his. It ail turned out the way it was supposed to. Germany was bombed to the stone age, Rothschild is still printing the money and the big corporates who helped him torch the place are still there, never touched by a bomb. German tax money is still paying for reparations and submarines to Israel, Germans just wake up in the morning and read more Deutsch Welle. which was part of the plan by the way. Evelyn Rothschild is quoted as saying if her sons did not want wars there would not be any. Is it this simple?

             …This sculpture depicts the Left Hand Path and the Right Hand Path of the OPs’ occultic spirituality. As you can see, the Left Hand (which sits on a black base) is pointing over to the open Right Hand (which sits upon a white base). This reflects the OPs’ practice of using the Left Hand (the “dark side,” which brings about destruction and chaos) to scare people into the open, welcoming Right Hand (the “light side,” which brings about construction and order).
            </p>
            <p>
             If you look upon the world situation now, you can see that the Anglo-American branch of the OPs are acting as the Left Hand (bringing terror, war, and theft that is destroying the existing world order and scaring humanity towards something new), and the BRICS branch of the OPs are acting as the Right Hand (“opposing” the actions of the Anglo-American axis and welcoming humanity into a “peaceful, fair” new world order that they are constructing). Once you understand this basic idea of how the Two Hands work together to control the world, everything you see around you starts making sense.

               yes. Well, he does gloss over quite a few prominent key points, intentionally. See, this is ah MI6 production. It's propaganda. Good propaganda, but nonetheless propaganda.  The  first key moment the narrator vears off direction is when he starts blaming American corporations for covertly funding the war effort like IBM. Ford and Rockefellers Standard Oil, he glosses over British involvement and the occult connections that endured between them and the Germans, especially within he secret services. He glosses over Hitler Israeli pogroms and jewish diaspora to Israel and alas Israels role in the entire panopticon. I can't believe someone with that amount of knowledge would not be able to see clearly that all 3 world wars are designed as an homage and sacrifice to their god Baal. It's not about IF war needs to happen for the ability of the 4th Temple to be built to Lucifer, it's when , how soon, and how many bodies can you stack up. His movie is about how Alex Jones turned out, telling 80% of the real story and omitting the biggest reason why and the top of the pyramid.

               Except for those key point above it is the very first movie of it's kind where it's just totally accurate the whole way through with most of the conspiracies we've known about for a long time but confirmed on video. It's like the Howard Zinn of conspiracy movies, just a slant bit commercial.

The fanjuls r members of a Club roght next to trumps mar a lago called Palm Beach Bath and tennis club. this club is the epicenter of old money and are Trumps nemesis' as they denied him membership and thus legitimacy in Palm Beach society. Andres fanjuls daughter married the step son of the mayor. Her husband may pr may not b the boss of cosa nostra on the east coast, depending who u ask. Fanjuls own caso de campo in Dominican republic. it was there that senator menedez waa honey potted and subsequently black mailed. much worse happens there as the resory is a law unto itself. Think customs can tell the difference between cocaine and sugar on palletes in containers?? doubt it. we always joked about their name meaning go fuck yourself ( in the ass). its an ode to sodomy, which is satans sex.. the family is jesuit black nobilty. Pepe has a signed photo og Pope benedict on his desk at their ranch in yhe everglades that he flies to im his huey from Pbi airport. dig into the palm beach bath and tennis club. that is the real swamp.. brook shiels mom is a member.. we all know how early she got put into the game. Duponts, morgans, flaglers, vanderbilts.. Google House of Munn. that will show u the nexus of The establishment. Founders of planned parenthood... u will have a field day digging.. God Speed...

I actually think that Executive order on dec..21st will eventually target them. Look up the conflict trump had with town of Palm beach over his American flag being against code.. he called their bluff. its in the record that the american aristocracy was against a man who wanted to be extra patriotic.. so much for lotalty to the country that made them rich. It was a brilliant troll by Trump and a precursor to the Maga movement he is ushering now.

               Florida’s sugar crop

              , and last year they made contributions to 31 political candidates, giving more than any other sugar power. They deeply resent their nickname: the first family of corporate welfare. Little known to the American public, Pepe and Alfy Fanjul operate within the hidden world of implicit linkage, the grand club of the country’s power brokers, who routinely trade favors like baseball cards."
             </p>
             <p>
              These guys cover their bets by making campaign donations to both parties: Alfonso Fanjul donates heavily to the Democrats (and has made huge contributions to the Clinton Foundation,) and he even managed Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in the state of Florida in 1992. Another brother, Pepe Fanjul. donates heavily to the Republicans and has worked on their campaigns.

            Egan’s lawsuit described an incident when "Collins-Rector allegedly passed Egan to Singer in the hot tub, where Egan 'was made to sit on' Singer’s lap...
           </p>
           <p>
            "When Egan resisted, the complaint reads, Singer forced Egan’s 'head underwater to make [Egan] perform oral sex upon him.
           </p>
           <p>
            "When [Egan] pulled his head out of the water in order to breathe, [Singer] demanded that he continue, which [Egan] refused.
           </p>
           <p>
            "[Singer] then forced [Egan] to continue performing oral sex upon him outside of the pool, and subsequently forcibly sodomized' him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eventually Michael Egan's mother was informed by friends what was going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            She found the boys a lawyer, Daniel Cherin.

           <p>
            The boys collected evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Egan says: "So we went back and copied everything in the file cabinet. We had photos of the drug bags and child pornography in different cabinets, and video of the gun closet they locked me in."
           </p>
           <p>
            A suit was filed against certain DEN executives: Collins-Rector, and Collins-Rector's colleagues Chad Shackley, and Brock Pierce.
           </p>
           <p>
            The defendants fled the country without contesting the suit.

           <p>
            The court awarded Egan and his fellow plaintiffs a $4.5 million default judgment, of which Egan says he collected just $25,000.

            and it looks like they have done a bit of legal rambling. A pretty sneaky trick they have going on here. Basically what Enty is saying is that when Michael Egan filed his lawsuits against Bryan Singer, Singer and his legal team devised a way to humiliate egan, settle his court case out of court, and PULL IN MORE LAWSUITS THAT COULD BE SETTLE IN PRIVATE.

            Blind Item #8 - Mr. Hedge -
            <strong>
             The Lawsuit That Kept The Secrets Hidden
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            You all remember a couple years ago, when that former child actor filed lawsuits against the now-disgraced A-list director, and 3 of his friends.  He was part of that film that you all know about, which was released for free online a few months ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those lawsuits ended with a public apology to at least 2 of the accused, and allegedly paying a low 7 figure settlement to them.  There was never even a fight before the lawsuits were dismissed. One day they were there with a huge public splash, and seemingly the next, they were gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you don’t know was the real plan behind this, and how well it all actually worked for the parties who orchestrated the whole thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The former child actor was not lying.  He believed what he told the public.  His accusations look much more credible these days, given what we now know about the disgraced A-list director, and his recently exposed serial child molesting friend.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously, it would be very difficult to prove in court exactly who raped him 15 years earlier, given that he was being force-fed drugs and alcohol to the point of being barely conscious, if at all.  The former child actor had previously taken his case to others, who turned the case down for those very reasons.  Despite the case being very thin, the publicity surrounding the announcement was huge.
           </p>
           <p>
            The motivation for such a public announcement was the expectation of more recent underage sex victims, with more solid evidence of their rapes by these people - to notice the huge amount of press, and get legal representation.
           </p>
           <p>
            This succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams.  At least 4 victims came forward.  The public is not aware of this yet, but there is incontrovertible proof.
           </p>
           <p>
            The private settlements are rumored to have totaled over $10 million dollars combined.  The A-list director and his legal team were quite happy, because it resulted in these even more disturbing accusations being settled privately, and never seeing the light of day.
           </p>
           <p>
            That lawsuit which you all heard about just a couple months ago, against the same A-list director, accusing him of underage rape - it’s the same game being played again.  The one alleged to have taken place on a boat in the Pacific Northwest.  Just a thin, old lawsuit with no witnesses, designed as public bait - in hopes of luring in more recent big money victims, with much more proof.  This time, there was no press conference, just leaked news of the lawsuit instead. So, thankfully, this victim will not have to be publicly embarrassed if the case doesn't move forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            The former child actor was offered a mere $100k by the A-list director to keep his mouth shut forever, but turned it down.  There is also incontrovertible proof of this.

             Thnks for the ping.  I had just read this Blind right before your call.  This is another Flim Flam Op by Singer and Friends.  It seems no matter how many Blinds Enty puts out the really big ones with big names never gain traction on MSM.  Others like Spacey were mentioned, but now Singer seems to have been given a slap on the wrist by the Media.  Very disturbing indeed.  And btw, where is Spacey hiding?

               Naw, you've earned a place here and are respected I believe. I think you're a decent mod that actually got involved, not like that other one. Pretty sure I was dv'd by the jew hating Toothless Get Ruthless crew.  You know, those ones that are too stupid to see that a parasitic luciferian cult has attached itself to the judaic religion even before it's full inception and have used them as sacrifices, symbolic and real, for thousands of years.

            The hybrid show, which fuses magic with storytelling, is created by Derek DelGaudio, the magician whose “Nothing to Hide” (seen in New York in 2013) was directed by Harris.

             Something is telling me NPH is COMBINING the 'fun' and energy of magic with his very pro gay stance and is using the title "Nothing To Hide" as a double entendre - as in you don't need to hide your homosexuality anymore, which should be true but in this sense it is being used as a trigger, therefore more magic therefore manipulation. Also kind of sick when you think that  those primarily interested in magic are young boys.

             Do you remember the kind of Secret Society that is a Magick Club in LA area The Magician that was found hanging in a closet in his underwear and then his step-daughter died up on a roof just days apart?  Somehow I believe NPH may be a member there.  The place requires Secret Password and has a EWS Movie similarity.  This immediately jumped into my head.

                 Ooh, and yes, I forgot.  The death of Daryl Easton is very suspicious to me.  I remember that members of the police did not agree with the findings of his death.  They tried to hide that he was found in his underwear at first, if I remember correctly.  Also his stepdaughter died around the same time falling off a roof nearby.  We can only imagine what went on in that place when the Normies were not around.

                  Strange how people end up committing suicide in the strangest of circumstances. They would always threaten me with 'we don't want you to do something crazy like kill yourself.'

                 <p>
                  They always have strongmen around to intimidate, and it would be made known to you in no uncertain terms what would happen to you if you stepped out of line.

                   Thanks so much for that information.  It is nice to get a back story about these performers and their lives and their contact with others.  Yeah, like kill yourself.  Like don't break your neck.  Hint. Hint.

                 Yes, I know he was President.  Also their are others that are very questionable.  David Copperfield was just accused for sexual assault and Roy and Ziegfried have a checkered background as well.  Somehow I see them being friends with Elton John and hubby but I have not looked into it.  They just seem like 4 peas in a pod.  Circus Performers.

                  Yeah, Siegfried and Roy were very good friends with Michael Jackson as well. He even wrote a song for their Vegas show called, "Mind is the Magic."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Their tiger act / magician show was at The Mirage, at the time owned by Steve Wynn.

                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   During a recent hour-long interview at their Jungle Palace home near Vegas Drive to discuss the 20th anniversary of The Mirage, the now retired pair said Jackson, who died in June, was a good friend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In 1989, when the illusionists were preparing their Mirage performances that ran for 13 years, Jackson loved to watch the rehearsals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Siegfried asked Jackson if he would come up with a theme song to be used for the show.
“As I was talking to him, I noticed he was tapping out a tune with his fingers,” Siegfried said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Jackson often attended their shows at The Mirage. Siegfried would introduce him to the audience.

                Nice. Yeah, things are coming back about this. Did voat pizzagate discuss this? Seems so familiar. Wasn't it auto erotic asphyxiation? Just like carradine, which can be made to look like suicide, appropriately embarrassingly so...

                 I'm more convinced now that autoerotic asphixiation is a twisted means to murder and stigmatize victims. I encourage everyone to ask their friends if they're into it. So far I find nothing to collaborate the practice but obvious mockingbird sources. Always be thinking.

                <p>
                 And to the jerk who might wish to enlighten me with more than a pinch of ridicule, can you guess how I might interpret that?

                    As we have all said, wish there were 10 of each one of us on here to delve into everything we suspect.  This was on my list since the murder of Daryl Easton.  His step daughter also was a very suspicious death a few days either before or after his death.  One of these days.

                     yes yes. Just have to try figure out how to tie it all to PGate. Does that Magic Castle place in LA have secret tunnels connecting it to the Getty Center, lol

                      Very representative of Eyes Wide Shut.  Secret Password as well.  The Symbol at the top of their page, as I mentioned in comments, is an Owl.  Cary Grant had a few beards in his life.  It was rumored he was Bi but may have been gay and played it like Rock Hudson.  A lot of the members are questionable.  The way the Magician was murdered and left there in the closet is very telling.  The police did not agree with the outcome of the decision of death.  I had said that Easton's step daughter also died, but it was Jonathan Pendragon who also is a member.  The magician remarried West McDonough -- whose family owns the Magic Castle in Hollywood -- the same year. Jacosa is her daughter.

                  I don't know why but I have a strong feeling PNH  may be a member at the Magic Castle, since he has such a fond interest in Magic, possibly also Magick.  I would think since this was the Master Magician that he would have known him.

             They do it right in front of your face, like Elton John. They act too squeeky clean and a model for gay adoption. I would like it to be true but the path that NPH took through Hollywood I highly doubt it. He was prolly turned out by Geffen personally back in the day anyway. If he was turned out that young chances are he fosters proclivities like that as well. Let's hope not.

                Yes!  Why do you think he is stopping to do concerts. He has a place in Atlanta One of the Top Sex Trafficking Hubs in the US. But he will be Lying low.  Hiding in that Fortress in England.  Also Ozzie Osbourne is also Calling It Quits.  Makes one go Himmmmmmm.

             Neal Patrick Harris is a regular at the Magic Castle in Hollywood and previously served as the President of the Board of Director.

             One can join its membership club called The Academy of Magical Arts, and they hold Houdini Séances. Also has shows for kids. Only accessible through membership or invitation only. No pictures allowed...
            </p>
            <p>
             My personal knowledge is that they used the Magic Castle to recruit kids for child porn. They also have held private rape parties and ritual abuse parties there. They know kids are attracted to magic and exploit it to the extreme. Don't know if it still happens, but it wouldn't surprise me.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The lobby of the Castle has no visible doors to the interior, and visitors must say a secret phrase to a sculpture of an owl to gain access, exposing the entrance to the club.
