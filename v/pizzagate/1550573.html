<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>
<p>And within less than 24 hours Richard DuBeshter has JUST REMOVED the PEDO coded message on his Trolley FB Page: </p>

<p>Richard DuBeshter is the Commissioner of the Trolley Park in front of the Pegasus building which I\'m 99.99% sure houses a Kill Room or &quot;THE&quot; Kill Room... Anyways there are strange connections between Richard and JA such as the fact Richard is gay and into the same strange art as JA. I\'m not going to explain everything, <a href="https://voat.co/user/followdamoney">@followdamoney</a> already did an excellent job of this here:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1545472">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1545472</a></p>
<p>At any rate, Richard also runs the Facebook page here:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/DlVZb">https://archive.is/DlVZb</a></p>
<p>I was scanning the page and there are some REALLY strange irregularities such as the fact he invests SO much time, energy, and effort into the park. He posts on the FB multiple times a month and holds big events catered ALWAYS to children and has a fucking UNICEF poster at one of the events.... WTF?!?! This is a local park in a relatively obscure neighborhood and yet there is an International group related to this?</p>
<p><strong>HERE is where I need your help.</strong> </p>
<p>To anyone that has cryptography and lingual forensic skills. This image posted by Richard on the Trolley Park FB page has Pedo references with a little heart next to a big heart then the infamous Comet Ping Pong and Satanist Crescent Moon with Star, then a box (I\'ve seen this box before on other JimmyCommet associated insta users), then a blue arrow and finally what looks to be an Iphone (perhaps signalling using venmo or Applepay, or to the person of interest) </p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>After yesterday we had tons of people flood this thread and comment which I am thankful for, 355 and counting to be exact. Everyone chimed in and did their investigative work so I thank you for helping especially those I personally called upon. Here is a quick guide to everyone\'s analysis and interpretation which vary but are pretty much in the same realm of conclusions (either it being child porn or a child being transported/transferred from a handler to a client or location; I\'ll state the current theories and then weigh in)... But the people of extreme interest in no particular order are below (list not exhaustive):</p>
<p><em>This goes without saying... none of these people are guilty, my thread and my ideas are all speculations and people like Wylita could be 100% innocent, so please be careful as to the accusations that may be weighed here from time to time.</em></p>

<p>Also consider what it <em>is</em> that an overseas US Consulate does.... 99% of their &quot;every day&quot; work dealing with foreigners is granting or denying Visas to the US. Not saying she is involved with human trafficking at all or even if her position as an information officer allows her access to granting visas but this can\'t be overlooked as we know JA and JP reference tons of art and pictures depicting human torture and human organ harvesting from China as well as the countless panda emoticons and instagram pictures they and their social circle have an obsession over. </p>

<p>RD is also an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner.

<p>The Friends of the 11th and Monroe Park group meets every 2nd Saturday of the month at 11:00 a.m. in the park. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/TrolleyPark/about/?ref=page_internal">Link</a></p>

<h2><strong>Places of Interest in Proximity to Trolley Park</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Pegasus</strong> (for obvious reasons) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The construction and ownership of JA in connection to Pegasus and Richard DuBeshter becoming an ANC commissioner of Columbia Heights neighborhood with multiple properties in full view of the Trolley park across from Pegasus which also has a perfect view with its updated construction of the park.</p>
<p>This place is also suspected of housing a kill room as the kill room photo was posted around a time that construction was finished at Pegasus. </p>
<p>There also are tons of images posted by JA on insta about underground construction work done at Pegasus </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Room 11 DC</strong> (hipster bar)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Room11dc is an insta user that asked about doing a popup in Pegasus on the photo posted by JA with the hold - <a href="https://archive.is/LAWVh">Link</a></p>
<p>Owns a couple other properties in the neighborhood including Bad Saint - <a href="https://archive.is/LAWVh">Link</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Coupe</strong> (restaurant, used to be 24 hours, known for unisex bathrooms and rated #1 to have sex in)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The manager of the restaurant &quot;The Coupe&quot; (which is just across the street from the playground) said &quot;I agree. We have amazing bathrooms to bang in, for sure. They\'re floor-to-ceiling, individual stall unisex bathrooms in a neighborhood where there\'s more people who would do that.&quot; - <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/food/blog/20678269/whats-the-best-restaurant-bathroom-to-bang-in">Link</a></p>

            What you are coming up with for decoding makes no sense. There is no such thing as a "child's name". Names are just names. Children become adults. Maybe aasaq refers to a child, maybe it refers to an adult, or maybe it refers to something else such as summer the season. Also, "Z" means from, with, of, in, out of, for, at, by, off, through, down, about, along, and or in the way of in some languages according to Google Translate. German is one of them, but it's having a tough time detecting the language. GE is not the typical abbreviation for Germany, as Germany is abbreviated as DE normally. GE is the country code for Georgia. Maybe GEw could stand for Georgia West or something. Also, Ge can be a name so maybe the w is just fat fingers, as it is next to the e on the keyboard.

            Except for the fact that they are Satanists... You've got to more research on how the Catholic church, vatican, and Freemasons are deeply interconnected. Research the P2 lodge and how it created a complete shadow government in Italy and was closely intertwined with the Vatican.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also research 9th Circle of Satanists. The Jesuits are also a mirror of Freemason organization. You've got to look more deeply into this as it's key to understanding how the top of the pyramid of Catholics are indeed Satanists and deeply believe in a 1 world government and their relationships with Freemasons.... The Catholic priests are the ones committing Satanic Ritual Abuse for the same reason as JP and Alefantis.... you are really behind if you haven't discovered this yet. There are several victim testimonies that have come out decades before Pizzagate broke out that are the EXACT identical replica of Pizzagate.... Did you not watch the Franklin Scandal??!?! This was one of the most deeply respected CATHOLIC ORGS THAT SET IT ALL UP.... Open your eyes man smh

            Still thinking about the code and three questions remain unanswered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fist: What s it with the with the "watching the Olympic Games"-tag? The post was made on the last day of the Olympic Games but I think it could be some prefix to the code. Why else would the tag be included? As far as I looked there where no other tags on the trolleysite.So maybe it means ether something is ending, it's something urgent or important or it's something international.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second: What's with the color coding in the picture of Wylita Bell? It's not a new picture (it was already one year old as it was posted on the trolleysite so it is definitely a code) and the background colors behind Bell seem like they could mean something. So I'd conclude it's a photo of a woman of color and a colorful background. But maybe the colorful background is a message (maybe it just means look at the color coding in the message? or just: wcqn means "woman with color"-Association)
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly: What's with the other messages on the site? Could they be related? Posts like: " aND sUPPORT", "tHANKS TO yAVONNE AND dAVID bOYD THE eASTER eGG HUNT WAS A SMASHING SUCESS. lOTS OF KUDOS TOTHEM FORE FUNDING AND MAKING THE EVENT HAPPEN. LETS sUPPORT OR LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH$$ TO HELP PROPPELL THESE EVENTS" and "tiogethet " seem more than suspicious.

             I have these same questions as well.... it's well known that the Olympic rings and games are very occultic and that the opening ceremonies are often very satanic so there are a lot of coded layer messages there.

             If you take the letters with lower case from the second sentence, you get "t y d b e e l s". Could mean "thank you, D. Beels"?

              Was there a D. Beels in the research? Another guess: In German "debil" means retarded so I'd translate it to "thank you idiots" , but maybe that's a bit far fetched since he is Norwegian and not German, but on the other hand the word is deprived from Latin and there is a Swedish word meaning the same too:

               There is a Jessica Beels - a designer (could account for the D) - in Washington D.C., but I didn't have the time to do a research on her or on other Beels. I guess we are both stretching it a bit :-) Am aware of the German word "debil", though.

Pakistan where UNICEF had CIA in their vaccine teams and where 10,000 children died, also has a serious problem with child trafficking.

            So, he was watching the Olympic Games, maybe "wcqn" is a refference to that, like it was said: World Cup Qualifier. Don't know about the "N" though.
           </p>
           <p>
            GEw - Maybe "GE" is some kind of government role, like General E-something. "w" could mean "Wyllita" which is the name of the woman in the photo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Z = could be the initial of an employee of his, the person who will send the CP.
           </p>
           <p>
            The emoticons could be the description of the activities done in the photos, so the employee would know which photos of Summer he had to sent. Maybe the crescent is some kind of satanic/muslim ritual? Don't know.

            You've got to watch some videos by Chuck Missler to see where I'm coming from.... He connects all occultism to Satanism in a very logical manner. Did you know the Jewish Talmud followed by Kabbalists allows for the raping of little children? I doubt it. Who is the satanist now? Kabbalists are Satanists

            This makes the Tikkun (Jewish rabbi) that emails John Podesta on a weekly frequency all the more bizarre b/c that particular guy reads and believes in the Talmud that allows for the raping of girls (morally).

            Very good observation. I am more inclined to think that this was the subject or clearinghouse. Maybe they direct people to his instagram, and they use these weird instagrams to communicate.

            I know. So many coincidences I thought, especially given the context and the trouble understanding that weird 4-character  mix. I think the instagram account may be relevant. What 14 year old has 591 followers and follows 621? Seem to be high numbers. It may be unrelated, but I think it might be connected actually.

            The wcqn is definitely the quilt lady; 
GEw I'm going with China; 
I don't think the aasaq is a girl named Summer, no. I don't think anyone's got it yet; 
I also don't think it means sending the girl over, I say this because of the two icons-the compressor and the downloading phone. I believe it's about sending/downloading some kind of disgusting porn. The little heart is a little girl, the green heart means porn, the moon star is occult, next the compression device (compression of files), downloading to a phone. And Z is likely the person from the quilting network. I'm thinking the aasaq has something to do with China (China being the GEw). Kudos to all of u for this research.  EDIT: I was just going through some pics from James Alefantis IG and noticed he hashtagged #firstpizza and #juniper on a pic of the baby girl. I noticed some of u were wondering if the aasaq was somehow related to juniper, child from a pedo family. Interesting he used the actual word itself.

            I just have to make sure this is noted so I'm reposting redditsuckz comment to me here.  How could this be a coincidence regarding the meaning of "Z"?

            From the Vice article that we got when we looked at the little grey "compression" symbol, in which the main player Wylita MAKES A STATEMENT "US Consulate Information Officer Wylita Bell told us she didn't have information on the requirements for obtaining legal work visas. While the US Embassy in Beijing publishes an online warning about working without a** Z visa,"
           </p>
           <p>
            Z is the first letter of the coded word.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-chinese-esl-industrial-complex-shady-working-conditions-abound-for-foreign-english-teachers-in-china-127">
             https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-chinese-esl-industrial-complex-shady-working-conditions-abound-for-foreign-english-teachers-in-china-127
            </a>
            Z is a code for a temporary work visa in China, one that the student teachers need to be there legally.  Wylita is based at the Chinese embassy and gave that statement in a Vice article regarding teachers in DISNEY schools in China who work with kids of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            SO WEIRD but Z could easily mean "work visa" or "our agent(working in China)"

            Put the words and meaning together see if it makes sense. This could be important. I think it's an isolated and solo order, but the Z is the delivery man and Richard is the manager. Possible ring detection.

                GEW in simplified gemetria means angel. Actually I used it on the other words and this is what came out of it: "

                  Would anything? Nothing is off the table, you know. Anything is possible at this point. Of course, it could be something else completely, but I had to post the results I got. It's there to be taken into consideration, nothing more. Let's keep digging.

            I just went through the halloween costume pics at the park and not only did they look staged and not actually outdoors but they are all very awkward like random not very attractive extremely happy adults with kids who look like they are in their clutches and not happy to be there.

              There's a panda emoji that means someone is going to drug a child they have for sale.....even a parent. The pandas dark fur around the eyes symbolizes dark circles and baggy eyes from being drugged. I've found kids all over social media with this as their name or in their pic.

                not a stretch at all. They constantly use the same themes. Why is someone from Saudi Arabia posting a panda image? They are not connected to that part of the world.

             Yup I saw the twitter as well but not the insta yet... aasaq seems to be a very popular child's name... If you look at youtube videos, pretty much every one associated with aasaq has a little child named aasaq playing around.

              Pedos use youtube to post the kids they have for sale playing game and whatever else kids do normally. They use code words to find in them in searches. I'm pretty sure the words are also code for something like maybe a password to access CP or order a child of a certain type etc. Summer could be the password to access something.

            Interesting, could be layers of layers of interpretation here.... Such as the occult symbolism but it could also be referencing a location for transportation, etc

             Jeez.... he literally owns every property that surrounds that park... this is getting really creepy. This guy has millions and millions in wealth if he's able to afford owning these properties plus pay property taxes on each of these properties which should run him into nearly $100,000 a year alone on all properties combined.... obviously this isn't a low volume industry he's involved in. If this is what we think it is, they are making a ton on selling children into this pedo ring (or he is being fronted money from a billionaire?).

              He seems to be living with a man named John Richard Henderson. Found another property that was linked to Dubeshter that is in Hendersons name, that also links back to Dubeshter with the address 1102 Monroe Street.

            I'm going to go with it being code for what they have available and that they can also compress video to send to mobile. Maybe they don't just sell kids but also video of people abusing their .....stock.

             Actually, this does stir something in me. I have read and viewed so many stories and documentaries about pedophiles and it amazed me at how many of them became English teachers in poor Asian countries to get close to the children. Thailand, China, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea... Read this article to know more about pedophiles and english lessons:

              It creeps me out that Disney runs English language schools in China - just way too off brand.  I'm always suspicious of Disney.   Have you heard about how Disney parking lot in Florida at least is a drop off/pick up point for child trafficking?  - I learned this here

She said they used color coding to make transactions safer for the traffickers and the clients. ''At Disneyland there would be people doing drop-offs and pickups for kids.

            if we look back at the construction photos, can ball park the approximate date they were taken, then slow down for a minute and think, I bet we will all come to the same conclusion about to whom who's head is in rafters beginning to decompose, and who's corpse is stuffed up into the rafters. Curious as to what everyone thinks.

            "Summer" has several connections here.  There's this OP usage, and the "Summer Camp" thing, and something else which escapes me ATM.  Somebody with a good searchable PG database should search for "summer" and see what all comes up, then cross reference those items.

            Another take on the emoji meanings:
           </p>
           <p>
            1)	beating heart = Alive? Good health? Vibrating? Exciting?
           </p>
           <p>
            2)	Green heart = to like something or someone without making it seem too serious; when thanking someone you’re not that close.
           </p>
           <p>
            3)	star and crescent = Islamic and also possible satanic symbol
           </p>
           <p>
            4)	compression = a zip file of photos or videos
           </p>
           <p>
            5)	Mobile Phone With Rightwards Arrow = send message to phone to get the file
           </p>
           <p>
            Possible translation: An exciting child for those who like them and who are into satanic things; preview available through zip-file via cell phone.

             Good interpretation.I take the little heart next to the big heart to simply be a pedo reference for pedo lovers. There simply isn't an emoticon for a little heart inside a larger heart which is the symbolism of an adult heart around a child's heart, so imo he chose the next best option which were these 2 emoticons. Your other interpretations seem pretty spot on to me. Good job :)

             Yes, I think there is.... My suspicion is that Richard DuBeshter and Lou Vivas are boyfriends and that's why Richard constantly gives shout outs to Vivas real estate.... who is also probably his real estate agent as well for the properties he owns and in on the whole parade.... they constantly put UNICEF references in the park activities to make it seem like they are all for protecting children to give them a cover for those who accuse them of doing sadistic things, then the mindless masses come out and say "but look they have UNICEF at their events and post videos to crack sexual offenders"... It's good to note nonetheless.

            It's possible DuBeshter is advertising for Wylita Bell as trafficker using her Chinese Shanghai connections. Maybe he's saying to interested persons "here's our new China connection." Maybe the code is used for shipping on the infoseaair.com website shown below.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found this on the web:

            ]
           </p>
           <p>
            How the hell is Bell using her government connections to run a shipping line out of Shanghai? Or am I reading the purpose of this website wrong?
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also this about the push to make it easier for Chinese to immigrate to US with an employment visa/work permit.

             Infoseair is an information house only. They compile data about business, shipping etc which you can buy as business intelligence to find out who competitors are etc.

             their listing of her is only because she had a shipment from a moving company in China.  It looks like a single shipment of personal stuff not repeated business.

             Is she a diplomat? If she used this to ferry her own furniture (for relocation) then it's no big deal. But if she uses it a lot and it is diplomatic protected, then it's a really big lead.

             Very interesting position. The photo definitely has some significance... Another user found the "gematria value" of GEw actually means "China"... so there is some significant connection to China since WB works there.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the website... if that is what I think it is, this is a significant find. It's highly odd if this is true considering she is not really any position of importance at the US Consulate notwithstanding the massive corruption this would entail if a US Government official were involved with port activities in China.... although this could be simply just her belongings she had shipped to China when she moved there for her new job?

             Yes, aasaq means summer.... so it would mean summer juniper beer... but in this context, Summer is being used as a female child's name just as an American would name a child June or April.

            Or potential victims that they want to abduct.... it's very peculiar he takes pictures of every single child there and makes sure that he gets plenty of photos at every single event.... this park isn't a huge revenue driver at all... there is no reason to put soooo much effort into this unless it's for something more nefarious.

              Nice! None of them are mutual friends though. I suspect some of them are using fake identities. Especially if they're involved in illegal stuff.

             Good work! The thing is, why would he post this publicly when he could have simply sent this friend of his a private message? I think Z means something else, maybe is the codeword for "you all / everyone who is interested"?

              The Z could be said TO everybody, but not explicitly being codeword for 'you all'. Meaning Z could be a verb or an action, if you like, that is addressing all, or everybody out there involved or in the know. Check the comment thread under here from 'Were-All-Geni-Uses' and the possible meaning for the letter Z in hebrew language.

            Just a little bit of supporting information regarding the area. The manager of the restaurant "The Coupe" (which is just across the street from the playground) said  "I agree. We have amazing bathrooms to bang in, for sure. They're floor-to-ceiling, individual stall unisex bathrooms
            <strong>
             in a neighborhood where there's more people who would do that
            </strong>
            ."

             And bizarrely enough.... it's 24 hours, perfect for people who want to operate in the cover of darkness when everyone is sleeping in the wee hours of the morning. Really good find Yuke.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: It used to be 24 hours and it appears it's open really late still.

            Ya, I edited out some of the UNICEF stuff, it took attention away from the main focus as well. And yea, the message is clear imo, a girl was definitely transferred from someone to another party or group either physically or a video of her and she was or is likely sanctioned to be sacrificed as witnessed by the crescent moon and star occultic symbolism.... sort of like their seal of approval. Whatever the meaning, it was important enough for Richard to make a single post about it and having a picture of Wylita Bell (a US Consular employee in Shanghai) in the post is just highly peculiar, they aren't even friends on Facebook.... so it makes no sense that he'd post her image unless she is connected somehow for the transfer.

            The pink hearts are associated with girl lover, but a red heart can mean... almost anything. Love, the sacred heart of Jesus, English heralrdy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't figure out the green heart. There is a Green Heart organization, but I can't make any connection. I doubt it's them:

            I assume the letters are in some kind of code, so we would need a key to decrypt it.

             I'm 99.99% positive I decoded aasaq. The others I can only allude to the fact that Z is probably shorthand for someone's name and GE is shorthand again... not sure though, but I'm convinced aasaq is inuit for "Summer" a female child. (See my update).

             The little heart next to a big heart is very similar to a little heart inside a big heart which no emoticon exists for, so I'm going to assume that's what he's referring to here. The Crescent moon with the star is very significant satanism and occultic meaning, the crescent moon is often seen with the star of ishtar as well, but this is a 5 pointed star. At any rate, it's an obvious stamp of approval for a sacrifice or sanctioning of one imo.... the phone is obvious and the word "now" after it obviously means "asap" so no need for aasaq to mean asap as some are alluding to as there isn't a need to repeat the same word twice in a message.

            What if Pegasus House - "the kill room" - is their temple?  Is it significantly located located at any of the supposed Illuminati intersections/points of significance?  Maybe that is why the "overreaction" by JA.  This is all a religious cult.  There are leaders, elders, and people fulfilling all positions. JA being a restaurant/land/renovation/property/get dirty-type-of guy.  Maybe he is Schneider (One Day at a Time), the building engineer, so to say.

             ... can you look into this for me? Can you see if that post on August 21st coincided with a Satanic holiday on their calendar ? Can you check to see if this is satanic/freemason geographic location from those overhead DC google earth shots some people post as well?

             This would be a big help. I've been trying to connect JA to freemasonry forever but haven't been able to do so yet. I know there is a freemason temple near his Pegasus building on 1733 16th street NW, less than 2 miles away.

            I do respect your work here! I only disagree with aasaq being a child's name (although I cannot be sure and you may well be right after all!). The reason is when I look at how he deliberately misspells words, he tends to simply leave out certain letters, mostly vowels, and to screw up words. This is why I think "aasaq" can also mean "asap". The following icons with the word "now" could be a repetition of the message, an enforcement, so to say. Having said this, I think the phrase could translate into something like this: "Z, we can send the girl asap." Anyhow, to finally decrypt this message, I believe it is worthwile to think about the fact that he deletes letters and srews them up (wcqn = we can?).

             I agree with you except for the fact that the odds of him accidentally misspelling a word and "aasaq" being a name that so happens to be a female child's name is like 1 in a 100 million.... I reread all his posts again and he rarely misspells words, it's mostly his terrible grammar that is egregious. And if he does misspell a word, it's usually 1 word in the entire paragraph of 40 words or so.... for him to make so many misspellings in a short sentence like this would be pretty interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm like 95% sure it's a female child's name (but you could be right too).

              All of these properties are in perfect viewing of the park... therefore they can see the merchandise on display. We might want to see if there are missing children in the area over the last 2 years considering he takes pictures of every child that enters his park at all of his events.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm assuming that he probably owns these properties so his pedo friends from Europe and the US can view their merchandise.

               Recently someone posted pictures of people with other people's children connected to Jabbaroo. I suspected that these are caretakers and "Uber service". We would have to see if the pictures match the houses found. Either these homes are investment properties (apartments), or they are homes to house babies and young children conveniently close to the watchtower. You can't pack a house with a dozen kids or else the neighbours will stick CPS on you for operating an illegal daycare. Unless the tunnel lead pans out.

             Thanks srayzie. This helps confirm that Pegasus is likely the kill room location considering the likelihood of such bizarre pedophilia anomalies happening right next door. It's all just way too convenient. Another cog in the wheel that I hope propels to more connections and to the bigger picture.... the photo of Wylita Bell alone on the pedo message has some importance that we need to keep digging into, especially her potential connections circling back to JA.

              Yeah and this Richard guy. I'm also wanting to check out the guy who posted images to google street view with the child's head at the park. He would have had to see the errors, or he possibly did it on purpose. I seen that someone else posted somewhere that several pictures that were posted that night had kids heads. That's just weird

               Lee Watkins... He's a person of interest imo as well. He posted multiple images of children's heads severed. You can find his pics here:

            Checking out Richard DuBeshter right now. Real estate agent. He must be writing on FB himself, because his Twitter account has the same weird language / spelling:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurban?lang=de">
             https://twitter.com/dcurban?lang=de
            </a>
            Will keep you posted should I find anything interesting.

             UPDATE.... I've figured out why this guy is terrible at English grammar and spelling... He is likely from Norway or another scandinavian country. If you look up family origins of DuBeshter, it returns Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark (all Scandinavian countries).

             This is startling considering the recent Norwegian pedophilia case. This fucker needs to be scrutinized as much as possible... We need to figure out when he came to the country which has to likely be pretty recent since his English is fucking awful.

              Sorry, I have to disagree politely, again :-) Why is he able to spell correctly in other instances? These are not spelling mistakes made by mistake, but deliberate ones, don't you agree?

               Yea, I wrote this before I figured that part out haha :)... but I'm still pretty sure aasaq is a child's name for summer, the odds of misspelling a word in English and it happening to have a significant meaning in an extremely obscure language used by probably 100,000 people in the entire world is really astronomical.

                 My initial thought is that they use her codename likely b/c he probably has multiple victims and whoever the bundler is, they need to know which one the buyer wants (my best guess)... And yes, keep up the work!

              A work visa is required for persons wanting to work in China for pay.  It is also issued to aliens who come to China for commercial entertainment performance. It is only granted if you and the employer meet certain requirements.  First, the organisation must be accredited to employ foreigners. You must meet the requirements as a 'foreign expert' and the employer must obtain a certificate stating that you comply.

                Edit 2....it is a "vice"...or "clamp"...so vice.com might be correct or he wants a compressed file sent to his phone.

                 are you talking about the hollow square in place of that weird thing that meant "vice?  even if that isn't there it doesn't matter, there was some kind of substitute which led us to her SPEAKING in an article and the word Vice, and the Z visa.  So way too coincidental.  (If I have misunderstood your question, sorry)
                </p>
                <p>
                 I reposted your find of the Z visa in comments because I think it is too coincidental - has to be something to it.

                  Im just wondering if its an emoji that facebook doesnt recognize...I dont think it should be a "square"...it might be something we are missing that is only viewable through a facebook app or viewable on a certain phone device or something.  Because on Android it shows up as a "Black square box" not hollow.

            My take on images: Trafficked little muslim girls arrived (or available?) - contact me (or possibly someone named Assaq?) now. The letters are more complicated, could mean many things.

            I also entered "tiogethet" from their latest post into Google, and the spelling errors on their FB site may be decoded with or come from or have something to do with OCR. Don't know if this helps at the moment.

             ... I commented on that to another poster as well. I find it highly peculiar that he "purposefully" misspelled words and it looks like an obvious attempt to make the account look as if it is making typos all the time so when he finally uses it to write a coded message the casual observer would just write it off as a typo.

            Well I've tried every which way at decoding the text, mirroring it, flipping it upside down and even sending through a simple enigma-style
            <a href="http://www.richkni.co.uk/php/crypta/caesar.php">
             cipher
            </a>
            , and couldn't find anything. The most annoying thing about it is I know there's something in there, I just haven't been able to find it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The emoji text is a lot clearer though. I know exactly what this sick son of a bitch wants.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             💓 = the closest available equivalent to a heart within a heart*.
            </li>
            <li>
             💚 = Apparently this means 'green heart', but if you look it up on an image search you'll find many different double and even triple heart designs. I also found links to those weird Youtube videos that feature Elsa/Spiderman by searching this character as well.
            </li>
            <li>
             ☪ = Star within a crescent. This is an outright satanic symbol and one we have seen before many times.
            </li>
            <li>
             🗜 = Means "compression". May seem unclear but when used in conjunction with the next symbol...
            </li>
            <li>
             📲 = He is asking for something to be sent to his phone. That something is a zip, a
             <strong>
              compressed
             </strong>
             archive. What is in the archive? Take a wild guess. The fact he's used both a "pink" and "green" heart mean he doesn't discriminate when it comes to his revolting and repugnant desires.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            *As I've been told later on this may not be the case, the use of two separate hearts might actually be a substitute for the heart within a heart rather than representing two different symbols as was initially thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            But that's not all. Looking up that first symbol again, I found
            <strong>
             THIS
            </strong>
            :

               That's a good point and I think you're right... I'm not sure the colors have much to do with it but it is interesting nonetheless... the problem is that emoticons have to have color to them, but it is odd that the heart emoticon would have an option for green and isn't just the logical red or pink color... perhaps there is meaning there or perhaps not... perhaps the meaning is just the pedo lover symbol of two hearts next to each other, one small one and one big one.

             Is it possible that the two heart icons in sequence are meant to be taken as a smaller heart followed by a bigger heart, i.e. that the green color doesn't matter so much as the juxtaposition of small with large?

              This is my original thought as well.... I don't think the color means anything at all... I just think it's a "heart within a heart" reference and that there is no emoticon for such a reference so he used the next best thing which is a small heart next to a big heart, but I implore others to continue finding meanings, it may lead to new leads.

              It's in over 80% of Muslim country flags... it's well documented that the crescent moon and star are a satanic reference.... Not saying that muslims are for Satan, but the symbolism has morphed into pagan and satanist usage over time

                Puppet... interesting, I'm going to have to make a summary of what wcqn could mean, b/c your view is entirely possible and so is the other view that it's the colored women's quilting network that others have suggested.

               If you want your message to be more widely read and not corrected, use OCCULT instead of SATANIC.  To be specific, the star and moon PER SE are not a well known Satanic symbol - these are very old symbols obviously.  However it is true that a star and moon make an appearance in this form together as part of a well-known Baphomet illustration.
              </p>
              <p>
               "This is an outright occult symbol and one we have seen before many times."  is more accurate, but not completely so.
              </p>
              <p>
               Please edit.  I would say it like this -"It is well known that the star and crescent is a symbol of Turkey and islam, but it is also a symbol seen in occult imagery."

                But anyone who knows anything about occultism knows occultism = satanism. To suggest differently imho is to dilute the meaning. I know others have made the word satanic appear hysterical but it's important to link the two and I think one can still approach this thread academically knowing that both are synonyms of each other.

                 Sorry, but that is flat out wrong. The occult relates to esoteric or hidden knowledge, and satanism relates to an adversarial relationship of some kind. There's a lot of misunderstanding of the origins and nature of Satanism within Judaism.

                  This isn't true. You've got to read about the occult. Dr. Chuck Missler has a good series connecting the occult to satanism throughout antiquity. Hitler used the occult very deeply to take over Germany via the Thule Society. Freemasons by their very definition are heavily involved in the occult and are also satanists... I'm not saying that all people who practice occult are satanists but it's a very high correlation... ALL Satanists practice occult but not all occultists practice satanism. My point is that in order to practice and worship satanism you will ALWAYS find the work of occult lurking in the shadows.

                   It is true, it follows logically from the meanings of the words in their original context. Missler, like most Christians, can't reconcile 1Ch 21:1 with 2Sa 24:1. Lower degree Freemasons are not Satanists and many forms of occult practice eg Voodoo, Santa Meurte, Kaballah, Wicca, aren't Satanic.

                    Yes they are satanic... do you even know what santa muerte means? Don't be fooled brother, Saint Death is not a cult you would want to follow and yes Kabbalism, Wiccans, and Voodoo do end up in Satanic realms. Lower level freemasons although pawns as they are will invariably one day enter a level that they are indeed opening some satanic elements just as anyone practicing Santa Muerte "Saint Death" or any occult to a strong degree will one day encounter.

                    And your point about the verses in Chronicles and Samuel don't make sense. There is no controversy there. What are you trying to imply? God uses Satan at times under his authority. God sovereignly permits Satan to act. God can use Satan in various ways, with the result being the refining, disciplining, and purification of disobedient believers such as in

                     No, the point is that Satan is a title, not a proper name. Christians typically don't get this, so you end up with absurdities like the proposition that 1Ch 21:1 and  2Sa 24:1 refer to different beings. These two verses don't refer to "God", this word is typically a translation of Elohim, which is a plural noun and does not refer to the singular being that caused David to number Israel.

                 Conversely, I am hoping that religious aspects of this investigation are kept away from the rest of the discussion. As new people come in to look at this evidence, they could be dissuaded by the large amount of symbolism investigators are willing to make assumptions about or infer. It looks... bad.

                 I respect your work, but here you are going to eventually have to admit you are just wrong.  Your statement above reflects a very strong naivete and lack of understanding of these topics. Satanism is a specific worshiping and adoring of a character created out of Judeo-Christian religious belief.  You can be interested in how to plant a garden with the cycles of the moon and have absolutely nothing to do with the devil, spells, worship, or anything of the like.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What you say on this reflects on everything you say and it could harm otherwise good work. Saying something is occult is accurate, if that dilutes the meaning, then it is accurately diluting the meaning and you have to accept that.  Otherwise you are not only sensationalizing, you are doing so innacurately and leave yourself open for criticism.  WHY DO THAT?  Be accurate.  However for most people saying something is occultic does not dilute the meaning that much.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Pizzagate journalism is not a witch hunt, but by stubbornly continue to throw around Satanism you make it one.  This investigation is not owned by Christians, nor is it owned by any other particular group.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Satanism IS NOT A SYNONYM for occult, but Satanism falls within the occult like many other subjects - its just one of the "diabolical" ones so to speak.

                  You don't understand then.... any occultism is giving reverence and homage to satan whether you admit it or not.... I'm not trying to offend you or your past but Satan is in command of the occult. (obviously you're going to disagree with my spiritual assessment of the situation, but it's obvious anyone divining into dark arts is worshipping satan (perhaps not in name) where they find their power from)

                 <p>
                  The occult falls under this verse in Ephesians:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.

                   Okay, well I've said my piece.   Good luck I think the decoding is an interesting path.  However, since you refuse even intellectually to consider very accepted and accurate distinctions in the subject you are dealing with, that will just have to be taken into account with anything you write.

                    No, that's not what I'm saying either... I'm not saying you're a devil worshipper. What I am saying is that practicing occult activities such as seemingly innocuous things like a ouija board and astrology is opening yourself to potential influences from dark sources (Hitler also used astrology, and any divination is a form of opening yourself to dark sources).... it's not the same as someone with a severed goat's head drinking the blood of an infant while standing in the middle of a burning pentagram..... Just be careful and do due diligence b/c you haven't approached your "sphere of influence" from my worldview yet which is very apparent. And to suggest that I'm somehow incorrect in my assessment b/c you are somehow claiming the "consensus" view which is by no means not true b/c you're likely allowing certain biases influence you to think it's a consensus view (which never means fact anyways) is not really fair to me or characterizing me as such "anything I write has to be taken into account" just b/c you've been offended.

                     said again. Maybe I need to read your comment again but it seemed like your argument was the same as claiming cause all oranges are fruits, so all fruits must be oranges... basically just cause there's some similarities and what not, you seem to be inferring it's almost a gateway to satanism or just straight up the same thing. Also, it seems like you're making a more personal connection to the word when everyone's just trying to say it has a literal definition that'll be easier for people to take seriously. If you want to say satanism that's fine but don't act like it involves every aspect of every occult. And saying that pedos in the Catholic Church are satanists just makes you look extremely bias. I'm sure there's a lot but you're saying it like it's fact that all pedos are. Doubt that's what you meant but that's how it looks. (saw this in other comments)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Edit:  "I'm not saying that all people who practice occult are satanists but it's a very high correlation... ALL Satanists practice occult but not all occultists practice satanism." I see now you don't mean that but again that's how it looks

                      Not offended, and yes, everything you write is through a particularly focused Christian lens, therefore must then be decoded into the wider world in secular terms.  That is what I was in a helpful and friendly way (I'm fine with your beliefs) trying to get you to understand - your message will get across better and to a wider audience if you don't make amateur mistakes based on your personal belief system that do not apply to a wider world.

                      I'm not a child, nor am I an adolescent, nor am I a callow youth.  Your warning are unfortunately a representation of your own fears, nothing to do with me, and also representative of a sort of condescending belief in the superiority of the bible vs other religous and holy books and systems as well as those that predate the bible.  Example:  Being in touch with the phases of the moon is not a gateway drug to blood drinking devil worship.  You are just wrong about that. That leads you to make mistakes about what symbols might mean, their associations throughout history, not just since modern Christian worship, and a whole lot of other things.  Since you are dealing in symbols here, you'd think that would be a welcome alert, but of course not.  Anyway, it was meant to be helpful, if you don't find it so, so be it.

                      There is no reason we can't work together towards the same cause - and I think that Disney connection to schools in China could be big, especially since Wylita works at the Chinese embassy - possible child/organ trafficking link through her, the embassy, that park and Pegasus?  When I see Disney involved in an off-brand pursuit like that, with their history and associations with MK Ultra programming and child trafficking that sends up all kinds of red flags.   And that line of thinking came from that one weird grey symbol.  When you have time you have to read this article - so much info on things we've discussed like child protitute auctions in Mexico and Disney

                      I had a Christian upbringing, but most Christians can't even admit that Christmas is a pagan ritual and the entire religion was invented by Jews to create docile goyim sheep.  Jesus was the story of what happens to people who fight the Jews and the Government.  I love Jesus, because he fought the Jews and the Government.

                       Since the finding and studies of the dead sea scrolls we have been given a lot clearer view of early Christianity.  It would do all Christians a lot of good to study the historical roots of their own religion through the writings of the Essenes and the history of Qumram.   Then look at exactly what was put in the bible and what was excluded at the Diet of Worms, and why.  And a look at the work of Australian Barbara Theiring's "Jesus of the Apocalypse" which summarizes the entire new testament as a series of hidden messages in symbols - fascinating.

                      <p>
                       I agree, the Jesus that we enjoy today is a radical freethinker who deftly fights hypocracy in the government and organized religion.

            -What is an ANC? Washington DC is divided into 40 districts called Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, or ANCs. ANCs are made up of 2-12 commissioners who make decisions about a broad range of issues in your community, such as liquor licenses, parking, and sanitation. This is your most local form of government.

                 ! This would make sense. Z could very possibly mean two things in this theory. Arm or, excuse the language, fuck. As an order.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Either:
                 <strong>
                  Arm
                 </strong>
                 wcqn and send (Summer or juniper/sra victim) now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Or:
                 <strong>
                  Fuck
                 </strong>
                 wcqn, send (Summer or juniper/sra victim) now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What do you think? Are we getting closer?

                   It's not only the women. It's Richard, Wylita Bell, Shanghai, the shipping company (ies), (containers used for the trafficking IF the victims are being moved from or to the US/China/possibly Qatar)... There are missing links. Idk, this is way down the rabbit hole and a bit scary! Someone take over, my blood pressure is up haha.

                Really good find Joe_Hill ... that was my thoughts originally that this child was likely born in an occultic family already and so is either a ritualistic "first born" sacrifice when taken into account with the crescent moon and star stamp of approval..... all the more relevance to them mocking Abraham and Isaac (Sarah's first and only son to be sacrificed but only at the last second wasn't).

              Woah, excellent catch, OP. We'd have to identify who the Z and GEw are to see if there is a possible connection. Z for Zachary? GEw, initials? G.E. Georgetown, Georgia... Try to identify friends of Richard that start with Z or G.E. I don't know, just brainstorming here.

               Thanks YingYang, very good suggestion I'll search the friends list of Richard and Wylita.... potentially James Alefantis as well. Do you have his archived FB friends list by any chance ? I know people have posted it before.

            I can remember that back in elementary school we had a lot of unicef affliated events. It was/is a go to charity for whenever we where taught about charity. We sold postal-stamps for unicef, had to find sponsors to donate money for sporting events, etc.. So the unicef link doesn't seem that far-fetched to me

             tjarco... it does matter. UNICEF nor the UN nor any international organization in the name of charity is really for charity. All of these groups are fronts for raping and stealing children. I don't think I need to go on about it.... Clinton Foundation in Haiti that was there for charity. Jerry Sandusky's Second Mile Foundation where he recruited his rape victims....
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't get me wrong, UNICEF does some good with the right hand, but the left hand is definitely creating evil in the world. That's the whole ploy, the public only sees what the right hand does.

              Well i get you and think the same, I just think the Unicef link isn't the most interesting part about your findings in this post. Besides these are still all suspisciouns untill proven so I'm carefull with making claims like these. I'm not advocating unicef shouldn't be looked into, just saying that with the other info found you present it seems like the least solid link...

            Yea and he is always posting his phone number and email any chance he gets... I just find that highly peculiar. Usually groups and non-profit orgs like this don't hand out their personal info so freely... just really strange behavior.

             That's what I'm leaning towards as well. Z is a person or handler that has the child and the text is asking him to send it to another individual and the symbols obviously mean a Pedo lover as the little heart is next to the big heart and the crescent moon and star means the child is ready for sacrifice or has been sanctioned for satan, etc...

               Are there any missing girls named aasaq (Summer) from Greenland or that region? I'll google and see if I can come up with something.

                Not sure, I haven't found any... Imo it's likely an American girl and her real name is Summer, but he is just using a code word in Inuit language for her name so no one knows what he is talking about, but please do check if you see anything for missing children there.... this is a significant step in decoding the message. Next would be to search if there are any missing girls in the DC area around the time of that post August 2016, with the name of Summer (or likely months before considering these psychos probably hold them for a while)... the other issue is that they are likely rename every child they steal from orphanages or from families or this could be a "first born" child given to them from a satanist occultist family which is often the case, which means there will be no trail of a missing child unfortunately.

            Definitely weird, but you also need to consider that it's highly unlikely that the commissioner is the one responsible for maintaining their social media websites and posting these messages himself. Those tasks are usually given to a lackey, so that could be part of the bad grammar and typos. The message from August 2016 is something worth trying to decode, so I hope someone is able to figure it out!

             But even a lackey wouldn't type in all caps and minimize certain words... it's almost as if many of the posts are coded messages b/c the errors are just too egregious for even a lackey.

              Mostly just a couple.... there are children's heads severed from their bodies in some of the images if you look around.... one is the girl in the pink jacket and the other is a boy. It's bizarre considering the circumstantial evidence in relation to the pedo cult that has art with severed heads of children.... it's obviously done technologically, the heads aren't actually cut off, but some sort of strange tech mishap, but strange that it's only for the children as if the photo user did it deliberately to send a message.

              Yea that was before JA made renovations to just have 1 single large window in the middle of those 2 after he purchased the property. That large single window was made and completed around September 2015. I think this youtube video is the best evidence that a kill room is hosted at Pegasus building:  (they keep deleting this video so watch it quick)

              FYI, further insight into ANCs. Here's a 2010 NBC Washington story, critical of the DC Advisory Neighborhood Commission

              "Is D.C.'s ANC Worth It?"
             </p>
             <p>
              Excerpt: {Blogger Geoffrey Hatchard told We Love D.C. that some commissioners “are professional, want to hear what you have to say, and feel excited to serve. Others see the ANC as their own fiefdom, something they reign over, and their sad little bit of power trip is something they refuse to allow to be diluted by dealing with the commoners.”}
