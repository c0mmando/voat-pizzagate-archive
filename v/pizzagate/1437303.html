            Oh and to add, when attempting to post on reddit, I could not post about what I had found on any board, and my post had nothing to do with pizzagate nor trafficking humans. I was trying to make a post what I found and theories about possible truth to The RNC being hacked, and hackers targeting people that was sexting to leak or help steal data via blackmail.

            I think it is hard to say if it is connected or not since we are still unsure how big Pizzagate really is. If this is a revenge porn site filled with pics of exes that are over 18, sure it may be illegal, but that doesnt involve trafficking humans or pedophilia.

             True. I just think it's that this person working at the Republican National Convention is messed up, looking at some of the pics on there sites they was revenge porn for the most part, its the twitter accounts I found messed up, I don't think they was revenge porn, some of the remarks made in them was as if they was the actor, and a few pic was of them and pornstars. As for the ages It was really not something I can judge some pics made me wonder, partly why I wanted to post this on reddit. Like I said I was unaware of pizzagate untill a couple of hours ago. Reading all about it and seeing some really messed up similarity that I was stumbling on kinda made my hair stand up. If this is nothing connected no biggy, But if by any chance this is related, I wanted to at least say something and let someone who would know how to better dig into it look at it.

              I am pretty new here and was on reddit too; just from what I've seen and read about reddit, that is before the mods and their CEO started banning everything over there, I would say you don't really want to post anything over there.
