<h2>Bill Clinton connections with Friends of the Orphans, the orphanage that child-trafficker Laura Silsby was given children from</h2>
<hr />
<p>According to a blog written by Robin Forestal, a staff member at NPH, Bill Clinton had planned a private visit to Friends of the Orphans, the orphanage that child-trafficker Laura Silsby was given children from, two months prior to the Earthquake. We derived this date by comparing the photo\'s filenames with other documented times (filename P1180312.jpg in relation to P1180452.JPG, which was taken on Thanksgivings). Alongside a photo of Molly Hightower and Erin Kloos of Friends of the Orphans, two volunteers who died from the orphanage\'s collapse during the Earthquake, Forestal wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is Erin and Molly on their way to see Bill Clinton at one of our street schools. This is Erin and Molly afterwards - he didn\'t show up.&quot; <a href="https://i.imgbox.com/VKvAq3zw.png">https://i.imgbox.com/VKvAq3zw.png</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is evidence that Bill Clinton, who is famous for boarding the Lolita Express 26 times, is connected with Friends of the Orphans. No information is available regarding Bill Clinton\'s visit to Haiti between November-December, while his last documented visit was during October. This points to the theory that Bill Clinton has personal connections with someone within Friends of the Orphans. To top it off, it was scheduled a few days prior to Thanksgivings, and a month prior to Laura Silsby\'s initial visit to Haiti. Private matters?</p>

<p>This may explain why there was no investigation done into the orphanage in question, nor any statements made by a representative of the orphanage, and also why Laura Silsby was let off so easily. After all, as a reputable orphanage, wouldn\'t you want to clear any misunderstandings? Because the spotlight was shone at Laura Silsby, the surrounding suspicions were buried. It was a Freudian slip by <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1565742">Jorge Puello, wanted child-trafficker</a> who had represented Silsby as a lawyer in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWS_20100202_030000_Greta_Van_Susteren/start/2820/end/2880">Fox News interview</a>, that revealed this connection.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Clarifications on the Silsby case</h1>
<p>Laura Silsby had attempted to traffic children twice, and was arrested on her second attempt at the Dominican border with 33 children. These 33 children had parents, and were gathered at Calabasse by pastor Jean Sainvil, who fled the country the day after Silsby was arrested. It was the first attempt where Friends of the Orphans came to play, when Silsby was caught trying to load a different group of 40 children onto the bus in Petionville, which is where the collapsed building of Friends of the Orphans was located, after a concerned citizen had reported to a police officer of suspicious activity.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The day after he met Silsby, Sainvil collected the 13 children from Citron. A day after that, the missionaries&quot; bus was halted at the Dominican border and they were arrested. Sainvil, meanwhile, became sick with &quot;vomiting and diarrhea&quot; and decided to fly back to the U.S. on a military transport plane, he said. <a href="https://archive.is/iEnFk#selection-827.1-827.310">https://archive.is/iEnFk#selection-827.1-827.310</a></p>

<h1>Additional Notes</h1>
<p>To clarify for any skeptics who believe this could have been a coincidence or a lie from Jorge Puello. Aside from the fact that there are around <a href="https://archive.is/10DkI#selection-583.0-583.136">760 orphanages in Haiti</a>, the reason this cannot be a fabrication is because the name of the orphanage which Jorge Puello used was its English variant, &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot;, which Puello could not have known unless he was told. This is because the orphanage is known in Haiti as Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs, which translates to &quot;Our Little Brothers and Sisters&quot;, and not &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot;. The staff call it NPFS, and not even the signs outside of the building writes &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot;. It\'s simply not plausible.</p>

<p><a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=S7Y05pL-rakC&amp;pg=&amp;redir_esc=y">This</a> is a good reference for the Silsby case, but keep in mind that it was written by one of the suspect\'s parents. It has numerous inconsistencies, for example the author wrote that the missionaries returned to Santo Domingo on the 26th of January, while pastor Jean Sainvil claims to have <a href="https://archive.is/cahQo#selection-1223.0-1223.252">met Laura Silsby in Ouanaminthe on January 27</a> which doesn\'t add up. <a href="https://i.imgbox.com/MIMGOrBv.png">Look how far apart they are</a>. So take it with a grain of salt.</p>
