             Weird that he would say 3 people, and post is 2 months old? Would've been deleted before that?  I definitely recall seeing a lot more than 3 people on the list. Following your first link, the event page was:
             <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/302092486845740">

             but yeah, its long gone now
