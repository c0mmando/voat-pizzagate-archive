<p><strong>Where We Are At</strong></p>
<p>At this point we have a preponderance of circumstantial evidence that leads to (on the balance of probability) a pretty obvious conclusion. If this case involved any average Joe rather than high ranking government officials, they would have already been dragged in for questioning, at the least. In many cases, people have been convicted on less.</p>
<p>The problem is, where do we go from here? Because this is really the point where an official police investigation needs to begin. A grand jury needs formed, a special prosecutor brought in, subpoenas filed, and persons of interest questioned.</p>
<p>But, given the level of overt cover-up in the media which &quot;debunks&quot; by failing to address any evidence and frequently resorts to name calling (&quot;wild-eyed conspiracy theorists&quot;) rather than disputing facts, I think it is clear that this problem runs wide and deep. It is not a stretch of the imagination to assume that higher-ups at the FBI/DOJ and the White House are compromised. There are good journalists that want to expose the truth. The editors are the gatekeepers and want it suppressed. There are good cops and FBI agents that want this out as well. They are likely being suppressed by DOJ and FBI &quot;leadership&quot;.</p>
<p>This PizzaGate stuff has popped up before. In Washington (Franklin cover-up), in Hollywood(*), in the UK government, and in communities all over the world. It always gets shoved back under the rug. This is like the monster in Steven King\'s IT. It pops up every 30 years and terrorizes children. We have to kill it now, because we have never had social media like we do today, and social media and the Internet will be completely censored in the future to prevent stuff like this from coming out again. Unless we act today.</p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong></p>
<p>We need a legal means of forcing this issue. I believe we can bring these people to justice with an honest investigation and a fair trial, and can do so, no matter how powerful the people are, without destabilizing the country. But the only way to do that is with wide-spread public awareness and support. If a million people go and sit outside the capitol building and refuse to move until the FBI investigates and the DOJ prosecutes (and if they wont, call for resignations until the corruption is flushed out), then I guarantee justice will be done.</p>
<p>Therefore, I propose that our goal at this point be primarily focused on spreading the truth and combating the massive censorship and disinformation campaigns coming from those who are (allegedly) guilty and those who sympathize with them. This is arguably more important than further research, because what good is research if you don\'t have any authorities willing to act? We can\'t stop them with vigilantism. We need police and lawyer allies.</p>
<p>So, assuming you agree that spreading true information to get the word out and debunking the fake news &quot;debunkers&quot; is the correct course of action, I would like to propose some actionable ideas on how we can do that. If you have any other ideas, please share them. Once we have a plan, then we should work on implementing it. Also please make a copy of this thread frequently as I suspect it will become a target. They are scared of us even talking about this. Imagine what they will do if we start creating plans that can actually work? :)</p>
<p><strong>Plans and Ideas</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Getting organized:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We need a website. Any third party platform can be compromised by corporate interests or political pressure. We need a hosting company that is thick-skinned and can deal with massive DDOS attacks, and won\'t delete our account under political pressure. The place that hosts the Palestinian BDS website might be worth looking into**. Also, who hosted WikiLeaks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need financing and a means of taking donations. That means we need a way of holding and transferring money that isn\'t subject to government scrutiny or corporate BS. No 5013c or PayPal. Bitcoin? I don\'t know much about BitCoin, maybe someone can take the lead on this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B. Building trust to counter the propaganda:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>With funding, we can hire lawyers who can do FOYA requests. If the president spent taxpayer money on $65,000 worth of hot dogs, we have a right to know why they needed that many hotdogs. Denying FOYA over hot dogs with &quot;executive privilege&quot; would be very suspicious and give us more evidence of a cover up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lawyers also lend credibility which we need. A video from a lawyer that says &quot;I looked at this stuff, and yeah, it\'s worth investigating&quot; would go a long way. Alex Jones is as credible as a tabloid and people perceive him as such. We need level-headed, respectable, just the facts trustworthy people taking about this. No click bait titles, no dramatic music, no swearing or ranting. We need people that don\'t have a history of conspiracy reporting. (Not that some of those theories don\'t have merit, but we need squeaky clean, stable, trustworthy public voices to reduce character attack vectors.) BTW, does anyone know where Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept stands on Pizzagate?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C. The Deathblow:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I bet there are lots of credible people who want to out this, but are afraid due to the suspicious deaths surrounding people who try to investigate and who talk. We need a lot of credible, authoritative voices calling for action, but no one want to be the first to stick their neck out. So I have an idea. You know how crowd-funding works? You set a gaol, and people pledge. If you get enough pledges everyone gets charged and you get the money. If you don\'t get enough people, no funding goes through.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we should create a system like that but for videos, where prominent and trustworthy people secretly make videos exposing the truth, but the videos stay encrypted and go into a vault until we reach a goal, say 250 whistleblowers. So we have people like lawyers, clean politicians, cops (like that NYPD guy that saw Weiner laptop), reporters, good rank and file FBI agents, people in Hollywood, etc. All credible people with real evidence to report. They make a video, encrypt it, and send the encrypted videos to everyone and the keys to somewhere trusted.</p>
<p>When we reach our goal and have several hundred videos (too many people to kill without suspicion), we release all the keys, decrypt all the videos and upload them all everywhere and from multiple accounts. Flood the Internet with high profile / credible people outing the system. Please help me come up with a system with no-single point of failure, but protects our whistle blowers from exposure until/unless we meet our goal of 250 testimonies. Wikileaks would be great, but I suspect they are compromised so we will need our own system.</p>
<p>The people who come forward will almost certainly be fired, possibly even killed. But that is the risk of being a cop, and of reporting true news. What good cop wouldn\'t give their life to save a child? And here we have hundreds of thousands disappearing every year.</p>
<p>Here are some fictional examples of what a short video might contain. It would be the person, with their face shown and identifying themselves, and a few minutes offering evidence or testimony.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;My name is Agent Smith, and I\'m an investigator at the FBI. I saw the contents of Anthony Wieners laptop and it contains videos of politicians having sex with children for blackmail purposes. I wanted to investigate further, but Agent John, my boss, told me to drop it. I was threatened with termination if I persisted in investigating. Please save the children&quot;.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;My name is Jeanne. You probably know me from my work on That Hit TV Show, and Some Motion Picture. When I was 8 years old and on the set for Certain Sitcom, I was molested by Famous Producer. They threated to kill me if I talked. This is still going on in Hollywood (give example) and needs to stop. Please save the children&quot;.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, these are fictionalized testimonies, but if we could get even 100 short videos like this from famous or credible people in media and law enforcement (against the will of their bosses obviously), we would easily show that PizzaGate is credible and get the nationwide attention that we need to force the government and FBI bosses to act through huge political pressure. I think we could pull this off. But we absolutely need a system where all of the whistleblowers remain secret until we have too many to kill/write off as kooks/ etc.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Please submit your own ideas below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please help me work on a system for safe and encrypted whistleblower video collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please help work on a way to setup funding and a website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please back up everything, I expect this post to scare the **** out of some people since it\'s actionable and they may just decide to DDOS everything. They are cornered raccoons and they know it.</p>
