Instead of positing walls of text in comment sections and social media, at least some of us should try this approach. Point out that maybe pizza gate wouldn\'t be a thing if people didn\'t feel the need to do their own investigating.  <br />
It won\'t result in an end to the fake news cover up, but it will make the media look guilty as fuck.</p>',
