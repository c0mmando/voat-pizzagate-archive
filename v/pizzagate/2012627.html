<p>The Linkin Park Singer was sexually abused as a child by an older man.</p>
<p>The singer strikingly looks a lot like John Podesta!</p>
<p>Bennington died just weeks after Chris Cornell\'s own death.</p>
<p>Chester, who died on what would have been Chris’s 53rd birthday, was a close friend of the singer.</p>
<p>Chris Cornell death probe still leaves a lot of unsatisfied answers. </p>
<p>Was he going to blurt out something which could upset the elite?</p>
<p>He was on the brink of exposing pedophiles among the political and entertainment establisment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cody, who runs the heavy metal rock website The Metal Den, said he believes Cornell — who established a foundation with his wife to help vulnerable children — may have been killed because he was about to expose a child sex ring.</p>

            posted on Linkin Park's facebook account is strangely worded... There truly seems to be a double meaning in here :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We’re trying to remind ourselves that the demons who took you away from us were always part of the deal. After all, it was the way you sang about those demons that made everyone fall in love with you in the first place. You fearlessly put them on display, and in doing so, brought us together and taught us to be more human. You had the biggest heart, and managed to wear it on your sleeve.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What if the demons they're talking about are ALSO to be taken literally ?!...
           </p>
           <p>
            (I know... A few weeks ago, I would've laughed at the idea that demons are a real thing, but now with all I've read, the discussions I've found on youtube comments and elsewhere, I'm wondering... "Stranger than fiction", they say...)

            Very interesting.  Page 33 being used as an illuminati billboard and communication forum seems very plausible.  Makes me think we should be routinely checking page 33's everywhere.  In this instance, I imagine the message to fellow "enlightened ones" is:  Spread the meme that Bennington killed himself and here are your talking points.  Edit addition:  I can see The Sun newspaper being a preferred communication vehicle because of the illumination symbology of the sun.

             Ugh.  This is amazing and horrible at the same time.  Sodomy opens the third eye of the child if sodomized.  It binds the child to the perpetrator.  How painful and disgusting.  They keep doing it and it is a long chain of sexual dominance.  I did not finish it all.  The Kissinger info was not surprising to me because I know he is vile.  Thank you I hope I can get back to this again as distasteful it is.

               It has been printed quite a few times on this site in different articles.  I just read it today.  I have been on here just about as long as you have and then add about 3 months of lurking and I have seen it.  I have been on here all day so I can't remember but if I dig it up I will let you know.  I did you a favor and looked it up.  Something I have read before.  It is not too long either.

               "Dear my faithful employees and brothers of the free, I am sorry to have to tell you this, but I have discovered that I am dying. I need to still finish what I started. Many of us know of the ones who discovered us. They are still out there. Do whatever you need to do to get rid of them. When they are on the attractions, make it look like an accident, and let the public believe that it was their fault. We cannot risk the world knowing. I have already gotten rid of one, by means of being crushed on the people mover. (He was obviously referring to the death of a 17 year old boy back in the 1960's, in which the police report described him being crushed to death by the people-mover, an old attraction that was removed, so that the monorail could be placed. He apparently "fell" off the first car, and was crushed by the next, going at a painful speed of 2 mph. Could he have discovered whatever the Freemasons were doing?) I trust you in making sure that they are all silenced permanently. Yours Truly, Walt D."

               Thank you.  I know about Club 33 and it is similar to the other secret societies I am sure.  There are many doubters, but the reasons I have read are fake and weak at best.  WD was and still is a creepy guy and so is his son, Roy.  I can imagine what his favorite past time is.
