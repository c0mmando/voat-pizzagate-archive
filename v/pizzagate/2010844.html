<p>The following is an excerpt from the article:</p>
<p>&quot;TERMINOLOGY AND SYMBOLS USED BY THE MOVEMENT</p>
<p>Terminology used by the movement </p>
<p>•	Child-lover (CL), Boy-lover (BL), Girl-lover (GL), MAA (Minor-Attracted Adult). These are terms of self-identifications used by pedophiles.</p>
<p>•	Pedosexual. Some members of the movement use the term pedosexual (also ephebosexual and nepiosexual) positing that pedophilia should be seen as a distinct sexual orientation as with homosexuality and heterosexuality. It has also been used simply as a synonym for pedophile.</p>
<p>Symbols used by the movement </p>
<p>•	A blue spiral-shaped triangle symbol, or &quot;BLogo&quot;, symbolizes a boy (small triangle) surrounded by an older male (larger triangle). It was designed by a pedophile with the pseudonym &quot;Kalos&quot;.</p>
<p>•	A similar logo, a heart within a heart, or &quot;GLogo&quot; was later developed by some pedophiles attracted to girls to symbolize a &quot;bond of love&quot; between adults and girls.</p>
<p>ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>•	Some pro-pedophile activists attempt to create a culture of support to pedophiles who are afraid to discuss their attractions for fear of being criminalized and ostracized. To this end, some pro-pedophile organizations provide online counseling services.</p>
<p>Organizations, like the Krumme 13, have been accused of encouraging pedophiles to act out their desires, thus break laws regarding child sexual abuse and the legal Age of Consent. Other organizations encourage others to take care in not breaking local laws.</p>
<p>Much online pedophile activism takes place on message boards. Some pedophile activists also use blogs.</p>
<p>MARTIJN, as well as publishing a magazine called OK and providing support for pedophiles, is also involved in overt activism, distributing flyers and pamphlets at public gatherings and gay pride marches.</p>
<p>Robin Sharpe, a Canadian pedophile, successfully challenged some aspects of child pornography laws in the Canadian Supreme Court in 2002, arguing that his fictional writings were not illegal because they had artistic merit.</p>
<p>Various groups also promote &quot;holidays&quot; intended to spread understanding and acceptance of pedophilia. International Boylove Day occurs on the first Saturday after the summer solstice and some people also celebrate on the first Saturday after the winter solstice. Alice Day is celebrated by female-attracted pedophiles, on April 25. This is the day Lewis Carroll met Alice Liddell, the girl for whom he wrote Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland, on April 25, 1856.&quot;</p>
<p>====================================================================================</p>
<p>Additionally ,  I just thought I would repost the adoption symbol, a heart and a triangle, and what it symbolizes,</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.lifetimeadoption.com/adoptivefamilies/for_adoptive_families/blog/index.php/symbol-of-adoption">http://blog.lifetimeadoption.com/adoptivefamilies/for_adoptive_families/blog/index.php/symbol-of-adoption</a></p>
<p>&quot;You may have heard people say “adoption triad”. It’s a commonly-used term that describes the three sides of an adoption: the birth family, the adoptive family and the adoptee. The triangle in the symbol represents those three sides. The heart intertwined represents the love involved in the relationship of adoption!&quot;</p>
<p>..........And the atheist symbol, which resembles the triangle pedo symbol</p>

            Thank you for Posting this.  It will be serious information for Newcomers that are not aware of the propaganda the pedophiles are spreading everywhere.  People do not realize how they slowly are trying to twist the minds of the American People into believing that our children are sexual beings that want sex with adults while they are still children under the age of 18, not to mention babies and toddlers.  YES.  Even babies and toddlers is what I saw on here from a pedo when I first started on here.  This is sad and must stop now before it goes any further. It already imo, has gone too far.  Their symbols are everywhere and people are oblivious. Upvoat4U
