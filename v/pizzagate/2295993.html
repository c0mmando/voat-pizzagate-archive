The Waltons were the richest family in America. They were worth some $90 billion at the time—as much as the fortunes of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett combined.</p>
<p>When Sam Walton died the pentacle or inverted pentagram was adopted instead the dash in the Wal-Mart logo.  The Walton family invests in charitable organizations, mostly through the Walton Family Foundation. These trusts actually help grow trustees\' wealth.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a big enough spread between the actual performance and the IRS rate, a Jackie O. trust can theoretically save so much tax that it leaves a family richer than if it hadn’t given a dime to charity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walmart has a history of exploiting its workers. According to a study by the Good Jobs First, the company has looted more than $1 billion in economic development subsidies from state and local governments.</p>
<p>Alice Walton became the richest woman in the world after Liliane Bettencourt died. She\'s crashed her cars in 1983 and 1998, when she was charged with DWI. Walton also has a DUI record in Arkansas. In 2011, Walker was caught driving drunk on her way home. She spent nine hours in jail, but otherwise went unpunished. In 2013 the same thing happened.  In 1989 Walton killed a pedestrian.  The police officer who charged her was fired a few days before the trial. </p>
<p>Alice Walton likes to invest in art (a great way to turn dirty money into clean) and built the Crystal Bridges Museum of Modern Art. It had its official opening on 11-11-11 (note the number that occultists love). From the air, the building is shaped as a \'9\'. Again, another favourite number of satanists. This is what a Washington Post article said about the museum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But its name will always be odd, a reminder that Crystal Bridges put bridges where there was never a need for them, channeled and re-purposed a stream that once flowed without obstructions, and gathered around it a forest that was, like many people on this planet, perfectly happy without art or museums or any other signs of “civilized” improvements ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>    
One of her favourite artists is Walton Ford. <a href="http://artodyssey1.blogspot.com.au/2011/03/walton-ford.html">This</a>  is one of Ford\'s pieces-- a baby sucking on the tail of a vulture. Pedophiles take advantage of a baby\'s natural sucking reflex, as was seen in the Instagram photos of Alefantis.  This is a description of this painting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The translation then follows an erotic direction. Tail, “coda,” is ... substitutive designation of the male member... The situation contained in the phantasy, that a vulture opened the mouth of the child and forcefully belabored it with its tail, corresponds to the idea of fellatio, a sexual act in which the member is placed into the mouth of the other person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So his painting is of a baby/toddler/child performing fellatio.  Nice.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblioklept.org/tag/walton-ford/">These</a> are more of his paintings. Lots of animals\' sexual organs, animals having or about to have sex.  </p>
<p>Alice Walton tried to buy 1876 Thomas Eakins’ masterpiece <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/10/the-butchering-artvictorian-medicine-from-blood-caked-aprons-and-body-snatching-to-antiseptic/">The Gross Clinic</a> for her museum.  It is not dissimilar to the painting of cannibalism behind Podesta.</p>
<p>SATANISM NEXT DOOR TO WALTON\'S PROPERTY IN BENTONVILLE, ARKANSAS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1978 a worker of Dr Compton\'s found an alter on the property. Dr Compton\'s neighbour was Sam Walton.  In the center of the alter was ‘the skull of a cow, and then all around it these rocks had been painted.\'  There had been  a series of animal mutilations in Bentonville.  A few weeks later another alter was found on the property.  On it was a plastic human skull, some candles, a large knife and more of the peculiar symbols, someone had left a message scrawled in painted white letters: “Zyto\'s wrath is upon you.”  The symbols were found to be of the Theban alphabet, the “magical ciphers” used by modern witches.  In ‘all. four cows and a horse have been killed this year in an apparently ritualistic fashion that involved cutting out their eyes, tongues and reproductive organs.  Dr. Compton was making arrangements to sell the property to his next‐door neighbor, Sam Walton. It was not just the altars that bothered him, Dr. Compton said. ... there had been other strange goings‐on, like the gunfire the neighbors had been hearing around midnight.  The land belongs to Mr, Walton now Two weeks ago today, a third altar was discovered in the field where the other two had been found. “I\'m glad I don\'t own it any more,” was all Dr. Compton had to say.</p>

<p>WALMART\'S TUNNELS</p>
<p>There is a vast network of underground tunnels with their entrances found at closed Walmart sites: <a href="https://theanalysis.net/2017/03/12/walmart/">https://theanalysis.net/2017/03/12/walmart/</a></p>
<p>The person who posted this video, asking whether Walmart tunnels were being used for sex trafficking has a terrifying story to tell: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I live about three store lengths away from the shutdown Midland, TX Walmart and I first reported a suspected tunnel to the DEA in Jan 2012 but they never looked. I was then shot from 2 3/4 inches above the floor inside my home two weeks later by somebody who was obviously standing underground. After I fall to the ground I find my phone lines dead so I knew they tried to murder me. I crawled out of my home to save my life. A few minutes later two people dressed like police showed up to my home without being dispatched and disabled my front security cameras and before the night was over a group of people &quot;dressed like police&quot; who I believe to be police were caught on camera sneaking into my home to steal evidence and stage the crime scene. The police reports show that no police had been dispatched to my home or were at my home for another three days. In spite of this incredible evidence, the press won\'t report this story and no arrest have been made in this capital attempted murder.</p>

<p>Here are some comments made on <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3647545/pg1?disclaimer=1">http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3647545/pg1?disclaimer=1</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walmart is a massive Child Sex Trafficking Front that works with DHS. FEMA, CIA and numerous other unconstitutional &quot;federal agencies&quot; to transport and kidnap children and adults and ship them around the country.    </p>
<p>Walmart always has missing children posters as you walk into the store, I have often wondered if those are sales flyers for people in the know&quot;   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walmart often advertises it\'s 6,666 children it has saved.  Note the 666.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... those WalMarts are some how affiliated with child sex slavery. One guy claims there are tunnels under his home, and WalMart, in Midland TX, being used by the Mexican Cartels. and local law enforcement, to smuggle small children into the USA, for sex trafficking, and drugs. </p>

<p>Phil Schneider worked in the DUMBs (Deep Underground Military Bases). He was “suicided”. Schneider said that the underground tunnel network is extensive. This network to the NWO airport of Denver, Colorado. These underground tunnels don’t just connect to military bases and installations; they also connect to the rich houses of the elite (Kelley talks about the underground tunnels connecting to houses and the Getty Museum)

<blockquote>
<p>There were many ways of entering the underground facility. The most common was... the underground shuttle system. There are connections to many of the major cities in the US. You simply drive to the designated building in the city as if you are going to work a normal 9-5 job</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ACCESSING TUNNELS VIA \'THE FARM\'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other ways to access the base are via farms in the local area. Many of the farmers have been paid off and the farms have been taken over by government staff. The farms are then modified to allow access to the base. The farms are still run as farms to cover up any suspicious activity.  ,,,  If you have ever heard of \'free energy\' it is being used in many places such as this. Before this system was put in place power was generated by water from the local area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>J.R. had also learned that - just as with the Dulce base (to the SE) and the Groom Lake Base (to the SW) - thousands of men, women and children have been abducted and taken into the underground labs of Utah to be used to satisfy the perverted sexual addictions of the 33+ Masons</p>

            Walmart is a massive Child Sex Trafficking Front that works with DHS. FEMA, CIA and numerous other unconstitutional "federal agencies" to transport and kidnap children and adults and ship them around the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Walmart always has missing children posters as you walk into the store, I have often wondered if those are sales flyers for people in the know"

           Walmart often advertises it's 6,666 children it has saved.  Note the 666.

           Phil Schneider worked in the DUMBs (Deep Underground Military Bases). He was “suicided”. Schneider said that the underground tunnel network is extensive. This network to the NWO airport of Denver, Colorado. These underground tunnels don’t just connect to military bases and installations; they also connect to the rich houses of the elite (Kelley talks about the underground tunnels connecting to houses and the Getty Museum)

            There were many ways of entering the underground facility. The most common was... the underground shuttle system. There are connections to many of the major cities in the US. You simply drive to the designated building in the city as if you are going to work a normal 9-5 job

           ACCESSING TUNNELS VIA 'THE FARM'
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Other ways to access the base are via farms in the local area. Many of the farmers have been paid off and the farms have been taken over by government staff. The farms are then modified to allow access to the base. The farms are still run as farms to cover up any suspicious activity.  ,,,  If you have ever heard of 'free energy' it is being used in many places such as this. Before this system was put in place power was generated by water from the local area.

            The Walmart logo you mentioned featured just a regular pentagram, not an inverted one, but anyway it's been changed now to what could be interpreted as a Luciferian illumination symbol.  They call it "the iconic spark":

            WALMART is involved in the FEMA program and recently during the hurricanes, people were brought to closed Wall Marts as emergency center. People have been warning that Wall Mart is involved with FEMA to secretly have quickly convertable FEMA camps around the country. Wouldn't be shocked if they were part of traficking as well.

                 Originally, the East India Co. imported (pushed) opium grown in India into China. This was the source of the Opium Wars. China was forced to legalize opium imports by Great Britain. Later, opium poppies were also grown in China. The poppies are also grown in Afghanistan and other countries. There is no reason to believe that "China white" was not sourced from China. This info is documented in that book I linked to. READ IT!

                   The article I posted (with info from the book I linked to) is older. Currently, "China White" refers to the synthetic. HOWEVER, when that article was written, the term referred to Southeast Asian heroin. This is documented in the NY Times article from 1987:

                   "CHINESE NOW DOMINATE NEW YORK HEROIN TRADE
By PETER KERR
Published: August 9, 1987"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "Chinese criminals have taken over the dominant role in New York City's heroin industry, in a sudden restructuring of a multibillion-dollar enterprise that for decades was the preserve of the Mafia, Federal law-enforcement officials say.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Authorities say ethnic Chinese traffickers have recently been flooding the New York market with huge shipments of Southeast Asian heroin, or China White, which is among the world's purest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The rise of Southeast Asian heroin in New York, where half the nation's heroin addicts live, comes as officials are warning that Chinese organized crime is on the rise around the country."

            Great post and documentation.
The controlling players in Arkansas are the Rockefellers, Clintons, Waltons, Tyson (chicken), and Riady Family (Chinese), J.B. Hunt (trucking)
THIS ARTICLE TIES IT ALL TOGETHER:

            </a>
            "Another Rockefeller owned and operated state is Arkansas. Sizeable land, small population. You cannot be so much as a successful dog-catcher there without the blessings of the Rockefellers. Several terms before Clinton, Winthrop Rockefeller was Governor. Our interviews with middle-level members of the Rockefeller Family convinces us his proper name should be WILLIAM ROCKEFELLER CLINTON. We feel certain, from all we know, that Sludge Willy is the illegitimate great grandson of the unsmiling Rockefeller patriarch."
           </p>
           <p>
            "It is surprising how some people look at a backward state like Arkansas, and yet do not wonder about the so-called great fortunes headquartered there. Tyson Chickens. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and all their subsidiaries, and J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Tyson has supposedly offered their chicken preparation expertise to Red China. Really? The Chinese have been handling chickens for centuries. Do they REALLY need consulting with Tyson? Need we point out, that Southwest China, where Tyson may have visited, are producers of “China White” dope, a major export to the U.S., much, often via Chicago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Starting about the late 1970s, the Rockefeller banks, such as the First National of Chicago, now to confuse people re-named Bank One, began loaning billions and billions of dollars to mainland China. The promise was that Red China would pay back with gold from their western provinces. BUT, China did not allow in any inspectors to determiine if there is that much gold there to be used to re-pay the loans. Instead, China has been allowed to pay back with “China White” flooding into the U.S. All the while the pressfakers keep falsely saying that most of the dope is coming from Colombia."
           </p>
           <p>
            "In the 1980s, the CIA was shipping through the southern states, guns to Central America, and return trips of dope. Some originating in Colombia and a few other places. It was centered around a small community in western Arkansas, Mena, and the Mena Airport. The Riadys bought the tiny First National Bank of Mena reportedly as a laundry vehicle to the Chicago markets. [Visit our extensive website stories about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.] With the aid of the Rockefellers and through the Riadys, reportedly billions of dope dollars traveled this route."

            BILL CLINTON AND THE ROCKEFELLERS
By Sherman H. Skolnick

            "Other reputed patrons of Bill Clinton reportedly include the Jacobs family of Buffalo, New York (who also reportedly contributed to the rise to high position in sports of O.J. Simpson). They control concessions at sports stadia around the nation, through their operations, once called Emprise, and later, Sportsystems, Inc. Some contended the international sports concession firm had underworld ties.
           </p>
           <p>
            (See, for example: Chicago Sun-Times, 6/6/72; 1/16/72; 11/28/72. Later, Jeremy Jacobs, president of Sportsystems, Inc., testified that the firmhas been "rehabilitated", Chicago Tribune, 3/4/75. In 1972, Emprise Corp., a Sportsystem subsidiary, was convicted in California Federal Court of making a series of loans to Las Vegas gamblers with crime syndicate connections. Chicago Tribune, 3/4/75.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jacobs family runs dog racing, popular in Arkansas. They also have owned Marine Midland Bank, originally headquartered in Buffalo, and now have units nation-wide, and around the world by having merged with Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. The Hong Kong Bank financed the opium trade going back to the 19th Century Opium Wars, the British method of subjugating China. That Bank has been owned and operated by British royalty and is interlinked with British shipping firms in the Pacific rim. Also, some in law enforcement have accused the Marine Midland Bank of being reportedly a dope money laundry."

            I would look into the locations of WHERE Walmarts are built. I remember it becoming a HUGE issue in Arizona. Walmart kept building stores on INDIAN BURIAL GROUNDS.... Random stores out in the middle of the desert. They then "close," but the entire infrastructure is left in tact. People always thought they were doing this to use one day as a FEMA camp or something... but I just realized, they are almost always near the border and I bet they are human trafficking hubs... Holy fuck!

            They actually have quite a history of building Walmart over scared Indian land and burial sites... GREAT WORK!

             I just posted in the "Holiday Cheer" thread about a cousin of ours working on the "mothballed" WalMarts on the East Coast.  Could get no answer from anyone about who was going in there after they finished working on them.  He is red-pilled, big time. Something really is weird about them and all the tunnels, too.  Scary.  But, if you try to get answers, people call you names and tell you that you are crazy and looking for conspiracies. (But, from last week, we now know that the Mueller probe fix was in--via all the text messages we are now seeing exposed.  Not our imagination, at all.  They had ultimate power for thirty years.  Always was sure she was getting in.  It's all over her face when she came out in that purple-lapeled suit after the election.  She had "oh, crap" written all over her face.)

             Yes.  It's a red kite as noted on the painting itself:

              https://imgoat.com/uploads/3f390d88e4/67681.jpg

            </p>
            <p>
             Here's the story of Leonardo DaVinci's earliest childhood memory that obviously inspired this painting (scroll down a little to Earliest Memory section):
             <a href="http://leonardo.wikia.com/wiki/Leonardo's_Childhood">
              http://leonardo.wikia.com/wiki/Leonardo's_Childhood
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             It was Sigmund Freud's interpretation of that memory that brought in the vulture mistranslation and sexual connotations:

             Freud's analysis:

            I was just reminded by someone here about the photos I have (sorry, haven't figured out how to post photos here) of the 'furry costumes' Wal-Mart sells for adults. Ones like they use for pedo. Also, Dr. Suess movie furry costumes with the fbi like double heart pedo symbol.

              Yes, I saw the animal heads on sale this Halloween. Also, had the rabbit heads. They are way to big for kids. The rabbit heads were really creepy, esp. after some pics I have seen here.

            Excellent post! Very impressively put together. Thank you! To demonstrate the importance of posts like this: I have read countless posts and articles about the suspicions with Wal-Mart. Then, reading this, something struck me. No wonder I have a friend who worked for Wal-Mart for 15 years and told me hundreds of horrible horrible stories. Like none I have ever heard. It always struck me that Wal-Mart manipulated people to extreme degrees to get what they wanted. One thing was the terrible terrible ways they made sure no one ever had enough hours for the minimum required for company insurance. My friend was management. She left for a job I could never work. Super high stress. She has been there for years. I don't believe I have heard her complain once. Talk about my eyes being opened. Wal-Mart practices mind control on its employees. And more. I would bet anything. Heaven only know what goes on underground. 
Also, it is well known they force companies to sell to them for less. Force.

             I’ve seen them make all the employees gather around before store opening and do excercises and chants to syke them up for the work day. It was always so odd and this went on for years.

            Great post, remember that Alice Walton is also a member of the Art in Embassies group that many prominent Washingtonians (and members of the Comet Ping Pong inner circle) are members of. Her museum gives her board the ability to send certain artwork (including massive, cumbersome structures) overseas.
