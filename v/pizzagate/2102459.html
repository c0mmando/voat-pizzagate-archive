            Great work with exposing Joel Osteen and connecting the dots!  That whole Hurricane flooding PR fiasco was absolutely despicable.

            He's also come under fire recently with his "devil horns" hand signature:

            religion has always been a refuge for con men and swindlers, PREYing on humanity's desire for meaning. cults and filthy rich religious folks are definitely worth keeping eyes on. the idea he uses of 'success and money' is a sign of doing well in god's eyes... this is an old idea used by many evangelical cults to cover their own corruption and $$ schemes!! Remember PTL?? 
i do not know enough to connect Osteen to Luciferianism, but he is certainly keeping good company with those who use their power to hide corruption.

            I don't trust religious nuts, no matter what the denomination. A religious hypocrite quit work suddenly a few months ago, turns out he was tossed in jail for kiddy porn. It makes me sick to think I worked with such a creep.
           </p>

            I know some church going people who are sincere and live their beliefs and I have great respect for them, but the religious loons are just that.

            Don't forget the double-speaking tactic these satanist/masons/Jesuits use in their opposite "mirroring" of what's considered "good." I'd bet Olsteen's support of charity Feed the Children is an example....
Feed the Children to whom? Spirit Cooking written all over it.

            He gets a lot of attention because he earns it on the field. He's basically unblockable and he's charismatic on top of that. Seems pretty obvious why he's a major celebrity.

             1000 points of light is a direct reference to the Mother of Darkness / Chateau des Amerois from the Dutrous affair. I think that speech was basically signalling that the US is now a Pedo nation.

            So disappointed the YouTube links were so weak in proving their claims. Are there any symbols or unusual decorations at Lakewood? That would be far more proof.

            Osteen is the 5th richest preacher in the US. He just signed a $1.1 million dollar deal (over 6 years, but still) with a new co-pastor. So Osteen claims not to take a salary for conducting services. However he's getting free time weekly to pitch all of his books. Ironic isn't it?

            Dude I think a lot of these leaders of mega churches are probably in cults. I remember when I worked at Chipotle back in 2010, and the leader of the Sacramento area mega church came in to get food with a few other people, before they ate they did a prayer, they were holding hands, and had their eyes shut and heads bowed. But it wasn't a christian prayer, usually where we tell God what we are thankful for, or something to that effect. They bowed their heads, and in a drone like voice, they chanted 3 syllables, I think in Latin. I was pretty red-pilled from that....Whatever it was, it was not a christian prayer, even though I didn't know as much about the occult back then, it was clear that whatever the hell they did was completely cult-like.
