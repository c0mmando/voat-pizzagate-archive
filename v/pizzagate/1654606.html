            The 7th Floor Show Government, Is a group of former intelligence agents, directors, Potus', and other Soro's constituents. Soro's, who is nothing more than a Rothschild lackey.
           </p>
           <p>
            The secret war being fought that has caused, and is causing, real wars to be fought by us., is against the old money (The English Royalty (w/ the Catholic Church) vs. their former Ottoman/persian enemies (United Arab Emirates, Saudi Royals, etc)., Vs New money (Intelligence Community, New World Order, 7th Floor, Private Commercial Leaders)., Which is fueled, funded, and continued, by The Rothschilds &amp; Fractional Reserve Banking (Along with other powerful Jewish Families).
           </p>
           <p>
            On one side of the war, is the Church vs. Islam  (Just like they have been fighting for the last 2000 year). Then there is the Rothschilds (representing Judaism - independently)., Who's family thinks they where here first., Because the basis of both religions came from a Jewish man. Christianity (Which came from Jesus, decedent of Abraham, father of Issac And Ishmael = All Jewish) and Islam (Which came from Mohamed, descendant of Issac and Ishmael, son of Abraham = All originally Jewish)., Are all deviated branches of the same story., The main issue being, each claim their own interpretations, to be the sole "Holy" doctrine.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Rothschild's and their supporting members, believe this because the decedents of both religions, descended from Judaism. The Rothschild's believe, The Kings of of the house of David (Judaism) are the true owners of the world.
           </p>

            Edmond James De Rothschild,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_James_de_Rothschild">
             started the concept of a Zion for Judaism
            </a>
            and creating Israel. The Rothschild, having been funding everything pro zion ever since, through George Soro's and the Quantum Fund, to avoid criticism, like in the early 1900's and then WWII.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think, why else Hitler was willing to go to war with the world to end their banking monopoly (Please do not take this like im advocating his horrendous acts). He was well aware of what they had created and the political influence they had (The Rothschilds that is)., Because of their lending and money power, anyone was willing to go to war for them. If they didn't help, they could recall loans, or they could collapse an economy. Which they have done. Many times. ie. US stock market crash of '29, '08, many small in between.,

             That was kind of interesting.  But I still think the pedos need to be taken down. They are choking our country, UK, Canada, likely some in a Europe, the MSM etc.  I'm not sure we can get rid of the love of money but pedos can be taken down.

            So the news feels they have a right to reprimand Trump for not filling and including those vacated positions with unthoroughly vetted people in the talks... And that so called experience of said people would be more understand on how to handle Israel and the Middle East. If they knew so much and were so good why have they done absolutely nothing to resolve those problems. They have exasperated the situation in the Middle East and with Israel... maybe that was their goal all along. I think clearing the wayfor less government bureaucracy, and putting in vetted trustworthy people in key positions is the right way to go.

            Consolidation and elimination. This is what happens when you have good reason to not trust people. The swamp isn't just top people, it's these entrenched people who have more at stake than just the benefit of this country. When I hear experienced people being let go I think: good. What have they done anyway?

             It is all the appointed positions, those not elected, that are the scum that need to be preasure cleaned out of our system. Appointed by criminals to help their criminal enterprise. They just got pink slips. Now abolish the CIA and gut the FBI. Then we can take down the FED. Why not? Oh, and the criminal media....they are on the list. Covering up 9/11, Benghazi, Fake shootings in order to get sympathy for anti gun measures. Treason. We are only in mid February, I am a believer now. Mostly.

            "The next three months are going to be rougher internally than in Beijing. Between 7th and 1600, no fun." - More talk of Shadowy 7th Floor Group at State dept
           </p>
           <p>
            7th and 1600. The 7th Floor Group, as seen in the FBILeaks. Why do they call themselves the 7th Floor Group? The boardroom of Soros's Open Society Foundation is on the 7th Floor in the Millbank Tower in London. This is some absolutely absurd shit.
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House.

             7th floor state dept is a big enough deal in its own right, but still just one head of the monster that is our government.
            </p>
            <p>
             Likewise soros is just one head of another beast, the darker side of globalism and bankster thievery.
            </p>
            <p>
             But are those both truly the same beast?
            </p>
            <p>
             How much does that matter?
            </p>
            <p>
             The gestalt of the globalist/elite/banking/progressive beast is real enough, but  unlike in mythology, lopping those mortal heads (metaphorically in most cases...) is more important than saying the demon's name.
They are mortals after all and some of them are discovering this in painful ways, whatever their particular evils may be.

            PG specifically is being danced around and going by another name publicly until the public wakes up enough.  PG is just a part of all of this.  The whole thing is coming down in a tactical way so as to succeed.

             I hope true.  DC police have the comet pizza child porn pics.  since Dec 5th.  DC police chief is Alefantis "friend" and supporter.  how do we win in the specific pizzagate case.  I know it's part of a larger picture.

             The Shadow Government is somehow linked to the CIA and it probably commands some faction within it. The State Department is deeply linked to pizzagate.

              They are not "somehow linked" - they are the same thing. This whole thing is the CIA from back before the JFK assassination via the bush cabal through the slaves to the bushs, the clintons, then the CIA asset Obama, and Hillary and all of these fucks. I can't type all this up for you right now, but if you want a simple starting point, it's Prescott bush, but bush and clintons are the same fucking thing and they are satanist evil pieces of shit.

               Think as if you were one of them. Would you try to get your people into other organizations and parts of the government?
Ofcourse!
Therefore I think there are no clear lines, but more centers of gravity with blurred lines (influence).
The CIA seems to be a very important centre of the pedo-satanic blackmailing shadow government.

              Which is exactly why Trump is running it with just his families help at the moment. He's snubbing everyone in the state department currently, aside from Tillerson and handling diplomatic relations almost exclusively on his own. Trumps a one man army.

             They need to discredit media alot, so their "HITELR STARTED JUST LIKE THIS"-narrative wont have any effect. Or go slowly, which seems to be the case so far. Start from the bottom, and slowly go further and further into the public positions which might be involved.

             I agree. I was just thinking how it is the huge pink elephant doing pirouettes in the corner. Everyone knows about it and no one will address it and need for genuine investigation. We are making headway though and each day we are a bit closer

             Openly calling it the downfall of PG is a well tested scenario by the enemy.  They want that so bad as they've prepared to counter, when their counter is first disabled (public awareness) then we can call it what it is.
