</p>
<p>Moms, watch this quick clip about one of the scenes from the Freshman Book 4 – chapter 5 in the Choices game. It gets super sexual between two women at the 17 minute mark. This is what our kids are playing and we wonder why they are experimenting with the same sex, getting pregnant, and contracting an STD at 13 years of age. This company does anything BUT protect our young children!</p>
<p>So why, you may be thinking, does this game affect me as a parent? Because not only is it easily downloadable on any smart phone or tablet, its advertisements are imbedded in other popular apps such as Pinterest, allowing your son or daughter to be exposed to a game where they are encouraged to explore totally inappropriate and sometimes graphic situations involving drinking, partying, and sexuality. The game is heavy-handed with sexual trysts and relationships of all kinds, and players are often encouraged by other characters in the game to choose bad behavior – meanness, drinking, promiscuity – over morally sound choices. Frighteningly enough, I changed the settings on my App Store to find games specifically appropriate for ages 9-11, and Choices did indeed make it through that filter!</p>

            Going to reiterate, I ended up at girlgames.com after a long night of pizzagate digging.  "Who's making games" is a question every parent should ask.

             Yes.  They should ask and also research the Soc. Media sites.  Talk to other parents, and block their TVs and phones of Youtube and FB.  They do not need to be part of this.  Even we do not want to look at that stuff.  Why do parents not police their kids.  I am blaming them.

               which is the Strongest Evidence That Ritual Abuse Is Real.  As you may know that there are some that have been trying to say that the stories of the Victims and Survivors are not real, now we have proof that they are.  These may really help your friend quite a bit.

               Fear is what they want to instill.  I know a SRA Survivor that is the most courageous person I have ever known.  She is a member on here, but she is older and also has an illness but still  manages to take part in life.  I did a post about her and the place where her Satanic Ritual Abuse took place.  She lives in Pa.  I am going to include the link to my post but there are also her comments that can be read in her comment history

               and  the post link is here

               You can read it first and see if it may upset your friend.  She was abused and raped by a priest.  I am not divulging anything she has not already done.  It all took place on St Charles Borromeo Seminary in Phil.  and her rapist is Msgr. Thomas J. Benestad.  Your friend needs to see a special therapist that specializes in SRA only.  Here is a wonderful site and I can also send you a post or two that were posted just recently.  This site is run by a man that was ritually abused by Freemasons
               <a href="https://ritualabuse.us/research/memory-fms/false-memory-syndrome-proponents-tactics/">
                https://ritualabuse.us/research/memory-fms/false-memory-syndrome-proponents-tactics/
               </a>
               AND here is one that she also recommended  run by Ellen Lecter who is a good friend of hers so she does not see her as therapist
               <a href="http://endritualabuse.org/">
                http://endritualabuse.org/
               </a>
               I really truthfully believe that your friend can be helped.  Is he a member of a generational cult?  She was.  I am interested in keeping  up with your friend.  I have always had deep feelings for SRA Victims and Survivors but have become much more involved since knowing my friend.  We correspond quite a bit.

             Yeah, Thank you. I added a couple of other links that I think are all connected to the Normalizing of Our Children.  I hope it was not too confusing.  The Lipstick Alley one really gives me hope regarding the Transgender Push that is going on with the Media and I believe Big Pharma. In one of the comments Diadem wrote:    The pharmaceutical companies. If they can make gender dysmorphia an illness that's only treated by medicine that must be covered by insurance, they stand to have a financial bonanza ETA: That said, it's incredibly sad that someone could be so distraught that they would take their own life. We need to find compassionate treatment for those who suffer from gender dysphoria. While I don't see any logic at all in many of the gender studies reasoning concerning trans ideology, it's clear that these individuals are in real pain and we should respect them and create a world where they feel completely safe to express themselves.    THIS is the one that makes the most sense to me although others are on the mark as well.

             The question we should be asking is what kinds of "mind altering drugs" or similar "medications" were in the child's system.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trans is basically Gender Dysmorphia (the more scientific term for the mental illness in question).

              Most def it is a mental illness problem.  I feel so sad for those people, and the young children.  I know that they are passing out meds in schools like crazy.  Schools are compensated for each child the put on meds.  I read a story so sad.  The child was so full of meds it was sickening.

             Just found this on transgender suicide.  It's from Jan 2014. In it it states... Analysis of other demographic variables found prevalence of suicide attempts was highest among those that are younger (18 to 24: 45%)

               Yes. Thought you would want to see it .I said I bet most of them were under the age of 25 that had transgendered that had attempted or did commit suicide. Now there is no longer a question, but a report with facts.

                So sad.  There is not any support of mental health for these people.  They will be butchered up and all they need is some therapeutic help.  The children are the saddest ever.

                 They should not allow it that young period. Knowing almost half will attempt or do commit suicide. Yet they just keep pushing it younger and younger. It's unbelievable.

                  WHAT is wrong with this country?  They will let people go through something like this?   I keep saying this to all my friends.  WHY can't we have Mental Health Centers?  Think of the problems that would be solved.  I am sure Big Pharma would protest for sure.  What would stop a bunch of people to raise money on Go Fund Me and buy a small building and hire some Therapists to work with people.  I think this could be worked out.  I am sure there are some Drs. out there that want to just help people or donate services during time off.  There has to be a way around this. It all started with Reagan.  Hey you Republicans out there.  Guess what?  I am a Progressive now but voted for Reagan.  Boy was I stupid then.

             I did read it, just now. Terrible. I bet most of the suicides are under 25. I would like to see the ages of those that transition that commit suicide.  Didn't you just love how they tried to tie suicide deaths with this only and not with drugs, abuse, depression, etc.

              Yeah, and what really ticks me off is people don't even notice it.  It's like they don't have a brain to think.  Bingo!  Nope.   Nothing goes off in their head.  They just accept whatever they hear or read on their stupid sites and never go one step further.  Stuck in the Middle.

               So true. That's one reason I look at different sites. You have to research beyond those main sites too. I know most people don't have time to do that, but If they would just switch up what they look at every once in a while they would be better informed.

Yeah there are a lot of Hillbots on there, but I can take it.  I am just interested in getting info.  Lipstick Alley is waking too.

             MSN  is complicit in pushing this narrative! Before it was your kid will commit suicide if you don't let him/her decide her sexual identity at 4 or 5 years old, and then when someone transitioning ends their life, it's still an excuse to push this by 'selling' what happened. That's what happens here.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was in the midst of transtioning so obviously IT'S NOT AN ANSWER! These children are troubled. There's a gender identity issue going on. And it's not that I think an adult shouldn't be allowed to transition. I am in support of someone having the procedure, but ONLY IF THEY'RE AN ADULT. A toddler is in no position to make life-altering decisions ... and teens? No, it's a turbulent time as it is what with hormones raging. And now they're going to be given more hormones which will upset them even more? No, if a person feels this and wants to undergo the transition, more power to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was always a waiting period before this procedure was even started. There was a psychological evaluation as well as a trial period where the person lived as a woman or man, the sex they identified with. It gave time to think this through and find out if this is what the person really wanted. If this was truly going to make them happy. Now? teens, pre-teens and toddlers are being put in the very confusing positions to advance this horrendous agenda.

              I agree with everything you wrote. They are not emotionally stable enough to make a decision even in their teens. What really caught my eye... she said it wasn't happening fast enough. When you think about it that's the way most people that age feel about everything. A year is like a lifetime to them. That's why I feel they should wait until 21. Just to young to handle things emotionally before that. Of course MSN is pushing it.

                At first I thought it was to stop the hostility between posters, but now I believe it's so no one can break the narrative or post opposing opinions. But I know you already knew that. Lol

             This is so very sad the suicide.  Lipstick Alley has it down pat actually.  Mostly all of them understand that Transgender is a Mental Illness problem.  I think things are starting to turn in our favor.  What do you think?

            PLEASE LOOK.  I am crying for this child.  There is something so very wrong about what happened here.  The Mother is nuts.  He was transitioning to a girl.  Now he is dead.  He committed suicide.  She releases the whole personal info about it in his OBIT!

            I can't find anything in the Obit on how he died.  This whole thing is bazaar.  They are killing of our kids.  The suicide rate is rising.  HELP OUR KIDS!!!

            I used to let my kids watch youtube kids, mostly for minecraft tutorials and history shows. I checked it pretty regularly to see what they were watching. Opened it one day to find all kinds of promoted/recommended videos of minecraft sex. Not something like minecraft naked skins, but full on hardcore gay sex in minecraft. They hadn't watched any, but that was the end of youtube for them. I explained to them why they couldn't watch it and why people would do things like that, and I think it was a good lesson for them.

            Damned near anything geared towards kids is pushing trans/gay/hedonistic material right now. Even cartoons for preschool kids.

             My kids use to like to watch videos on YouTube. I learned about the elsagate bs and saw some of it. I cancelled internet and now my kids live like it's the 80's again! Playing outside, no screentime, and using their imaginations. I'm sick of society dictating how kids need to be raised! Im done with it

               Thank you, you're very sweet, but I am just terrified for my children and want to protect them from all this crap. I wish I could put a stop to it for all the other kids but I can't. I can only focus on my own (and try to warn my friends and family who would rather choose to stay asleep and complacent 😩).

                I meant to say part of the solution, lol. But all the same, it really does start at home. The latch key generation is all grown up with kids of their own now and that's why this country is in such sad shape. 😕

             Did you hear that Parents?  NO MORE YOUTUBE FOR YOUR KIDS!!!  Stop It NOW.  They are Hijacking all of our Kids Media.  As soon as we boycott and there are thousands of Shutdowns of their shows then it will HIT THEM in their WALLETS.  That is the only thing the will get.

              Yeah, we used to be able to go outside and play in front of our house or at the park catch lightening bugs at night and now they have to stay in just to stay alive.  It's beyond sad.  Yes and Halloween is no longer a fun thing of making costumes.  Its a Freak Show.

             I'm not a gay guy but I've got several buddies who are, and I'm not surprised by the number of commentators calling bullshit on this trans crap trend of basically forcing children to abandon their gender or change it. Gotta say that on Voat, there's a lot of putting all gays and all Jews into the same pot as the Satanist pedos.

              That's why everyone was so disgusted with people like DonkeyHote and all his incarnations. You can believe there is Jewish control in govt / media / banking without hating them all as an entire race, which is really just mental laziness. It's a failure to realize stereotypes aren't absolute and people must always be judged on their actions. And frankly I would not mind that one ethnic group over another is overrepresented if they weren't known for their dirty politics and amorality, but sadly they are a highly liberal bunch. That's what I don't like, but I'd dislike that whether they were white, black, green, or purple.

              With regards to gays, of course they should be afforded the same consideration to be judged as individuals. Unfortunately, as a
              <em>
               movement
              </em>
              they seem to be embracing this anything goes attitude. Or they're afraid to speak out and and be labeled bigots. Not really sure. From where I stand as a Christian woman, it feels like a progression. And I can't help but notice a lot of homosexuals were sexually interfered with as children. Of course I can't talk to them all, but it is a pattern that can't be ignored. Nobody wants to address it because we're afraid offend.

              Yeah, I don't like it or believe the lumping all in one group of anything.  This stuff needs to go viral.  I am glad someone started this thread and I plan on checking on it and seeing how many have responded.  Hope there are a large number reading this.  Might get others thinking.

               Lately it seems too many people have forgotten how to think, and the young ones are programmed to not think at all-- just react emotionally. When I was growing up, there was a saying, "Question Authority." When is the last time you saw that anywhere?

                When I worked with children  for a few years, I always told the children to question authority.  The teachers did not all agree with my telling them that, but when I told them that I did not mean that they should not listen, just think before submitting to the order or request.  So many now just sit in their seats  and think that their Professors are gods.  Gone are the days of  Professors teaching their students to question even the Professor's teachings.

             This is so wrong to do this to a six year old.  Poor kid. What is wrong with these celebrities ?  The people on DL do see all and not afraid to say what they think either.

              Really surprising because they sometimes are so into the HollyWood scene.  But when it comes to kids they seem pretty grounded.  I am delighted actually because it means that another Soc. Media site is going to be spreading more truth.  They are doing it because they are getting paid Big Bucks by DC and they control PedoTown.

               I know they were upset about the way Kevin Spacey came out about being gay. They don't want people putting gay and pedophile together like that.

                Yes, well, I think people are going to if we keep finding out about the gay couples that are abusing foster kids.  Also, CMBYN did not win any big awards,  so people are getting it, even the gays are.

                  Very true. I know some wonderful gay people, however statistically speaking gay people have higher rates of domestic violence, mental health issues and pedophilia than the general population.

                  Exactly.  I know there are good gay parents, but I believe the sicko elites have this all figured out.  They allowed they gay adoption and parent plans to go through while the sicko gay pedophiles could not wait til they could get their hands on those Foster Kids.  I don't know how we can get around this now.  The CPS thing has to be rolled back somehow.  Did you now Walter Mondale started that pay to the workers at CPS?  He started the ball rolling and then it was scuttled through during the BC Admin.  Wouldn't you know.

                   No, I didn't know that. Something needs to change in followups on these kids. Do they ever speak to the kids privately about their new home life?  It doesn't seem like they do.  Time for me to log off. Have to see my crazy Dr tomorrow. I swear I think she's bipolar. Never know what mood she will be in. Ugh.

                     Well, my Dr was happy today. I always test the waters with her though when I go in. It's like a coworker who you know is always on the edge of flipping out, so you walk on eggshells around them until you feel that safe zone. Most of the time she is fine, but she did go psycho on me once, rude and yelling to the point even the staff was aware of it.

                        Yes.  I know he is my Dad but Whoa.  Everything had to be just so when he came home.  I think my Mom, Bless Her Heart, spoiled him and created the monster, as the family says, But I still very much love my parents.  My Mom is Our Angel.  The are both 90.

                         Oh wow, hope they are in good health for their age. Saw today the 100 year old man from Texas that won another marathon. There was a 102 year old woman that won a marathon too. My neighbor is 85 and she can run circles around some of the young people in the area. She is a hoot too. This old dog I had, a lab mix was chasing a chihuahua that was in heat. She laughed and said he wouldn't know what to do with it if he did catch up with it. So funny.

                          Well, neither one can run like those runners.  My Dad has worked hard all his life and is showing it.  My Mom is much better and pretty much makes sure he takes his pills and gets to his Dr. appointments.  She has a sister that is 93 and her brother is 94.  The sister is really something.  She still lives in her own house, plants her garden and walks the gardens of her whole block in the summertime to make sure they are doing well.  AND she plants flowers at the Church with her daughter. Amazing.  I hope I will do half as good.  They are all from the Old Country.

                           Staying active on into senior years is key to longevity. Of course all the obvious such as eating healthy, staying a healthy weight, avoiding drugs, alcohol and not smoking. Having great genes too. Sounds like your moms family inherited the longevity gene. How wonderful. I agree working hard all your life in a physical job esp can take a toll. We found clips of letters to the editor from my husbands great grandmother to their local newspaper. She was disgusted by fast food joints,lol. She said that was what was wrong with people being so unhealthy. She was right. She lived into her 90's and so did her husband.

                            I used to be more healthy but now I spend so much time on here almost all day that I don't get out much anymore.  Should really take care better, but the Children call to me and I don't want to miss even one post.  Your grandmother was a smart lady.  Our country really has thrown eating healthy out the window.  Deep Fried Twinkies.  Really.

                             I admire what you and others do here for the kids. I don't so much, but I follow and contribute if I can. For anyone who doesn't think it will make a difference, it will. Just think of all the things that been uncovered. One day when all is revealed these discoveries may be used. It also helps for people that are curious and come here to understand what it really means.  MSM that always says.... oh it's just about kooks that think a pedophile ring was ran by Clinton in a basement of a pizza place will be the ones discredited then. This is about much more than a pizza place.

                              Yeah, the ones that think it's a big pizza joke, they will be the ones that will be in Mortal Shock.  How stupid.  As if thousands of us would be hooked on something like that only.  Those people are so stupid, thinking that there are not people evil enough to be doing these things.  We can see how things have sped up as far as knowledge about our case.  Just check out Twitter and the comments after articles.  We have, I believe, mad a huge difference.

               I heard that story about Madge. Nothing surprises me about that evil witch. I'm more inclined to think Jolie has something resembling a human heart, whatever else her faults. 😂

                I don't know what's up with their actions.  Why are they adopting those babies, for what purpose?  The only thing I can come up with is that they are being paid to make bazaar examples of the kids.  Also maybe they are selling them off for sex to elites.  Those kids are going to be screwed up for sure.  Just like their mothers.

                 I can only speculate it has to do with virtue signaling. "Look what a humanitarian I am, caring for all these kids from impoverished countries!" It's a fad, a fashionable thing to do. It's like these kids are fashion accessories to them. I think they think it's going to be so easy but there's lots of red tape involved, lol. I bet Madonna isn't used to being told no and when she had her "fashion accessory" picked out from an orphanage and was told "uh ma'am this kid has a family" she didn't give a damn. That's all speculation, but it just seems like something she would do, lie to a down on his luck father to get her way. She's a horrid person, lol.

                  I remember reading and article about how the father of her latest adopted girl, filed a lawsuit against her and that there was a misunderstanding and that he claims he was told the child would only be taken to give her a good education and a good start in life, or some similar story.  Then he could have her back.  Don't know what came of the lawsuit.

                   Welp. I think we all know who can afford the best legal team. And the father may have signed a contract without reading the fine print. People take advantage of the poor and and/or uneducated all the time. The man may not have spoken much English either. Don't know for sure, just speculation.

                    You are right about the legal team.  Also I am thinking maybe she paid off that orphanage and they are willing now to speak in her favor, not the father's.  When will people understand that just because someone can afford a 1st class college education and fancy clothes and all the trimmings, when will they understand that it does not replace the love of a parent.  Deep Love is the Key.

               Add Sandra to that too. That was the going thing for a while was to adopt these kids. I think they have switched to having kids transgender now.

                Makes your stomach turn doesn't it?  Madonna was being sued by one of the father of the last girl from Malawi.  He said it was a total misunderstanding.  He said he was told she would just educate here and give her a good life til then and return her.  He had brought her to an orphanage because he had to work and could not care for her during the day.  Hmm.  Sounds like a pay off to the orphanage and a quick jump onto a flight.

                 I remember reading that too. Sounds just about the same as CPS taking a kid away from their family, knowing someone in the family wants them and refusing them custody of the child.

                  There is more and more of this going on.  I wish someone would start a petition to get rid of this clause.  I am sure it is stuck into some kind of  bill.  I posted it in the comments a few weeks ago.

             I don't think a 6 yo can fully transition, you need sexual reassignment surgery for that and I don't think that it can be performed on a child. At least not on a child that wasn't born hermaphrodite. Anyone here know for sure? I feel like the datalounge title is being sensationalistic...

              They won't do surgery, but they give them hormones, or hormone blockers which impede the natural development of their bodies. That's plenty sick enough!

              I was a tomboy for many years as a child. My family didn't care and just called me a Tomboy. When I got a bit older that all changed for course. I never once thought I might actually be a boy, or wanted to be a boy. I just preferred doing boy things and didn't like dresses. It is so scary to me to think what happens now to a young child who shows preference for games, toys, clothes, etc that are attributed to the opposite gender. Dumbass parents seem too quick to hop on this "my child is trans" trendy bullshit and actually force detrimental and often permanent changes on their child! In the next few years we are going to see some really screwed up kids because of this! Just let kids be kids!!!

              I don't think so either.  I think it was kind of meant to be tongue and cheek.  Since most of the remarks are not in favor of what she is doing and one of them even says she has to dress him that way WHAT?  Yeah, I actually think some of them are on to the forced gender push on their kids in PedoTown.  Another says that there is a low % of transgenders and most of them seen to be in Hollywood.  Um, pretty good I think that they are on to these idiots.  Yes, I agree and think you are correct that a 6 yr. old would not be allowed.  But I am scared to death that someone may think that law needs to be changed.  God let's hope not.

               Yeah, I don't think kids should even be told that they have an option when it comes to gender, just let kids be kids. Telling a child they should choose some shit like that will just confuse the hell out of some kids. I cringed so hard at this professor on bill nye's show talking about some lady apologizing to him because she didn't realize his 3yo boy was a boy and this doofus says "I don't know if he's a boy either" or some dumbass shit like that. His poor son! Can you imagine if your fucking father was that fucking retarded? Hey dad, guess what? "I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding."

                You really had me laughing, as if there is something funny about that, but the stupidity of people, is amazing.  But remember that Bill Nye is a Tool so he will be having Wack Job people on talking about stuff like that.  All these people are on the march.  Yeah the march to get people believing that everyone talks like this.  No they don't and I don't think people will fall for it.

            It is scary that the filters are not working. Evidently, their idea of what is appropriate includes the sexualization of children. It's ridiculous. It's another reason for us to get together and demand the filters work.

             I fell on this story by accident.  Like many others, I was researching something else.  The good thing is that there is a way to block it.  The bad thing is that it seems now we have Pinterest in on the act just like other Soc. Media sites joining in with their partners in crime like Youtube FB and others.  They have all been paid off, bought out and infiltrated by TPTB to do their dirty work.  Yes, it is important for us to spread this far and wide. Tell your friends, relatives, schools.  At school you can stand out in front after you print out a flyer from the website. You can also do this in front of your House of Worship.  Let parents know.  It's as simple as that.  A Simple Flyer Will Do Wonders.

              Yes. I'm sure parents will be horrified to learn what's going on.

              One person can make a big difference. Alert your friends and neighbors at the least. Invite them over and share what's going on.

               The Old Fashion Koffee Klatch.   Yes, that will be an Ice Breaker and you can also bring up Elsagate on Youtube and CP on FB.  Then you can watch their eyeballs pop out.  Just like ours did.
