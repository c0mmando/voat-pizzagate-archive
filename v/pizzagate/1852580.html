<p>PHOENIX (AP) — An oldies country music radio station serving a rural Arizona area that aired a public service announcement for two years telling people how to hide potential evidence in child pornography cases has stopped doing so after advertisers received threats, the station\'s owner said Wednesday.</p>
<p>KAVV-FM owner Paul Lotsof said in an interview that he does not like child pornography but created the announcement because he thinks Arizona\'s 10-year minimum sentence for each image of child porn is too harsh and costly for taxpayers.</p>

            WHERE HAVE I SEEN THIS BEFORE? Ah yes, government gay child raping teacher grooming training 101 from a now jailed pedophile Alex Golan. I work in education as a developer of e-learning systems. It's un-fucking-unforgivable for the government to let disgusting

            gay teachers do social networking direct to young children using weird and wonderful social networking websites the parent's can't effectively monitor. This is exactly what is going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a video from the gay pedophile jailed schoolteacher:

            </a>
            Antifa leader and Vice Contributor Alex Gollan Jailed for little boy child sex porn gave training sessions in grooming tactics as a gay teacher. He gave a training course telling teachers how to use weird and wonderful social networking sites for networking with kids contary to the teachings given by the cybersafetylady.com.au who  tours schools with a criminal dyke cop Tui Ormby that arrested me, but that's another story.

            </a>
            ) Google Tui Ormsby Boosted by a Lebsian tiff to see her doing same sex domestic violence almost occasioning in death or see the two youtube videos at the end of this post on a gay child raping cop that arrested me in America Christopher Kent bowersox. Anyway back on topic.
It got censored from the sit.edu.au website but I backed it up somewhere. This should be enough

            Tbh I agree with him. 10 years per? There are people who have been imprisoned for accidentally downloading it. Imagine getting 10 years because one of the chicks among thousands in your porn folder was 17 instead of 18.

             The USA FBI is the biggest host and creator of CP content in the USA. Fact.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some 90% of all CP on the internet wouldn't exist if the USA GOV didn't make the material available in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just like Cocaine, or Heroin; The GOV(CIA) controls world cocaine and opium, and then has exclusive markets to hook the USA ppl on drugs.
            </p>
            <p>
             CP  is exactly the same the GOV makes the CP, hosts the CP, and then targets PPL for prison. Funny the USA MIL, and LEO are biggest users of CP, but they are never targeted. Riddle that why FBI doesn't arrest its own ppl?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h1>
             Let's be clear here, what the fuck is "CP" really?
            </h1>
            <p>
             Back in the day, guys used to collect photo's of hot 16 year old's, that was a common. Now that be CP, and yep a guy would get 10 in the big house now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Baby photo's, back in the day nobody thought shit about developing a B&amp;W photo of a kid in the tub, now you develop or possess such a photo, your going to the big house.
            </p>
            <p>
             My personal guess like all thing probably only 3-5% of the "CP" out there is the "BAD STUFF", they real nasty stuff that we all know when we saw it, it was once sick mother fucker that made the CP.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem is like a over 18 guy fucking his 17 year old GF, this could get him listed as a 'sex offender' for life, this is what we have come to as a society.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fucking fucked up,
            </p>
            <p>
             What the Message here is was simple, don't have even anything that can be construed by societal nanny's as "CP", and if you do keep it on a disposable usb drive. Not bad advice given the fucked up society.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, let me close to remind all that in Arizona you can still get 20 years in the Pen for possession of a 'joint'. Same deal, if you smoke in AZ only do it at home, and never make take it out of the house. Only have a very small quantity, otherwise you will go to the pen for a very long time.
            </p>
            <p>
             The point of this article is that the PRISON-Industrial-System is insane, and they 'public service' message is telling people how to stay out of the private prison racket.

              i dunno why you got downvotes, your post is spot on.

             <p>
              I have relatives who have photos of me as a kid in a bathtub. Absolutely innocent, but 'technically' an overzealous policeman could lock them away for it.

              #pedogate is serious, fucked up and the major obstacle to a humane society. But that's not to say there isnt some misguided efforts in prevention of paedophilia

            <p>
             Baby photo's, back in the day nobody thought shit about developing a B&amp;W photo of a kid in the tub, now you develop or possess such a photo, your going to the big house.
            </p>
            <p>
             My personal guess like all thing probably only 3-5% of the "CP" out there is the "BAD STUFF", they real nasty stuff that we all know when we saw it, it was once sick mother fucker that made the CP.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem is like a over 18 guy fucking his 17 year old GF, this could get him listed as a 'sex offender' for life, this is what we have come to as a society.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fucking fucked up,
            </p>
            <p>
             What the Message here is was simple, don't have even anything that can be construed by societal nanny's as "CP", and if you do keep it on a disposable usb drive. Not bad advice given the fucked up society.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, let me close to remind all that in Arizona you can still get 20 years in the Pen for possession of a 'joint'. Same deal, if you smoke in AZ only do it at home, and never make take it out of the house. Only have a very small quantity, otherwise you will go to the pen for a very long time.
            </p>
            <p>
             The point of this article is that the PRISON-Industrial-System is insane, and they 'public service' message is telling people how to stay out of the private prison racket.

              A primary consideration, which excludes bathtub baby family type photos ( in Canada anyway ), when looking at evidence is are the images of a sexual nature. If they are clearly not, like any family photo album that has a bunch of naked babies in it, there is no crime.

              I get what you're saying, but I don't think anyone on public radio needs to advertise to hide cp.
             </p>
             <p>
              I get that family photos of their baby in a tub shouldn't be considered bad &amp; I don't think it is by law.
             </p>
             <p>
              The one problem that u don't address w cp is that it's not just pics of baby in a tub or a 17 yo girlfriend that people w cp have. It's pics of babies and children being raped by an adult, it's
              <em>
               videos
              </em>
              of babies and children being raped by an adult.
             </p>
             <p>
              Imagine a pic of your baby in the tub ending up in the hands of a pedo. That pic gets duplicated &amp; circulated to many pedos. Would u be OK with that? It's just a pic.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think, for the most part, people who have fam photos of their kid in a bathtub aren't the ones being charged. Otherwise there would be a massive amount of mothers in prison.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: I just reread your post &amp; you did mention the real bad stuff. Sorry have 50 things going on at the same time at my house.

              Here's another example of his warped thinking:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Then there’s the case of Conrad.  In 1989 Conrad got into a fight with another man in Safford during which Conrad hit John in the head with a screwdriver.   Conrad then compounded the problem by taking John to a ditch and leaving him there.   The next morning John crawled out of the ditch and got help.   Conrad couldn’t afford a lawyer so he got convicted of attempted murder and kidnapping and a sentence of 28 years.   Thus far, Arizona’s taxpayers have been taken to the tune of just under half a million dollars to keep Conrad away from screwdrivers.

               Can u define a pedophile? I seem to remember it be someone that have sex with 'children'.
              </p>
              <p>
               The problem is that internet allowed photo sharing, and there as always been a minority that have the pedo fetish, then of course CP is BIG biz, anything illegal or taboo, the NET is the perfect place, the dark-net, ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Funny thing is that biggest and MOSTEST CP comes from our own FBI, who setup and make CP, so that they can entrap 'innocent' people and bring them into their system.
              </p>
              <p>
               Make no mistake the USA system is about putting people into private prisons for any reason, and making them into $1.5/hour corporate slaves.
              </p>
              <p>
               Arizona like Louisiana is the worst. Remember those WACO bikers a few years ago, got in 'fight' 100+ tossed in jail, $1Million bail, all rotted in prison for months, in PRIVATE prisons, turned out that Warren Buffet owns the town and the private prison, and it need's to be full capacity by GOV contract, so the bikers were just useful 'guests', anyhow, all this don't have fuck to do with CP or PEDO.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lastly, if you want real PEDO, then become LEO, or Israel/Saudi person, where its totally legal to have a child sex slave.

              No, he rationalizes child pornography (as he does other criminal and immoral behavior). And that's even more clear from what he said in a news interview:

              </p>

              </p>
