<p>According to the recently unsealed documents in the case of Epstein victim Viriginia Roberts-Giuffre against Epstein\'s accomplice and fellow sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, who allgedly trained the girls, and sometimes raped them too, Robert-Giuffre said that Maxwell bragged about a sexual encounter with George Clooney.</p>

<p>Robert-Giuffre says socialite Maxwell boasted about it during a globe-trotting trip they both made with Maxwell in 2001 which culminated in her meeting Prince Andrew for the first time in London. Maxwell allgedly loved to brag about her rendezvous with her various lovers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once she came back giddy as a schoolgirl with an explosion of news, with all the build up and excitement in her voice you’d think she was the next crown princess, but she had given George Clooney a b*** job in the bathroom at some random event, she never let that one down.”</p>

<p>It is not known when the alleged incident may have taken place.</p>
<p>Giuffre-Roberts\' manuscript, which she drafted in 2011, featured in a defamation court case she fought against Maxwell.</p>
<p>Lawyers for both sides had said it was “fictionalised”. But it was released on Friday, along with documents implicating Prince Andrew.</p>

            The question I'm interested in is why did child trafficking go UP after the creation of Clooney and Podesta's Nonprofit?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 2017, there was an increase in the number of occurrences of sexual violence from FARDC and the Congolese National Police, with many of the victims being children. 41% of the actions committed by members of FARDC and 42% of those committed by Congolese National Police included acts upon children.

             Good question. One reason is certainly that the men in Congo became more and more insensitive, and more brutal during the ongoing war. Congo has been one of the most hellish places on earth in recent years.

              Geez. Well considering who her father was we have a good idea why she became what she is today. Wonder how many times she was raped and by whom. Some pretty big names surely. That’s how she learned her trade.

               Yes, her mannerisms, the phony smile, even the short boyish hair ALL of it reminds me of my D.I.D. Ritual abuse victim ex wife. I have first hand knowledge of what it is to be victimized(actually I hate that word, let's call it survivor) by a woman who, as a child, was severly abused and programmed. My ex had Delta programming as well I believe. The least of my ex's crimes was she was a prostitute(which at the time, 1995) made no sense because I was sometimes making around 1 million a year. But these kind of women are victims of their childhoods. Believe me, it is hard not to hate them but as time goes on I try to forgiving(oh hell, who am I kidding, it is damn near impossible). Summarizing, they are programmed monsters. Seems the both had sex programming as well (Beta programming) but as with my ex, I would be looking into strange deaths around Ghislaine Maxwell. Just a thought, but I intuitively feel that she is an assassin as well. Speaking of that, she very well could have killed her own father. Maybe she even enjoyed it as he was most likely the perpetrator that started on her at a very young age(anal rape, etc) and the n passed her on to the pros that conduct programming. Many as children, may have grown up to have normal lives but this ritual abuse can take a normal child and turn them into a full steam ahead, full blown sociopath. My research on ritual abuse programming goes back to 1996 when I first met Ted Gunderson. As far as Ted goes, I think he was a white hat but some claim he worked both sides of the alley. I even spent time at his apartment in Vegas and I can tell you he wasn't living the high life. Broken down car etc. But Gunderson had, what has turned out to be, excellent information regarding ritual abuse.Sorry Carmencita for the long post but had to get my 2 cents in. I am in NO WAY condoning what these woman) (or men) have been programmed to do but sadly, they are victims as well. Cut the head of the serpent off, only way to stop it. The ones that started these programs and continue creating their secret armies and Brownstones.

                Sad Oh so sad. No apology please. I found it very enlightening. It’s a double edged sword actually. I can’t imagine the hatred deep within them. She may have killed her father and possibly she was programmed to do so. Ala Manchurian Candidate style. Orr maybe she didn’t need force. Many that have been abused by their parents still ant to please them. Wanting to make things right in a sick way. Yes I think she could be an assassin. Possibly she even offed Epstein. Who knows. TPTB would take pleasure in such a sick criminal act. I always like to hear from you. ♥️

                It’s sad in a way that they can’t get help but they are quickly snatched up by the ones that have groomed them to be what they are. There are many like her in their army. Mossad and CIA and others.
