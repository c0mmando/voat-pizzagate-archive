            This is why Webb is an important topic, especially while people are still unaware of the threat he poses. Voat is almost completely unusable at this point, the WebbOp has so many trolls and brainwashed crowdsourcers, whose identities are now known to Mossad. Glad I never fell for their bullshit and contacted them.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, a crowdsourced investigation is supposed to be accessible - where is all this info being stored? To my knowledge, there is nowhere one can go to find all the crowdsourced information. Yet no one complains?
           </p>
           <p>
            They have ruined this sub. I hate to think of what more is in store.

            Total Bullshit. Did you watch the video from lifting the veil where "Dave Acton" is trying to manipulate and intimidate Nathan and George cold calls him on the spot and tells the truth blowing Dave's lies out of space. Acton admits to all of it that he lied and his career is over.,George is nice to him and talks about exactly what he is doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dave then deleted all his youtube videos and channel from the net and went dark.
