<p>Simply googling &quot;michael aquino and the snake lady&quot; brings up an interesting youtube channel and website accusing her of, among other things, being a communist MK Ultra operative who was involved in a wave of &quot;about 12-20&quot; teen suicides in Antioch Illinois in a 1-2 month time span, for which no police reports were filed. Most of the victims did not leave suicide notes. Antioch is about 45 minutes away from Racine.</p>
<p>In this video, the speaker claims she is connected with both Michael Aquino and the Jonestown massacre which resulted in the only murder of a serving US Congressman. he says Helen Miller moved her operations from Rock Lake, Wisconsin to Round Lake/Antioch Illinois in 1979. He says  &quot;I know for a fact that Helen Miller was serving drugs to teenagers in the Antioch area and she was known as &quot;The Snake Lady&quot; to them.&quot; He also mentions a forum posting from 2004 about how &quot;Antioch Highschool is haunted&quot; and there is a poster in that forum that says he didn\'t know of any hauntings, but many students died in crashes and from suicides when he attended the school, and one student murdered another. The speaker also claims that there was a man wandering around who had drilled a hole in his head. After being picked up by the Round Lake police he said someone tried to put something in his head and they &quot;took him to the looney bin&quot;; he also claims that a man from Grays Lake suddenly went crazy and drove his car into the White House fence.</p>

            An 80 year old from Forest Lake, who was involved in recovering Hillary Clinton's 30,000 missing emails, "committed suicide" in 2017. This rabbit hole doesn't end. I wasn't looking for this information either, I was just looking into Tony Podestas connections to Forest Lake when I found this article:

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Peter W. Smith was a longtime Lake Forest businessman who earlier this year told of his 2016 quest to obtain from Russian hackers more than 30,000 of Hillary Clinton's emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             Smith took his life about 10 days after calling a Wall Street Journal reporter about Smith’s efforts. Now, his estate is cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee by turning over unspecified documents it requested, Lake Forest attorney William Ensing told the Tribune last week.

            The Bill Clinton thing..... unbelievable! Bc Lake Forest is the definition of living in a bubble. No crime. Nothing!!! Everyone practically knows everyone to where there’s zero chance of any outsiders getting away with anything bc if you aren’t from Lake Forest (bows in hair, dressed in pink/green Lily Pulitzer) you stand out like a sore thumb. That def needs some looking in to.

            All the Lake Forest info I can MOST DEFINITELY verify bc I live in the next town over and my hubby grew up in Lake Forest. Not sure if OP mentioned it, but Podesta once worked at the now defunct (and razed buildings) of what was once Barat College. LakeForest=old OLD money.

            The spider cult is a curious aspect given the fact that she is known as "The Snake Lady". In Native American mythology Spider Woman, the keeper of wisdom, is said to return in the last days and spin her web across the land.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this excerpt from the Hopi Snake Myth, recorded circa 1900, a young man journeys to the home of the Snake People. There, with the help of Spider Woman, he meets a beautiful Snake Maiden.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Spider Woman and the Birth of the Snake Clan
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             On the walls of the kiva were hanging many costumes made of snake skins. Soon the chief said to the people: "Let us dress up now," and turning to the young man bid him to turn away so that he would not see what was going on. He did so, and when he looked back again the men had all dressed up in the snake costumes and had turned into snakes, large and small, bull snakes, racers, and rattlesnakes, that were moving about on the floor hissing, rattling, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             While he had turned away and the Snake People had been dressing themselves, Spider Woman had whispered to him that they were now going to try him very hard, but that he should not be afraid to touch the snakes; and she gave him many instructions....
            </p>
            <p>
             Spider Woman whispered to the young man that the one that acted so very angrily was the pretty maiden and that he should try to take that one. He tried, but the snake was very wild and fierce. "Be not afraid," Spider Woman whispered.... He at once grabbed it, held and stroked it four times upward, each time spurting a little medicine on it, and thus freeing it from its anger.
            </p>
            <p>
             The snake then changes back into a beautiful maiden; the two later marry, and their children become the ancestors of the Snake Clan.
            </p>

            , can you add some corroborating links for this alleged wave of suicides? We need the timestamp from the video showing the news clippings or obituaries at a minimum, or better, links to the obits/news items themselves. If the videos do not provide the evidence supporting those claims, this is merely personal testimony, which we typically flair "Unverified" or "Accuracy?" I will give this the Unverified flair for now and will remove if this can be corroborated.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              on Feb. 28, Laskero-Teskoski, 15, was struck and killed by a train in what his mother said she firmly believes was a suicide.
             </p>
             <p>
              Laskero-Teskoski became
              <strong>
               <em>
                the second of three Lake Forest High School students who were fatally struck by trains since January.
               </em>
              </strong>
              Sophomore Farid Hussain, 15, walked in front of a Metra train on Jan. 9 in what the Lake County coroner ruled a suicide. Last week, as classmates began spring break, senior Edward Schutt, 18, became the third to be killed by a train.
             </p>
             <p>
              No official cause-of-death rulings have been made for Laskero-Teskoski and Schutt.
             </p>
             <p>
              But mental health experts and officials from other schools that have dealt with multiple student deaths say Lake Forest may be dealing with a suicide cluster. Within days of the second death, suicide prevention advocates began calling Lake Forest school officials, offering condolences and education tips.
             </p>
             <p>
              The grouping of teen deaths may serve as a wake-up call to strengthen mental health support in a community rich with resources but reeling from the turn of events. Where multiple suicides have occurred, it often falls to school officials to lead prevention efforts with screening and education.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Three highschool students all get killed by a train in less than a year? This isn't even the time frame that the videos mention, it's 20-30 years later and the area still appears to be a "suicide cluster"
