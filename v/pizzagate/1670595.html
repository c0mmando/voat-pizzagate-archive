            You know, in bouncing these concepts off of you It's pulling back the fog of things as my confidence grows, and I'm sure of this now too... That High Functioning Autistic types (HFAs)  are actually wired up for the genuine.  There is something about spotting a phony that comes natural to us.  We have this thing of getting annoyed at those who go about things indirectly.  We're just like... why didn't he just come out and ask?  So being that we so easily spot a fake we operate as though being a fake is just the stupidest thing ever.  It's insulting to our intelligence when people are fake.  I mean things like popped collars are more than just bad taste to an HFA, they reflect deeply into just what exactly is wrong with the one who does it.  we add up all the subtleties quick and come to pretty good conclusions.  I think we also have issues with narsacist (spell check wants to change that last word to nonracist, though it would be very funny lets not)  as well.  I think we are just so super conscious of the root of things, and we cut to it so quickly that we almost couldn't live with ourselves if we went around like complete Manipulative self seeking D-bags.  However we are very self seeking through the eyes of others at times, because we don't care how things come off or look often, because we sense that it would all be seen through anyway.  It's liberating though knowing that I go about things in the most direct route and I'm successful for it when others are not yet they do everything according to all of the rules of etiquette they were taught was the glue of society.  Well... It appears you got me rambling on a topic of interest LOL.....  I'm doing a non-telepathic version of a Spock Intel dump to your brain LOL... Relate to Data or Spock much?  sometimes I feel like a Spock... Sometimes a Data...  I often feel like Capt. James Kirk, but come off like a disorganized Spock or Data LOL.

            Yea... I got a sociopathic mother in law.. No really.  For real LOL.  My wife from time to time says Im alot like her, but reasonably I'm very different.  I'm accused of ignoring my wife when the reality is I'm 10 moves ahead working on solving a problem she doesn't really think she has which is the root of multiple problems.. all the problems go away and I get no credit, but she's better off....  I get the "Nice to see you too" response instead of thank you lol.   I've learned I need to force myself to sacrifice an hour of progress here and there to just get my wife up to speed with me on things.  I can't keep her up to speed at all times or I'd never get anything done.  LOL....  Anyhow...   I agree with your sociopathy-autism polarization.  I've essentially had to break that down for my wife, but never considered relating the two in a dichotomy.  The tell tale for me though is Sociopaths like to be heard, autistic types want confirmation of understanding.  Admire a sociopath and they are happy, admire an autistic type without any affinity for the topic of engagement and you frustrate them.  I think these personalities are natural born enemies actually... and I'm fond of the idea that I have advantages in surviving their manipulations and wiggling out from their control.  It's just from time to time I would let my mother in law have it over the phone... LOL

            It's a dopamine addiction cycle that is associated here.  It's just as much a physiological addiction as crack.  The receptors need this stimulation more and more the more they get it.  They are rewiring their brains perpetually, and in doing so seek out the most vile perversions in short time to get a fix.  The more demonic and out of this world the more effective the experience is at releasing surges of dopamine to re-excite the receptors born of trauma... again, that trauma can also be their willful self traumatization.  Or it could be childhood molestations.

             It's my firm belief that marijuana is a great remedy for such rewiring.  It burns out receptors and enables one to start over form various physio-psychological addictions.  The brain has been proven to prune and regrow, but on it's own it is a lengthy withdraw process to rewire and nutrition can be a detrimental factor.  Quickly burning out the brain for a few months will bring about a new beginning,  coupled with a good recovery program after several months of smoking alot of weed you can actually reshape who you are, your interest, attitudes, and preoccupations for the rest of your life like a teenager again.

              again however.. for pedos... the only solution is execution.  Any decent person capable of reform wouldn't trod such a path into darkness.

            However... This could still be a chicken or egg debate....   I wouldn't say all with autism are pedophiles nor would I say all pedophiles are autistic either... I actually see sociopathy to be the heighest correlating mental characteristic.  Autistic personalities often do not handle spotlight well, and seek to avoid it.  I can see how either mental deviation could arrive at pedophilia, but not that there is a magnetic pull to it.  I think the Sociopathy is partly what sets one down the path towards pedophilia, but at the same time I believe acting upon such impulses in any degree or any general amoral impulse tends to develop a degree of sociopathy, and the more traumatic, the more significant.  Lower IQ is a reasonably expected correlation with Trauma victims... That said, when they commit their crimes, they are indeed traumatizing their selves, I have no pitty on them and execution is due all the same, but this is something to consider when examining their psyche.  Motor skills issues can be a bit convoluted in autism.  I will confess that I'm to a degree on that spectrum from time to time, and more so fluctuate relative to nutrition, sleep, and environmental stresses.  I actually have an innately high spatial-visual IQ as well as kinesthetic IQ if such were measurable.  I've picked up Tai-Chi, and Wang Chung easily on my own as well took two Karate Classes and the Sense was convinced I was well developed in another style already...  Paradoxes often exist when the DSM is consulted for any mental dysfunction/alternative-function really.  I suspect however these divisions are related in large part to what they put their brains through, and in a small part what they were susceptible to all along.  Consider the case of "Halfy" who light his mattress on fire in Florida...  Halfy had halfa brain.  Alot of deformations physically among our criminal populations, largely the result of dietary problems I think (agreeing with Weston A Price Foundation talking points here.)

            Possibly a little big of normalization going on here?  Hmm.  I don't know, but softening the perception of their sick habits is definitely something they would be good at since they as the Doctor claims you don't have to be cunning, when we all know that is exactly what they are.

            Ut-oh buckwheat... This is a pizzagawhatever thread. We need to keep this main thread focused on pizza gate, if you are not specifically focusing on alefantis, podesta, clinton, or related by only a few degrees, than you are intentionally or unintentionally engaging in thread sliding, an intelligence tactic. However, some mods odd subjective hypocrisy only compounds this situation and thread's that should have been sorted out remain on the main forum, only reinforcing the rumors of thiel's ownership in this site. However relevant or altruistic your endeavor is this thread is only contributing to the mess the pizzagate forum has become and should be relegated to the pizzagatewhatever column. Better threads have been straight deleted by these mods. time to clean this circus up.
