            "Might be" is too vague. Find a connection, find a name or names the SPECIFICALLY tie to The Clinton Foundation, or #pizzagate as it exists. Someone's uncle's grandfather listing in old pedo files is interesting, but NOT relevant to the research we are doing. STAY FOCUSED. Pedophilia is worldwide and ancient. #pizzagate is a VERY SPECIFIC situation. Don't muddy the waters by pulling up every pedo situation from the past, UNLESS you can SPECIFICALLY tie it to #pizzagate.

            We KNOW this stuff gets covered up. It has been going on for years, around the globe. Keep your submissions ON TOPIC.

             These people are in the Washington crowd. This is not a snapshot of an event, this is a growing ring over the years. I was hoping that someone has stumbled onto a name or a company they saw in their research that links the past to the present, AND we should be aware of what depths they will go, to kill an investigation. I suggest you review the information and watch the video ( 1 hour long), My post has not been up that long , You did not look at the information. I suggest you do before you declare it is not relevant.

              We KNOW the depths they will go to. They KILL to hide what they do. They HIDE in PLAIN SIGHT.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am not dismissing the importance of the Franklin cover-up. It, like the Operation Flicker cover up of 5000 Pentagon pedophiles, is an important reminder that this behavior is extremely wide-spread, and fiercely guarded and hidden. BUT, that does not mean that either of them are SPECIFICALLY related to #pizzagate. The keyword here is SPECIFICALLY.
             </p>
             <p>
              We KNOW the depths they will go to. That is NOT an issue, here. I HAVE looked over the information, and read about it days ago, along with Operation Flicker. And again, there is no DIRECT connection to #pizzagate (so far, at least). Unless you can provide SPECIFIC correlation beyond "the depths they go to in order to cover it up," or SPECIFIC names, NOT "might be linked," it IS irrelevant to the situation at hand, HERE.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Pentagon is in the "Washington crowd," too. But without SPECIFIC names to tie the two together, Operation Flicker is likewise, irrelevant.
             </p>
             <p>
              I respectfully suggest you try to differentiate between ALL past pedophilia cases and THIS one. ANY other investigations NEED to be DIRECTLY tied to #pizzagate in order to be relevant. No "might be linked" or vague tie ins. STAY FOCUSED.

               This is a worldwide user investigation, INFORMATION from any source that can provide links to others is important. Maybe someone has seen a name,of a business or a person from a past event that makes a connection to the present, It is how we connect the dots... INFORMATION. As for this site I suppose we are not required to read every post just those we are interested in. I choose what direction/lead I want to chase. If one person finds the information of use and finds a connection then that helps the cause. Dissing past cases (because YOU do not find it relevant) that may have links to current events seems to inhibit potential leads. We have a lot of people looking at this, why shut down information that someone might pop up and provide a connection from a past investigation to the present? Pedophiles do not just stop, its ingrained in their being (a need) they will find a way to do it again!

               <p>
                This is a WORLD WIDE user investigation. YES.
INFORMATION SPECIFICALLY connected to #pizzagate is important. The KEY WORD is "SPECIFICALLY."
               </p>
               <p>
                NOT "interesting but unrelated." NOT "possibly," or "maybe," or "might be," related. SPECIFICALLY. 
We are not interested in names that someone MAYBE can connect. SPECIFICALLY. Two entirely different concepts.
               </p>
               <p>
                You NEED to understand the difference, and you need to ACCEPT the rules of THIS situation, in THIS SPECIFIC subverse.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's NOT that hard, and the RULES apply to US ALL, not just you. So PLEASE, stop wasting your valuable energy arguing something that you cannot change. STAY FOCUSED, and stop trying to inject MAYBEs into the discussion.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes, you are free to investigate ANYTHING you choose. But you are NOT free to post irrelevant and unrelated shit that you find, simply because you find it interesting, or think MAYBE it is relevant. If it is relevant, it is because it SPECIFICALLY relates to #pizzagate.  What part of SPECIFICALLY do you not comprehend, here?
UNRELATED investigations will most likely be deleted. Regardless how hard you try to squeeze that square peg into a round hole. STAY FOCUSED.

                  But the facts I am presenting to you are common knowledge. I have told the moderators to most freely tell ME to STFU, Censor, or delete any and everything I post at THEIR discretion... And I appear to still be here, with a steadily climbing upvote count. So, all in all, what I am saying must not be too far off the "official" subverse mark.

                   I am not here for up votes (if i was I MAY have already down voted your 3 posts, but i have not and will not). I am here to expose this horrific ring. Most are here because they found something they did not know and want to share with others. You seem to be well informed on the subject. We need more helping the cause and we should not be discouraging them.The more eyes on this the better. I believe with enough research there are links in what I posted, it will take digging, The more digging the better. I have no clue if you researched every name and company/government department in my post I made. I am digging and I hope others read it and dig too. This is how we crack this wide open, the links, Unless there is a time limit on pedo activity that you deem not within some written or unwritten rule, please let me/us know.. As I have stated prior, these people have "a need". They can get caught, serve time, they ALWAYS resurface doing the same thing, HARMING KIDS. On that point we need INFORMATION and WE NEED TO DIG! They never stop.

                    I agree with SO much of what you just wrote. BUT, you are so conveniently glossing over the main point here, which is SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO #pizzagate.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    NOT obtuse references to past investigations of OTHER pedophile incidents. #PIZZAGATE, which involves a fairly specific group of people relating to a fairly specific incidence of pedophila. NOT Boys town. NOT Operation Flicka. #PIZZAGATE.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    TIME Limits are irrelevant, and not germane to this discussion. Please do not demean your very valid points with ridiculous theorizing. It is not so much a matter of time, as it is one of RELEVANCY. As you well know, pedophilia is nothing new, and neither are cover ups, particularly within governments.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    THIS "citizen investigation," for lack of a better description, is FOCUSED on the SPECIFIC TOPIC and MATTER of #Pizzagate. ALL the other pedophilia in the entire world still exists, still is most horrendous, and still needs to be addressed. THIS IS NOT THE TIME OR PLACE FOR IT. THIS subverse is SPECIFIC. THIS subverse has SIMPLE RULES that contributions NEED to be SPECIFICALLY RELATED to #pizzagate.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    WHY are you SO insistent that ALL pedophiles MUST be included in this investigation? The RULES are for us ALL. You, me, and anyone else participating. NO off-topic bullshit. NO matter if it pedophilia or not. If NOT SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO #pizzagate, it DOES NOT BELONG HERE. End of chat. There is nothing more to be said.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You can go on forever about all the pedophilia going on, or the cover ups, or anything else. But THIS SUBFORUM has a SPECIFIC  TOPIC relating to pedophilia, #pizzagate. I cannot for the life of me understand how you are dense enough to not understand the way this works. The rules are there, in simple words. SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO #pizzagate. NO argument you can come up with is going to change this. The information either SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO #pizzagate, or it doesn't. There IS NO "MAYBE." You truly need to accept what you cannot change. You are truly wasting energies far better put to use helping us, instead of trying to insist that irrelevant and unrelated material is needed here. It is not. No matter how hard you try, you cannot make unrelated material relate. GET OVER YOURSELF.

                     DIG all you like NO ONE is stopping you. BUT DON'T POST IRRELEVANT DIGGINGS WHERE THEY DO NOT BELONG. The Web is a huge place. This is NOT your only option. Dig away, but find the APPROPRIATE place to post your findings. #pizzagate is ONLY for #pizzagate. Just that simple...
