            No offense the only one that looks like a possible torture victim is the full body said to be found in the back of a club, the rest look like visuals from surgeries, not trying to down play this at all, there are fucked up weirdos in this world who get off to gore and death metal.  But idk how many of those images are from tortures.  Just my 2 cents.

             That one looks suspect for sure, the others although they are supposedly medical conditions related to Krokodil abuse and other medically named maladies yet in my sincere opinion are only in reality a symptom of a larger ongoing SADO culture that is being allowed to be accessed by the public. The people that these types of things happens to is not accidental or happenstance, they are being selected and tortured - what the public makes of it and how it can be sold to them is another matter. Often when the world admins put the public on notice with regards to something important, they will include a "softball" of sorts, where they will make it easier to see the truth. The fact that there is one inexplicable torture victim straight out of a snuff film likely tells a greater story with regards to what really is going on with these images and the music outlet that is intertwined with them. It's worth looking into, if these people suffered these horrible things deliberately and intentionally on the part of others for their pleasure and in the hope of gaining empowerment - it needs to be stopped.

            Very bad taste and gory. There is whole genres of metal based around gore and depravity, though the people in these bands are usually just into extreme music and messed up horror movies etc. There's even an element of comedy in there usually, kinda to see how sick you can make the lyrics or how brutal the artwork is. There's a lot of shock value there obviously.

             It doesn't fit within the Globalist agenda to worry about stuff like this.  They're too concerned with making up fake narratives to bring down Trump.  Why would they waste time and resources prosecuting real crimes when there are so many liberal social causes to defend?
            </p>
            <p>
             Ultimately these elite globalists are among the anti-Christian movement, so they embrace satanic activity.
