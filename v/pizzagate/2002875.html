<p>So this &quot;restaurant franchise&quot; called Joseph\'s Bistro Restaurant and Sports bar supposedly has 23,000 locations nationwide. Just to put it in perspective, McDonald\'s has 14,233 locations, and Burger King has 7,277 locations nationwide. When you start to look at the locations of these &quot;restaurants&quot; you will find that they are absolutely everywhere, in apartment buildings, office complexes, malls, law offices, medical establishments, etc.</p>
<p>Here you can look for yourself to see if there are any so-called &quot;Joseph\'s&quot; franchises in your town.
<a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/josephs/">https://www.hourscenter.com/josephs/</a></p>
<p>All of the locations list <a href="www.fiorechiro.com">www.fiorechiro.com</a> as their company website, for a chiropractic office in Maryland.</p>
<p>In my own town there were dozens of these Joseph\'s locations. Some had hours posted, but the schedules are so bizarre there\'s no way it could be a real establishment, such as &quot;Open Thursdays 11:30am - 12:30pm&quot; and other ridiculous times.  None of the locations I looked at had anything to do with a restaurant called Joseph\'s. </p>
<p>Upon investigation I found a <a href="http://thepulsemag.com/wordpress/2007/10/1007-review-joseph%E2%80%99s-bistro-restaurant-sports-bar">review of an actual Joseph’s Bistro</a></p>
<p>The reviewer apparently ate at the Westminster Massachusetts location, which matches up with the <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/josephs/westminster/6638983/">HoursCenter website results.</a> </p>
<p>After a Maps search, I found the supposed location of the restaurant, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.5462811,-71.914492,3a,75y,309.59h,84.64t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srphZvJYMOXRdgoGDzjqStg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">though it looks to be a house that has never been used for such a purpose.</a></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the food that was reviewed by has absolutely nothing do with Joseph\'s listed &quot;menu&quot; which is <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/menu/josephs/">high-end italian themed.</a>  Bernie, the reviewer, ate buffalo wings and biscuits. At first glance you would think that it is simply a different restaurant, however the logo, location, and telephone number used in the review proves that it is in fact the same establishment. </p>
<p>Looked into the reviewer Bernie Whitmore, and found some reviews for restaurants that no longer exist. Granted, these are old reviews and that is not enough cause for concern.</p>

<p>Maybe we can ask Bernie some questions about the location?</p>',

            I looked up a major city in my state
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the addresses house multiple businesses, many that have been dissolved
           </p>
           <p>
            Tried to separate the obvious reference to a man name Joseph
           </p>
           <p>
            3 Hospitals came up
           </p>
           <p>
            St Joseph Hospital, would separate but 2 other hospitals come up, and St Joseph  Milwaukee Hospital Offering 5-Star Critical Care, Close to Home  In addition to nationally-recognized high-risk pregnancy and birthing care,
           </p>
           <p>
            The others are Childrens Hospital and Froedtert Hospital/ Medical College of Wis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flight for Life takes people to Froedtert in southwest Wisconsin
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the addresses are connected to these Hospitals
           </p>
           <p>
            Two I found interesting, A Clinic for acute and chronic kidney diseases and a Clinic for Endocrinologist, hormonal imbalances

            Another 2 listings caught my eye
           </p>
           <p>
            One was for the Federal Building and Court House and an office building which states it has had many Government agencies in there and is directly across the street from Mitchell Airport

           <p>
            with that said, was thinking about  2impendingdoom 1 points (+1|-0) 13 hours ago  
I wonder if this is connected to the hospital's food service/cafeteria, but still all of this is super weird. ..... Maybe vending machines?

            Imagine finding out your next-door neighbor has an incredible talent you never knew about. That's what it's like when most people find out about all of the health care services available at Wheaton Franciscan — St. Joseph Campus in Milwaukee. In addition to nationally-recognized high-risk pregnancy and birthing care,

            It's not a database error. Look at this listing - nothing to do with Joseph, just a private house on the market this year for the first time in 10 years. No reason to be in a business database at all - and there are no business listings on google for this address.

            I suspect you could easily do this search for many of the others.
If it was a database error, a search for "Kate's" or "John's" would yield more results yet it doesn't.
Joseph is not that common a name.

            Checked for my state and allegedly 636 locations for Joseph's Bistro -- 
Allegedly 4 locations in my area -- and telephone numbers listed. 
Certainly, I'm familiar with the area and there are NO Joseph's Bistro's at those locations,
but I will check as to what is there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also strikes me as odd that on the Joseph's "Hours" listing page at right side are "Popular Brands"
           </p>
           <p>
            which include ...
Taco Bell, Little Caesar's, Golden Corral, Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen, Sonic, McDonald's, Chick-Fil, Cici's Pizza, Wendy's, Burger King, GNC, Outback Steakhouse, Subway, Domino's Pizza --
           </p>
           <p>
            Doubt there is any one of them where you couldn't find a Burger consisting of ground up "meat."
           </p>
           <p>
            Dairy Queen is the odd note there -- 
Other than that these are all "Fast Food" restaurants which have risen in popularity since the 60's and 70's?
           </p>
           <p>
            As we know from the youngsters in the Hampstead UK case, they connected some of the activities of the results of the pedophile activities at the "church" location being extended to fast food restaurants in their town.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, I don't know if anyone has come near estimating just how many children over the years of MKULTRA/Monarch would have been missing in that time and seriously don't think that any of them were returned or recovered.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I am thinking about the rise of these fast food restaurants as

            Did anyone else find that under listings for "Menu" and "Hours" there was a listing across from what looks like a "globe icon" which was for www.fiorechiro.com

            ANY generic named sub-folder is auto-populating based on a search engine "scrape" that taps into existing business/professional/individual listings across the entire USA. I've built and deployed tools that do this exact same thing... aside from the fact that mine worked correctly.
           </p>
           <p>
            You could spend days indexing all of the generic sub-folders that would trigger "false positive" listings. And you'll be left with a massive list of businesses and professionals that share one thing in common. A first name.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not a pedo activity map based on generic first names.
           </p>
           <p>
            By all means, keep digging, but, I'm 99.99% certain that you are chasing a database error.

             I checked other businesses that they offer on the hours website and they don't have the same problem...why not?  Why just this one specific (nonexistent) business with this problem?  What other non-existent businesses do they have on that website?  I checked other business that I know exist, and that I know where they do and do not exist, and no problem like this.

              I've explained this about 3 or 4 times now on the threads pertaining to "Joseph's" invisible bistro. It has everything to do with the sub-folder structure used on the CMS/web platform they've developed.
             </p>
             <p>
              For example - let's use the pedo bait franchise of Chuck E. Cheese...
              <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/chuck-e-cheeses/">
               https://www.hourscenter.com/chuck-e-cheeses/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              611 locations in the US. Sounds reasonable. Clicking on a few states I'm familiar with, the results check out. Looks like an accurate listing! Why?
             </p>
             <p>
              Because the sub folder is properly named /chuck-e-cheeses/
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, if you found a man, who had himself listed as a registrant/stakeholder/independent business, who's actual name was "Chuck E. Cheeses" - he would be included.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's go to Joseph's:
              <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/josephs/">
               https://www.hourscenter.com/josephs/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Notice the sub-folder?
             </p>
             <p>
              Bob's:
              <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/bobs-stores/">
               https://www.hourscenter.com/bobs-stores/
              </a>
              (Clicking on links drives you to a random business named "Bob's Custom Heating &amp; Cooling" -
              <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/bobs-custom-heating-and-cooling-brown-city">
               https://www.yelp.com/biz/bobs-custom-heating-and-cooling-brown-city)
              </a>
              )
             </p>
             <p>
              And then there are at least 2 or 3 more generic named sub-folders that also create the confusion/false listings.

               You didn't actually respond to anything I said...nice. As I said, I, and others, have found several of these places that have nothing to do with anyone named Joe, Joseph, Joey...etc.  So,,,Just stop with your BS.  I'm not attacking you because you're critical...I'm attacking you because you're obviously wrong, I see it...you see it...everyone sees it...
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, explain how you know their sub-folder structure (which, even if you do, doesn't explain the businesses that have nothing to do with "Joseph", so don't act like it does.)

                Dude. How dense are you? I specifically said registrant... as in, property owner or address registrant. I've scouted no less than 20 addresses that were in neighborhoods, and guess what?! Every property I found had a listed owner with the first name "Joseph".
               </p>
               <p>
                It doesn't have to be a business based on this database error.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, who's "obviously wrong" now? "Everyone sees it.

             Found another one "Teri Teri", An actual Japanese restaurant. I checked a few of the listings and it led me to a Hair Salon (cant find a Teri name link) and a Lawyers office and then a residence (weirdly also its on the water and boat can access international waters). I cant find any names with these addresses but I am seeing a pattern with these double names from HoursCenter. I have found some sites located near streets with names associated with Podestas emails. I feel this could be a database issue but there are lots of coincidences too. What bugs me is why would the site admin not fix this database, Why pay hosting fees for a garbage site with erroneous info?  Could this be designed to appear like a database error and keep these locations hidden in plain site among the chaos of bad data?
            </p>
            <p>
             I am really trying to find the answers here. So far I'm on the fence.

              I cross referenced the Joseph locations in my city and they are all legit places with the name Jospeh in the title or an owner with the name Joseph.  I know many of the businesses that came up and they aren't pedo fronts- it's just a list of literally all the places in the city with Joseph associated with them

              Accessing the data is the only way to "spike" hosting fees... they get a good bit of traffic surprisingly:
              <a href="https://www.spyfu.com/overview/domain?query=hourscenter.com">
               https://www.spyfu.com/overview/domain?query=hourscenter.com
              </a>
              But, a site where 99% of the people are looking for specific biz listings, likely won't raise any alarms when 1 out of every 10,000 visitors clicks on a random "Joseph" listing that they are not actually looking for. Sidenote: They are relatively new. So, whomever is behind this seemingly terrible site certainly knows how to get some love from Google.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the coincidences add up and amount to something more sinister, then I'll change my story!
             </p>
             <p>
              But so far I'm not seeing much in the way of deeper/darker connections... perhaps I'm being too skeptical?

               A good dose of skeptism is healthy. With this site being new and it's boost from Google makes me wonder if this was setup and launched as a distraction or trap. Or it may simply be a new site that was poorly configured.

                Actually, despite the aesthetic shitty nature of the site... it's structured in a very search friendly manner. They've deployed schema data and have all listings pre-optimized via algorithm. Organic search traction can be had very quickly these days. The "boost" from Google, from what I can surmise, is purely natural and based on the MASSIVE amount of listings they've scraped in a short period of time.
               </p>
               <p>
                Unfortunately, search engines don't scrub/penalize inaccurate listings. The risk is too high for them to alter/delete listings that are actually accurate and appear to be erroneous. One day, if that happens, HoursCenter.com would still have a very high traffic volume. Due to the BS listings not actually being clicked on by real users (because they won't be looking for these random residential/small business listings in almost any scenario)

            I'm looking through these locations in towns I'm very familiar with, because whatever this is, apparently there's tons of them around. So I'm trying to be skeptical thinking its a database error like one goat suggested but from the ones I've looked at, they all have something in common: they're all buildings that you pass by but don't really pay any attention to. Buildings that don't really get a lot of traffic but when its there you don't think twice about it. Bizarre as hell.

            I was looking around on the HoursCenter site and checked listings under the Hot Dog cuisine tag.
Theres a place called
            <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/franks-franks/">
             Frank's Franks
            </a>
            and has 17,574 locations in 51 states.
Checked the locations for an area near me and was shocked so many were listed for a place I have never heard. Who would have 15 hot dog joints in one city. The menu is all about hot dogs and the items have weird names.
Something is going on and i don't think its a database error.
We all know what they mean by "Hot Dog".
I will continue and research the locations listed but i wanted to post my findings so others can check their areas.
The URL for this place listed on HoursCenter is a expired site  www.frankbiggsmra.com
           </p>
           <p>
            <s>
             Also searching for Frank's Franks in a search engine only returns results for the HoursCenter site.
            </s>
            Not sure what happened the first time. Now I am getting results for Franks Franks in search engines and its a roaming food truck and another is a restaurant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe they picked common names for this scheme to blend in and keep hidden.
           </p>
           <p>
            My next location for Franks Franks is a site for launching boats. This waterway can eventually lead to international waters!
           </p>
           <p>
            Come on!!  Theres a Franks Franks in Bastrop, TX and the near cross street is WALNUT.   This is blowing my mind.

            Not sure if it's important, but the website all these locations serve is for a particular chiropractic office (apparently) and they have a section of the website called "Children and Chiropractic"
            <a href="https://www.fiorechiro.com/page/kids-and-chiropractic-video.html">
             https://www.fiorechiro.com/page/kids-and-chiropractic-video.html
            </a>
            It just has a video about how important it is for kids to start chiropracitc services early. They say it starts during pregnancy.

            This is very weird; there are locations on military bases.  I checked a couple that I have been to.  First there are two locations at Tripler Army Medical Center.

            I have never seen these in my time there, but I googled the numbers.  One came up as being an appointment line for a neurology clinic, and the other seems to be connected to, possibly the orthopedic clinic

            One at Fort Campbell, KY (Considered to be in TN on the website) is a dental clinic; I haven't been there for almost a decade, but I am 100% sure there was no restaurant there at the time

Has fucking barred windows too! This is fucked, theres also an old painted heart under the verizon sign! It looks like a prison. There is also a security cam on the back of the building pointing at an barred up service entrance or something. Shady as fuck.

            You guys we are either being played, or there is some glitch in which Joseph is being picked up. Not every Joseph being picked up on that link posted by OP is associated with Pedos ect..
            <br/>

             It could be a list where only say 10% of the 'outlets' supply what you are looking for.  But if you know what you are looking for, you would be able to pick out the 1 in 10.

            Ok, interesting I put in my state,  town ect.
It came up under names of my local hospital, a medical clinic and a diabetic center WTF!
           </p>
           <p>
            *** ok so seems these listings have an association with a person/s with name Joseph!  This has to be some kind of glitch guys! No way all these places are Pedo related.***

               Yeah, not trying to convince anyone really... the last thing I want to do is to deflate a real issue/piece of evidence. But, after spending time on this I just wanted to share the assessment!

                Absolutely!  All assessments and findings should be shared.  You never know where they'll lead.  If I've learned anything from sleuthing missing persons cases for years, it's that.

            so it seems to me that this site is listing any place with Joseph in the name... I investigated the one by me, and the name of the place is the owner's name, and the owner's first name is joseph.  is there any evidence that there is something more nefarious going on here?

            I looked up my local Joseph's Bistro from your link listing their locations. I don't want to go into specifics about the location for fear of being doxxed, but it looks like it is a suite in a hospital. The link you gave me shows they have around a 4 star review with a couple hundred reviews. Doesn't make any freaking sense because I'm very familiar with the area and I've never heard of this place in my life. Who the fuck would go to a hospital to eat italian food? I'm pretty confused.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: I searched Joseph's Bistro on Yelp for my area, and I can't find a single one. But when I pull up the Joseph's from your link in my area, it's listing 30 or more "Joseph's" in my area.

             This is a Joseph's cafe. When I cross reference the address on the hourscenter website, the address on that yelp does not show up. I think that's just a random shitty cafe.

            and realized I ate at Carmellas Italian literally decades ago!  Went to school in Amherst, MA.  This place was NOT located in "Brookfield" on route 9, but in Hadley on route 9 and closed permanently in 2012 it looks like.  So, I don't know what is up with reviewer literally LYING about the location.

            I just got that nauseous feeling when you know that the entire thing is a pedo shell game.  I know exactly where this lead is going.  Except maybe we can do something about this if it is ongoing.

            I will say this - If the FBI or other LE/IC are watching, you better get your asses in gear now and shut it down because they are about to get spooked.

             Guys, its a pedophile database. We've just hit the jackpot. Its how these kiddie fckas communicate - scheming, hubris and their own culture.  This is big. I like what someone said on POL - kidnap one of the degenerates, torture them until they spill the beans, post results.

            So I looked up the Joseph's bistro location in Bastrop TX, a small town near Austin (which has 66 Joseph's location- none of which I have ever seen or heard of) and lo and behold the Joseph's address appears to be the middle of the highway. It also happens to be located 2 blocks from the masonic temple right across the street from a CASA child advocacy center that has a heart within a heart logo.

            I checked my town and found 6 listings.  I checked all addresses for all 6  and found that they were names mostly of medical people, and all had the name JOSEPH in their name....I am wondering if JOSEPH is not a code or an ANCRONYM for something???

            It's a restaurant that went out of business in 2012.

            Your map search is facing the wrong way, the restaurant was across the street. My guess is it's now a Subway and Dunkin' Donuts. From the link above - "Pandiscio's father first bought the building that now houses Subway and Dunkin' Donuts in 1978 and opened the Little Town Hall, changing the name to Joseph's Bistro in 1995."

              This is obviously pure speculation (both the places in my small town are chiropractors too), but aside from dentists, chiropractors also have chairs and, frankly, are expected to get more personal with you than a dentist.  Doctors in general have historically been seen as "leaders" of the community.
