            That's real sick. People let their kids on this "game" unattended all the time. Who knows what could possibly be going on. One more steps toward them normalizing these kind of activities in children's eye. Real sick.

             Exactly!  You wouldn't believe how some are acting as if people are making too big of a deal out of this. ..on the other hand you Would believe it because you clearly are awake!

              My thought is with this "me too" movement, people are so apt to believe claims of sexual assault when it involves a man doing it to a woman, so apt actually that sometimes it's believed when it's not even true. Whereas when kids or adults try to tell people they were ritually abused, even though they all have similar stories, people just can't seem to believe it. Always seemed weird to me.

               You took the words Right out of my mouth!  I feel just as you do and have been saying this and felt appalled for well over a year now!
              </p>
              <p>
               When I covered actual pedo arrests that were verified and an Open Secret, I was very frustrated by the fact that I saw So much virtue signaling in the me too movement and not enough or in many Cases None at all for these innocent children whom adults are Supposed to be the protectors.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now I don't of course condone the actions of harassers and what not, but grown women Do have a choice, children Do Not!
              </p>
              <p>
               Always seemed Beyond weird to me. . .makes me wonder if in some cases it isn't intentional.  Satanic people always work that way Diabolical!
              </p>
              <p>
               In the same manner they practice Rules for Radicals of whatever they are doing, they blame it on the other side.  Wicked, vile people for sure!

             This is the one directly related to roblox

             Another here showing what occurred and how mods say they try to fix it, but interesting how it got by them

            <p>
             Many articles focus on the mother telling the story of her daughter 6 or 7 being invited in and gang raped, heinous enough, there are many other scenes going on that any good parent would Never want their child to see.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5915213/Outrage-7-year-olds-Roblox-avatar-gang-raped-players-virtual-world.html">

            </p>
            <p>
             If this graphic content was able to get through with hackers already, how can roblox guarantee it won't happen again?  There are multiple instances and scenes as would be expected because there is a lot of freedom and people are able to purchase skins, accessories, etc.

            The one comment says something to the effect that parent passwords/logins will give parents control over what their kids can watch on Netflicks. To say the least, I think NOT. smfh, my niece was easily jailbreaking her iPod years ago when she was about 8 years old. Kids understand technology and work with it all the time.
           </p>

            We all know the
            <strong>
             entertainment industry
            </strong>
            is pushing hard to normalize hard core porn of all kinds, and worse. They’ve been doing it over time, and have a long, prolific history of mainstreaming foul language, promiscuity, crude behavior, nudity, and soft porn. And graphic depictions of mutilation, torture, and murder. And there’s nothing we can do to walk any of this back. Too many people love this shit, and too many of the people who understand the gravity are dying off. Big Entertainment is working hard on the high bar of normalizing abnormal sexual behavior and indoctrinating children into ALL of this, and I think it’s more than potential ad buck$ that spurs them on. Someone is investing big into this. Their biggest obstruction is parental control, and they WILL use any means necessary to find their way over, under, and around all obstructions.
           </p>
           <p>
            End rant, I’m preaching to the choir. Love, prayers, and many thanks to you guys here at v pizzagate. NEVER STOP.

             Those who understand who and what we're really fighting. . .the depth the horror know it leads directly to that most wicked, formidable, skilled foe. . .satan.

            </p>
            <p>
             You are right, this agenda has been going on Forever.  They are desperately trying to condition our children and anyone who will listen.  All connected.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is why after their FF in Parkland they started their drum beat of lowering the age for voting.  If they can give kids the ability to make their own decisions, then they can defile and abuse with no one standing in their way. ..at least while on this plane of existence.

             Everyone must stay vigilant, fight and inform others.  I actually got this comment on a board, but it is a board where a mod was found to be a traitor so not really surprising.  Traitors lurk and mix among is just as Alice Bailey instigated into the bible believing churches.
            </p>
            <p>
             First the commenter states this in a maga type board which many GA people on that platform sub to concerning this same post,
             <em>
              I'm not sure you understand what Roblox is. It's practically a platform for user-generated games using their engine. There's tens of thousands.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             My response,
Yes, it's a game marketed to children. My kids used to play. I've seen it. There are sources where the parents are telling you what they have witnessed and roblox doesn't deny it, nor do they deny it goes against their guidelines, yet it isn't really being controlled.
            </p>
            <p>
             Parents absolutely should be the first line of defense, but don't market a platform to kids, if you can't control safety concerns. Just my opinion as kids are kids only once.
            </p>
            <p>
             He keeps coming back with (apparently hung up on the platform aspect)  as it matters what you want to focus on. . .evil is preying upon children,
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              You keep calling it a game.

            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              It is a platform. It's like YouTube, but for games, and using their own editor. There will always be assholes who slip through administration/moderation nets. What exactly is your point?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             I just left it at,
The point is it is marketed to kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             What exactly is your issue with people warning parents who may be unsuspecting?
            </p>
            <p>
             Kids, especially those young, see it as a game and a place to hang out.
