<p>Before I go into the details I want to ask a question. If you were going to get into the human trafficking business, what types of operational support would you require?</p>
<ul>
<li>Trucking / Shipping to transport persons / organs / etc.</li>
<li>Warehousing to store product</li>
<li>Travel agency services to move product that can’t be put on ice or otherwise shipped</li>
<li>Immigration and other Legal support for navigating Customs and potentially falsifying documentation</li>
<li>Shell businesses with easily forged books for laundering proceeds</li>
<li>Tax / Accounting services to help launder the proceeds</li>
<li>Refrigeration services for keeping organs at optimal temperatures</li>
</ul>
<p>You would need all of these. And it would be best if you have all under one owner or a small circle ownership to keep your dirty business on the down low. Of course, you would also need these operations to appear publicly as legitimate businesses.</p>
<p>Please keep that in mind as you read.</p>
<p>I did not do an exhaustive search of the World Corp website. Like everyone else, I watched the horrible video that has now been analyzed and reported upon. I watched some other videos, but the material was just too bizarre / traumatizing so I turned to the images page.
Most are nonsensical, but I found one image that has some information - which I have not seen discussed so far. <a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/images/wc655.png">http://worldcorpo.net/content/images/wc655.png</a> / <a href="http://archive.is/Qz75o">http://archive.is/Qz75o</a></p>
<p>In the linked PDF, I will discuss my theory (which is fully cited) that information in that image may reveal a human trafficking network. </p>

<li>Another researcher indicated that there may be prior reports against which these locations can be cross-referenced (e.g., the Ted Gunderson\'s many reports <a href="http://tedgunderson.info/index%20-%20copy%20-%20copy%20-%20copy.htm">http://tedgunderson.info/index%20-%20copy%20-%20copy%20-%20copy.htm)</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p>I posted this previously and struggled with issues around anonymity and file persistence (or the lack thereof). As a result, I have chosen to simply link as a PDF on filedropper. If anyone has a better suggestion for sites to drop anon files, please share.</p>
<p>Please note this research is fairly technical and will likely bore the casual investigator. Additionally, before somebody comes along complaining that this is speculative and circumstantial - remember that the entire Pizzagate theory is based on speculation and circumstantial evidence. However, when it all starts to point to a conclusion, it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>I\'d appreciate your thoughtful inputs.</p>',

              I'm busy with the face correction I hope it works ..but I need some time ;)  If it is a chinese restaurant than we have possibly to deal 
with the chinese triad. Be carefull because they are big deal and very difficult to catch. Life means nothing to them and the chinese people are very afraid of them.
