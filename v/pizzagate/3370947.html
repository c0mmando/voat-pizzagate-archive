            These next wiki's show the run don of the various businesses and you can see Einsmann looks like he deals in logistics. You can see his phd's and that verifies it more so. He's a backdrop thinker. Setting up whatever it is. From food to textiles, to cyber security, to data processing, to the logistics of procuring hydrocarbons from petrol.

            This last one is one I find interesting. No wikipedia entry on it. The company is almost 20 and deals in media. Yet no wikipedia entry? I'm guessing this one goes into British Intelligence and thi is where I stop.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Camelot began as a consortium which had to fight many rivals to win the role of being the National Lottery controller. The groups making up the consortium were International Computers Limited (ICL), Racal, Cadbury Schweppes , De La Rue and GTECH Corporation. After they won the original bid in 1994, the year the National Lottery started, Camelot executives were criticised by Labour for their desire for big salaries and bonuses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Camelot has been operating it for 24 years. However, serious challenges have been made by Richard Branson, in 2000, and in 2017 media mogul Richard Desmond was planning a takeover bid too. As of 2010, Camelot has been owned by
