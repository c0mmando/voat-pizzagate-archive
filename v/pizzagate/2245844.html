<h1>Melanie Morgan: After TV appearance, Al Franken harassed me too</h1>
<p>In response to the disturbing allegations made against Franken, Media Equalizer and Media Equality Project Co-Founder Melanie Morgan has come forward to recall her own frightening encounter, sparked by a seemingly-mundane and even obscure topic of political disagreement.</p>
<p>Morgan, who was a ABC Radio talk show host for KSFO / San Francisco at the time, appeared August 19, 2000 on ABC’s late night show Politically Incorrect.</p>
<p>She was joined by Franken, William Baldwin, and then-Colorado Lt. Governor Joe Rogers on the panel.</p>
<p>Morgan and Franken had a dispute over the OMB’s budget numbers.</p>
<p>“I was invited and unaware of who his guests were going to be that night. I’ve since learned that though few know this, Al Franken was actually a writer for the show,” Morgan said.</p>
<p>“I made a statement about the budget numbers, Franken challenged me, I challenged him back. It was about spending priorities, actually just a mundane discussion. But he obsessed over it.”</p>
<p>After the show, Morgan said Franken wouldn’t leave her alone, insisting on continuing the argument.</p>
<p>“He approached me backstage, angrily called me out on those numbers and insisted he would prove he was right. He wouldn’t leave me alone, he kept following me. As a woman, his presence and proximity to me felt very threatening and intimindating.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize his creepy behavior after the show meant it would continue in the days to come.</p>
<p>“He approached Carol, the show’s producer and demanded my home phone number, which was a clear violation of network protocol. I had thought that was the end of the story and was shocked when he started calling my home, badgering me repeatedly.</p>
<p>“I became fearful and called Carol to complain and asked her to tell him to back off. But he made another call after that. I thought that he might end up stalking me at my home in Northern California, it was that bad.</p>
<p>“By the third phone call I was outraged and terrified, as he is really disturbed,” Morgan recounted.</p>
<p>Morgan said Franken finally left her alone, but only after she pushed back and threatened “to call the police and make a report that he was harassing me.” </p>
<p>To this day, she says she is haunted by it: “I never forgot that experience and it informed me of his lack of character and obsessive personality. I believe every word Leann wrote.”</p>

            This is not the "storm" I wanted.  While it may be fun to watch his career go down the tubes as he embibes a dose of his own meds, it's not really the storm we were promised.  What does adults coming forward about questionable predator behavior have anything to do with this so supposed underground coup against the satanic elites?

             Hollywood is a major contributor to the political process through fundraising and messaging and influence of the mainstream group-think. but this ends if they are mired in their own self inflicted crap.

             This is part of it. Don't you remember that he's the one that was a host at Rob Reiner's comedy roast. Franken is the one that told all the pedo jokes about him being anally raped.

             He's friends with Rob Reiner and Reiner has always been on the radar. Then there's the pic of Franken in diapers? So weird.

              ok thanks. I needed that comment.  Hope is important, but I'm tired of getting excited about little things.  I thought it was hilarious that immediately after the news broke that his buddy Schumer called for an ethics investigation on him.  It all just reeks of desperation.

                I've been a silent pizza nerd and lurker since the hunt was still going down on reddit.  I still vividly remember some of the earlier suspected shills lol.  I just changed my user name caz I'm a paranoid single woman living alone in DC.  I've been woke for years, but it's recently been a hell of a roller coaster.

                      he is not a good poster...  ever notice how his alt account backslaps and high fives him ?  Does that concern you?  After all, we are talking about the ritual sacrifice and rape of small children.  Getting pumped up over Al Franken going down and self congratulating is sickening.  It's fucking sickening.

                       youre making a mistake. You're not the only one who has a new alt. mp changed names a month ago too. you never would said these things about her old id. who else posted like this? you'll figure it out. we are all here working together. and you know faggot is for 4chan. no one use that here.

                         because I know who mp was, and its not the same account as 2a. mp had a lot a support as her old incarnation so anyone else who recognizes who this is will quickly chime in as they used to with her old name, she doesn't need 2 concurrent accounts. she does a lot of digging on corrupt politicians.  the nefarious element here is m falcon and the other mods.

             I believe the implication is that because she was  female he reacted that way. Had she been a man, he wouldn't have tried the intimidating behavior.

             That's what I got out of it. You can watch the interview at 5:00 was it? Maybe she'll elaborate.

             I agree that it is only indirectly related the way it's been written. However, I think we have an opportunity to bend this to fit our own concerns. This image is perfect ammo for meme warfare. It captures the PG premise that depraved US elites abuse our military might to feed their own avarice and lust. I am leaving this up for now for the OP to try to edit along with my meme request.

               Franken has made statements elsewhere demonstrating a cavalier attitude towards the subject, which I asked SecondAmendment to add. He's also pals with several, and was raised to his position by the Cabal, despite being a reprobate. We'll see what SA comes up with.

             I think your heart is in the right place and you want to focus the sub, but I think this post is indirectly relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
             To me, the core of Pizzagate isn't a specific Italian food restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
             The core of this sub is the idea of Pedogate: a system of sex trafficking and leverage that very powerful behind the scenes figures use to control the household names of politicians (and other elite media figures) who we all know and despise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Illustrating that these people are immense hypocrites and that despite talking about things like protecting women, most of them do that and know about it and stay silent, is a core way of helping people understand that they've been misled.
            </p>
            <p>
             It might be circumstantial evidence, but I think is closer to relevant than much of the content on here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once people understand that Washington and Hollywood and New York and other power centers are filled with creeps, it becomes easier for people to question what they've been told about a lot of things.

             Hey, remember that thing we've been doing for the past year? Can you tell me how far it has brought us? We need to start spreading information like this to soften the public opinion towards PG because otherwise we won't get anywhere. We tell them about the pizza later.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you also not remember being told that if we focus on trying to get the elites taken down for pizza we'll miss our opportunity and instead indirectly protect them? These posts are necessary, don't try and sabotage one of our hardest working researchers.

               The MSM narrative? None of the main media outlets are covering this aside from about Roy Moore, which tells me they're all guilty aside from Roy Moore. If he's diverting our attention, tell us where to look instead. Every time there's a distraction it's because something bigger is happening in the background, so tell me which direction to take and I'll go for it. Otherwise try and help the cause, not hinder it.

                GEE... maybe destroying JOE AND JILL BIDEN should be on the front burner right now..  After all, she runs a charity that deals with children in Haiti and he and Lady GAGA are starting an abuse foundation.

                 Biden's in the limelight more than
                 <em>
                  anyone
                 </em>
                 else at the moment. I was thinking about making another post on him yesterday but decided everyone had heard enough of him by now - besides, the biggest accusations are already out there by now (including how he touches kids in front of the media), so it's a matter of watching and waiting to see what happens to him from now on.

                  spread those videos far and wide... connect him to Lady Gaga and spirit cooking...  don't get bored of a topic in a day.  Joe Biden is the front runner for 2020 and needs to be systematically destroyed and his actions connected to Barack Obama..

                   That is true actually, I was somewhat shaken by the idea of him running. However, posts of Biden here are mostly the same thing. The videos of him grabbing kids are everywhere and won't be news to anyone. I just don't see what kind of information could be brought to the table that hasn't been said before.

             I can see your point, but maybe this will turn out like Pedowood.  You know, first the adults and then the minors.  First people have to believe that there is abuse among the elite politicians and then when the shock sinks in, then they will be able to believe the pedophelia.  We can at least hope?  Idk, at least that is what I am banking on.  Yes, this stuff is sleazy but maybe it will lead to that Pot of Gold.  Sorry, I am known to look through Rose Colored Glasses.

              Also I don't see the point of diverting our attention right now. We haven't made any kind of huge discovery that would need to be concealed, so getting every politician arrested would appear to be counter productive at the moment on their side.
