<p>Here\'s an article about the LGBTQ activist and a targeted Christian bakery which was taken to court: <a href="http://www.christiandoctrine.com/in-the-news/persecution-of-christians/1444-the-asher-cake-a-message-for-the-timid-and-weak-kneed">http://www.christiandoctrine.com/in-the-news/persecution-of-christians/1444-the-asher-cake-a-message-for-the-timid-and-weak-kneed</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘A judge has ruled that a Christian-run bakery discriminated against a gay customer by refusing to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan. Asher’s Baking Company, based in County Antrim, was taken to court by [sodomite activist] Gareth Lee…. A Belfast judge said, as a business, Ashers was not exempt from discrimination law and they have had to pay damages of £500’</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that a tradesman is being forced to make a product that he is ill – equipped to produce: a waste product. Ashers produce pure, Christian cakes not ones with offensive messages written on them. After the Sodomites, who else will be turning up on Ashers’ door steps? Perhaps those who want to celebrate adultery, Satanism, transsexuality, paedophilia, necrophilia, zoophilia, polyamory, incest polygamy and Islam will also want their slice of the cake?</p>
<p>What if a Muslim were to demand of a Christian Butcher that he produce a piece of Halal meat, involving a Mullah praying over the animal whilst its throat is slit? What about the rights of the Christian Butcher to protect his faith? This is what we call in the trade dhimmitude [2]. We would call it a form of racism to allow one ethnic minority to force their values and morality onto another; and so it is in this case. And since the gays claim they were born gay, they are creating a form of apartheid, whereby they intend to shut down, one by one any born again, Christian minority.</p>
<p>Christian foster parents like Mr and Mrs Owen and Eunice Johns who in addition to raising their own family have raised many foster children were, because of their Christian faith, deemed an infection by lesbian QC, Karon Monaghan, working on behalf of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Derby City Council Social Services</p>

            Judd was a member of the Commission on Global Governance. The Commission was established in 1992 with the full support of United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. It produced a report containing many controversial proposals ‘Our Global Neighbourhood’ in 1995.
            <strong>
             Sitting alongside Lord Judd in the Commission was Maurice Strong
            </strong>
            . Strong’s appointment as Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Environment and Development—best known as the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 had resulted in the UNs Agenda 21 programme being implemented by all states belonging to the UN system of Governance including the UK.

             The inquiry said it had "recently become very concerned about aspects of Ben Emmerson QC's leadership" of his team and he had been suspended so these could be properly investigated.

              Child abuse inquiry member: 'I was silenced in 2015 to ensure Theresa May could become Prime Minister'
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A child abuse survivor who served on the panel of the Government's independent inquiry has told talkRADIO she was silenced to ensure Theresa May could become Prime Minister.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sharon Evans, who also runs the charity Dot Com, told John Nicolson the child abuse inquiry was all about controlling information, and
              <strong>
               she fears the Grenfell Tower inquiry will proceed along the same lines
              </strong>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              She continued: "I was taken to one side and it was made clear to me, I was told that Theresa May was going to be the Prime Minister, this inquiry was going to be part of this, and that if I didn't toe the line and do I was told, if I tried to get information out, I would be discredited by her advisors."
             </p>
             <p>
              She went on to allege that this warning was issued by the inquiry's QC, Ben Emmerson, who served as a go-between between May and the inquiry team.

...
England is a vassal of rome by treaty ...that is bankrupted by the venetian merchants since 1500s...
The legal system of jurisprudence is a cover for the debt system...we are volantarily stuck in a big brother virtual reality show....enticed by the game that as its inception reduces and makes scarce the energy of humans ...this artificial scarcity is what creates the chaos...just s they show us in their big brother series...
We sell our credit to this debt game ..we can get out of HER by starving her at an individual level by reducing debt..
U havent lost ur country ...u just sell it off to the lowest denominator , the debt banking system..
U have only one option ...the other option is to live with this multi headed monster we feed...
