            Richard Branson went to fancypants prestigious British boarding school "Stowe" where every young boy is anally raped by age 13.
           </p>
           <p>
            Source: Three guys I met in London, slightly younger than Branson, who had all gone to Stowe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: fun article on Stowe. Doesnt the headmaster look like a total creep?

            More info about Richard Branson in this long article:

             http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2283172/Richard-Branso-Mother-Eve-reveals-prouder-son.html

            Mother eve Branson talks about Richard:
           </p>
           <p>
            We later found out that he’d almost been expelled for climbing late one night through the bedroom window of the headmaster’s daughter.
           </p>
           <h2>
            I gather Charlotte, an attractive 18-year-old, had taken quite a fancy to Richard, aged 12. Their illicit rendezvous came to an inglorious end when he was spotted sliding down a drainpipe and running across the playing fields.
           </h2>
           <p>
            -
In the end, there were seven issues of The Student magazine, which launched in 1968, with feature articles such as ‘Easy Sex — Not So Easy Sex’ and ‘White Slavery Today’.  (Richards magazine)
           </p>
           <h2>
            Some of the glossy covers were explicit even for the time: one was a somewhat shocking picture of a beautiful young girl, naked and pregnant, kneeling sideways.
           </h2>
           <p>
            -
Trying to persuade Richard to find a proper job was a waste of breath. In 1971, we were relieved when he appeared to have started a harmless enterprise — selling pop records through his Virgin mail order company. Little did we know that it would nearly prove his undoing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was on holiday in Menorca when I received an urgent phone call from Richard. As soon as he heard my voice, he broke down. Aged 21, he’d been arrested and wanted me to come home immediately.
            <br/>
            It was a devastating blow. I felt sick, angry and fearful. And I wasn’t all that sympathetic: I told him to pull himself together and be a man.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was only on my return that I learned what had happened. Richard had devised a clever and entirely illegal scheme to avoid purchase tax on records.
           </p>
           <h2>
            -
           </h2>
           <p>
            Customs had finally caught up with him. He’d been taken to Dover police station, where he’d spent the night in custody and been charged under the Customs &amp; Excise Act of 1952. I was mortified — not least because Ted and I held positions in the legal system.
           </p>
           <p>
            -
           </p>
           <h2>
            -A lengthy correspondence ensued between Ted and the authorities: they finally agreed to drop the charge if Richard paid £15,000 immediately and a further £45,000 fine over the next three years.
           </h2>
           <p>
            -
           </p>
           <p>
            With financial help from Ted’s sister Joyce, Richard managed to avoid having a criminal record.
It was the best lesson he could have learned. After what we’d been through, I felt confident he was never going to break the law again.

            It's more than a vacation, I guarantee it. They're probably not banging any underage boys or anything, but I bet they are having a brainstorming session on how to reverse the damage to the globalist agenda caused by Trump and how to squash the scandals that are being exposed. They still think they can win this. Obama has grand plans of becoming the Secretary General of the UN.

              nice, actually there are several videos on youtube suggesting that the Dr. who delivered the girls is actually the mother and the father is a big real estate guy. watch the videos and the kids even look like the parents. Sasha was noticeably missing during the end of this (terrorist, muslim, pedo's term) and I predict Sasha figured it out and is not happy.  Can you imagine living with this CIA, homo and having a Tranny, racist mother and THEN finding out they are not even your parents.

               Ive seen the video ;-)  The girls look EXACTLY like them,its uncanny. Do you think, obamafag1, most people will start to believe the Obama hoax in 2017 and beyond? It's getting really tiring being the only red pill in a room full of dummies.

                smokemirrios - First of all thank you for asking for my humble opinion, I am just a concerned citizen who will do whatever it takes to stop these atrocious crimes against children. I will answer your second question first.   I am in the same situation living in LA and working in media and entertainment. In the past few months because of my work  I have met Snoop, George Lopez, DL Hugely, Mayor Eric Garcetti  and many others so you can imagine how hard it is for me having to interact with these types of liberal hacks. I also attacked Hillary on a LinkedIn, posting on a post where she is "an Influencer" so that posting received thousands of responses and after I attacked her with Pizzagate stuff the very next day a DEA agent in Columbia viewed my LinkedIn profile.
               </p>
               <p>
                This agent is in Columbia and at this time (October) I had just heard of pizzagate and was super pissed and had no idea about the Colombian connection with the agent until I googled the agents name and found out this agent is involved with lots of cases in Haiti. (I pray the agent is a white hat because they have my name, work info etc.  and yes it probably wasn't the smartest thing I have done but its too late).  I now carry a 9 mm 24/7. Additionally, I was an FBI informant about 8 years ago on a underage child trafficking ring but at that time I had NO idea the magnitude of this sick shit.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sorry for the long story but I wanted to answer your question but also wanted to share with you what I deal with as well so you know you are not alone. To answer your second question:  I could FUCKING care less about the left and what these morons think. We already know CNN is preparing a "position" once the arrest start happening.  At the end of the day. I am doing as much as possible, to expose and tell non-believers about these atrocities being committed by our elected officials and our "government".
               </p>
               <p>
                I am on my 4th twitter account in 3 months because Jake Dorsey AKA pedo boy, has shut them all down and I just create a new one. I will lay down my life to protect these children and I sleep well at night (with my 9 mm next to me). All we can do is all we can do and worrying about others and others opinions doesn't work for me because THEY have to wake up on their own... we can't make them. I truly believe this " New liberal" ideology is a fucking psychosis, these fucking people really are insane with these immigration positions, sanctuary cities, etc. I can only do my best  and keep in mind each day that children are being raped, trafficked, tortured, and eating by the likes of Hillary Clinton.  My blood is boiling now having to type this just thinking about her and the subhuman satanic fucks like her, the Pope and royals who kill , torture and EAT children.  My opinion to the first part of your question is (yes they look exactly like their real parents) but as I mentioned there is a "psychosis" affecting a large percent of the population and God only knows how many will wake up but I do know that I will do all I can to wake people up by any means I have available. Sorry for sloppiness, typos etc as I am at work.  Have a blessed day ;)

            Edit: Richard Branson's mother, Eve Branson is on the board of directors for international center for missing and exploited children. ICMEC is a offshoot of the NCMEC. Her wiki page states:
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout her life, Branson has been a child welfare advocate. She established the Eve Branson Foundation and currently serves as director. This charitable organisation provides communities in Morocco with income-generating projects and training.[5]

            Branson is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children ("ICMEC"), the goal of which is to help find missing children, and to stop the exploitation of children.[9][10] She was a founding member of ICMEC's Board of Directors in 1999, seeking to generate awareness of the Centre's work, and her son Richard was ICMEC's founding sponsor.[10][11]

            One of Britain's highest-profile billionaires, Richard Branson owes his fortune to a conglomerate of businesses bearing the Virgin brand, many of which he no longer controls. Among his more famous exits: the sale of Virgin Records for $1 billion in 1992, which reportedly made Branson run down London's Ladbroke Grove crying. He still has dozens of business ventures, though, including financial services firm Virgin Money and Virgin airlines based in the U. K., America and Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of his best-known projects -- private spaceflight company Virgin Galactic -- faced a setback in October 2014 when one of its spaceships exploded in mid-air, killing a test pilot and injuring another. Still, Branson continues to develop rocket-powered planes with the goal of transporting tourists to space. In 2015 he and private equity firm CVC Capital Partners sold around 80% of the Virgin Active health club chain to South African tycoon Christo Wiese's company, Brait SA. Branson also announced Virgin Cruises, which is which is set to launch in 2020. He lives on Necker Island, the British Virgin Islands retreat he bought in 1978 for $180,000.

            Branson's place is called Necker Island. I saw it featured on a show years ago he has celebrity guests visit it, so far as I know, none have mentioned underage sex, and his airline is called VIRGIN, not LOLITA. In retrospect it is maybe a direct contrast to Epstein, but the way things are going, if allegations or evidence against Branson shows up, it will not be surprising. His VIRGIN mobile phone business is kind of geared towards kids though, but maybe he just thinks its better market strategy because kids wont buy stuff geared towards granny but granny has no problem buying kid stuff (think KIA soule and other cube shaped cars, they are marketed toward youth but old people like them for the low floor and seat access.)
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Obama going there? A vacation invitation to a Caribbean island with a billionaire who has tons of toys in February is a no brainer.  I doubt the proximity is an issue, it is on the other side of the BVIs from Einsteins place, they aren't tripping over each other, and if Obama is looking for kiddie sex, getting it at Epsteins sounds really stupid at this point, he must know of the connotations, nobodys that stupid. Besides, isn't Epstein the Clintons friends and Obama hates the Clintons (so I've heard).
           </p>

            EDIT: okay if all this other stuff about branson is true, errgghhh. is anybody not a pedofucker????

               I'm so sick of people's using the race card too. Now the liberals think anybody that doesn't believe like them are racist. So if you are white, you have white priveledge. Racism was improving so much until Obama and people like Soros wanted everyone to turn on each other. That is why Soros funded BLM. That's why the media pushed hatred towards cops. Now feminist groups. They want us all out of control so they could put heavier laws on us or do martial law. Now that Trump won, they are pushing it to make him look bad and look like it's all of his fault. Anyway, lol. What I meant about Michelle is that it's hard to imagine her being evil. Knowing that children are being trafficked. Or maybe she participates. Some of these people it's just so hard to imagine. I guess if you have a normal mind, you're blind to it.

            They seemed mighty chummy in the pictures.  Branson has always struck me as an elite devient pervert.  And my god does Obama do anything but vacation.  Hawaii at Christmas, Palm Springs, Martha's Vineyard, now island hopping with Branson.

             He is still on the payroll. They will be using him to pop his head in now and then and tell the public he understands if they want to disobey Trump. We may never be rid of him.

              When you go to the beach you don't bring sand. In obama's case, when you have dick at home you don't bring it when you are banging under age boys.
