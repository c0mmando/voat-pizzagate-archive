<p>Here is a post containing the anonymous video: </p>

<p>What I found curious in the video was the strong connection between Epstein and Leslie Wexner that I haven\'t seen discussed here.</p>
<p>The anonymous video also goes into detail about a secret group Epstein, Wexner and powerful elites are part of called <strong>The Clothing Shop Network</strong>. The video claims this secret group is involved with much of what is being discussed here.</p>
<p>Leslie Wexner is chairman and CEO of L Brands, formerly Limited Brands. Limited, Bath and Body Works, Victoria\'s Secret and more. Probably why the name The Clothing Shop Network.</p>

<p>I found another article in New York Magazine that details more about Epstein\'s relationship with Wexner. </p>

<p>Another focus of curiosity is the relationship that Epstein has with his patron and mentor Leslie Wexner, founder and chairman of the Columbus, Ohio–based Limited chain of women\'s-clothing stores.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wexner, who is said to be worth more than $2.5 billion by Forbes, became an Epstein client in 1987. &quot;It\'s a weird relationship,&quot; says another Wall Streeter who knows Epstein. &quot;It\'s just not typical for someone of such enormous wealth to all of a sudden give his money to some guy most people have never heard of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the secrecy that envelops Epstein\'s client list, some have speculated that Wexner is the primary source of Epstein\'s lavish life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epstein\' s current residence in Manhattan -- a 45,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on East 71st Street -- was originally bought by Wexner for $13 million in 1989. Wexner poured many millions into a full gut renovation, then turned it over to Epstein in 1995 after he got married. One story has Epstein paying only a dollar for it, though others say he paid full market price, which would have been in the neighborhood of $20 million. Epstein then undertook his own $10 million gut renovation (special features: closed-circuit TV and a heated sidewalk in front of the house for melting snow), saying to friends: &quot;I don\'t want to live in another person\'s house.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epstein also owned a grand house (he has since sold it) near Wexner\'s opulent manse at the center of the Limited magnate\'s high-end housing development in New Albany, Ohio. New Albany was a lush sprawl of farmland on the outskirts of Columbus that Wexner, starting in 1988, turned into a rich village of multimillion-dollar Georgian homes surrounding a Jack Nicklaus–designed golf course. It was a massive development project, financed largely by Wexner himself. Epstein was a general partner in the real-estate holding company, called New Albany Property, despite putting only a few million dollars of capital into the project.</p>

<p>....</p>
<p>It may be fruitful to look into the Epstein and Wexner connection as well as The Clothing Shop Network.</p>',

            Anonymous in this case was sending a message to Bill reminding him they have the video. Also note that Anonymous here is the Mossad or the KGB or the CIA it doesn't matter who they are the important thing was the message to Bubba and the threat to release it might have signaled he has to pay more to keep the video under wraps. That's how they chose to communicate to Bill this time.

            The videos of powerful people raping kids certainly exist but they are far more valuable if they are never divulged to the world. If the video of Bill Clinton raping a 13 year old girl were ever released then there is no more profit to be gotten from it. Bill would commit suicide then he's gone and you can't squeeze him for any more money. Much smarter to keep the videos secret to make sure your victim makes his monthly payments to your bank account on time. Bill probably has to pay a million dollars a month maybe 2 or 3 million bucks a month to keep the videos under lock and key. The same goes for every other power player who was stupid enough to let themselves give into the forbidden temptation of having sex with kids. Now they are owned forever and if they don't have the money required then they have to do other things. Congressmen don't make that much but their votes are valuable. Especially in support of Israel. The same with Senators. This is why every single vote is always in favor of Israel and against the Palestinians. The Israeli Mossad has blackmail videos on every single politician in the world who is worth blackmailing. They all know they have to do what Mossad tells them to do otherwise the video will be released online and their career in politics is over.

            Some more about the Epstein connection to Wexner and a mansion in New York City that Wexner might have given to Epstein:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Every Property Owned by Sleazy Financier Jeffrey Epstein" [including at least two stone buildings]
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...His portfolio also includes a "stone fortress" in New Mexico and the Herbert N. Straus Mansion in Manhattan, both of which are mentioned in the current round of allegations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Often referred to as one of the largest townhouses in Manhattan—possessing 21,000 square feet and seven stories, 45,000 square feet and eight stories, or 50,000 square feet and nine stories, depending on who's describing it and when—the stone mansion at 9 East 71st Street was built in 1933. It was designed by society architect Horace Trumbauer for Herbert N. Straus, one of the heirs to the Macy's department store fortune, who died before it was completed.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1961, the mansion became home to the Birch Wathen School, which it remained until Leslie H. Wexner, the founding chairman of the Limited Inc., bought it in 1989 for $13.2M. Wexner hired architect Thierry Despont and interior designer John Stefanidis to help gut-renovate the 40-room home, showing it off in the December 1995 issue of Architectural Digest (sadly, the magazine's online archives don't go back that far). In 1996, the New York Times referred to the sumptuously decorated, expensively renovated pied-à-terre as the latest "puzzling" "status symbol of the ultra rich," when it reported that Wexner never spent more than a few months in the home. This was back when the scarcely used pied-à-terre was a smaller part of the Manhattan real estate makeup.

            The Curbed article quotes at length from "Home Sweet Elsewhere," a 1996 New York Times article on New York properties owned by wealthy people who spend little time in them, referred to in Curbed as "pied-à-terre" (literally "foot on the ground") properties. David Geffen, Ronald O. Perelman, Steve Jobs and duty-free shop executive  Robert W. Miller are also discussed.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...When asked how long Mr. Wexner had occupied the property, Jeffrey Epstein, his protege and one of his financial advisers, replied, "Les never spent more than two months there." Thus the prorated cost of Mr. Wexner's sejours would appear to have been in excess of a million dollars a day.
            </p>
            <p>
             Visitors described a bathroom reminiscent of James Bond movies: hidden beneath a stairway, lined with lead to provide shelter from attack and supplied with closed-circuit television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet beneath the sink. The house also has a heated sidewalk, a luxurious provision that explains why, while snow blankets the rest of the Eastern Seaboard, the Wexner house (and Bill Cosby's house across the street) remains opulently snow-free, much to the delight of neighborhood dogs...
            </p>
            <p>
             Reached in Florida last week, Mr. Epstein said that the house was now his.

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Monday's creepily gentle profile in the New York Times suggested that Epstein charged annual fees upward of $25m a year for "superelite financial advice"-leading Portfolio's Felix Salmon to remark on the profitability of private banking. Bullshit. Epstein's wealth is built on a "bizarre relationship" with single acknowledged client, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch creator Leslie Wexner, one of America's most successful retailers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now that loaded quote comes only from an unnamed Wall Street acquaintance of Epstein who spoke to New York magazine for a profile of the money manager in 2002. There is no evidence whatsoever that their relationship went beyond that of aide to mentor. Epstein is pretty obviously heterosexual, or else going to extreme lengths to prove the point. The Limited owner Wexner himself is married with four children. It's bizarre to imagine any romantic connection between two men who are now 70 and 55 years old, a right-wing Ohio tycoon and a sex offender.

              Not saying there is a relationship. But there are married bisexuals and others that have relationships for various reasons though married. Scalia was married and had 8 children. There was info on here saying he might have been into pedophelia. Someone might be willing to exchange certain favors for a residence quite opulent.

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In 2007, when model Maximilia Cordero filed suit against Epstein for statutory rape and sexual assault (the suit was later dismissed), her lawyer included a description of what has by now become a legendary piece of puerile decor in chez Epstein: "[The] defendant gave plaintiff a tour of his mansion, showing her a huge crystal staircase with a huge crystal ball by the railing, ceiling chandeliers, a lounge room with red chairs, a statute [sic] of a dog with a statute [sic] of dog feces next to it" (emphasis ours).
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And from a Vanity Fair article:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed eyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were made for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner of Jean Dubuffet … but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests are like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...The office features a gilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan), 18th-century black lacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway “D” grand. On the desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de Sade’s The Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted. Covering the floor, Epstein has explained, “is the largest Persian rug you’ll ever see in a private home—so big, it must have come from a mosque.” Amid such splendor, much of which reflects the work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed black poodle, standing atop the grand piano. “No decorator would ever tell you to do that,” Epstein brags to visitors. “But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog.” People can’t help but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saying that he always has the last word.

            I have discovered websites that masquerade as clothing shops but I strongly suspect sell children. Some sites do not even display any children at all. It is from pedo's instagram accounts that I found these places. They have pictures of clothes in certain patterns thathave some hidden meaning.

            I remember reading in a few places, and it seemed reputable, that Epstein had a rich seeder, with ties to Mossad. The purpose of seeding him the money was to ensnare elites into provable pedophilia. This was Mossads preferred method in the states, as they didn't want to do proper ops and risk the relationship.

Ukraine orphans are being sent, many times to Jerusalem; in data I have dup up so far and with Vista Maria/ good Shepard's Npo also.

              <p>
               Ukraine now has that orphans under five cannot be adopted, unless on list of medical probs. Eye and ear hearing issues are on the list. Boystown research hospital website does advertise that children hearing and sight issues ate top at their research hospital for research and medical care clinics.

            Same pattern as Dutroux. I remember reading he got out of prison, then his rich "buyers" set him up with what he needed to supply them with "product".

              There is a doc film, by a woman who used to or still does rep at a modeling agency. I'll try to find it. She goes over to part of old Russia, story of a girl. Indebt them, taking them to Japan, the Jap agency indents them, uses them for escorts. It's a shit show. They must look as young as possible.

               Yes, I spent time in it as a teen. Its crazy scary as is the music laps. Males in the Biz, would tell us they were vampires, dose drinks. One gal got locked in a apt, escaped when photographer passed out. He blocked door with heavy furniture. Weird scene, mass young gals and guys.
