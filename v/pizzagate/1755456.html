<p>Mom Shares Terrifying Story of Encounter With Possible Human Traffickers at IKEA
<a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/parenting/news/a43466/mom-kids-followed-in-ikea/?ref=yfp">http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/parenting/news/a43466/mom-kids-followed-in-ikea/?ref=yfp</a></p>
<p>I feel this and similar true stories from parents who dodged the worst imaginable bullet (or didn\'t) can be very powerful weapons in educating the public that Elite Pedo Preditors ARE REAL. I am hoping we can all use this story to reach out to one of the most important audiences for actually saving children: PARENTS. Here\'s why I think the above story is powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was published by Good Housekeeping which has credibility whether deserved or not.</li>
<li>It makes Pizzagate real without mentioning the word.</li>
<li>It presents guidelines on how to determine whether a stranger in a department store is shopping or stalking. </li>
<li>It offers excellent advice such as remain aware and present at all times (keep your phone turned off or do not use it unless you are with another adult). If you suspect someone it suggests you:</li>
<li>Look around to see if there are others alone and similarly dressed. Snatchers work in teams, very often including a woman.</li>
<li>If you suspect someone, note if s/he stops moving every time you do</li>
<li>Note if he (they) remain near an exit.</li>
<li>Take a picture of them</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been thinking it would be good to:</p>
<p>1) Develop \'public service\' memes aimed at parents in public alone especially moms with multiple young kids in tow.</p>
<p>2) Start a campaign to broadcast those memes via social media in which we: </p>
<p>3)  Include a link to the IKEA mom\'s story along with an image meme. </p>
<p>The purpose is to save kids by waking up parents, to spread awareness of Pizzagate by bringing it close to home. It might make parents overly cautious but honestly I think they should be!</p>
<p>TIPS: To get around censorship I recommend using pro-Hillary, anti-Trump and SJW hashtags because a) Twitter always lets those through b) Does not suppress them if they trend, c) Those hashtags are lfollowed by women and d) those are precisely the people who are not getting the message. Only include #Pizzagate&quot; and &quot;#Pedogate&quot; as part of a meme (that is, as part of an image - sample below). Then send it out again, or re-tweet it with #Pizzagate&quot; and &quot;#Pedogate&quot; as actual text.</p>
<p>Here is a sample meme to use: <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3d9446802a/9383.jpg">https://imgoat.com/uploads/3d9446802a/9383.jpg</a></p>

            This past year my family was going to the park. There were a group of homeless people (men and women) off to one side, which is not unusual in our city. One of the homeless men locked eyes with me, with an unmistakable look of wanting to "get to know" me. We reached the kids play area and my husband and I conferred. He asked, "Did you see that guy?" I described the one looking at me. "No," he said, and described another man, who was giving our toddler son the same unmistakable look.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have not been back to that park or general side of the city.
           </p>
           <p>
            And we now carry.

            So why would she give out her entire family name, and pics of her family and location, if she did not want attention? something smells fishy. She is giving interviews left and right
           </p>
           <p>
            glad its bringing attention to pizza gate, but i hope this doesn't create a paranoia that all men shopping alone are pedoes lol.
           </p>
           <p>
            if im with a friend, mother, brother...whoever and i dont want to go shopping and im with them, I will frequently pace around the exit or just outside, til they get done what they are doing.....or i may wander aimlessly if the store has even something in it besides clothing and i might be interested in, not really shopping but checking things out.
           </p>
           <p>
            not to down play this, but the world is filled with people killing time while they wait.

            I'm glad you mentioned that abductors sometimes employ women or children to lure the victim away from the parents. In the 1990s I was in McDonalds with my 9 y.o. daughter and her 3 y.o. brother who were playing in the play area where I could see them from the restaurant. My daughter (who I had already drilled stranger danger into her) left the play area to tell me that she was approached through the fence by a woman outside of the play area. The woman asked her to bring the woman's two y.o. boy still in the play area to the parking lot. When I went out to the parking lot to see what kind of woman leaves her two y.o. behind in the play area, I couldn't find hide nor hair. Looking back in hindsight, it could have been a botched abduction of my daughter. Another source of danger are so called professionals/pedophiles  who have worked for years to achieve positions that place them in proximity to children. As a parent I was somewhat aware of that but hadn't realized how prevalent it was and is till I read this article:
            <a href="https://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2/professors-staff-arrested-for-trading-in-child-rape-6c39fcf62a9e#.uhwgyng9t">
             https://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2/professors-staff-arrested-for-trading-in-child-rape-6c39fcf62a9e#.uhwgyng9t
            </a>
            . This lists indicted and convicted pedophiles in education and medicine for the last several years including a pediatric oncologist! Parents need to follow their gut instinct whenever their antenna says something's not right and never be intimidated by anyone, no matter high high their station in life.

            This is a great idea!  My thought is to just do the memes as public service items; that's what they are.  Don't use any "tricks", I think that may turn off the ones we want to reach.  A picture of a mother &amp; 2-3 kids in a store with a guy watching them &amp; link to a true story should be fine.  I think a short story is better; in today's world we need to get things in a minute or 2.  There would be no reason to suppress them.  I really think this approach is better than trying to pick up the pervs; I doubt they'll be deterred, it's ben going on far too long.  I don't know that the hashtags have any advantage.  My $.02

            These creeps will hang out anywhere there are kids, especially if there are distractions for the parents.  I was going to name a couple places that are dangerous, but I don't want to give any ideas.  Keep your kids close and within eyesight at all times.  Accompany
 them to the bathroom.

            I don't even know how to ask that's how weird the situation has gotten. But I'll take at stab at it. What of a 3rd party seeing say the situation above - wanting to maintain a presence until seeing everyone safely reunited? I know I have had questioning looks when I've said something to cute kids out and about when seeing some distress? to defuse the stress. I don't remember what I said to reassure the parent that I was acting in a protecteress capacity. The first time it happened I realized how scary it's getting. I am not sure what I said but I've gotten good about saying something right away to the parent to let them know I've got their back for a moment. It's interesting to write about it. Parents and kids know right away. I'd say the first encounter the mom looked at me right in my eyes. So maybe something about that. I don't mean to be vague and obtuse but it is a factor. I guess the next time I looked at the Mom right in the eye to let her know I was present as a friendly person in a safety moment.
           </p>

            I want to add another side of the coin. Being in one of the highest trafficking areas I guess I see this too. Such carelessness on the part of the possible parent/the adult I do wonder if they are selling the child. Concern and de-stressing those kids is another reason to extend some kind words to them. But then what about those adults? Many tens of years ago I was driving somewhere with a boyfriend, a worldy studly sort of muffin, and he said there are kids for sale there. He pointed to a garage sale-like sign. I was flabbergasted and have had some awareness of the sellers ads ever since.memes please. Thanks!

            Call the mall management and follow up. Tell them you are going to channel x news local do-right show(many markets have them, sometimes focused on financial scams and such) to expose the mall that allows and perhaps fosters this behavior. Challenge the money, follow the money.

            I am not a parent myself. It isn't just on parents to watch out for their kids in a store. It is up to everyone to watch out for children and everyone else we encounter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Parents are busy shipping, reading labels or doing whatever. That split second a parent turns around is all it takes for something age to happen. Everyone needs to be on the look out for shady shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know we focus a lot on small children but we need to focus as well on everyone. Anyone of any age can be in an abusive situation and allowing that to continue is not right. If you see a guy looking at preteens or teens say something. Abusive spouse, say something. Get a plate number, take a picture or just state at them so they know they are being watched. Don't let abuse of any kind slide

            Thank you all - fabulous feedback. KEEP IT COMING.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most compelling insight IMHO is the stuff you'd never think of had you not been spending the last 3 months down the pizzagate rabbit hole. I'm talking about the stuff you and I know because we researched the perverts, we've watched "The Finders" and have listened to hours of child sex trafficking survivors describing not only what they went through but what they were forced to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "common sense" advice on how to keep your child safe is very valuable, but I am going to assume that most parents are aware of most of it and practice it. But the stuff like the fact that abductors work as a team, the fact that women are very often used to nab kids because kids trust them, the fact that it might actually be a child that makes the initial contact THAT's the stuff the average parent or Gramma shopping with her kid is not likely to be aware of. Let's surprise them with it and WAKE THEM UP. Anyone got more?
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you all so much.

            Be aware of people pretending to shop as well.  THRIFT STORES are a big, big hot spot.  Mainly because they are usually run by recovery houses or church groups looking to rehabilitate sinners.  Now, don't get me wrong..I believe it's a good idea to rehab drug offenders, but you know what kind of people can get mixed up in that group.
           </p>
           <p>
            We were browsing the women's clothes, and a man came up right behind me and my young girls..he started just indiscriminately grabbing women's clothing and throwing it over his arm, getting closer and closer to my girls and I until he was right next to us.  I noticed he kept staring at them and it seemed as if he was trying to sniff their hair.
           </p>
           <p>
            My husband was on the far side of the shop and I texted him to come over really quick, without drawing a lot of attention to us.  I grabbed my girls mother hen style and put them under arms.  He arrived in a hurry and was inches from that guys face.  He asked if he needed help buying women's clothing.  The guy
            <em>
             literally
            </em>
            dropped everything in his arms on the floor and took out running.
           </p>
           <p>
            My husband chased him out into the parking lot, but it looked like he had someone already waiting in the car for him.  They peeled out and I didn't have a chance to get the license plate number.
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR - Department stores, thrift stores, etc. are ripe with Pedos.  They are terrified of confrontation.  Be sure to be the Alpha and let them know you will break them in half if they step near you.  Also helps if you open carry (I live in the South, so it's second nature, ha!)

            Exactly. You said it better than I did. We have to FILL their echo chamber with Pizzagate just like David Brock and CTR and all the shills and trolls pump their shit into our arenas.

            Also, people in my neighborhood really seem to think it is ok to let their children play outside alone in the front yard. We had an attempted abduction here not too long ago and the cops did not do shit about it. We have 5 convicted child rapists living 3 miles away from our neighborhood. Don't let your kids go outside unsupervised is my advice. And yes these pedos often drive shitty cars, vans without windows, run down cars, because that is all they can afford. If you see a run down vehicle stalking your homes in your neighborhood call the cops. Don't send your daughter outside in a bikini to ride her bike. If you see a child alone who appears super young find their parents and make sure they are being supervised.

             This makes me so sad, I grew up in an area where you could let your kids run around by themselves and we were safe and knew everyone who lived around us.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had an experience ONCE in 15 years of playing outside, but because my parents had stressed to me the importance of 'stranger danger' I was okay and knew what was happening immediately. It was the most cliché thing ever: a couple come riding up to our group of kids asking us for help to find their lost puppy. It was almost laughable how stupid an attempt it was, hell, even the 5yos hanging out with us big kids called bullshit on them. We told them "There are a couple of cops who live in next to us that can help you put up posters if you like" (I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they HAD lost a puppy" As soon as I said cop they bolted and we told the cop who lived next to us what happened and the plate numbers. He told our parents later that night that the car was stolen and us kids were praised with how well we handled everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             Parents! It is never to early or to late to teach your kids how to not become a victim. Our parents would sit down with us and watch TV programs that would deal with these themes, then have a discussion with us during/after. Many times I have taken a step back from a situation and realized I was about to put myself at risk because of something we had watched on America's Most wanted, and yes, even 'To catch a predator'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Proper communication and explanations for  how you feel and lay out rules are important, kids do not respond well to "because I told you so/because I know better than you" It will hurt your efforts and make you seem paranoid, they will dismiss it without proper training

              This makes me sad as well. I grew up on an AFB and would run around with friends the entire day playing basketball and stuff without ever having a single negative incident. You guys are doing a great job taking preventative measures and I'm happy I'll be able to protect my kids once that day comes

            Yeah... every time I see a parent who is using a car seat in a store for an infant I think that looks a tad risky. Someone could grab it and go. I keep my child strapped to me in a baby wrap, and I never look away from the others in a cart. I'm actually afraid to shop alone. Never leave your kid in the car alone for even a second. One time my child climbed out of his seat and hid underneath groceries in the third row while I was loading in the back and couldn't see him doing it... It only takes a couple of seconds for someone to grab your child. Go shopping with your spouse if possible, don't go out shopping late at night alone, and be aware of your surroundings. Also, if they would institute a death penalty for kidnappers, pedophiles and child rapists, that would go a long way.

            Another thing to consider is to be aware of kids you encounter when you are out and about. Years ago my little girl and I were shopping at CVS. A very dissheveled little girl a few years older than mine maybe 6 or 7.......she was really pretty but her dress was filthy and her long hair was all tangled and she needed a bath came up to us by herself in an attempt to play with my daughter as we shopped. Mine was checking out a toy or something and the girl was trying to interact. It was sweet and I gave the girl an encouraging smile. My daughter is friendly and kids have always be drawn to her right away so that part was not unusual. That CVS was small so I knew her parents must be close by and would be there momentarily. Mind you this all took place in a matter of seconds. Suddenly, her father or the man she was there with came bounding down the isle, grabbed her arm led her away without looking at us, I don't think he even said anything. He looked rough too. It seemed abusive to me, the whole thing was off.  I wandered around looking for them just to check out the situation, hopefully without him noticing and I spotted them at the prescription pick-up counter. He had the girl right in front of him almost pinned to the counter, his arms resting on the counter on either side of her at her eye level. Like he was forcing her to look straight ahead only. His body was forcing hers tight up againt it. I was concerned but felt I was maybe misunderstading the situation or something but my instincts were screaming that this was bad, real bad. I considered trying to get his plate numbers just in case I decided to call someone but when I went outside they were gone. To this day this haunts me. Now more than ever.....

            When my brother and I were 5 &amp; 6 yrs old, our parents dropped us off in the toy dept so we could entertain ourselves while they did their shopping. I could never imagine letting my own child out of my sight like that.

            my children, wife and I were followed around a habor frieght store by what i can only assume was a pedophile a few weeks ago. when i noticed him following I picked up a machete and started talking to my wife about using it to kill pedos and what do you know, the joker and poison ivy show up in full dark knight era cosutme and start looking at bolt cutters. the heath ledger joker character starts snapping the bolt cutters at me the way you would threaten someone with a pair, sort of like a cutting motion. I asked the cashier if the first guy was security or loss prevention but, he seemed really freaked out that someone had followed us around too. While I was attempting to describe the guy, i noticed that he was watching us from the other side of the store still and pointed him out. He took off as fast as he could without running. That was the strangest stranger experience I have ever had. I am 30.

            Wow, that sounds terrifying.  Especially with how much it would be for a mom to handle 3 small children at once.

             My first thought as well. I wish there was a statistic out there showing moms shopping alone with two or more young kids are the prime target of abductions. That would be great to broadcast out. But something tells me there have been no studies on this AT ALL.

             That's what I was thinking, that many kids with you make you a target because they know you're going to get distraced. They lay in wait for that moment....so scary!

            My sister told me about this story yesterday.  She believes everything that I have been telling her about pizzagate Now! So as a mother I truly believe that this story will be very helpful in spreading awareness of pizzagate, pedogate.  It worked on my sister and she was fully convinced that I was crazy!!
