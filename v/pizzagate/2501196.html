            This is shameful and disgusting. The Med. Proffession is like the Vatican protecting the abusers. Doctors rarely lose their lisence, it’s as hard as defrocking a man of the cloth. I would presume most of the victims are women and children. Would be interesting to know if men have these problems and if they are too embarrassed to report it.
