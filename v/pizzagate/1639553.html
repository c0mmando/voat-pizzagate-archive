<hr />
<p>Convicted child-trafficker Laura Silsby and alleged child-trafficker James Alefantis were two key leads that drove the Pizzagate investigation over the past few months. Investigators parted ways to look into them respectively, and discovered that the two were uncannily connected in more than one way. One was through <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1431715">ICMEC, International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children</a>, and another was through <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1523591">Friends of the Orphans, the orphanage that Laura Silsby was given children from</a>. CIA agent <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1602801">Mary Sue Conaway</a> happens to be connected with both of these organisations. </p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Background</strong></h1>
<p>For those who don\'t know about ICMEC, it\'s basically an organisation dedicated to issues regarding missing and abducted children. James Alefantis is friends with Jeff Koons, co-founder of ICMEC, and Laura Silsby <a href="https://archive.fo/wka7C">works for AlertSense</a> which is affiliated with ICMEC. The founder of ICMEC is NCMEC, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which is in charge of AMBER Alerts of AlertSense for when children go missing domestically.</p>
<p>Regarding Friends of the Orphans, also known as NPH-USA; it is the orphanage that Laura Silsby was <a href="https://archive.fo/ox7Fa#selection-423.0-425.82">caught attempting to traffick children</a> from. Although you may know her for being arrested with children who all had parents, it wasn\'t just that one time that she had attempted to traffick children. She had <a href="https://archive.is/lMmHp#selection-1093.0-1093.168">previously been caught down at Petionville</a> near the collapsed building of Friends of the Orphans, per the testimony of her lawyer.</p>
<p>Here\'s a <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1625812">refresher</a> on the Alefantis-Maccoby-Silsby-CIA connection.</p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Abduction Chief of Office of Children\'s Issues and ICMEC</strong></h1>
<p>Friends of the Orphans happens to employ a special unit called the <a href="https://archive.fo/vNAAY#selection-3537.0-3681.25">Secret NPH Task Force</a>. One of the operatives is Mary Sue Conaway, who happens to be a <a href="https://archive.fo/gJQk9#selection-297.1917-297.1953">CIA agent</a>. She worked in the American embassy at Dominican Republic at the time Laura Silsby was arrested, placing herself in a convenient position to organize an international child-trafficking scheme. </p>
<p>Back in 2006, she was the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mSoXijM.jpg">Abduction Chief</a> at the Abduction Unit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Children\'s_Issues">Office of Children\'s Issues</a>, which is an organisation that develops policies and programs related to international child abduction. Guess what? Office of Children\'s Issues was <a href="http://archive.is/Op8cW#selection-493.32-493.116">founded by the current president of ICMEC</a>, Maura Harty. </p>
<p>There\'s no question that the former Abduction Chief and president of the same organization would know each other. Of course they do. This gives an explanation to why Laura Silsby did not fear retribution by not only stealing orphans, but children with parents also. After all, the ICMEC was launched by <a href="http://archive.is/irGDp#selection-455.0-455.153">high-priestess Hillary Clinton herself</a>.</p>',

            from what I saw on The Tribe, that statement couldn't be more accurate. After viewing the people on that site I can't even go to the grocery without looking at people wondering...They're literally everywhere.

            Here are some ideas on how ICMEC might be capitalizing on its unique position:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             People are advised to send pornography to them so that they can route it to the appropriate authorities.  They have been given special software to detect faces and to build a giant database containing porn libraries.  Seems to me this puts them on the receiving end of porn, the ability to identify adults, and then blackmail them.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Project VIC has built a library of over 5 million unique images of child pornography, including stills and video. Through processing and categorization of the images, there now are more than 2 million quality-controlled hash values available to law enforcement.
             <a href="http://archive.is/2EOx4">
              source:
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              They are under no oversight.  If they receive a report, they can choose to pass it on or not.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              They work closely with individual law enforcement units, and they know who is compromised and who isn't.  They also get them software which I am guessing could give them the opportunity to install software that allows them to download from the LE computers.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I know there is more, but what?  Are they coordinating shipments of children through various countries?

             there's that blackmail thing again. Excellent thinking. I never thought of extending the need to blackmail to ordinary citizens...who have jobs in banking, IT, and they'd be quite useful in stealing information on their "enemies" not needing to go through proper gov. channels for it.

            Excellent job on expanding from your previous researches and on continuing to connect the dots. The evidence keeps piling up and still, nothing is done. The authorities should already have investigated those leads and came up with arrest warrants.

             Agree.  I sometimes think that it is a mistake for so many researchers to focus on Comet Ping Pong.  To my mind, the Silsby case is much more important, as well as substantiated, as a weak link into the whole corrupt network.

            Kinda funny how Obama went and vacationed with this dude on his island (like 34 km away from Epstein's island) right after he got out of office. Wow these people are really just flaunting it in our faces. I'm trying to red pill people with videos and my mom, dad, and stepmother think they can somehow jail me or institutionalize me. The world is backwards right now its just so destructive on my brain, I cannot believe how entrenched people have become in the reality fed to them by hollywood, the MSM news, and the government, its just absolutely insane....

             It really is insane, considering the fact that all we're asking for is an investigation. It's really our duty to show that the elites aren't above the law, regardless of whether this turns out to be true or not. Because the overwhelming circumstantial evidence points to it all being true. Too many coincidences!

              Ya well if there is not investigation we need to stop recognizing our society and government, stop depending on them to do anything for us. Thats all they want, is for us to depend on them. They sit around tables thinking they own you and me, the people, we cannot allow that any more. These people are the toxic trash scum of the universe and we can no longer sit around and enable them. Start planning and figuring out how to live without societies' support. No. 1 most important goal, start farming.
