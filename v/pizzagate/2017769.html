<p><strong>Cult of Antinous and links to Osiris:</strong></p>
<p><em>Antinous\' death:</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#Death">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#Death</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In late September or early October 130, Hadrian and his entourage, among them Antinous, assembled at Heliopolis to set sail upstream as part of a flotilla along the River Nile. [...] 
On their journey up the Nile, they stopped at Hermopolis Magna, the primary shrine to the god Thoth.[33] It was shortly after this, in October 130 – around the time of the festival of Osiris – that Antinous fell into the river and died, probably from drowning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Antinous\' deification:</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#Deification_and_the_cult_of_Antinous">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#Deification_and_the_cult_of_Antinous</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hadrian was devastated by the death of Antinous, and possibly also experiencing remorse.[41] In Egypt, the local priesthood immediately deified Antinous by identifying him with Osiris due to the manner of his death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antinous was often depicted as the Egyptian god Osiris in statues:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#/media/File:Egyptianizing_statue_of_Antinoos.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#/media/File:Egyptianizing_statue_of_Antinoos.jpg</a></p>

<p><strong>The link between the cult of Antinous and spirit cooking and John Podesta:</strong></p>
<p>From Swordfish69:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2015796">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2015796</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cult of Antinous were the originators of the strange practice of Spirit Cooking revived by Aleister Crowley and popularized, most recently, by the controversial Marina Abramovic. The deeper meaning of their practices is tangential to the seedier prospect of it concealing a child sex ring; what is important is that they worshipped Antinous, an underage boy regarded by the Roman elite as a figure of erotic beauty and pederasty, and continue to use him as a symbol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Podesta was invited to spirit cooking by Marina Abramovic herself.  (as revealed in leaked Podesta emails at wikileaks)  So,  Podesta is definitely linked to spirit cooking.</p>
<p><strong>The Myth of Osiris\'s link:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris#Mythology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris#Mythology</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enraged, he tore the body into <strong>fourteen</strong> pieces and scattered them throughout the land. Isis gathered up all the parts of the body, except the penis (<strong>which had been eaten by a fish</strong>, the medjed) and bandaged them together for a proper burial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Use of double meanings:</strong></p>
<p>Something we find time and time again in criminal organizations and cults is the use of double meanings.  Double meanings for words, double meanings for symbols, double meanings for actions</p>
<p><em>Food code words have been covered here extensively.</em></p>
<p><em>Spirit cooking doubles for art and also for magic/occult/worship purposes depending on the context according to Marina.</em></p>
<p>*The use of symbols in street signs, all in the same general area. *</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Besta pizza - boy lover symbol hidden inside the logo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many other symbols used in nearby businesses that were identified by the FBI\'s document on pedophile symbols.This has been covered extensively here as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A strange Podesta email:</strong></p>
<p>Wikileaks link: <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39999">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39999</a></p>
<p>Milia Fisher says to John Podesta: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My favorite</strong> of the #GlobalGoals? No. 14— we must protect our oceans and life below water #SDGs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The email contains an attachment that is mirrored here that shows John Podesta showing his hands and the number 14 and a fish and smiling like he\'s doing something clever or on the inside on an inside joke:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/pT5D46U.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/pT5D46U.jpg</a></p>
<p>Wasn\'t that strange that she already had a picture of Podesta with the fish and 14 that she sent <strong>to Podesta</strong>?	</p>
<p>So, you tell me:  Is this an innocent depiction of Podesta having fun showing the #14 goal?  Or is this a double meaning with him smiling like he\'s pulling one over on us?</p>',

            Notice the bandage on his left middle finger?  I'm sure this has been pointed out before, but it's further evidence that he is involved with spirit cooking rituals.

             The cult of Antinous were the originators of the strange practice of Spirit Cooking revived by Aleister Crowley and popularized, most recently, by the controversial Marina Abramovic.

           <p>
            There is no evidence for this assertion.   I have never read of the phrase Spirit Cooking used before in ancient Greek or Roman esoteric literature, and I have read a bio on Crowley and this is never mentioned.   I don't believe this is a true statement, but I'd be happy to see evidence to support it if there is any.

              The origins of Spirit Cooking can (allegedly) be found in the preludes to production of the Cake of Light material, a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley[2], and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”.
Marina Abramovic has even admitted herself on a Reddit AMA that private Spirit Cooking sessions, particularly at one's home, are no longer considered art.

              Okay - yes I see that the argument can be made that the Cake of light is an antecedent to Spirit Cooking a cake like Marina A.  And since Crowley was inspired by rituals of acolytes of Godesses/Gods in ancient greece, another antecedent is drawn however flimsily. I'd just be careful paring down the info so much that it starts to look innacurate, such as the idea that "Spirit Cooking" was an Ancient Greek ritual or that Antonius' cult specifically did this - not really.   I'd say something more like  "Spirit Cooking is Abromovic's ritual abomination cullled from earlier traditions, including Crowley's Cake of Light which incorporated blood into a sacramental wafer mimicking the Church's holy sacrament of communion and based on practices with roots in the ritual traditions of Ancient Greece."
