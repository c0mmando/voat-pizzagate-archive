            You haven't articlulated  direct connection to the sexual abuse of kids by the global elite, so I really have to remove this for the sake of consistency. When Bill starts reporting on child abusers, we'll leave it up. :-)

              President Trump should resign. But, of course, he won't hold himself accountable. Therefore, Congress should investigate the multiple sexual harassment and assault allegations against him.

             But, of course, trying to get him to resign/impeached isn't really part of the war being waged to get him the hell out of office and install a flunkie that will dance to The Cannibal Elite's tune.

             You see, it's here where the rules start getting all cloudy for me.
            </p>
            <p>
             If a subject has been covered on Voat, I assume it's going to be allowed, but that's not what happens. The election and installing Killary as The Cannibal Queen Elect was consistent in the emails that were the launching pad of pizzagate. Besides throwing kids in the pool for entertainment, there was a consistent strategizing in controlling the press, etc. Part of the winning was to smear Trump since the wiretapping turned up zip. I mean, how the hell clean did Trump have to be  for them NOT to come up with dirt even with him being wiretapped? So they invite/pay for fake dossiers and leak off camera interviews that were secretly recorded, and, oh, yes, skanks that had cream pie anal sex on camera for $1500 came forward to protest being sexually harassed by Trump! All for him to lose the election! So the parade of heifers vehemently complained about such things as him not asking permission to kiss before he planted one on her lips and that he took a woman's number and never called her!!!! WOW!!! That's heinous! Then there's another skank/whore's family being convicted of human trafficking AND being a good friend of Killary. So it's an established MO. We know that from the hit job done on Roy Moore. Those skank's stories are as credible as Allred herself. So when the pattern continues and somebody, O'Reilly in this case, actually purports to have proof of the dems being guilty of PAYING for these heifers to lie? Oh, no! Reporting THAT story is not part of pizzagate?!!!! How do you figure? Let me ask you this, why the hell are stories about Seth Rich allowed then? There are ZERO tie ins to child trafficking or molestation. Yeah, somebody pointed to a Disney print, but, no, those are sold by the truckful to collectors. I'm talking Seth Rich being murdered. He wasn't molesting children. There's no proof he was, so why was it allowed? Oh, that's right ... because it tied into the emails, in that, he might have been acting as a whistleblower in leaking the emails to Assange. And why is that important? Because it would impact the election. You see how everything is about who is in power? And the propaganda against the POTUS is enormous! It's propaganda 24/7. But you don't see how it's tied to pizzagate, eh?
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever. I can't possibly understand what you guys/gals are doing in your decision making process. I really can't. Rich was allowed partly because it was tied to the MO Killary uses on political enemies and skanks/heifers coming forward to lie? Oh, yeah! It's another MO that's used, but, of course, it doesn't matter because these rules aren't supposed to be logical. They're arbitrary at best seemingly based on shills reporting posts and whining about how someone is spamming the boards. So really, the number one rule is: If you're a shill and whine, a mod will appease you.

              I hear your frustration and respect your assessment of lack of consistency. I myself am often frustrated by trying to enforce the rules.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seth Rich was allowed because there is a possibility he played a role leaking the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and that he was murdered to cover up what ELSE he might know and reveal (pizzagate), and those failing to investigate his murder also failed to investigate the child porn found on the Comet server.
             </p>
             <p>
              My bias is to leave up everything I possibly can, and let votes decide. If you made a case that O'Reilly's tape is connected because it shows just how desperate they are to stop Trump from remaining in power long enough to weed out and prosecute the VIPedos, and how that is now a much more likely possibility given the tape, I would probably leave it up. But you have to make the argument.
             </p>

              Franken is a gray area. He groped women, but made jokes about raping babies. His ouster after so many inexplicable years of getting a pass is a possible sign that tides are turning and the pedos may soon be exposed as well. We've removed most posts about him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Q has made numerous references to pizzagate, Haiti, Satanism and characterized the Cabal as "sick". He has positioned himself as a voice of hope and encouragement to pizzagate researchers, urging further digging and meme warfare and predicting events to show he is legit. I see him as similar to the role clandestine radio played for the French Resistance during WWII. We were specifically told by kevdude to leave up and sticky alphabravo's original Q post, though I think they need to be combined into a megathread that gets updated in the Comments, rather than numerous little tidbit posts. I am mulling doing a sticky asking people's feedback on that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Migratory, how would you do things differently overall? What criteria would you use? How would you change the wording of the rules or the definition of pizzagate we currently have to make the subverse better, more enjoyable, etc.? I would love to hear your thoughts.

               I'll have to give this some thought, but as for Q, one big thread doesn't cut it. If someone finds something he says as a jumping off point for a post, the post should stay up. Why? Because points and ideas get lost in a huge thread. I don't read every single comment, and sometimes valuable information is overlooked, so individual posts are not something that mods should frown upon or discourage. Instead, see which ones have legs. If the post disappears and drops off the first page in an hour or two, and there are limited views of comments, you know the community is not interested. If, however, it generates or stimulates interest (much like the CDAN Arizona thread - KABOOM!), you know it's valid. If a separate thread is validated in this way, then the link to that thread should be preserved/included in the mega sticky thread . This will satisfy individual members to take a flyer in pursuing a lead and keep us happy, but keep the information in one convenient place for followers of Q to find. I'm not a follower of Q, but I absolutely see the necessity of reporting and keeping tabs on what he's saying/posting. If you don't it would be like the media saying that ANTIFA is a terrorist organization so we won't write about them anymore. What? No! It's because they are the outlaws and pirates that you're mandated to keep tabs on them because they're a huge part of what is going on. And to take the pulse of an issue, you include everything to get an overall view. It's why when certain shills who shall remain nameless start shrieking,, "LARPER! LARPER!", I cease to listen. If Q is a LARPER (and I believe he is), it's because a LARPER has become part of pizzagate. Therefore, his posts and posts about him or his clues should remain up.

             Part of the pedo defense network scheme is to level as many charges against everyone as possible...to throw sand in the air....
False charges are great, as well....then some people will discount tje real charges (they hope).
            </p>
            <p>
             This is reasonably "Pizzagate connected",,,,,First line of defense was "get Trump"/"impeach Trump".....but he's moved the ball enough that they see that charges are going to be made against some of them, so they are gearing up for "if everybody did it then nobody did it" and "this is like the Salem witch trials, not to be taken seriously".
            </p>
            <p>
             Its chess.  Trump is slowly red-pilling, start with Hollywood and sex harassment charges in Congress.....Whats the Pedo's best defense as the charges begin to be laid out?  Throw a ton of shit in the air.

              As soon as heard them going on and on about trivial sexual stuff in England I though that too. You're also right about it being chess, it's like the dominos have to fall slowly enough for there to be time for the normies to get their shit together.

              SEE THE PATTERN? The Zionists are making a huge move to co-opt pizzagate and some pizzagaters are falling for it. The Zionists want all things Trump to be pizzagate. They intend to bury in sexual "impropriety" bullshit. A pedophile network will get exposed as we do it ourselves. We cannot rely on Trump. Ok?

                Christianity gets fucked hard. The place where Jesus rose from the dead given to Talmudists who write that Jesus is in hell boiling in hot excrement. Zionist plan to co-opt Christianity further with "Judeo-Christianity" advances. Goal: Christians to one day worship "God's Chosen People."

               Christianity was a splinter cult that made the big time after it was adopted by the Roman state. The resurrection doctrine originated with a Pharisee who held Roman citizenship, there are other red flags.
The Karaites were around and the time of the Pharisees, but they weren't mentioned in a negative light. The Karaites don't follow the Talmud, Talmudism is mostly associated with the Rabbis, who are the ideological descendants of the Pharisees. Judeo-Christianity can refer the ethical system of the common law: the ten commandments and the golden rule etc. The term "God" is hopelessly ambiguous, it is both a a translation of the plural word Elohim and the singular word theos, as well as being used in reference to the Christian Trinity, a Semtic deity of fortune, and to Allah. Zionism is named after Tziyown, the city of David. These things take time to unwrap.

                    I'm not considering the history of judaism because that goes no place in today's arena. It only drags the discussion into a pit. I would rather use the term Zionist because it pulls the discussion out of the swamp of racism and ethnicity. At the present time Zionism is without question a predatory political group and we can see that by their actions. They have destroyed what was left of the middle east to a large degree simply to take their mineral resources, banks, and control the land. Pretty simple. Their exclusive club "others" all people who are not in their clique. The have looted the U.S. Treasury and the treasuries of the countries they loan money to by force. People that attempt to set up their own banks and do business in their currency of choice can be bombed into the stone age as history shows us.

                     An alternative to analysis of Judaism in historical terms is analysis of the writings of their prophets. Their kings and leaders have a pretty spotty reputation, but the prophets of the Tanak are well regarded by all of the Abrahamic religions.

                I understand the history but in practical boots on the ground terms I base my perspective on what it means for real people based on their limited understanding of terminology and history. In a nutshell its not hard to see that today's Zionism is oil and water to Christianity. Zionists hate the principles attributed to Jesus, be he an archetype or was once a real man. People who consider themselves Christians are sitting ducks for Zionist predatory intentions and do not stand a chance of comprehending what this means for them in the future.

                 OK, but if your target audience is Joe sixpack &amp; co then you're probably fighting a losing battle trying to explain it to them. IMO it's more productive to argue with those who are actively interested and have some knowledge of the subject.

                 It's a double edged sword. The Bible clearly refers to Jerusalem as the most important city and as the city of David. If that's interpreted as legitimizing the Zionist occupation of the promised land then there's trouble ahead, but it can also be interpreted as the possibility that Jews &amp; Muslims can find reconciliation. The name Jerusalem means teaching of peace, but Zionist foreign policy is pretty much the antithesis of that.

                  Christians, real ones and the ones that are becoming trained to worship "gods chosen people" don't have a clue who Herzel is. They are at a built in disadvantage.

                  Zionists disregard the 10 commandments and don't like TRUE Christians nor Jesus. The principles attributed to the archetype of Jesus are similar to a blueprint for freedom. Zionists are not into freedom for anybody but themselves.Zionism invaded Christianity over a long period. Christians are being lured into Zionist traps becaue they never heard of Herzel. That does not make them willing Zionists. It makes them dupes in the process of losing what is left of true Christianity.

                   Yeah, seen it. I get that anyone who believes the Christian version of events would have trouble understanding why she would take the piss. Even if you disregard what the Talmud has to say about Jesus, the Torah is at odds with the Christian version of the crucifixion both theologically and prophetically. Some of the symptoms of the disconnect between Christianity and its own canon are the Pope wanting to fix the Lord's Prayer and the Christian doctrine of the Trinity being hopelessly incompatible with the first chapter of the book of Genesis. It gets much worse with the Anglican Articles of Religion.

            I DISAGREE. Its more theatre from the Mockinbird media. It has nothing to do with our mission. This is more of your Al Franken teir CNN vs FOX noise. You keep trying to clutter this sub with this bullshit and I keep pointing it out. I will continue to do so.

            If we post all these sexual impropriety squabbles they want us to focus on pizzagate will become the National Enquirer. Stop spamming our sub we finally just got the front page cleaned up. spamomatic...

              I have figured this out. We have whole fleet of shill accounts that are up voting. Roughly about 25 accounts right now. You're right he don't give a fuck. Might have to post an organ harvesting thread and see if he is alive.

              Are you out of your freaking mind? Trump being president has everything to do with pizzagate. Haven't you heard about the human trafficking arrests? They're actually being made now that Trump is in office. Further, the paid hookers/whores/commies that alleged Trump groped them are being orchestrated to give a press conference where they're demanding he resign -- just like Franken! Getting Trump out of office before you know who gets locked up is paramount. And Megyn Kelly was the interviewer!!! Priceless!!!

              The same is said about Q, but you–personally–will explode into an autistic fit of rage if anyone dares question your proven LARPer. And yet somehow this shit about ACTUAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS BEING PROVEN FALSE is “not pizzagate related.”’

                    Some of his very first claims were proven fraudulent. Couple that with the claimed picture from AF1 over Hong Kong (at a time when we knew Trump was in South Korea) and the very concept of exposing a system of nationwide martial law and the arrest of… well, just “people in government” * and it makes for a very unconvincing LARP.

                    <li>
                     “People in government” is as specific as can be said. We can’t say ‘jews’ (because Q-LARP never said anything about jews being bad), we can’t say ‘globalists’ (because he hasn’t said anything about that, either), and we can’t even say ‘foreigners’ (he hasn’t said anything about dual citizenship, probably because he’s a civic nationalist). Crying shame.

                 But think about it, IF it's her and IF this is true, she'd be disbarred ... for starters. She was tampering with a US presidential election. And if that client of hers that accused our POTUS admits to what went on, IF anything did go on, well, you got some YUGE federal charges!

                  I think she is def a candidate for this accusation.  But I must applaud her coming out against Bill Cosby who I think is Guilty as Sin.  A possibility she is playing both sides of the coin.  She is so money hungry she will take the cases that are on the up and up and also happy to supply "fake victims" when needed.

                   I think they just play the game. In other words, Cosby was about to be outed so who else would handle it?
