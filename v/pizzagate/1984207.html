            This this selling out to China by the Clinton's was done in conjunction with the Bush's. Look how Jeb and Congressman Tom Feeney of Florida did this too! Jeb sold out our missile technology to China. I'll put a link to the investigative story that no one would touch!

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Late last year, Congress heard sworn testimony from Florida programmer Clint Curtis, who created vote-rigging software in 2000 at the request of Tom Feeny, a Bush Family factotum. Feeny wanted Curtis (a fellow Republican) and his employer, Yang Enterprises, to produce untraceable programs that could 'control the vote' as needed, investigator Brad Friedman reported. Feeny also told Curtis of Bush plans to 'suppress the black vote' with 'exclusion lists.' This is exactly what happened. BBC investigator Greg Palast has shown that tens of thousands of legitimate African-American voters were deliberately 'purged' from the rolls by a private Republican-controlled corporation hired by Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Afterwards, Feeny - who had been Jeb's running mate in his first gubernatorial campaign - was rewarded for his dutiful service with a plum congressional seat.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2002, Raymond Lemme, a Florida state government inspector, took up Curtis' charges, which included other corruption allegations involving Feeny, Yang Enterprises and a Yang employee charged with peddling military technology to the Chinese. In June 2003, Lemme told Curtis he had 'tracked the corruption all the way to the top' and that 'the story would break in a few weeks.' On July 1, 2003, Lemme was found dead in a Georgia hotel room, just across the Florida border.

             For the purpose of exploring the reasons China has grown up thanks to the United States, and especially the president who was bought out by Chinese businessmen who disguised themselves as businessmen, In the United States, hit the ham psychology that sells national interests just because of donations. China has a rather sophisticated bribery regime.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beijing is not able to cope with the mighty United States in terms of military, economic, political, scientific and technological ... However, China often uses its top leaders to serve the right. Their benefit, like the sentence: "Lion lion, lions humiliation." No one is capable of defeating the superpower, but only the maggots at the head of the brain are making the United States weak, favoring China's many benefits thanks to those who " Internal "within the White House. 
According to Capitalism is freedom and the Daily Mail on July 29, 2016, China had "invested" and "bought" Bill and Hillary Clinton since the 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not unusual. With "ma ze in China" dating back to ancient times, the mirror of the "King of the Sultan" was born by a businessman named Zhao En (292-235 BC), after the general of Qin Dynasty during the war. Zhao Zhi, who had brought his concubine, Zhao Zhou, was pregnant to "invest" in the united kings who had never met as Zuo and used the money to create opportunities for his son. By bribery. In the end, La Vi was successful, Tu Su son was King and son of La Vi Vi is Business, later successor, that is King Qin Shi Huang.
            </p>
            <p>
             The king of words, especially the purchase of a president of the super-power that Americans still "ignorant school do not know," even the United States Democrats gathering political figures, not only Ignoring but also trusting Hillary again in the 2016 presidential election: also closed eyes for. Try to see the United States muscle crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the 1990s China has "bought the throne without the throne" of the United States' superpower and until now the truth has exposed, surely the country, Americans have suffered much during the eight years of the presidency Bill Clinton, first lady Hillary served as senator and 4 years as foreign minister at the time of Barack Obama.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ng. Lap Seng - Bill Clinton - Hillary Clinton Since the 1990s, Chinese billionaire hand is Ng. 68-year-old Lap Seng has been interviewed by the Daily Mail about how he has been in the US Congress for many years now. This is not the counter intelligence agencies, US intelligence as CIA or FBI bad, but by the president, the military commander who became the recipient of the Chinese money, of course must return by the government New national welfare danger. President Bill Clinton, a veteran lawyer who served as Arkansas governor, used his legal capacity, his salary, and his experience to limit the CIA's authority. Important issues related to national security.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is also Bill Clinton's triumph to "pay off" those who illegally spend Beijing through "backstage donations" and also detrimental to national security, so terrorists take advantage of the gap. The law and limits of the CIA, the FBI that the training organization, penetrated in the United States, when President George. W. Bush new, see the adverse situation should Al Qaeda "first downplayed through terror" September 11, 2001.

            <p>
             The "Ma Ze in China" has had a "donation" process for more than 20 years abroad, with the primary goal of targeting politicians, presidential candidates and present day donors. This has been questioned by parliament, affecting Hillary Clinton's ambition to move the White House again and now the record of China has been "depositing" the purchase of President Bill Clinton since the 1990s. Today's old lesson can happen again with Hillary becoming the Democratic presidential nominee nominated for the party congress that took place at the end of July 2016.

              Chinese state billionaire Ng Lap Seng is re-emerging in New York City and has been subject to detentions of bribery and bribery charges and is likely to be sanctioned by US law. A group of activists and members of the US Congress should give him immunity if he submits the truth about big donations to Bill Clinton and from what Bill gave to Trung. The nation grew, becoming the second economic superpower. This is legal, if the offender is under false pretenses, is exempted from prosecution to catch small fish, small fish, in the case of Nguyen Xuan Nghia, may be due to personal security that has provided the truth with.

              Ng Lap Seng, a businessman in Macau, very close to the Beijing regime, was charged with illegally donating money from abroad. During this time, Ng Lap Seng refused to go to the US to respond to the congressional referral from abroad after the government discovered it. Well, the reason is that the United States needs to wipe out China's tendency to invest in the president, which has an opportunity to influence through elections, which donate foreign money illegally.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to a survey of some members of Congress, the name Ng. Lap Seng illegally laundered money through the Clinton campaign in Arkansas in 1996, taking the American name of Charlie Trie through the eyes of security agencies, Tax office, treasury. The name Ng Lap Seng under the US name is Charlie Trie to camouflage the involvement and behind the Chinese Communist Party mastermind. The name Charlie Trie was donated to the Democratic National Committee and the Bill Clinton Bill when Bill pleaded guilty to violating the financial advocacy principles of the 1996 election campaign. The last interrogation was related to Ng. Lap Seng about his foreign donation program. He is currently under house arrest at a $ 3 million luxury apartment in Manhattan. Congress is waiting for more and he's trying to bribe top UN official John Ashe, former UN General Assembly president, who died secretly at a hotel in New York.

              Republican Sen. Fred Thompson, who also chairs the commission, has found that the Chinese ruling party has plotted and handed over the immense power structure of the United States by dumping money illegally. In the US elections, the "brokers of the presidential mercenaries, politicians" under the guise of wealthy merchants, afforded the money and then politicized the government to benefit Beijing. It is this illegal spill that has the potential to knock down America's electoral system, according to The Washington Post.

              But the Democrats are trying to avoid, as Senator Joe Lieberman says there is not enough convincing evidence that China directly participates in the United States through illegal money bombs in elections. On the other hand, according to Ng Lap Seng's lawyer, Hugh Hu Mo, and on behalf of the Chinese state, this justifies the US Congress interrogating his client's lawyers in China. "Here. However, the US Congressional Ombudsman made full use of the possibility of filing a plea with Ng Lap Seng for the testimony and testimony

              This time through the middleman affair of the United States president for the Beijing conglomerate, Ng Lap Seng, was arrested, investigated and sent to court with evidence of illegal donations to Bill Clinton in the campaign. It has been possible to influence the future of his wife, Hillary, although she has been nominated by the Democrats to be the "old hen" of Recycle in the race for billionaire Donald. Trump in the White House. And yet, the Clinton Foundation now comes to China to buy President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which has made Hillary disadvantageous, especially today, of rapid, universal communication. Exhausted, greedy, foreign minions ... can not be stopped as in the 1990s, then the use of the Internet is still embryonic and limited.

             <p>
              Republican rival Donald Trump uses tricks to exploit Hillary's "weaknesses" and their families so that US voters recognize the deceitfulness of their opponents to win the upper hand in the run. Sprint Race for the White House. It is certain that from now until November 2016 there will be some gloomy weather in the Bill Clinton family, so publicly debated, Hillary is unlikely to defend the obvious evidence presented, Even in the law profession, the defense can not be "innocent" for a client who has been found guilty by the judge: Alone burdens seven.

              The US Congress dissuaded Hillary's acceptance of hundreds of millions of dollars while serving as foreign minister. The US Congressional Ombudsman has been working hard to investigate this extremely important issue and was informed by the US Citizen Organization that more information was available to interrogate the " This CCP, when appearing before the congressional investigation commission. David Bossie, president of the US Citizenship Organization and former head of the parliamentary oversight committee, has said suspicions of foreign donations have been made by China since the 1990s.

              Although Ng Lap Seng did not co-operate in the investigation, the monitoring committee had bank evidence of the transfer of funds to run for President Bill Clinton in 1996. Commissioner Jason Chaffetz and chairman of the legislative commission, Senator Chareles Grassley, proposed the use of the immunity principle if the name Ng. Lap Seng provides the truth about using foreign money (China) to swing the presidential candidate, affecting the national interests. This case is very important, explosive because the Chinese have long bought the president of the United States is Bill Clinton through the "middleman trade president" as Ng. Lap Seng.

              John Huang talks about Chinese hands deep in the White House, known as the super spy "ma ze in China" as John Huang exploited the amusement of Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to invade.
             </p>
             <p>
              When Bill Clinton was governor of the state, John Huang was a merchant, managing director of Lipo Bank of Indonesia, who had blessed Bill Clinton to Hong Kong, becoming profoundly involved (such as La Vi Vi and Prince of death). When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, China surrendered $ 150 million to Lipo and John Huang cashed out to support the campaign. When Bill Clinton was elected president, John Huang was promoted to deputy assistant secretary of foreign affairs by Ron Brown as secretary and was named vice president of the Democratic Party. Ron Brown's mysterious accidental accident is a suspected espionage spy John Huang?
             </p>
             <p>
              Name John Huang attended 37 secret meetings in the White House, so the Chinese know a lot of things to benefit Beijing. After the spying of John Huang was discovered, White House drove into the sex scandal Monica Lewinsky to fill and this case sank for the prestige of the United States and the CIA lost face, the reason is Bill Clinton has. Bound by civil rights laws.

              In the days of Bill Clinton, outwardly he raised the issue of human rights, attacked China, but internally regarded China as a "cooperative partner". Consequently, the United States released the zoo in 1994 to meet the "purpose of claiming rights" to Chinese vassals and also saved the regime from extinction, which lasted until day. Now, to progressively integrate and assimilate into China. According to Molon Lave Media on June 8, 2016, entitled "The Clintons' Treason, China's GPS Technology and FAA GPS Warnings."
             </p>
             <p>
              President Bill Clinton received China's illegal donation to run for a second term in 1996 called CHINAGATE. This scandal was so serious in US history that Bill Clinton switched to the purest missile technology of defense, the "Global Position System" GPS aims to receive millions of dollars in unlawful donations to the Clintin-Al Gore election campaign in 1996.
             </p>
             <p>
              Today China grows and competes aggressively with the United States because it has succeeded in "buying US President Bill Clinton" since the 1990s. Hillary now resigns as president. The first US "is also a concern for the UNITED STATES, when the Bill-Hillary family was very much in debt to make money for China if he was elected president.
