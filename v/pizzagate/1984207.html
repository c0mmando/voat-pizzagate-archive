            This this selling out to China by the Clinton's was done in conjunction with the Bush's. Look how Jeb and Congressman Tom Feeney of Florida did this too! Jeb sold out our missile technology to China. I'll put a link to the investigative story that no one would touch!

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Late last year, Congress heard sworn testimony from Florida programmer Clint Curtis, who created vote-rigging software in 2000 at the request of Tom Feeny, a Bush Family factotum. Feeny wanted Curtis (a fellow Republican) and his employer, Yang Enterprises, to produce untraceable programs that could 'control the vote' as needed, investigator Brad Friedman reported. Feeny also told Curtis of Bush plans to 'suppress the black vote' with 'exclusion lists.' This is exactly what happened. BBC investigator Greg Palast has shown that tens of thousands of legitimate African-American voters were deliberately 'purged' from the rolls by a private Republican-controlled corporation hired by Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Afterwards, Feeny - who had been Jeb's running mate in his first gubernatorial campaign - was rewarded for his dutiful service with a plum congressional seat.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2002, Raymond Lemme, a Florida state government inspector, took up Curtis' charges, which included other corruption allegations involving Feeny, Yang Enterprises and a Yang employee charged with peddling military technology to the Chinese. In June 2003, Lemme told Curtis he had 'tracked the corruption all the way to the top' and that 'the story would break in a few weeks.' On July 1, 2003, Lemme was found dead in a Georgia hotel room, just across the Florida border.

             For the purpose of exploring the reasons China has grown up thanks to the United States, and especially the president who was bought out by Chinese businessmen who disguised themselves as businessmen, In the United States, hit the ham psychology that sells national interests just because of donations. China has a rather sophisticated bribery regime.

            <p>
             Beijing is not able to cope with the mighty United States in terms of military, economic, political, scientific and technological ... However, China often uses its top leaders to serve the right. Their benefit, like the sentence: "Lion lion, lions humiliation." No one is capable of defeating the superpower, but only the maggots at the head of the brain are making the United States weak, favoring China's many benefits thanks to those who " Internal "within the White House. 
According to Capitalism is freedom and the Daily Mail on July 29, 2016, China had "invested" and "bought" Bill and Hillary Clinton since the 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not unusual. With "ma ze in China" dating back to ancient times, the mirror of the "King of the Sultan" was born by a businessman named Zhao En (292-235 BC), after the general of Qin Dynasty during the war. Zhao Zhi, who had brought his concubine, Zhao Zhou, was pregnant to "invest" in the united kings who had never met as Zuo and used the money to create opportunities for his son. By bribery. In the end, La Vi was successful, Tu Su son was King and son of La Vi Vi is Business, later successor, that is King Qin Shi Huang.

             The king of words, especially the purchase of a president of the super-power that Americans still "ignorant school do not know," even the United States Democrats gathering political figures, not only Ignoring but also trusting Hillary again in the 2016 presidential election: also closed eyes for. Try to see the United States muscle crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the 1990s China has "bought the throne without the throne" of the United States' superpower and until now the truth has exposed, surely the country, Americans have suffered much during the eight years of the presidency Bill Clinton, first lady Hillary served as senator and 4 years as foreign minister at the time of Barack Obama.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ng. Lap Seng - Bill Clinton - Hillary Clinton Since the 1990s, Chinese billionaire hand is Ng. 68-year-old Lap Seng has been interviewed by the Daily Mail about how he has been in the US Congress for many years now. This is not the counter intelligence agencies, US intelligence as CIA or FBI bad, but by the president, the military commander who became the recipient of the Chinese money, of course must return by the government New national welfare danger. President Bill Clinton, a veteran lawyer who served as Arkansas governor, used his legal capacity, his salary, and his experience to limit the CIA's authority. Important issues related to national security.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is also Bill Clinton's triumph to "pay off" those who illegally spend Beijing through "backstage donations" and also detrimental to national security, so terrorists take advantage of the gap. The law and limits of the CIA, the FBI that the training organization, penetrated in the United States, when President George. W. Bush new, see the adverse situation should Al Qaeda "first downplayed through terror" September 11, 2001.

             The "Ma Ze in China" has had a "donation" process for more than 20 years abroad, with the primary goal of targeting politicians, presidential candidates and present day donors. This has been questioned by parliament, affecting Hillary Clinton's ambition to move the White House again and now the record of China has been "depositing" the purchase of President Bill Clinton since the 1990s. Today's old lesson can happen again with Hillary becoming the Democratic presidential nominee nominated for the party congress that took place at the end of July 2016.

              Chinese state billionaire Ng Lap Seng is re-emerging in New York City and has been subject to detentions of bribery and bribery charges and is likely to be sanctioned by US law. A group of activists and members of the US Congress should give him immunity if he submits the truth about big donations to Bill Clinton and from what Bill gave to Trung.

              Ng Lap Seng, a businessman in Macau, very close to the Beijing regime, was charged with illegally donating money from abroad. During this time, Ng Lap Seng refused to go to the US to respond to the congressional referral from abroad after the government discovered it. Well, the reason is that the United States needs to wipe out China's tendency to invest in the president, which has an opportunity to influence through elections, which donate foreign money illegally.

              According to a survey of some members of Congress, the name Ng. Lap Seng illegally laundered money through the Clinton campaign in Arkansas in 1996, taking the American name of Charlie Trie through the eyes of security agencies, Tax office, treasury. The name Ng Lap Seng under the US name is Charlie Trie to camouflage the involvement and behind the Chinese Communist Party mastermind. The name Charlie Trie was donated to the Democratic National Committee and the Bill Clinton Bill when Bill pleaded guilty to violating the financial advocacy principles of the 1996 election campaign.

              Republican Sen. Fred Thompson, who also chairs the commission, has found that the Chinese ruling party has plotted and handed over the immense power structure of the United States by dumping money illegally. In the US elections, the "brokers of the presidential mercenaries, politicians" under the guise of wealthy merchants, afforded the money and then politicized the government to benefit Beijing. It is this illegal spill that has the potential to knock down America's electoral system, according to The Washington Post.

On the other hand, according to Ng Lap Seng's lawyer, Hugh Hu Mo, and on behalf of the Chinese state, this justifies the US Congress interrogating his client's lawyers in China. "Here.

It has been possible to influence the future of his wife, Hillary, although she has been nominated by the Democrats to be the "old hen" of Recycle in the race for billionaire Donald.

              Republican rival Donald Trump uses tricks to exploit Hillary's "weaknesses" and their families so that US voters recognize the deceitfulness of their opponents to win the upper hand in the run. Sprint Race for the White House. It is certain that from now until November 2016 there will be some gloomy weather in the Bill Clinton family, so publicly debated, Hillary is unlikely to defend the obvious evidence presented, Even in the law profession, the defense can not be "innocent" for a client who has been found guilty by the judge: Alone burdens seven.

              John Huang talks about Chinese hands deep in the White House, known as the super spy "ma ze in China" as John Huang exploited the amusement of Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to invade.

Now, to progressively integrate and assimilate into China. According to Molon Lave Media on June 8, 2016, entitled "The Clintons' Treason, China's GPS Technology and FAA GPS Warnings."

              President Bill Clinton received China's illegal donation to run for a second term in 1996 called CHINAGATE.

              Today China grows and competes aggressively with the United States because it has succeeded in "buying US President Bill Clinton" since the 1990s. Hillary now resigns as president. The first US "is also a concern for the UNITED STATES, when the Bill-Hillary family was very much in debt to make money for China if he was elected president.
