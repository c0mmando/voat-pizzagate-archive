            Thx. Yes I had the van post from way back but I still can't find the giant stuffed animal bear on the dock.
            <br/>
            Maybe it wasn't posted by werkinonmynightcheese. Might have been the brother or a follower or someone he was following. I'm so frustrated that I didn't save it way back.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might have been in the series of instagram posts by a coffee shop person?? Remember that? People were reaching about the coffee shop being like a pizza shop with beans being a code word. It was a stretch, but maybe it was while looking through the coffee shop persons posts that I ran across the giant stuffed animal bear on a loading dock.

            You have no proof of what you are saying, you are speculating this to be the case.  And I can tell you I have seen vans with horizontal boards on them and the boards were not there to attach plywood or concreteboard.  It's probably concrete board and that is probably what is meant by the comment.  The other voater mentioned HardieBacker that's a brand of "concrete" board pre-made and sold like plywood or sheetrock

            The vans I worked with that horizontal boards were to provide places you could hook your bungee cords or tie down straps when you are transporting unusually shaped objects.  You want to make sure they don't slide around in back.

             You are correct.  My painter has a van like this.  All the tools etc are attached to the sides
            </p>
            <p>
             The hardiboard is probably going to be used to build something.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only thing I find strange about this van is how low it is to the ground.

             But I wouldn't doubt that it's not used for both construction projects as well as transporting children.  The guy calls himself a pedo on instagram

            Also possible that they wanted a photo out of them using the van for legit purposes in case questions get asked later on. It's also interesting, given the research here, that they need load bearing waterproof building materials. I don't think, however, that this photo will take anybody down.

            The vans ‚Äî let‚Äôs see if I can adequately tell you what they look like so that you could recognized one when you see one. They come in a couple of different sizes. The biggest carries a 100 slaves. The smallest about 20, drugged and thrown in on the floor. That is not very big. They are really Ryder sized vans. But they have no over-the-cab van space as no kids go up in such a space.
           </p>
           <p>
            The insides are a plain rectangle. The outside walls are about a foot thick and they are rounded on the outside. Their floors are surprisingly low to the ground like Ryders because the drugged kids are heavy and no one wants to lift them up, if one doesn‚Äôt have to. It almost always happens that some of the kids do not wake up between the ships and the vans.
           </p>

            Edit: Forgot to ask if this is the description you are referring to.

             Interesting.  I've never seen a van low to the ground??? And sure enough look how low that van is.  Very strange.  It looks way lower than a normal sooner mom minivan

            It looks to me like they are transporting cement board. It is commonly used for flooring under tile to be used in higher load bearing situations and situations where water or wetness will be common. A coating can be applied to make it waterproof. It's like plywood, but stronger and waterproof.

            I think this is actually called "strapping". It is commonly used in moving trucks to tie large/heavy/fragile items to the sides to prevent damage. If you are transporting people against their will, you could use these to anchor them to. I don't think it is intended to have plywood attached, however.

            Oh I am so glad you posted that pic.  I thought JP had a van that was reinforced in some way as well.  So obvious.  Why would anyone need something like that if not for humans or animals.  Or humans treated like animals.  I think Podesta's was a black very expensive type of SUV like Hillary's?  I remember seeing it on here.

            It's not what I want to believe I asking about the facts.  His business is custom metal work, not coffins, if I remember correctly.

             the fact that someone would seek him out for such a "special" project validates my theory of him being a builder who could conceal evidence by using the soiled materials in his projects. Just build something with the bloodied plywood, paint it black, and voila bye-bye evidence.
            </p>

           <p>
            I agree he builds things.  But where does that leave us?

            Your theory is an issue I have with pizzagate style investigation.  People who think being an investigator is akin to being a screenwriter where you can make up speculative scenarios and then uses those scenarios to justify more speculation.  (Pig farms, tunnels, shipping containers, oh my!)  That's not how an actual investigation concerned with finding out the truth works.  Just because you imagine something or the capability exists doesn't mean you've actually learned anything about your subject.  I could imagine a million different things they do with that van, but it doesn't make it so.  All that instragram post tells me is he has a van and occasionally hauls plywood.

            People always say this.  Is there any evidence he built more than one?  My understanding that small coffin was a custom job somebody requested and it was not an actual coffin.

            Transporting Hardee Backer? Do you have a picture of it actually being used to reinforce the side of the van, or just on the floor?

            This is where we lose people. That is a really dramatic explanation of what's happening.

             Yeah, this fantasy clearly doesn't describe that van

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And the van couldn't be hosed off without the plywood ?  Plywood makes a much better surface to catch and absorb evidence than the inside of a van does.  It blood is absorbed by the wood, it would not simply disappear with a hosing.   Where does one find this magical stronger plywood?
