<p>A Christchurch man has avoided jail time, for a range of offences involving child sex abuse images.</p>
<p>Truck driver Vincenzo Tyrone Wiremu, 24, pleaded guilty to 41 charges of making, distributing and possessing objectionable images, videos and texts depicting the sexual exploitation and abuse of children as young as toddlers.</p>
<p>The Rolleston man has been sentenced to two years intensive supervision and has been ordered to attend the STOP programme for sexual offenders.</p>
<p>Wiremu was first investigated by the Department of Internal Affairs after he uploaded the 20 videos to a storage website in 2015.</p>
<p>It was then discovered he was distributing pictures of the children online, encouraging traders to gain access to his password-protected albums.</p>
<p>Judge Jane Farish said two of the girls had their pictures traded in a way that ruined their lives, with ongoing attempts by sex offenders to locate and contact them.</p>
<p>A 5 ½ year imprisonment was recommended by Internal Affairs prosecutor, Marty Robinson. However Judge Farish instead opted for a supervision order on recommendation from a psychologist.</p>

<p>What disturbs me beyond the obvious is how this feels like an obvious \'show\' of what lies ahead for the politicians who have been caught with and/or distributing child porn in this country.  There are already people at the top who\'ve been named... i.e, Mike Sabin (if memory serves me right).... and gotten away with child sex abuse scot-free.</p>
<p>Gone seems to be the times of old where even one child porn picture gets you a hefty fine and a twelve-month home detention sentence... along with a loss of job, social status, etc,. (a late uncle of mine had an image planted on his computer by his asshole (adult) son, who then lodged the complaint to cops and although he did finally up to his desire to frame his dad, it was too late and his father was made an example of as a warning to the pedophile community at large).</p>
<p>And yet here is this young guy, an obvious pedophile..... and he gets no jail time for his offences!</p>
<p>It stinks real badly here in NZ and I fear for the children of my country.</p>
<p>**
I\'m sharing this to show that pizzagate occurs elsewhere, and sadly some of the scum are getting away with it -- my personal suspicions are that this is to set a precedent for allowing this filth in our communities.  Perhaps particularly by those in a higher position who are currently under investigation - or might soon be.</p>',

            The judge needs to be called out publicly and repeatedly on social media for this travesty of justice.  She said the girls' lives were ruined and then goes on to ignore the prosecution's recommendation and give the creep no prison time??  She is apparently a serial pedo coddler.  Here's another case:

            We're doomed I tell you. Between this endless shit show of "justice", the increasingly hostile rhetoric of those less skeptical of the corprorate overlords and the ever-bolder displays of "fuck the goyim swine, we're invincible", I don't see any way out of this pitchblack nightmare. I refuse to go back to "live your own life happy, be a good person thats all we can do". Fuck that, and fuck anybody who's half-woke and deliberately choses to stick head in sand. So long, and thanks for all the fish.
