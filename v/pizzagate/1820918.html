            This is so sad. It is unbearable to read story after story of dead babies &amp; children. So desperately want to make it all go away. The truth is if we who know this truth do not continuously push it forward it will be buried and more babies will be slaughtered. Not just in other other countries but in the United States as they have been in secret. Not that it matters which country how can the world stand by and live with the truths that have been discovered.

            Pope Francis was complicit in the Argentine dirty wars. He is the first ever Jesuit Pope and was personally identified by an eye witness as being involved in sacrifice. To really understand the significance of a Jesuit being placed as Pope would encourage everyone to research the Jesuit Order. This is one of the oldest and most powerful secret societies in existence. Also research why this occurred in 2013 and who was behind it.
           </p>
           <p>
            When this occurred it took all the Jesuits and placed them under papal law. The CIA is a Jesuit Order. That does not mean they will all obey but it was founded as a Jesuit order. Most universities ecspecially law schools are Jesuit universities. This was intentional.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the most encouraging things that happened during the election was when Donald Trump spoke out against Pope Francis. Pope Francis spoke out against Trump on a few occasions even tweeting him saying he was not a good person because DJT was stating terroism was real &amp; dangerous. Pope Francis also compared fake news to eating excrement.
           </p>
           <p>
            DJTrump openly spoke out against him on numerous occasions. He sent twitter rants back at him, etc.
Now many might think that is disrespectful but this is great news for anyone who wants to believe DJTrump will not submit to Rome instead only to the constitution. It also means he in all likelihood does not belong to the secret society as Newt Gingrich mentioned on live television that DJTrump was not a member nor had been initiated into "the secret clubs"
           </p>
           <p>
            When DJTrump spoke out aggressively against Pope Francis it sent shockwaves across the world as it was happening. Many did not pay attention here in the US.
           </p>
           <p>
            The jury is out on still but it seems like a good sign that Trump would speak out aggressively against Pope Francis.

            , it most certainly is PG related -- we definite it as the sexual abuse and trafficking of kids by the global elite, and this was perpetrated by the elite of Argentina. It is also very inspirational:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the plaza, Delia met other women who were looking for pregnant daughters or daughters-in-law. Soon they were meeting in parks and coffee shops. They’d bring props like knitting or birthday gifts to pass themselves off as harmless grandmothers on a social call. But really they were plotting investigations. The women made the rounds at candy stores and orphanages and spied on families that might have acquired a child under murky circumstances. They gathered evidence and stuck it in tin cans that they buried in their gardens.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            Jorge Bergoglio (Pope Francis) was guilty of turning his head the other way when it came to clergy sexual abuse otf children in Argentina.  I cannot find the info now, still looking, but I remember reading that he also was implicated in letting the Pres. of Argentina allow many babies and small children be taken out of the country.  He is a Jesuit and he also was in lockstep with the CIA's "Operation Condor" and "Dirty War" which involved Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller.

              I was so hopeful when they elected him.   But my bubbles were burst when I was red pilled.  I had hoped for so long that the abusive priests would be punished.  Now I am waiting for him to be punished.  I have not been a practicing Catholic for many years, but this seemed good, now it is just a continuation and  Ratzinger is kept away from those that might punish him.

               It might help you to know that the original church still exists (continuously since it's founding on Pentecost) and that the Latin "Catholic" church is a result of heresy that was created in order for banking and war to dominate the west.

                Although I am not Hispanic I love the language.  I pray in Spanish and I love the original Latin Mass.  That was a mistake I believe, changing it.

                 The early Church Fathers (back when there was only ONE Christian Church, decided that the Divine Liturgy (the sola scriptura worship that was truncated and altered to create the Latin "mass" after 1054 AD) should be in the language of the people who are performing it. The original church language for the Divine Liturgy is Koine Greek--which is also the language the New Testament was written in. No one speaks Koine Greek today, nor do they speak Latin. What good is it to worship God if you do not even understand the words you are saying? We are NOT talking about magic or occult mumbo jumbo, just to be clear. In worshiping our Creator, we speak as we normally do. You can pray the Divine Liturgy in Spanish, if you like:

                  Thank you for your information.  I shall look into it, and must agree,  I am a little partial to the old mass since I learned it going to school.  The Spanish Prayers are as close as I have come.

                   The old mass is an abbreviated, somewhat adulterated, version of the over 1600 year old Divine Liturgy. If you liked the "old mass", you will certainly love the Divine Liturgy.

                   There is a famous bishop-martyr who was once a Franciscan monk who came back to the true church. He wrote a book about it. Here is a summary of his journey in this article about this saintly, educated man:

             It's true, he was complicit with child trafficking. Children of political prisoners and babies of prisoners who gave birth in prison were taken away and never seen again. I found a bunch of stuff awhile back, I'll see if I can dig it up again. When I found out the new pope was Jesuit, I knew there would be some nasty moldy skeletons in his closet.
