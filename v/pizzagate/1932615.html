<ol>
<li>
<p>Involved in swiping children in the aftermath of the Haiti disaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hillary Clinton had Huma Abedin follow Silsby\'s activities and report to her</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Particularly, Huma alerted Hillary when it looked like prosecutors were going to try to jail Silsby in Haiti.</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772</a></p>
<p>and Hillary moved to get Silsby off using State Department resources.</p>
<p>Fine, that\'s all old stuf. Well known.</p>
<p>What you may not know is that Laura Silsby got married in 2015, which gave her the opportunity to take her new husbands last name. She now goes by the name Laura Gayle, shedding the baggage her old name brings to everyones mind.</p>
<p>And somehow, she has been handed a Vice President job at the AlertSense Software company of Boise, Idaho!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/">https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/</a></p>
<p>Yep, she\'s put on a little weight, but that\'s definitely Laura Silsby there on the Executive Team page. Here\'s a photo of her from her detention in the DR &amp; Haiti for comparison: <a href="https://faithandthelaw.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/030810_laura_silsby.jpg">https://faithandthelaw.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/030810_laura_silsby.jpg</a></p>
<p>If you mouse over her picture, a little bio pops up: &quot;Laura leads product marketing, business planning, and outbound communications for AlertSense. She has nearly 25 years experience in business strategy, finance and marketing having worked at HP, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and ecommerce/tech startups.&quot;</p>
<p>That bio kind of tells the truth about her, but it\'s significant what they leave out.</p>
<p>So Laura did work at HP, where she met a guy called James Hammons, and teamed up with him to start a dot com called Personal Shopper Inc.</p>
<p>Fine, so she has experience running a tech startup, just like the bio says. But what it leaves out is the fact that Silsby and Personal Shopper Inc. have been sued numerous time for breach of contract, unpaid wages and wrongful termination. And the plaintiffs seem to win every time.</p>

<p>The lady even has a bunch of traffic citations for driving without insurance and for driving without having renewed her license.</p>
<p>This woman clearly couldn\'t manage her way out of a wet paper bag. She obviously doesn\'t attend to important details at the company she founded, she can\'t even get her act together enough to renew her drivers license on time. And now she\'s a Vice President at AlertSense? </p>
<p>There\'s no way someone living in Idaho could not have known about her track record. Her fiascos at Personal Shopper Inc. were well publicized in the local media at the time.</p>
<p>This smacks of payoff to me. AlertSense\'s major client is FEMA. Did someone intervene to get Laura a job as a reward for loyalty. Or did AlertSense really want her for her connections that go way up high in the State Department?</p>
<p>This is as much as I know. Maybe someone in Idaho knows more about the circumstances of her hiring/payoff?</p>',

             Not that there isn't immediately a lot wrong with FEMA which seems to have the paperwork outline 
to be a new Nazi/CIA organization . . . . but this would seem to also taint that organization as to 
child trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually, when we add up all of the trafficking -- human trafficking, child trafficking, organ trafficking, drug trafficking, arms trafficking -- it would seem to me that every part of our government would have to be corrupted in order to not only permit and govern the traffic but to cover it up and keep it covered up long term.
            </p>
            <p>
             And of course, NSA which is recording all of this data 24/7 has to also know.
            </p>
            <p>
             And since 1963 and the coup on JFK and our people's government, that seems to be what our government is all about, on every level .... i.e., High Treason: High Level Crime nationwide and internationally -- and High Level Cover up of these crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             PS:
This has to also include our Military as Det. Rothstein/NYPD has mentioned at the end of this video.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the break in. &gt;
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             In earlier days, LBJ and Bobby Baker were running an operation where women of the day or evening were available in various hotel rooms to members of Congress whom LBJ and Baker were looking to compromise, blackmail.

             So a child kidnapper is working for the company that issues kidnapping alerts? These people really have no shame.

              She might not even be the only one at AlertSense that is um untrustworthy. What if the plan is to get pizza friendly people positioned such that they can selectively sabotage amber alerts when the abductor is one of theirs.

               Ncmec started this whole amber alert thing. Ncmec and Icmec are up to their eyeballs with pedos, lots of money, lots of access to cp (incl video), and horrible results. I have no proof but circumstantial evidence suggests that they started these alerts for no honorable reason. So the fact that silsby is involved isn't very shocking. Probably best to look at what's staring us in the face instead of making excuses for these sob's. it's all out in the open. #eyeswideshut

               I didn't think of that, but it is a rather horrifying possibility!

               We know that the difference between ordinary pedophile rings and elite pedophile rings is that the elites position minions in politics, law enforcement, the judiciary, and other places to set up a system that prevents complaints and investigations from happening.
              </p>
              <p>
               There could be nothing more attractive to elite pedophiles than being able to cut off publicity of their kidnappings right at the source.
