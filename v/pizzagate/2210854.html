<p>Out of curiosity, and I tried to figure out roughly where the point of the pizza slice was.  I settled on here, based on the peaks presented in the mural.

<p>Sky Ranch  <a href="http://skyranch.org/">http://skyranch.org/</a>
Its a christian childrens camp.  So I started looking into who owned it and worked there.

<p>One guy really stood out to me, John Walsh.<br />
<a href="http://www.tigusa.com/agents/john-walsh-iii/">http://www.tigusa.com/agents/john-walsh-iii/</a></p>
<p>I thought \'damn, that face looks really familiar\'. Then I remembered seeing an alefantis/rothschild comparison on voat this morning.<br />
<a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FC7uyvCMU8AAH577.jpg&amp;f=1">https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FC7uyvCMU8AAH577.jpg&amp;f=1</a></p>
<p>Now what really spooked me about this was that while I was up there, I stopped by a burger place.  I ended up talking to a lady who had moved to the town from Virginia, who had a surprising interest in my kids and wanted to buy them icecream and told them they could come live with her if my wife and I didnt buy them enough icecream.  Innocuous enough, what I would normally expect from small town conversations waiting on food to be prepared, but I talked to my wife about it and she said it all seemed odd.  She did some facebook stalking to find the lady.  I\'m not going to share her name or facebook page, but I\'ll be damned if the lady didn\'t have the same nose, smile, creases, and chin as alefantis and walsh.  I\'m talking could easily pass for a sister of one of them.

<p>I\'ll throw this into the mix as well:

Another relatively close small town pizza place with the swirls and creepy murals inside, in a town with a history of literal underground activity and tunnels that are closed off to the public.  Additionally, there are a number of ongoing investigations within law enforcement here, for cover ups, murders, and missing evidence.

<p>Any names or places look familiar here?  Do I possibly have something worth looking into with a bit more detail?</p>',

            Sky Ranch website has one thing odd visually compelling....to me. A boring yet perturbing detail. There is a very very dull background image of a map. Does that indicate Minor Attracted Person or is just a very washed out map in the background. The washedoutness gives the veiwer the feeling of unsmartness. Like there is some mystery it's scientific but we don't understand because we can't see it. I opened a video about sky Ranch and took a screenshot, maps are key in Sky's messages, every message to you is on a mao. Is that about a journey to God or is it about Mappers being  pedophiles?

            I think this is a extremely pertinent find. Way relevant to the trafficking in our states of kids and this is the symbology we have seen before this is the math we have seen before the angles, not necessarily pyramids, spirals, pizza,  the codedness obvious the secrecy is out . Creeped out for reason a hub of traffic is Colorado. Huge huge huge

            Just looked for this post and it had dissapeared from top. Am I wrong? Paul Bonacci led cops to Colorado house people say was owned by security gaurd who went missing. The house in Colorado where they kept Johnny gosh was owned by a security guard who went missing

I know this is an old comment but I just watched it and came across this comment. I think there are a lot of suspicious things surrounding the police department itself. The house they were stashed in was owned by a police, right? That just "went missing"? And the cop that was known for fixing the books keeps coming up with reasons not to interview the admitted kidnapper? It really sounds like there was some pedophiles in the police department covering it up. Or maybe I watch too many crime documentaries.

I found this whilst watching the documentary too and it says the house they were in was owned by a prison guard that 'went missing'____

             not in the same area, but there are a lot of very isolated and very expensive ranches through this area.  lots of international travelers into the area for horse training and rodeo stuff.

            Hey I attended Sky Ranch Lutheran Camp For 1 week a summer in 1985,86,87. There was nothing weird! We was separated into boys and girls, at night and slept in lil cabins. We all had big bon fires and sang. During the day we went on nature hikes, canoed, picnic lunches by the creeks.

             Not saying there is anything to it.  I honestly only picked it as it seemed to be the closest thing lining up to where the pizza slice pointed.

            Personally I would not even buy food in a town like that. Maybe I've watched to many Twilight Zones :)  Not like the cabal is against drugging.  Traveling with kids, rural area with shady rep...be careful please.

               Another relatively close small town pizza place with the swirls and creepy murals inside, in a town with a history of literal underground activity and tunnels that are closed off to the public. Additionally, there are a number of ongoing investigations within law enforcement here, for cover ups, murders, and missing evidence.

            Colorado gives me the creeps in general.... too many stories! but this 'xtian' camp is super creepo-- esp the all male staff as someone mentioned....   the other thing that jumps out at me is the REAL Estate connection with Walsh.... of course, rich people would invest in real estate, but the patterns with these guys seems to be international real estate or multiple large developments.... not the usual businesses, rentals or multiple family homes...... paddock's real estate history is esp strange....

             The reason being that they have not changes the sign/mural yet? Look closely at this special license plate from my State, if I can correctly link this.Lauren's Kids. Not sure that went through, but what I see is two butterfly's, one inside, and one outside a carefully concealed double heart with a slice of pepperoni pizza within the heart. Not sure if this particular 'saving abused kids charity' has been covered already, but I could not help but to notice, because this person was driving like an idiot, and I had nothing better to do but stare at this odd plate.

             Yeah, definitely symbolism there regarding the entering of hidden dimensions or whatever garbage these morons believe in. Also, note the "boy lover" swirls on the pizza. As I recall, Crowley and other high-ranking Freemasons believe that one can somehow connect with other dimensions by anally raping a boy child. They call it opening the third eye or something. I know, it is absolutely vile. This belief of course probably originally comes from Talmudic Judaism, like basically all of Freemasonry and modern-day occultism does. We of course know the fascination that kikes have with raping children and committing all other transgressions imaginable. Their Talmud furnishes examples aplenty.

            I don't know how to directly link to the images on mobile but that last pizza place, go to the "pizza maddness"'s Google link. Check out the atmosphere images and look at the last images on the images posted by the owner.

            Pizza with swirls. Zombie swirl eyes (owners image shows only two people with swirl eyes in entire mural.)  Girl in bikini with butterfly tattoo. American eagle holding pizza with swirls on guys shirt. Bikini girl is pouring beer (servicing) the criminal chained to the sheriff. Bikini girl has meatball earrings. Sheriff is being fed a meatball sandwich by the criminal. Meatballs mean something here. The criminal is being fed a single peanut by the chef. The chef is feeding people at his other side a tiny pizza. Girl hanging off of swirly eyed guy has a bee drawing nectar from a flower on the top of her head.

            There is also the Sangre de Cristo Seminary nearby.  BLOOD of Christ.  Priests in the area of the Camp and a Pizza Place with Swirls.  Hmm.  What could go wrong here? Is the Sangre deCristo a Jesuit Order? Let me find out about that Seminary.

             Also that this is the furthest such preserved lands that are not in close proximity to First Nation. Injuns like to walk and observe. A rez dog might just kill someone if they see fit. I really don't know much about the area at all, and am just guessing. Seems like there might be a control system there, and the roads lead into several states with lots of opportunities for safe houses. Good eyes Dkeere, and I got some too, but I am waiting on a connection.

              This area and some of the places in it look really sketchy and it is odd that they are all grouped together.  I too think the woman's response at the ice cream place is really very strange thing to say to children.  There are enough oddities here to warrant an investigation of sorts, or research, if you will.

              I know they are very long.  My dream has always been to visit the in Mexico where the Monarch Butterflies migrate to every year.  But that name is usually used by Catholic Religion.  Not that it can't be used by others due to the Mountain Area.  I have discovered that the Seminary  is not a Religious Order.  The  Faculty heads are Father and Son and were both Chaplains the father being in the Navy and son in the Army.  I find it odd that the Faculty is All Male, since some are married, I was thinking they would be more open, since many now are.  The Son  to me has a creepy look, but that is just my opinion

            very strange. thanks for posting! I drop in once every few weeks or less. When I have time. I'm not near there and if some of that was going on where I was, there would be a shtstorm. Colorado's a little 'different'.

            Edit: Comparing those photos. There is also a photo comparison of the Rothschilds with Sabbati Zevi. Very close physical features. The eyebrows etc. On the John Walsh III and the Philippine de Rotschild and James 'I like Children' Alefantis: The Eyebrows, The Nose, The Creases and the Mouth stand out, as well as the general shape of the head/face.

            Are we able to embed images in these replies?
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Here are far more Rothschild photo comparisons to compare with 'James', 'John Walsh' and Phillipine

             Plausible, as the Mythbusters would say, for the simple reason as well that later on after he had died it came out that Shabbati Zevi might have been a cannibal and pedophile. This is something most Jews don't want to talk about at all, and if you even bring up that name with certain Jews they will not say one word or opinion but then later go batshit crazy over even the mere mention that their Messiah was such a cuck.

              There is no doubt that Zevi was a child rapist. Being such is an integral part of being a Rabbinic "Jew". The Talmud is brimming with passages endorsing the rape of children, incest, bestiality, sodomy, and much more. Who knows what exact percentage of kikes are child rapists, but the number must be alarmingly high. As far as the antichrist messiah of kikes goes, some may have considered Zevi one, but actually the Talmud tells kikes that they are collectively "the messiah", in other words each and every kike is "god" in his own right. Of course high-ranking Freemasons feel the same, which is hardly a surprise, since their belief system is basically a ripoff of Talmudic Judaism/Kabbalah.

               Wrath, I can tell you right now that as a person who is now a Sabbath keeping Christian and former Orthodox Jew that the Talmud is garbage. It is complete and utter garbage and I for one will never go back to that dark place. I've honestly had family members disown my mom and I and will have nothing to do with us just because I became a Christian and believe in the one true Messiah as well as I will never be able to make Aliyah nor will my children because if you are a Jew and you convert to Christianity, even if you still keep Kosher, the Sabbath, and the High Holy Days, you are considered an enemy and will never be part of the Jewish community. It's even worse if you are a Kohana(Sephardic Levite, aka the Preisthood tribe) because they will spit on you in the streets for converting. This happened to my mom when she was just 24 years old and I was just a baby, less than  a year old.  But in the grand scheme of things I guess that is a good thing because then we don't have to join up the IDF. I do still have family members in Israel that I keep in contact with but in all honesty I have a ton of family, my mom is one of 13 kids, but a good vast majority have nothing to do with me, my family or the American part of my Grandpa's kids because my Grandfather converted as well to Messianic Judaism. So to wrap all of this up, I know all too well the in's and outs of the Talmudic Jews.

                Thanks for the information. Good for you if indeed you have accepted Christ as your Lord and Savior! That must be quite unusual for individuals of your background.
