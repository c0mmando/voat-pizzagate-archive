            And now we begin to see why the previous trump and kavanaugh etc accusers did not need to be credible or sane - because the constant lying accuser insanity would dull the publicâ€™s belief for a time when the mother load was released on the real sickos...

            I am thrilled, BUT ... what you're saying is not completely true. I didn't know a dozen more women have come forward ... and juxtaposition them coming forward with what happened with that hag E. Jean Carroll and her story about modelitng lingerie for a stranger in Bergdorfs. Also look at what the coverage has said. The media is pressing the narrative that Trump and Epstein are alike? And that they are friends?
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile photos of Clinton w/Epstein are being purged. So thanks for the post, thanks for your insights, but ... the coverage ... much to be desired.

             Epstein's arrest could have been a pre-emptive strike by his handlers.....to frame Trump. Don't forget, Comey's daughter is involved with this case. All the photos of Trump and Epstein are out there. Their first attempt, the fake Russian dossier, failed. Perhaps this is their second try. Acosta has already been forced out. He would have had lot's of first-hand knowledge on Epstein's original plea deal. I'm just watching it all unfold.

              It could be, but I don't think so. Trump was talking about an Epstein take down in 2015 and included Bill Clinton in his scenario. So it really looks as if Trump had his eye on the ball.
             </p>
             <p>
              From Vanity Fair:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               <a href="https://pjmedia.com/trending/vanity-fair-trump-knew-jeffrey-epstein-had-incriminating-photos-of-bill-clinton/">
                https://pjmedia.com/trending/vanity-fair-trump-knew-jeffrey-epstein-had-incriminating-photos-of-bill-clinton/
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump knew what he was talking about. Vanity Fair reports that, shortly before CPAC, Trump was approached by David Pecker, who then owned the National Enquirer. Pecker visited Trump and brought along "an issue with a Prince Andrew and Epstein-related cover." They were joined by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.
              </p>
              <p>
               After the meeting, Trump called in Sam Nunberg, who then worked for him. Nunberg told Vanity Fair:
              </p>
              <p>
               â€œMichael was sitting in there when I came in, and the issue of the National Enquirer with the pictures of Prince Andrew was on his desk. He said not to tell anyone, but that Pecker had just been there and had brought the issue with him. Trump said that Pecker had told him that the pictures of Clinton that Epstein had from his island were worse."
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Okay, so it's here I'm going to have to go back to Stormy Daniels. I'm not a fan or follower of Q, BUT Q said to trust Daniels because that lawsuit would prompt files being taken from Cohen's office and that that's what they were after. So it's peculiar that it was Michael Cohen that just happened to be in on this conversation. Now that I found Sessions really was grinding out those sealed indictments and that all hell is breaking loose in Arkansas, I'm starting to think that Q is legit, and if he is, he positively said they have everything and are in control. So if they have everything they need there is no way they don't have the tape/evidence they need. And if they have tape that shows a naked Skankes and/or Bill in those tunnels ... it's over for them. Kaput. No glossy veneer can withstand that kind of perversity.
