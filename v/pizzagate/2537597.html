            If a stranger commits a crime against me I'd want everyone to know. Mabye if it's like an older sibling who molested you I could see reasons to not want it out in the public, but this is most certainly about either preventing racism or protecting the mall.

            Soon people are gonna realize that the police can’t/won’t keep kids safe. Even the police that have kids... Here we are, citizens and parents becoming our own journalists and protectors.

             People need to understand that nothing and nowhere is safe. There are only less or more opportunities to be a target or a victim. As individuals we need to protect ourselves as much as possible, and teach our children those same instincts.

              It sure is.  AND what really stands out for me is that some were not worried.  There were covered up rapes for Pete's Sake. This is not some made up story.  LE covered it up.  They should seriously be Screaming their heads off and Demanding Answers.  The Chief should be Broiled in Oil.

              Yes well I am sure many will say that the mall near their house is OK.  And maybe it is if you are alert.  But this mall had complaints.   Really dopey.  There is something weird with that mall.  Needs Investigating for sure.

                Well, yes.  Many decades ago, people did not get around as easy.  Now they can travel everywhere almost.  Cars bikes.  Bikes have made it easier for pedos to travel.  Trails are popping up everywhere and they can escape quickly.

             At 14+, maybe even almost 15, you're a teenager and going shopping should be a fairly safe thing. There's cameras and private security everywhere around, you're likely much safer than in public school! At least I always felt safer at malls than in public school at that age.
            </p>
            <p>
             Granted, they don't realize that their country is changing. It's the people and culture that makes such things safe or unsafe, in Japan it's likely not a risky thing for teenagers to go shopping on their own.

              I get what you say about public schools, but shopping is different.  They are now mesmerized  by their phones and clothes in the store windows and going gaga over the opposite sex.  We need to have a Red Pill Talk with our teens.  They will be much more receptive to the truth than the Old Sheep.

              There is no accounting for the dumb statements by UNWoke people.  I have heard the dumbest things come out of the mouths of the smartest people.

             Right? I'm nostalgic for the good ol' days when moms could drop us off when we were 13 to cruise the mall and nobody had a care in the world. What was with that? Were these crimes just not talked about or did they not happen in such prevalence?

              They were not talked about. I remember a story a woman resident in Rotherham told (yep,
              <em>
               that
              </em>
              Rotherham). She and a relative (both teenagers/girls) at the time went to a bookstore, and were molested there by a man. They went out, and told their two aunts. The aunts said they should up and not talk about it! Just imagine!
             </p>
             <p>
              The woman quoted this experience as example that girls were raised in a way that you had to suffer silently when you made these kind of experiences.

                Yes. Maybe I'll find the source - I have saved it somewhere. It was a very good article about the 'culture of silence' in Rotherham. Pointing out that teachers and classmates knew that underage girls had adult 'boyfriends' (=traffickers), but nobody intervened.

               Yes, I can certainly see that. It seems as though those from the baby boomer generation and earlier were "trained" to keep secrets. Even today, my parents will keep things from their doctors because according to them, you don't complain about things. Outrageous! So, if your brainwashing is so deep that you believe you should be keeping things from your doctor, I can just imagine what else is kept in the dark.

                I knew that you were not supposed to talk about priests molesting kids, but I thought in this case, it was a total stranger, and the two adult women would have helped their nieces.....but no.... :-(

                 I guess she was worried about what people would think of her nieces, or criticize her for dropping them off? Remember that there was a time when you sent your daughters away if they got pregnant until the baby was born to save face because you didn't want people to know that the girl wasn't "pure" anymore.

                  Yes, that might be a possibility. I found this story useful for understanding why child trafficking has been going on in Rotherham for decades, with 1,500 victims (and the city isn't that big), basically under the eyes of the public, and nobody really tried to fight it, apart from some desperate parents, and maybe the one or other social worker.

              I don't think they were that prevalent but still happened.  Remember there is talk of a Pedo Ring with Gacy and it was national.  So, yes there were kids missing, but now there is the organ thing going on as well.  They will get them however they can.  I think parents need to have a Tough Talk with their teens.  Red Pill Time.  I think they will be more open to the truth than Old Sheep.

               Yeah, things are deep with Gacy and now the arrest of the Golden State Killer who was a former police officer, it's not difficult to believe that there are indeed serial killer cults, which I'm convinced of anyway after I watched the YouTube series 'Programmed to Kill' a few years ago. By the way, this series just became active again after being dormant for 3 years or so, and Stephano now makes direct connections to Pizzagate.

              There are countries were women might be raped for saying certain things or wearing clothing that isn't modest. It's not about the number of reports, it's about culture.
