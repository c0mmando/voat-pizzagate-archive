<p>I know I shouldn\'t even go down this rabbit hole but while watching a recent interview on TV with John Mark Karr, he insinuated that he was at JonBenets\' and that he was able to get to her through someone that basically was able to get to any of these kids that performed, and was brought to her home, by an acquaintance of this person. So from what he seems to elaborate on, and most people agree is that Michael Helgoth was the actual killer. So on a sick intuition, I started to look into who could have helped these two, I began my search with Michael Helgoth, and Helgoth family which BTW was very strange he lived with his Aunt and Uncle in Bolder. So I began to investigate others in the Helgoth family or with that last name, I do know his birth records are a little shady...no one applied for a birth certificate until he went to school, it seems that both his half sisters lived very short lives like he did(he committed suicide 1 month after the JonB murder), seems like the family lives in Co &amp; Nebraska(Franklin Cover-up)....But then I run across 1 person with the Helgoth last name that just so happens to be a casting director in LA..</p>

            When I first saw your post I immediately thought of John Mark Karr.  When they first suspected him I remember he was teaching small children in  some Asian  country....I am thinking Thailand but could be wrong.  I also remember he was brought back with Govt. guards...I am thinking CIA.  At the time I thought, Whoa!  But that seemed to go nowhere.  I have always thought he figured into this some way.  Still do.

             Yeah he was the one that they interviewed that had pretty solid evidence that he was there...but no matching DNA...he said that people had connections to get to her...so I went with the guy that killed himself last name...going on a suspicion

            Yes I believe it has been leaked her father was a bigwig for Lockheed Martin and some other defense contractor. It was also speculated she was chose and used for trauma training possibly 'invited guests" even before that fateful night. It has been speculated her death was to keep the Ramsey's in line/blackmail. This is why the investigation was jacked up. Much like the McCann case it looks like keystone cops trying to investigate. This is possibly intentional "destroy evidence" etc. again George Webb mentions this case in his youtube presentations. My heart is broken every time I realize the truth behind the lies we have been fed.
