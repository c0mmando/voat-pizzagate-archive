            Where is the quote "My wife said they don't cook" from? Podesta is sort of famous for his cooking. Those are not the pots and pans of an amateur either.

            That is exactly it.. Where is he? He can't be let down because no one will walk in and get some footage.. I'm sure with all of the coverage as it is they are fast covering everything up and taking extreme measures, if it doesn't happen now I doubt it will happen at all. The creep Alefantis (if worst comes to worst before someone gets the "smoking gun" will sell the business and open up a new place and I'm sure he has the means and the support to do so.  I can guarantee you they are scrambling and doing whatever they can to cover everything up so that this gets dismissed as just a "conspiracy" as it did in the 1980's..  What is going on in that place(s) is wrong on so many levels and standing by is in essence, making it worse. I understand where you are coming from but at the same time if not now, when? It's pretty obvious that no authorities are willing to take this on so who will? What if it was your child or a close relative that inadvertently, forcefully became involved?

            It really is simple what has to happen..... No law enforcement is going to pick this up it is all circumstantial. Someone needs to go in like this gentleman did except they need to take a different approach. I'm not advocating violence or criminality just simply walk in to the public establishment on a Friday or Saturday night and make your way to the back. If you are asked to leave then do so respectfully while obeying the law..

            Unfortunately he never made his way behind the curtains to the "party room" Some of you may think this is dangerous but do you really think that this place is going to want even more public attention? It NEEDS to be done we NEED physical evidence to justify a serious investigation

            Even somebody who can't cook for shit still cooks.  They have a LOT of dinner parties so I'm sure they do a lot of stuff in the kitchen.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, that being said, I once worked for a rich woman who had a home built that had no kitchen in it.  Talk about snooty.
