            I'm with George.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has said he wants to go back to the good old Bob Maxwell Mossad days.  I see it as when The Godfather refused to go into drugs - gambling and prostitution was fine, but drugs were a step too far.  [Film buffs correct me if I am wrong].
           </p>
           <p>
            And "old Mossad" thinks the whole body harvesting thing has got out of control - if only out of their control.  Looks like a common or garden turf war.  Fascinating to watch and George is the best guide you could have.

            They are steering people away from looking at pizzagate, and wanting them to focus on Seth rich. So their presentation of anything to do with the Seth rich investigation is suspect, it comes through the lens of their Mossad handler. As Titus frost says, it's time for us to do our own investigation. Frankly, there is no reason any one of the bigger channels couldn't have asked for an interview with this man, and they would have shown it to you sans editing. Editing is ok, depending on who is doing it, and for what purpose.

            Update from Seth Rich's Neighbor; Cameras &amp; Footage Confirmed by Sheilaalien May 30 2017

           <p>
            She joined the local Bloomingdale web community and from reports virtually confirmed the MDC has the store video footage - which I think Rod Wheeler confirmed to George Webb.

             No Rod Wheeler on this video. Only two guys from a news station reporting on the cameras and Sheilaalien.  Sorry.  At the very beginning there was some garbling that I could hardly understand and I heard Wheeler's name mentioned, but it was very short and hard to understand.

              Rod is in the OP video -
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDI0AFOHuNIYouTube">

              Mine was about the cameras, but I thought Rod had said [in his George Webb interview] that MDC had the video from the store.

             If they do, the feet (which is what we were told were taken) should be matched up with those two guys found shot in Myrtle Beach.  The police said they may be MS-13 and Rafael Aguilera was 32bj.  If true, I want to know exactly why the camera was pointed downward.   Let's hope the pics, if they really exist, show more than their feet.

               Thank you. Yes I heard it.  But what I want is for it to be released.  That camera was placed downward since I have heard only the feet were filmed.  We need to see it for ourselves.

              Interesting - I hadn't realised Rafael Aguilera was SEIU 32bj.  I think this tallies with FBIAnon info.  Must check - I should have it bookmarked.

               Did you find anything on Aguilera and 34bj?  I had found it before but now can't. I hope it was not scrubbed. They are watching 4chan and us, I know that.  I know he used to be with LIUNA and some of them were absorbed by SEIU.

                LiUNA cropped up in the DCWater thread - SEIU was supporting their "carding" operation.

            Until it casts a shadow on the $300 million DNC case going on with the "I was drunk last night" "I drink alot of wine" "I survived the FBI hitman", "Rabbit gave me this thumbdrive", "I'm Mossad".  "Shout out to my Frenchie Mossad friends". Who's looking at or talking about that court case? Who's looking at the shocking new Hillary emails Judicial Watch just posted? Who's noticing what is being deleted now across Social media.  Oh, and how about that CLINTON FOUNDATION he started off with?

            Here is my comment on the Seth Rich sub. This is a massive psyop with everyone involved including Wheeler IMO.
All this muddiness, multiple theories, confusion and lack of named sources with this crew talking about being drunk and drinking wine all the time not to mention the ridiculous thumb drive fiasco and FBI hit man episode where they are now safe, must help to put some perception on the validity of the $300 million DNC lawsuit by Jared Beck, no?

            If you are interested in the Seth Rich murder, you need to listen to this interview in its entirety regardless of the debate as to George Webb's real motives. Wheeler is articulate and forthright. There is something about Seth that the family is divided about disclosing. The father who wants to solve the murder gave Wheeler some personal info that perhaps he would have preferred not sharing but felt Wheeler needed to know it to do a proper investigation and Wheeler preserved that  confidentiality. Meanwhile the brother felt there was no need to pursue  the murder perhaps because he wants to safeguard the same personal information and the true story of Seth's murder is not going to bring him back, so why bother.  Wheeler also believes there is some connection to Shawn Lucas' death  but is not at liberty to discuss it.

             Some bad news on Wheeler. I created a new submission with the link.
Rod Wheeler, the now-notorious Fox News commentator who characterizes himself as a private investigator and whose recent comments fueled conspiracy theories about the murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich, isn’t even licensed to practice in D.C., and the website for his investigative firm has disappeared from the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             MPD declined to comment further, but sent along a link to the relevant code, which states: “It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of detective, or operate, manage, or conduct a detective agency, for profit or gain, or to advertise or represent his business to be that of a detective, or that of conducting, managing, or operating a detective agency, without first obtaining a license so to do.”

             The brother was the one trying not to laugh in the interview video. the entire family acted like crisis actors, but how could that be? If the father gave the info to Mossad agents, he just screwed up.George is a real piece of shit, so you can be sure he will continue to try to confuse people about the Seth Rich murder with too much info.

             Why would a detective run with something he heard from Fox news off-air and then promote it on air with again un-named source? How many detectives base their work on un-named sources. And then why would he do this interview with these guys? He doesn't seem to know answers to basic questions about the murder but he ties it to Wikileaks and Lucas? This should be named Wheeler interview with Mossad squad. DNC funded Hollywood must be very pleased with Jason's work.

             That info the father gave probably had to do with Seth's unnatural obsession with stuffed panda bears! I personally think Seth was a homosexual, but just my opinion.

               That is exactly what I am thinking that Seth Rich was a Pedo victim.
I just could not get my head around him and that damned stuffed panda.
              </p>
              <p>
               To me the panda thing was an obvious "in your face" type of message, that Seth knew what the panda meant to the Pedos.

              Not all homosexuals have pandas on their beds or in their office.  The obsession with pandas is  really sick if you are a pedo.  Seth was not a pedophile.  Everyone that loves pandas is not a pedophile.  Just because you are gay does not mean you are either.  Some pedophiles just happen to be gay just like some heterosexuals happen to be pedophiles.  Please, This thinking needs to stop.

               I only was stating in my opinion, that Seth Rich has been portrayed as having possibly two sides to him. 
The father not wanting personal info about Seth I the public, along with the other observations, I, in my opinion believe Seth may have been a gay man.
              </p>
              <p>
               The family's weird video, has all the makings of MK Ultra. Something was def.  not right!  MK Ultra mind control has been shown to be used in part with Pedo abuse. 
We have learned through the pizzagate research that a panda bear is a symbol that the Pedos use.
In that family video, in which the family looks to be under MK Ultra influence,  the mother is holding the stuffed panda. 
Seth Rich an adult male carried in public a stuffed panda, he used panda as "handle" several times. 
Unless, the whole Seth Rich story is a bogus story, these observations to me, lead me to think that Seth Rich was a victim of a, or was a Pedo. 
Many Pedo victims, especially those abused my the same sex, have identified with  and continued in homosexuality.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, would I come to the same conclusion about other adult male carrying around a stuffed panda? Not necessarily, I for one would think it very odd. But, I would not just assume he was gay or a Pedo/or a victim of a Pedo.
I agree not all homosexuals are Pedos. Nor are all men who carry around stuff toys are homosexual.

                There may be something entirely different they do not want to come out.  Something about how Seth was more important than we could have imagined.  Something he was about to do that made him very valuable.  Beyond the emails.  It may not have had anything to do with his persona or his sexuality.  The real reason Seth had to be murdered.  Thanks for your explanation.

                 I think at this point, you must question every thing you hear about the family or investigation and search for evidence that the opposite is true. Why not look into the smiling brother that is a senior IT guy at Northrup Grunman,  who the Intercept put out an article about from this CIA wikileaks dump.

                   I thought I put it in there. Here it is. In reading this back it may appear I meant the brother was in Wikileaks. It is Northrop Grumman and not him personally. It is very telling though considering what they do for the CIA. Do we know what Aaron does?

            At around 21 minutes in, Rod Wheeler starts talking about how the brother acted really strange when he called and said he has leads. He thought he would be excited. Aaron wasn't that excited. Wheeler asks if he's ok because he was acting strange. Wheeler asks Aaron if he really wants this case solved. Aaron says Rod just do what you want to do. Then click. He hung up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rod Wheeler said that the parents really want this case solved. He got along with them really well. The dad gave him information that he doesn't think others in his family would have wanted him to share.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's not allowed to talk about a lot of it right now. But, his body language and smiling when asked questions  revealed a lot to me. He's not dumb and knows what's going on and I think it's hard for him to have to hold back. He has not seen an autopsy. He says everything about how things are being handled is really strange. He also confirms which hospital Seth Rich was taken to.

            I understand the rivalry you're getting at. But I am talking the rivalry you don't get to see on the public side of things: their private internal power struggles for the top position. Rockefeller never liked being 2nd rank. Hillary thinks / thought she could become the next Luciferist Matriarch of the globe. (Her 'weapon' being exquisite sex and seduction, Rothschild's 'weapon' being money). (

           </p>
           <p>
            They have internal power struggles hidden from the public. This will also be their prime weakness.

            These guys are Mossad DISINFO (obviously), but I like Wheeler a lot. ???  What dis-info are they spreading?  I am not saying trust them -  but why is it obvious to you?  cause I have been watching for over 100 days.  I just cant see what you are talking about... He has working theories that may not be 100% correct but he has been pushing Awan brothers for a long time and this story looks on target.

             ... you can't believe anything/everything you hear, and Mr. Webb certainly needs to be listened to very cautiously, but, the people on here are expecting the impossible. They clearly want some sort of magical being that has 0 ties to anything/anyone, yet can conduct an independent investigation, and provides summaries/findings inside of a vacuum that are 1,000% accurate without any hypothesis or variance to their theories.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anything other than that? Clearly disinfo/shill...
            </p>
            <p>
             It's absurd.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do they ever stop and think - "If Webb was truly disinfo... why would he keep bringing up Awan bro's, SEIU, Podesta/Clinton past, Clinton Foundation, Rod Wheeler? If he is controlled by Mossad and spreading disinfo, why would he offer that information and tell people he has worked for Mossad in the past?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Not everything he says adds up... sometimes he's spit-balling, but, again, a lot of the inconsistencies from the Seth Rich story came from his research, and people want to pretend like THEY spent 290 days attempting to crowdsource a massive independent investigation. But, guess what? None of you did. None of you will. So, until you can produce some serious 1st party research - you can continue criticizing Webb, and not trusting him, but please stop labeling anyone that mentions anything he does as being a shill/Mossad disinfo agent.

              Why did he delete the first 54 days video's about the Clinton Foundation and CGI? Or actually he said someone else did it and he used it start this proof of life stuff. He finally admitted he removed them because "he was getting too close to the truth too fast?". Remember those stinger missles that were moved to Mexico that were an imminent threat that were going to be launched at our planes? People did provide HIM research and who knows what it is being used for since he kept it, deleted it and then told all his viewers he was going to use it and publish it. You want to talk stupid and lazy....Where is your research?

                People on VOAT work very hard sharing and vetting detailed research for the "lazy" people. Here's a resource for you proving GW's spreading of disinfo. He vetted NOTHING.
               </p>
               <p>
                Rod Wheeler, the now-notorious Fox News commentator who characterizes himself as a private investigator and whose recent comments fueled conspiracy theories about the murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich, isn’t even licensed to practice in D.C., and the website for his investigative firm has disappeared from the Internet.
               </p>
               <p>
                MPD declined to comment further, but sent along a link to the relevant code, which states: “It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of detective, or operate, manage, or conduct a detective agency, for profit or gain, or to advertise or represent his business to be that of a detective, or that of conducting, managing, or operating a detective agency, without first obtaining a license so to do.”

              Awan Bros, Podesta, etc.. they are just pawns in the chess board, trying to get some money and kicks out of the game, but in the end they are just pawns. .not the brains moving the chesspieces.

              Fat George Sweigert is not a real journalist, if he was a real threat to those in power, he would be in jail right now. like
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_Brown">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_Brown
              </a>
              .
Anyone with half a brain knows Fat George Sweigert is just like Alex Jones.. a disinfo comedian
who refuses the name the (((culpritts)))
             </p>
             <p>
              In the end, after this silly interview, we still don't know who really was behind the SR murder..
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh, he was taken to Medstar..
             </p>

              Oh his dad wanted the case solved.

              If these guys were real investigative journalists, they would have cracked the case already, by digging in, bribing people, etc.

             <p>
              These two clowns are NEVER going to crack any case, because they are not serious, they are a comedy team and no real anon witnesses are going to trust them..

               Really? So... you think he's a disinfo joke, but won't take him seriously until he cracks the largest conspiracy single-handedly? Hmmm... ok? Sounds a bit hypocritical to me. Considering that not even the powers-that-be, the anons or any other fringe group/researcher can even come close.

              <p>
               No one publicly knows who was behind the SR murder. That's why there is an increasing reward for someone to come forth. If we untangle the Seth Rich case, or at least force an investigation, we get to nail the DNC for corruption, murder and it totally dissolves the Russian narrative.

                No "researcher" has untangled anything and the ones that have (like the real George Webb or Barrett Brown) are either dead or in Jail.
The people who have really changed things are whistle-blowers, like Snowden, SR,  people on the inside who decide to go against the system.
or hackers like Jeremy Hammond.
The Deep State know this, this is why Obumma prosecuted more whistle-blowers than any other "president'

                If Fatso Sweigert was a threat to anyone, he would be in jail right now.

               </p>
               <p>
                There are some real researchers, like James Corbett who have revealed more stuff in 10 years of research, than fatso George will in his entire lifetime.
He is just not a media whore like fattie George.

            Thanks for posting the video, I wanted to watch it, but didn't want to take the time to go looking for it.

           <p>
            One of the possibilities I'm juggling is that Hillary died, which, if so, might have really screwed up their plans, it might have been that none of the body doubles was up to the task of being "presidential," as much of a front/puppet-role as it is. I also wonder how much of the history presented about her is real, there's just too much catering to her for her just to be a nobody who rose up in the ranks.
           </p>

            And Rod Wheeler has to be playing an assigned role. While presenting an excellent, educated  image, when it came to Pulse, etc., he didn't call out nuthin'. He might be yet another hoodwinked American thinking they're going to help save the country by getting rid of guns with false flags. Unless, of course, he's into that ritual thing.

            I have been all over social media the past year..  The Clinton/DNC shills are real and I don't see any evidence of Russian Bots... What is  the diss info that George Webb is spreading?  I don't see it.. I have been watching him since day 58.  He has said some strange things and I have cringed  at times but I do not see the disinfo that Voat posters are talking about. Seth Rich's murder was obviously not a robbery.. they are hiding many details of the investigation. I will continue to watch and judge for myself.

             Would giving 6 to 7 seven completely different stories about Seth Rich , most of which completely contradict each other, count as disinfo? It sets everyone up in a position to divide each other. Throw out a bunch of different theories, proclaim them as FACT each time and have the suckers fight each other over which on is true. This is classic shit. You can even throw the actual truth in there because it is so mucked up at this point that it will never be figured out. This guy is currently talking about an FBI bullet...seriously? A subsonic gun? That is the claim..i shit you not.  They acknowledged my comment today on the livestream when i told them that Ammo is what makes for subsonic and that .22 and .17 rounds can be bought anywhere for peanuts..at a fuckin Walmart! There is no such thing as a subsonic gun. There response..."well, we arent ballistic experts.. we have no idea if that is true..." THEN WHY ARE YOU RUNNING WITH IT IF YOU DONT KNOW BASIC SHIT ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT!?

               You are probably right. Most of them are just grannies and divorcee house wives in love with Inspector Gadget here. They are like that women that gets beat up by the husband and tells everyone they deserved it or fell down the stairs...which it is fitting since George has an assault arrest against his ex.

               <p>
                you are probably the most knowlegeable person here about him..
Why don't you put together a big thread unmasking this guy.. the fact that he is not jewish, etc
Better yet, we could do a video and then post a thread.. you will get full credit for all your info

              He calls it working theory and without Webb I and many others  would not be following the Awan brothers and Rich case so closely. chill out and let the truth surface.

            I'm not into the Rich case at all -- in fact, I think the entire thing is BS.  However, I'm still up so decided to watch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sooo.....
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Wheeler, he never bothered to verify what the Fox News chick told him about the "credible source."  He just took it at face value that Seth had been in email contact with WikiLeaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a schism within the Rich family.  Parents want the "crime" solved, someone else -- presumably the brother Aaron -- does not.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Rich family does not want Wheeler's report to be released under any circumstances.  Wheeler, OTOH, has publicly appealed to the family since he wants to release his report.  His attorney and their attorney are holding discussions/negotiations RE this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sweigert mentions -- in all seriousness, as though it were real -- the FAKE Gabby Giffords "shooting."  How fitting!

             Yes, I have come to the comclusion Seth Rich
             <strong>
              is part of the grander psy-op designed to cause armed revolution
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             There's way too much stink surrounding the issue from MANY angles. SR takes a lot of citizen capacity off of the real issue: Nefarious criminal sectarian syndicate members getting away with heinous acts as they practice their Luciferist aspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is very complex and would need me pages to explain all of this; but applying the basic rules (Occam's razor), narrative control etc. would still draw a picture:
            </p>
            <p>
             Mind you that Seth Rich initially had nothing to do with PG; at least, has no more to do with it than DNC corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Bigger Picture I have come to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton
             <em>
              was no longer the intended candidate even well before the elections ended
             </em>
             . However, the NWO, through media still kept to the illusion of her being the preferred candidate. However, this illusion was not so much intended to the PUBLIC. No, the illusion was primarily targeted at the Clinton Sphere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would they turn on Hillary? Well... that has to do with the nature of evil. Evil will consume itself. Meaning, evil people will always be in competition with one-other and will only work together out of necessity. Due to our biology, we are dealing with two types of humans. Males and females. Evil men and evil women will always be in competition with one other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hillary Clinton rose to power as a female. Got addicted to it. NWO support made her audacious and bold. But that does not take away the sub-current competition elements. Hillary liked hugging it up with Lynn Forrester de Rothschild where Lynn stated "I miss you!". Hillary Clinton with her Clinton Cartel was seriously working herself into the Rothschild sphere. As a highly dominant, leading female. And from the occult perspective, and per Guccifer's statement, being an occult high-priestess.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a future NWO, the Clinton Cartel may have caused a serious power threat to the Rothschilds through sheer influence of the Clinton Sphere on the globe. Rothschild has a male at the top. Clinton has a female at the top. Both evil; yet in competition. After all, the Clintons were A LOT more visible to the global populace than are the Rothschilds. She was using that as a power leverage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even though the NWO didn't really want Trump to begin with; they chose Trump as a better option than Hillary. Go from this view perspective...
            </p>
            <p>
             Now you see why SR has played an pivotal part, along with complicit WikiLeaks and complicit Kim.COM in bringing down the entirety of DNC while Hillary was still clinging to the Russia-Did-It narrative,
             <em>
              while the NWO had already 'parked' the Russia issue
             </em>
             and instead divert attention to North Korea... and Iran. Iran is now the NWO's short-term prime target. USA+UK pumping SA full of weaponry etc. Russia is on their back-burner. But to not give that away too much, we still have this "Reality Winner" NSA Russia-hacking psy-op that made its show debut today. It's a sloppy one though. To hint at, ok, some Russians still involved, but not focus narrative on it too overly. This psy-op has been made to be bust.
            </p>
            <p>
             Besides using Seth Rich to bring down the Clinton Sphere, the false flag is also used for the purpose I mentioned in the opening paragraph. That's why there's a photo of SR in an all-American Stars 'n Stripes tenue. And it is you, citizen researchers, that allowed me to establish this conclusion based upon all the oddities regarding SR you dug up.

              Yeah I know (about Kushner etc). I understand the rivalry you're getting at. But I am talking the rivalry you don't get to see on the public side of things: their private internal power struggles for the top position. Rockefeller never liked being 2nd rank. Hillary thinks / thought she could become the next Luciferist Matriarch of the globe. (Her 'weapon' being exquisite sex and seduction, Rothschild's 'weapon' being money). (
              <a href="http://weeklyworldnews.com/politics/22835/hillary-clinton-possessed/">
               Hillary having wild sex with security detail
              </a>
              )
             </p>
             <p>
              They have internal power struggles hidden from the public. This will also be their prime weakness.

              Well, looks like we've got more intervalidation for my analysis here:
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               "Jason Goodman: if you are questioning the Seth Rich files, you are crapping on this investigation"
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Webb and Goodman have both been identified as DISINFOs. With the above statement Goodman basically says "STICK TO SR AND STAY IN OUR MENTAL CAGE".
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1913813">

             </p>
             <p>
              They're both damage controlling and steering the narrative towards DNC implosion. The DNC / SR combo are their current "decoy-magnets" to again, cull this bit of the Deep State and focus citizen research on just this sector of the Deepstate Zone, keeping y'all away from the really incriminating stuff: Satanic human trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              bopper + DarkMath also actively support and push these DISINFO agents.
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              I'm really getting to the point I'd almost advice people to drop and leave VOAT for the crapper hole it has become. There must be better places that are not NWO controlled.

                ? I'm still bothered by you not being able to answer the simple question of morality I posed a couple of months ago. Once you can do that, you'll receive my clearance :)

                 Haven't been following the attacks, no time right now. I do believe Operation Gladio is still in effect. Don't know what the London attacks have to do w/ what we're talking about.

                 Because you're bothered about my answer to your posed morality question doesn't make me a Webb flag waver (I'm just the opposite).

                <p>
                 You're atheist or agnostic I think, and that's what bothers you about me. You know this quote right? "The greatest hindrance to discovery is not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge."
                </p>
                <p>
                 At least we agree about Dr. Judy Wood (I think). You believe in theories right? Like the "theory" of gravity and relativity? Walk outside. Do you feel yourself spinning? Is China underneath you?

                     If NASA is showing us fake pics then maybe they hoaxed us on the moon landings also (which they did) and are possibly also continuing to play a role in perpetuating an even greater cover-up concerning the cosmos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If so, what if that particular cover-up can be easily discerned by simply opening our eyes, suspending judgement (and questioning theories no matter how longstanding), and relying on our senses and common sense (which is not very common w/ pseudo-scientists of today or even yesteryear), and what other "everyday people" are discovering more and more w/ the plethora of new technologies available to them today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Why did Hillary in her speech the other day mention "science deniers" even before pizzagate. She couldn't have been talking about climate change because what she was talking about would "hit you right in the face" within ten minutes of "logging onto the internet." Climate change is not that popular an internet topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Maybe there are things that we have learned that need to be unlearned, and maybe it's quite simpler a matter to achieve such learning and info than we believe.

                     Have you seen The Principle? It's a good "starting off" point but largely disinfo.

                          . That's much better than being called a GWebb shill and it pays a lot more that I can tell you.

                          Whether I am going to retract or not depends on your legitimacy. You can prove your legitimacy by telling me about this thing you can not tell about lest people get irritated with you. If it is legitimate knowledge I'm more than fine looking at it and you should not be worrying about anything.

                           If my "legitimacy" is dependent only upon whatever it is I am babbling about, then it shall be "verified" only by a subjective construct in your own mind, as well as others, which subjective construct will vary greatly, depending upon one's upbringing, circumstances, life events, research, etc., and maybe most importantly, who they trust. For example, what if I said reptilians, or aliens.

                            Why don't you stop assuming things about me and either choose to enlighten me or just don't mention it. This is pointless otherwise. What does detecting spin or curve have to do with Hillary, China or gravity? Something wrong with our planet that Hillary knows about?

                             Yes, there is something very wrong about what we've been told about our planet, and Hillary is now being used to keep it hidden, as John Kerry and Obama have also been doing. Our planet is not a ball, it does not spin. We've been lied to and the truth is becoming known. I'll drop it now, but my feelings are still hurt about Webb, but I forgive you, just don't do it again if you don't mind.

                              So you are saying, in a differential fashion, that Earth is......  FLAT !? You do know what "differentiality" means right?  IF one is TRUE the other end must be FALSE. If one is FALSE the other end must be TRUE. So, if you say, Earth is NOT round, then it is must be FLAT! Is that what you are saying? I'm now validating with you whether that is indeed what you differentially try to say?

                                 Yes I am. But of course I never actually used that term "flat earth." Of course it IS a logical fallacy to say that if the earth is not round it must be flat ... because it could be something else, right, just not round ... not round because of no detectable curve. Nor spin. So the differential thing doesn't quite work here. NASA has told us it's pear shaped also. But I believe that the truth is discover-able and provable, and one does not need to be a mathematical genius nor rocket scientist.

                                  No, not a logical fallacy. You're just addressing the one-to-many differential. Not a one-to-one. Case in point? If it's RED then it's not GREEN, not ORANGE, not YELLOW etc. This is a one-to-many. A one-to-one would be if it's TRUE then it is NOT false. No other options. With a curve, there are not many differential options. It's either flat or a bowl instead. Since I don't see china when looking up, what remains must be flat. By parameter elimination we thus still end up with a one-to-one differential.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Yes, with differentiality we can establish information integrity.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  So, if not curved, then it must be flat. OK. Got proof, other than looking outside and not hoping to fall off when driving / boating endlessly into one direction?

                                   Good points, I think I understand what you're saying. I expected you to go ad hominen on me by this point. There's still time :)  Well, you did just a bit.

                                   All I can tell you, or suggest to you, at this point, is to "become as a child," put away all preconceived notions and suppositions and pride, and say yes, I'll be an absolute idiot for just two full days, and I will look at this ridiculously nonsensical subject. You will probably feel anger and righteous indignation just even considering it, cause hey, you're no idiot, right?

                                    Na, I'd rather join up with an online buddy, some 3 time zones spaced apart and in synchronity take a picture of the nightsky and match up our pictures. Some simple goniometrics will then tell us both that Earth is still a nice round globe.

                                    You can do this experiment together with an acquaintance yourself if you wish. All you need is a smartphone and some way to ensure the cam's focus points straight up to the night sky:

                                    That was a trap snapping. And you thought I were going to retract a comment. No.... Suffice to say you've now been indisputably identified as an NWO compliance. Say hi to George will you? You might want to tell him that there are more options than being "with us" or "against us". Who is "us" anyways... given that "us", "you", "we", "them" are all dynamic group binders that turn the 1-1 differential (with/against) into a 1-n differential.

              While I agree with much of what you wrote, I disagree on your take about Hitlery, the election, and the NWO.
             </p>
             <p>
              All elections at the state level and above are RIGGED.  Every Governor of every state is BLOODline.  This goes back to the ffirst Royal Governors. (nothing has changed except their title)
             </p>
             <p>
              Every POTUS "election" since 1789 (George Washington) has been "won" by the candidate who had more royal BLOOD.  This is 100%, with ZERO deviation.  So it's really a (S)election.  All documented by Burke's Peerage, THE unimpeachable genealogy house in England (they have done genealogy for Buckingham Palace since 1826.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump is Hitlery's COUSIN.  The Donald was destined to be POTUS by virtue of his BLOODlines.  (He has MORE royal BLOODlines than Hitlery.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Everything else is BULLSHIT and THEATRE to make you believe that "your vote counts" and elections are "legit."  THINK:  If elections were legit, it would run like CLOCKWORK, like TAX COLLECTION.  Instead it's complete chaos.  The feds would give grants to the states to fix the problems, but they don't.  It doesn't matter that it's a mess because the outcomes are PREDETERMINED anyway.

               You lack one component in your analysis. Yes. Financial power dictates hierarchy. Bloodline purity dictates hierarchy. That is known. That the show is an illusion to make people think they have choice is known.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the component you're not addressing is an extremely important point, which I described in my post:
              </p>
              <p>
               Rivalry / Competition. It is not "all good and cozy" in their circles. It's an ever going competition to get to, or stay atop. This adds a dynamic that I have presented in my argument. It's in the nature of evil.

               Yes, the Seth Rich story is BS.  It's been nothing but BS from the getgo.

               Plus, the fundamental premise is fatally flawed.

               I know.. one thing I can tell is that I have not been looking at the whole ordeal from a Pizzagate perspective only. No. I've been digging for truth for decades to build the bigger picture. PG is just an element in something much bigger. You can deduct this from my postings here on VOAT.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not saying that this latest conclusion is most definite. It is however, in light of events transpiring, becoming the most likely when one would consider a time-space cube much larger than PG's one. Like a space cube the size of earth over a time-span of millennia.
              </p>
              <p>
               So yeah, I can understand (and especially with people with vested time in the SR case) that some can not immediately agree with this updated view.

            Confirms that Rod's relationship with the parents was GOOD, but Aaron Rich doesn't want it solved it seems. Rod flat out asked him if he wants the murder solved; he told Rod "do what you want to do."
