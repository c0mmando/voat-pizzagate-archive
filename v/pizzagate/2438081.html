            DNC emails were leaked: "There was no hack of the Democratic National Committee’s system on July 5 last year—not by the Russians, not by anyone else. Hard science now demonstrates it was a leak—a download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device. In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNC’s system. This casts serious doubt on the initial “hack,” as alleged, that led to the very consequential publication of a large store of documents on WikiLeaks last summer."

            I find this to be factually incorrect, the outing of Podesta started in 2011 with Andrew Breitbart and the Podesta emails were hacked ( albeit a really simple hack - give me your password please ). The DNC emails were a leak but not hugely pizza related. The other data point here are the Stratfor emails which again it's not clear if that was a leak or a hack as WL provided no source data.

             said is factually correct. Reading it shows how obvious and easily the MSM shifted the narrative to “hack” instead of a “leak” from a very concerned whistleblower within the DNC.
            </p>
            <p>
             We cannot dispute that Seth Rich was murdered for this.

             But you are also right. I remember reading that podesta password story since the early days of PG. Which leaves me asking the question of is this password story true. Where did it come from? Did many people hear word of this pedoring and try and hack him. How many people have these emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m pretty sure they haven’t uploaded all podesta emails on wikileaks too (I may be wrong). Wonder what it is they haven’t showed us.

              There are still about 1-200 unindexed Podesta emails if I recall that can only be accessed by manually putting in the digits in the url. When we were breaking them down originally we noticed that while the emails should have had sequential numbers but some were missed e.g. email I'D 1,2,3,4,6 so we noticed where is 5? Nothing huge cropped up in them but interesting trinket. Now where this gets really interesting and you are 100% correct WL has more emails than whats online, the only emails shared were emails RECIEVED I.e. inbox his sent items was never posted online and given how the account was compromised the sent items definitly were part of that data. The only time you see what Podesta said is when someone replies to a mail he sent.
             </p>
             <p>
              With regards to the Podesta hack if you sort them chronologically the last emails were a bogus password reset email which Podesta forwarded onto a staffer to ask was this correct and the staffer said it was legitamite. Shortly after they realise the mistake and a set of instructions was sent to Podesta to turn on two factor authentication at which point the emails stop. Now interestingly throughout the duration of the emails Podesta leaves a device in a taxi and in one other place so .. it's not clear when exactly and how many people actually had access to his emails but only the last person via the reset email could actually download them in the format we see today. I can tell you from months of pouring over the data basically 0 emails from the DNC leak were pizza related.

                I just found it fascinating like staring into the sun blinds the eyes after a while. For keks here's how they tried to spin the staffer 'typo' that caused this mess.

                the megathreads got purged sometime around the vote I believe but ceddit should still have them. This is also actually where pizzagate started.

                 I didn’t hear about the dncleaks on Reddit. I think I discovered it because they deleted the Pizzagate sub which was obviously suspicious .. searches around the internet and ended up here. God bless you Streisand effect. And also to people like you who put so much hard work into these posts.

                Yes the emails showing for example Donna Brazile giving questions to HRC and the emails showing the DNC colluding against Bernie were all the DNC / Seth Rich emails circa May/June 2016, . But the emails to and from Podesta were totally seperate circa July - September 2016 and were not related to Seth.

                 Because Podesta discussed making an example of the leaker I just kind of put them together in my head .. I now see how silly that sounds emailing a discussion about killing a leaker on an account that’s been leaked 😳 ....... I’ll let myself out!

                Never a word spoken about this as per my understanding, someone literally connected into the gmail account with a client such as Outlook, when this is done it should bring over the sent items also and if it didn't and someone had full access anyways would you not make a reasonable stab at even just screenshotting the words that Podesta was actually sending to people not just what was being sent to him.

                  Well if WL was a truly independent organisation then it would make sense to have a black book of secrets, I however dont believe its independent I think it has many ties with tavistock operations and open socities linked backers, Assange was raised by a cult and they put him on the cover of Forbes, serious alarm bells. But thats my 2c I think the juicy secrets are potentially passed on.
