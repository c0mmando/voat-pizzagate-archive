<p>The search of Norway in the Clinton files produces 181 results: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/?q=norway&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=0#searchresult">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/?q=norway&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=0#searchresult</a></p>
<p>I was just browsing and discovered that there appeared to be a major discussion Norway\'s donations/commitment (FM Store = Foreign Minister Jonas Store). This 2012 email to HRC is the one that caught my attention: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/20602">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/20602</a>
...which also puts Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves into the cross hairs given the context.</p>
<p>Verbatim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your conversation with FM Store nearly two years ago, he noted that their initial $500k commitment was to be a
&quot;down payment&quot; once the Alliance had a strategy in place. We now have that. The Alliance has been seeking a major commitment from Norway - on the scale of a five years, $50M commitment. Your mention of the progress the Alliance has made in your meetings w PM Stoltenberg and FM Store could prove crucial in making these commitments happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digging further, I found this May 2011 email, which was sent to HRC l: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/24116">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/24116</a></p>
<p>In the email, the writer, from a firm that specializes in bringing &quot;interdisciplinary expertise to bear to identify and understand factors that could alter the global balance of power,&quot; referred to a friend who had &quot;confronted you [HRC] with the world\'s primary challenge, the bane of Norway.&quot; At the time, Norway was not cooperating in the attack on Libya. This email came less than two months prior to a major terrorist attack in Norway that some link to the CIA.</p>
<p>Was it a combination of this kind of threat and the possible pedo-blackmail model that caused Norway to invest so much in the CF, with the decline in this amount related to her loss of power??</p>
<p>This is still relevant to pizzagate in that pizzagate appears to be potentially part of a much larger operation in which the government can control and manipulate those in power (in our country and throughout the world) through pedo blackmail. The profile of the terrorist involved in Norway, Anders Behring Breivik (may have been more than one based on research), also fits well with someone who was programmed with MKULTRA - <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2011/07/27/mind-control-was-norway-shooter-an-mk-ultra-manchurian-candidate/">http://21stcenturywire.com/2011/07/27/mind-control-was-norway-shooter-an-mk-ultra-manchurian-candidate/</a>.</p>
<p>Some speculate that Norway\'s Prime Minister Stoltenberg was paid off for his support of the CF by being appointed to NATO.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts.</p>',

            I looked for details, but I could not find those. At the time of the articles, 20 had already been arrested. These arrests tend to come in waves, with the first break usually many months earlier, and then raids once they build the cases. The original lead from the FBI appears to have happened in 2015.

            What if they knew that information on the abuse was likely to come out, so focused on the " ridiculous donation to the CF, coupled with rundowns of the CF economics" prior to release? If they know they're going down, they would rather it be on their terms than the peoples... even if it does mean the CF is damaged. Just speculation on my part of course.

            The news reports broke in November 2016, but the arrests had happened earlier. FBIAnon said to follow the money, so it is worth a deeper dive given that Norway was the 1st or second larger donor country for a period, and then this happened.

            That Anders Breivik story always struck me as weird, i always wondered why nobody picked up on the point that apparently its normal in norway for large groups of young teens to go out on a secluded island retreat organised by one of the country's ruling political parties.  Seems creepy to me.

            Looking at it now the whole thing screams false flag most likely to further the agenda of free movement in europe.  He said in his trial that the attack was in response to the rise of multiculturalism in norway so i assume now that most people in norway would be reluctant to oppose rising immigration for fear of being associated with what was a truly horrific incident.

            This reminds me of the CF replacing local African healthcare workers with Norwegian "donors" back in 2009:

            The relationship to Norway goes back a way, keep digging! Interesting that they seemed to fall out of favor for awhile.

             Good point. Ericsson was very clearly part of the pay-to-play corruption, but I think this was for business gain...market access in return for buying the rights/influence. The connections to the pedo ring, though, appear to potentially involve government officials in the same way we have uncovered elsewhere (now with pizzagate and with the Franklin Scandal).

              It was in Finland, and extremely suspicious. Looked a lot like MK Ultra.

             <p>
              The official story is that this insane man randomly wanted to kill some people, so he drove to the town with a hunting rifle, got out of the car, and shot with deadly accuracy a group of three, consisting of a popular and prominent local politician and two reporters, who by
              <em>
               pure chance
              </em>
              happened to exit a nearby restaurant at that very moment. Then the man was arrested on the spot with no further casualties. There was no mention of resisting arrest or trying to flee.

               Sounds like you're right. I wonder how many of these "operatives" they have at their disposal. Seeing the number of people/kids that go missing per annum, there could be an army.
