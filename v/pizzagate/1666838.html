<p>JP and the host John Heilemann speak about &quot;fake news&quot; and pizzagate as if they were major factor in the election.  JH made sure to say that Trump says &quot;fake news&quot; anytime the mainstream media says something he doesn\'t like, but fails to mention the entire &quot;Fake News&quot; narrative began as soon as Hillary lost.  The first mention of fake news I heard was in regards to &quot;demands&quot; that Facebook control it somehow (JP speaks about this later in the video).</p>
<p>JP never denies the claims, only saying that the &quot;mainstream media&quot; debunked them. He mentions Alefantis but not by name (at first, then mentions his name later), as a &quot;guy he knows&quot; and goes on to describe him in generalities as if he\'s only heard about the guy a few times.  He mentions Edgar Welch but not by name, saying he (Edgar) &quot;drove to Washington to do a self investigation of what was going on in the basement of the pizzeria...I don\'t think the pizzeria had a basement, by the way&quot;.</p>
<p>JP claims &quot;fake news&quot; is &quot;undermining our democracy&quot;.</p>
<p>If someone has the time, it may be useful to watch more videos of JP and the way he speaks and acts when we know he\'s speaking about something truthful, then compare to when we think he\'s lying.  He has an odd way about his mannerisms. He\'s constantly wringing his hands and moving them, and has a death stare on the host JH during the entire time he\'s speaking. If you watch JH\'s non-verbal responses, he seems uncomfortable with the conversation as if he\'s forced to listen to someone trying to bullshit him. Everyone has been in a conversation like that and it\'s difficult to keep eye contact with that person, since they insist on maintaining eye contact 100% of the time as if that will help convince you it\'s true.</p>
<p>Maybe JP is just an eccentric cuck who always talks like that. Or maybe there\'s something here he is giving away in terms of the details he\'s providing, or not providing, and how his mannerisms change (or not change). Further digging would be helpful here as I\'m not as well versed in the finer details of what JP has said or knows (and acting as if he doesn\'t know).</p>',

            I'm not sure where else to post this so I'm just going to put it here.... the video that has been posted, that we think is JP torturing a child, he makes the boy sing a song. "I'm just a boy, each day I grow some more" is from the kids show caillou. I looked up the creator of the show and tried to dig to see if it had any ties to anyone or anything. Please be aware this may be really far fetched but go with me...
           </p>
           <p>
            The creator of the show is named Hélène Desputeaux. She is a Canadian educator and writer and that's pretty much all I've got on her. But when I googled her some related searches of people came up and one was of Robert Munsch. He is the author of the kids book 'Love You Forever' and has done collab work with Hélèn. This guy seems a tad bit creepy to me and on his bio page he goes into great detail about how he has always loved kids. He went to study and become a Jesuit priest before he realized it wasn't for him and he then decided he wanted to work in a daycare.... then went on to open his own daycare. Born in Pittsburgh and we know a lot of pedo activity happens there. Maybe worth digging into. I understand that being a children's author of books doesn't make you a pedophile but i feel it's worth digging into. I've found that nothing is coincidence when it comes to the elite so it makes me wonder if any of this is connected.

            At one point in the video the interviewer says about Comet "I actually have more questions for you about that" but JP just "skillfully" bulldozes on about the supposed PG shooter. I just wish he would have asked (like any sane intelligent journalist): "So what were all the pizza and pasta codewords in the Wikileaks emails"? Who cares if the Russians leaked them as JP says - they're still real and there's no real other way of dodging the question. I wonder what he would have answered.

             yeah I noticed that too. My guess is the interviewer was going to ask him if he preferred playing dominos on cheese or on pasta... #ICanOnlyHope

            They really like to cling onto that basement narrative. Even though the pictures of so called "basement" were proven by voat clearly to be the pegasus museum. And whats up, James Alefantis testifies that Comet does indeed have a basement in a magazine article, or that is what the statement seems to imply.

             The other day I was reading something about the making of the tomato sauce for Alefantis' restaurant.
Don't recall what it was or where, but it was referring to some farm where the harvest tomatoes come in
and are processed in the basement for him.  It's not the farm that was tracked down awhile ago.  I actually
think the thread or post is somewhere here on Voat and I will try to find it.
What Alefantis is saying is that CPP restaurant doesn't have a basement and I have no idea if that is true or not.
But that's like reading something here where suddenly you're reading a bit of propaganda that is anti-abortion fanaticism or something casting suspicion on the anti-smoking campaign.  The comments are jarring and make you wonder about the poster and what they're up to.  Same thing with John Podesta referring to the "basement" at CPP.

            im convinced now there is going to be major motion this week.  john has done three interviews the past few weeks, i have the pne he did with techcrunch in my submission history.  he is like a lone soldier trying to maintain the russian narrative, im in utter shock that he mentions pizzagate by name.  it is so very desperate, he doensnt stop talking

            Someone messaging Podesta about keeping the public dumbed down and misinformed:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging."
