<p><strong>Today\'s Blind Items - The Graves</strong></p>
<p>Slightly over three decades ago, there was a meeting on a yacht in the Med. A very important meeting. Things were dire and the whole escapade was crumbling and was going to leave some very important people with some very public egg on their face.</p>
<p>Attending the meeting were several world leaders, two of the richest people in the world, and several others, all of whom who were being catered to by a group of teens from the country of  one of the world leaders.</p>
<p>The focus of their discussion was half a world away. To see what they were discussing, we need to take a step back.</p>
<p>In the late 1960\'s and early 1970\'s, G was one of the wealthiest men in the world. Although he could have any one in the world to have sex with, G enjoyed the company of young girls. Very very young girls. Under 10 was his preferred.</p>
<p>He imported the girls from a foreign country and housed them in the annex of his home which he reached via an underground tunnel. The girls were supplied by a very close friend of his who we will call M. It turns out M also had a love of young girls and provided them to other people like G all over the world.</p>
<p>In return, M was protected in power and also enriched himself personally from these men who gave him gifts of not only cash, but also paintings by the masters and so much more. They also arranged for other governments to prop his up in the face of rebellion.</p>
<p>When G died, things started to go downhill. Although one of his children (J) also was a fan of the young girls and availed himself frequently, he also ended up taking things too far and some of the girls ended up dead. J also had some big drug issues and was not of the same caliber connection wise that G had been. J was also under a great deal of pressure from siblings and bankers to do something with the annex to the house. The same annex where the young girls were located.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years. The same men in power like G that had helped prop up M were all dying off. They were being replaced by other men who had their focus on other areas of the world. All too often they didn\'t care about young girls and had other vices that they could fulfill from other dictators. The problem was what to do about all the girls all over the world that were in place or dead? That was the purpose of the meeting on the yacht.</p>
<p>What was decided was everyone who had a girl in their possession could keep them in place but could never let them go. If they wanted them killed, they could send them to J and he would make arrangements to kill them. In total, about 50 of these girls were killed. They were dumped beneath the foundation of an addition to the annex which was built several miles from the original annex.</p>
<p>If you ever want to know why a hit was never put out on the spouse of M or any of his own kids it is because that meeting on the yacht was recorded both via audio and video and M made sure that everyone knows she has a copy of them. She also made it known that if she, or her kids were to die, that the recordings would be released. M\'s spouse is very old so people are worried that she has not made any plans to not release it when she dies. Apparently this recording discusses many world leaders and titans of industry who all had their own young boys or girls from this country they abused.</p>
<p>Oh, and just so you know, this will be revealed. This is too important to not be revealed.</p>

            Last November, after news broke  about Kevin Spacey's "indiscretions", he was dropped from filming the role of J Paul Getty in Ridley Scott's latest film, "All the Money in the World".  Christopher Plummer replaced him.   Doubtful the film will cover anything about J Paul's secret tunnels and annex housing girl sex slaves who were allegedly murdered.

            Ghislane Maxwell (enabler and accomplice to Jeffrey Epstein) is the daughter of Robert Maxwell. He had been an MP. He died in 1991 when he fell off his yacht (yeah right)! I know the Gettys seem like the reasonable choice here but the Maxwells popped into my head.

            <p>
             The Getty Center in Los Angeles is a multi billion dollar structure built to house the art collection of the Getty Foundation. J. P. Getty was given a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth when it was completed. The reality is that it is a front for a fortress protecting an elevator that goes down into a deep underground sanctuary, intended to house the royal family in the future.
The entire structure, and the complete system of underground structures is also home to a Satanic empire that provides massive amounts of children to the caver's that live there, for pedophilia, ritual abuse, and sacrifice, with consumption.

            For what it is worth, folks, these CDAN disclosures have all the fingerprints of an intelligence operation - white hats, in this case.
Specifically, if an established outlet for gossip was bought/taken over/ commandeered to be a conduit for controversial, damning info to be released into the mainstream, this is an effective way to accomplish that.
The reason I am hoping this is true is that would validate the whole "Q" narrative.
The vastness and vileness of the status quo is so horrific that incremental disclosure is necessary for widespread acceptance of the truth.

             While I can understand your apprehension,  I guess you might want to clarify your position on what 'white hat' means in your understanding because there are variations on what is meant by the term according to many different theories.  Essentially,  what I mean to say is that they are all 'white hat'  operations because it is TIME for them,  whether those entities disclosing the information are good or bad is inconsequential. According to my own theory and others,  the black hats have only been ALLOWED to exist for the future benefit of the white hats,  the former being there to scare the populace into the 'safety' and security of the white hats,  the cleanup crew,  the Vatican and the royal and ruling families. It is them that will usher in the total enslavement of mankind.
            </p>
            <p>
             Really,  all of it is a psyop on the public,  it's a demoralizing tool,  stripping the world of who they once looked up to as role models.  Once you reduce a man and strip him of everything he has two choices to make,  sing with the angels or dwell with the devils.  That's part of the true nature of disclosure.

            Getty owned a house in England called Sutton Place. He lived there in the 60s and 70s up to his death. Could be the home mentioned in the blind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Found an odd connection to PG and Alefantis. Sutton Place was bought after Getty's death by a Stanley Seeger. Seeger "established the Center for Hellenic Studies at Princeton" according to Wikipedia. The first thing he did when he bought the property was to have a new garden built.  "The largest post-war landscaping commission for a private client" He sold the house six years after buying it.

Duterte managed to negotiate some of the wealth back and possibly, the black mail material. (Letting Ferdinand get buried, supporting Marcos' son...)

             If Duts got the black mail material, Trump probably has them.

            This is random but I read that the energy of the eclipse back in Aug is to reveal hidden truth.  It was because of the specific alignment at that time.  The astrology article said this energy will continue for 10yrs.  It seems to be truth, so much is coming out. I can only imagine what things will be like by Aug 2027.

            Like the Gettys were the only ones with boneyards.  This shit goes on all over the world.  And in the US.  The ones that don't havve the facilities or skills to liquify, incinerate, or render a corpse have to bury them. Common problem.

            Recently, there were fires near the Getty in LA.

            Interesting thread on this:

            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            People speculated the fire could have destroyed possible evidence re: murdered kids.

             If this info. helps anyone. The Getty Museum is relatively not an old structure.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was built after The Getty Oil Company was bought by Texaco in 1983.
using sale proceeds received by the Sarah Gettiy Trust. So this structure was
put up after 1983. After the sale Getty Museum was the most heavily endowed
museum in the world. It was rich rich rich.

             Whether direct sacrifices occur IN the Getty or not, there is definitely something going on involving possible money laundering / people in charge of the Getty using it for their personal gain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't forget the Getty heir was found dead a year or two ago in his Hollywood Hills home, dead of a 'drug overdose.' Young guy too.

             Those fires.  Very odd indeed.  There were other areas near Santa Barbara as well, Ellen D. had to evacuate animals.  Wonder who had to get rid of evidence.  Don't Oprah and  Gayle liver there too?  They have been on many Yachts.  JPG  JPGII  Marcos

               They all have way too much.  Oprah and Gayle have a house as far as I am concerned.  They now go everywhere together.  I really don't care, but I can't stand people that live a lie.  Move the letters in Santa around and you have Satan.

            Remember the Getty museum has its own underground train service and underground storage facilities?

           <p>
            Someone suggested there might be children held under the Getty, although the numbers he gave - 100,000 - were by far too high to be believable at all (limited hangout? exaggerate so nobody will believe it...).

             Yes, Getty Museum has tunnels. I've been in the tunnels myself when Getty used to be a client of mine. Didn't think much of it at the time, but when I went to visit we went to an underground conference room through tunnels.

             Teddy Getty Gaston (1913–2017) (born Louise Dudley Theodora Lynch, also known as Teddy Lynch and Theodora Getty) was an American author and singer. She was the last wife of J. Paul Getty.

             Life with John Paul Getty[edit]
            </p>
            <p>
             While singing at a nightclub in New York in 1935, Lynch met J. Paul Getty.[1][2] The two start dating. Lynch wanted to be an opera singer and Getty paid for her lessons. The couple married in Rome, Italy, in 1939.[1]
            </p>
            <p>
             Lynch went to England and Italy to study opera and she worked as a journalist for the New York Herald Tribune.[1] On the dawn of World War II, Lynch was arrested and held by the Italian Fascist Party and was accused of being a spy.[2] She was freed and moved back to the US in 1942. Getty was living in Oklahoma and Lynch chose to reside in Santa Monica, California.
             <strong>
              Lynch had a son with Getty named Timmy, who died aged 12 of a brain tumor.
             </strong>
             Getty was overseas when Timmy died and remained there
             <strong>
              when the boy was buried at the family's home, now the Getty Villa
             </strong>

             I wonder if that poor unfortunate loss is what prompted him to fill the rest of the yard?

             Miss Gaston probably had a few demons of her own:

              His Favorite Wife
             </strong>
             ‘Alone Together,’ by Teddy Getty Gaston
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              "Teddy Lynch met Getty in 1935, when she was a deb and a chanteuse at the New Yorker nightclub. She had no idea who he was, and when her friends said, “He’s in oil,” Lynch asked: “ ‘Oil’? What show is that?” Perhaps she had some reason other than money to look at a man 20 years her senior. She came from a home of privilege and secrets; her stepfather, a success and a drunk, sexually assaulted her at night, once telling her she deserved it because she was “nothing but a dirty little Jew! Like your father!” Yet she loved the man she knew as Dad. So when another father figure came along — a man almost twice her age when they met, who claimed to value her Jewish heritage (her father and grandfather were prosperous merchants in Chicago) — she perhaps thought she could get the approval she craved."

             My gut has always told me there is some connection between pg and Getty family. I'm gonna have to look back on past threads that discussed the Getty and note which shills came out to play.
