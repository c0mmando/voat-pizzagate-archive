<p>Not posting this because I am surprised, but because of all the celebrities posted in Wikipedia, which might explain why they are going soft. After all it was just coerced sodomy and rape, molestation, and general all around sexual harrassment, and that\'s only the students who talked!

            The 2 names that POP out at me are (although there are many others) Nicholas Negroponte of One Laptop Per Child  and Victoria Nuland who HRC was planning to name as SOS.  Nuland would become the female Kissinger.  Others are also breathing a sigh of relief.  You can hear it here  (SIGH-AAAHHH).   But those two imo, are the most powerful.

            We need revision to the laws on statutes of limitations to assist these victims. Perhaps the filing deadlines should be waived if the victim can present sufficient evidence at the outset that the claim is viable. But I doubt that lawmakers would make such an exception to the rule.

            Alumni should join forces and establish an endowment devoted to treating enrolled students who have been sexually abused. The mere existence of such a program  might act as a powerful deterrent since perpetrators run the risk of exposure.

             Exactly. This is how many pedos "get away with it" as in the case of "Elmo":

             Quote from that article: " "The police told me it was out of their hands,” Singleton told The Post of meeting with Special Victims Unit cops this week.“They said if it were up to them, they would have arrested him already,” if it weren’t for the statute of limitations, he added. "

             amen to that. maybe in england and /or some states, wasn't there recent legislation that greatly extended statute of limitations, something like decades; not only because of the risks of exposure, but sometimes these memories are locked away for decades.

              There should be activists in every state forming a group to take this on.  I am looking into it in mine.  I am not joining any one group.  You cannot be too sure nowadays.  We should all start our own.  All you need is about 10 people to start one and everyone wants to help abuse victims.  Also a postcard writing campaign to your legislators.  That may be a good way in finding out which political elites care or not.  I am sending my cards today, and I will send to both Dems and Rep.  I am not holding my breath for a response.
