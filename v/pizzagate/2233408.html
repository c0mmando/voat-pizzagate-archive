            Whether or not Q is legit, it doesn't matter. Even HE said that proving PG is real is up to us. There are no saviors in the wings. So by all means, continue working on this. I've been disappointed too many times to get excited about Q or any other anon source at this point. I'll save my celebration for when the pedos are dead men/women walking to the gallows after our justice system decides to actually pursue justice. Obama has body doubles and I believe he also has clones-- so it's possible they sent one to the jury room but ultimately, it doesn't matter. We have work to do.

             It can't be old footage because the Oct 27th article said he was going to show up and Nov 8th he showed up.  He couldn't have known he was going to be taken down, so why would he make a fake footage before hand.   Body double?  You look at the photos is there any way that, that is not the real Obama.

             The Q seemed so real, or maybe it just seemed real because so many were jumping on it and I was trusting the crowd.

            Q seeming real in a phenomenon called confirmation bias.  We tend to belief facts that back up our previous conclusions and distrust facts that undermine our conclusions.  We are all susceptible to this.  Trusting the crowd has elements of tribalism.  The people who are saying this is so are people on voat like me therefore these facts seem more likely to be true.

            Too good to be true is basically the fuel behind the fake news phenomena.  If a story excites us, for good or bad, it could make you happy or inflame you, especially in just the headline, and it's from a new or dubious sources, that should make you skeptical.  The purveyors of fake news know what gets their audience excited.  They know which kinds of stories get clicked on which get shared.  And it's easy to make something that feeds into that or take a real news tidbit and slap an inflammatory headline on it.  They do it for money or for political reasons, but they know exactly the psychological phenomena I'm talking about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's an example of this.  Straight up fake.  Created for profit and shared all over the place.

            If you dont think the shit that happened in Saudi arabia was a huge deal and also make connections to the texas shooting then you need to go back and read more.  Q is legit.

             It was huge, but it doesn't in itself confirm that there's a counter-coup occurring with Trump and the US.  The fact that the Antifa protests were a non-event was big too, and that wasn't predicted by Q.

             How do you reconcile "PHIL_B_O_Extract_Conf" on Nov 6th with Obama showing up at a courthouse on Nov 8th as he had previously confirmed that he was going to?  This isn't a poke it's a question.  What do you do with that info?   If Q can't be trusted on this, what is the criteria for determining what is reliable info?

              We have been over this and over this many times now.  About 70-80% of these "leaks" are going to be bullshit.  This goes back to the very first FBIanon dump.  Just because nothing came out of the Obama "extraction" doesnt mean there wasnt a purpose behind what they did.  Believe what you want though.
