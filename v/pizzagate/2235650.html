<p><em>Back in the mid-80\'s was peak child molesting time in Hollywood. There was no internet. There were very very few mobile phones. Children came to the set where they were left alone by their parents. For the next 8 hours they were subject to every kind of horrible thing you can imagine. Drugs were commonplace. They were used to try and get the kids to not be so hysterical when being assaulted</em>.</p>
<p><em>Producers loved casting shows with kids and tweens. If someone pitched a show that involved a handful of tweens with a dozen tween extras per week, it would get a green light</em>. <em>Even if the show was going to suck, and everyone knew it was going to suck, if you got the right pedo at a studio he would say yes just to come for the casting and taping of the pilot</em>. <em>As sad as it is to say, there were a lot of parents who told their kids to go off with the nice man in the suit and do what he says</em>. It was a sick sick time
.</p>
<p><em>It was just past the mid 80\'s when a producer came up with the idea of a tween show that not only would feature a rotating cast of extras, but would make the studio a bunch of money because they would film quickly and not hire any adults. Further, the faster they filmed, the more time they would have to molest all the kids that would be hanging around</em>.</p>
<p><em>From the first day, it was the worst place on earth if you were a kid. The studio where the show was filmed also had several other shows being filmed there, most of which featured lots of children. Executives would drive over to Hollywood right before lunch and would stay at the studio for several hours each day</em>.</p>
<p><em>Anyway, on this particular show, there was a special guest star. A very special guest star. Still not a tween, everyone knew who she was. Executives flocked to the studio that day to see her. She was first molested when she was 5 or 6 and had continued to be molested throughout her hit movies and also on a previous show</em>. </p>
<p><em>One of the stars of the show who has spent her life bouncing in and out of rehab because of what she saw, and who was actually nominated for awards from the show, described the atmosphere that day</em>:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>A bunch of fking pigs. I had just turned 12 or 13. I was the same age as the actress coming in. Maybe a little older. We had been shooting for months and I was old news. They knew I would do what they wanted, but they always wanted someone new. This was someone new and someone they all knew. They had it set up like a peep show almost. She had finished shooting that morning and they brought her out on a stage. The stage was used most of the time for a game show that was taped there. That game show is still on today. I can\'t watch it knowing what happened to her there. They brought her out and the front four rows of this theatre were filled with guys who were already rubbing themselves. The girl was wearing a bikini. The show took place around a beach just so they could make these girls wear next to nothing. They had her walk around under the lights. The lights were focused on her and she couldn\'t really see out to the audience. She was squinting. It must have been blinding for her. They had her walk back and forth. Then they had her start dancing. All of these guys were doing what another star at that same studio got busted for. This went on for about 20 minutes. Then three of the guys took her to a different area of the studio</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><em>The actress didn\'t see what happened, but about 45 minutes later, one of those three guys came running out and needed a set medic. Apparently they had inserted something inside the girl and things were bad. The medic came and the ambulance came. The parents of the girl were told some crap story. That crap story ended up killing the girl because the parents believed the executives. Two weeks later, the show finished shooting six episodes all at once and then everyone was sent on their way forever. No one wanted the kids around or any witnesses to what happened</em>.</p>

            Two times yesterday Heather O'Rourke came to my attention. This story, and just a few hours before that she was in a video I watched on vimeo that was recorded earlier this year called "SORRY CASSANDRA I MISUNDERSTOOD: EVERYTHING PREDICTS 9-11"
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a very long video full of Jewish mysticism from the "synchronicity" school of thought. It's a 7+ hour video and her story appears at the 6:24:10 to 6:39:00 marks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some hours after I watched it I got a tweet with the above story in it. When I read the replies to the blog one mentioned the 1998 superbowl in San Diego. This was also mentioned in the video.
           </p>
           <p>
            It got me wondering if she was sacrificed or raped there, because that's when she fell seriously ill and died shortly after. Anyway here's a link to the vid there's a full clip of a show she did for Disney fantasy land that on reflection is super weird

            I think most commenters decided
            <strong>
             Devon Odessa
            </strong>
            was telling the story. There was another blind yesterday shortly after this one that alluded to her also being in a show with a actor that "does other stuff" and is just as depraved as the ones watching
            <strong>
             Heather O'Rourke
            </strong>
            . That is likely
            <strong>
             Jared Leto
            </strong>
            .
            <strong>
             Devon Odessa was on My So-Called Life
            </strong>
            with
            <strong>
             Jared Leto
            </strong>
            . They also think the show Heather O'Rourke was filming that day was "Rocky Road." The actress telling the story won an award for the show, and Devon Odessa is the only actress that won an award for "Rocky Road." If it WAS "Rocky Road," "Jeophardy" is likely the game show that was on then and is still on the air now."

            Found a People Magazine Article of why the mother was suing the Hospital for wrongful death.
            <a href="http://people.com/archive/heather-orourkes-grieving-mother-tells-why-shes-suing-her-childs-doctors-for-wrongful-death-vol-29-no-23/">
             People Magazine Article
            </a>
            <br/>
            "Kathleen states that she received a letter—dated March 30, 1987—from Dr. James Tipton of L.A.’s Kaiser Foundation Hospital saying that there was “conclusive radiographic evidence for Crohn’s disease [a chronic inflammation of the bowel].” The suit charges that the operation performed on Heather on the day she died at Children’s Hospital and Health Center in San Diego established conclusively that she did not have Crohn’s disease but an acute bowel obstruction due to a congenital stenosis.“
This means they were taking her to doctors in early march which fits with the when she would have filmed her episode on Rocky Road sometime in Febuary of 87.  She likely had a perforation of the intestine that healed badly leading to her death a year later.

            In the comments someone mentioned about Lucas Spielberg and Kazdan discussing a part in the movie they might add about a 12 yr. old girl having an affair with a 25 yr. old guy and how she was promiscuous and coming on to him.  AFFAIR, no mention of rape or molesting her?  Promiscuous and Coming On to Him?   OK, I am sorry this seals it for me.  Maybe someone can find the transcript.

            The actress says the show took place around a beach.  There was a show on TBS called Rocky Road whose premise was parent-less teens run an ice cream shop on the beach.  Heather was in an episode called “Moscow on the Boardwalk”.  The series filmed in Hollywood Center Studios in Los Angeles, California.  Hollywood Center Studios  (now known as Sunset Las Palmas Studios)  Some of the tv shows filmed around that time were:
            <br/>
            * Jeopardy (she mentions a current game show that was filmed then and still filmed there today)
* Star Search
* Dance Fever
* Soul Train
* Peewee’s Play house

             Citing Violent Content, Reddit Bans Misogynist Men's Rights Community

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A Reddit community known for containing misogynist content that sometimes advocated sexual assault and violence against women has been shut down, after Reddit announced it was prohibiting content that incites violence.
            </p>
            <p>
             The group's very existence stemmed from the notion that women owe men sexual relationships, and many posts focused on this idea; a recent post was entitled "Sex should be a human right." Others condoned rape, and recent posts have had titles including "Why women are the embodiment of evil" and "List of female rights that should be removed," a post that included the line "Their right to bodily integrity should be relinquished" as women are "the property of men."'

            NATURE has given everything to do with childbearing and care of children
to women.  Their ability to protect their children depends on their power 
within societies.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we see in Saudi Arabia, the more oppressed the women in the society
the more prevalent the sexual abuse of children in that society.
           </p>
           <p>
            This misogyny is taught by Elite patriarchy, by organized patriarchal religion --
and of course by the propaganda of pornography - also pushed on the internet by
Comcast and Verizon who make billions from it every year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Violence against women is clearly connected to sexual abuse of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Males are our sexual abusers of children according to studies.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Note -- 
Pornography consumption -- both violent and non-violent -- is associated
with verbal and physical sexual aggression.

            It was Spielberg who "discovered" O'Rourke. Surprise, surprise. Considering her age, there is little doubt that Spielberg and his friends began raping her during the filming of Poltergeist, at the age of 5 or 6. Business as usual for talmudic kikes.

             Imagining all those old men crowding around a little girl and then proceeding to rape her (probably almost exclusively anally) makes me want to kill people. I know people on this board say that "violence and hatred isn't the answer" but I want nothing more than to go V-Tech on these motherfuckers.

              There's indeed a strange connection between the talmudic Pharisees (aka fake "Jews") and the Saudis. Whereas the rest of the Arabic world tends to be quite hostile towards the talmudists, the Saudi leadership are very close to them. There is of course a rumor about Saudi royalty actually being crypto-"Jewish". I wouldn't doubt it for a moment. It was some Saudi royal family member who recently said the "Jews" too come from Arabia, or something like that. Unfortunately I don't remember exactly what the context of this was. Either way, I find this interesting. We know that the Edomites form a very significant component in the birth of Pharisaism and quite literally were "converted" fake Jews. Edomites came from the fringes of the Arabian peninsula. Maybe that is what that Saudi was talking about. I don't know too much about Wahhabism, but certainly there is something very strange cooking in the region of Arabia and I wouldn't be surprised one bit if Wahhabism too actually has crypto-"Jew" origins.

               What I have never been able to clearly figure out, or get a straight answer on, is WHEN did the Fake Jews come in the picture, and HOW did they get people to start referring to them as real Jews? How did they pull such a massive deception?

               They are all Khazars....AshkeNAZI “Fake jews” we’re forced to choose a religion and were part of Babylonia Talmudism they migrated to Europe and became the Royal Families and money power behind Adolph Hitler who is not a biological son of A.Hilter his adopted father. His mother was a maid of the most wealthy Talmudists of all and was impregnated. His bloodline goes directly to them through his father. Also blood related to UK British family. The Windsors are not Windsors the Queen E is bloodline related to them all as well. They changed their name. Hitler was a practicing Babylonia Talmudists are in other words Luciferian. The Wahhabism beliefs are the same and the bloodlines are the same. Saudi’s, the Queen, Hitler, Merkel, Bush’s, Clinton and BO are the same bloodlines or sold out to protect them...

                Ashkenazis have Near Eastern origins. You can already see it in their faces. Sure they're mongrelized, but they descend from the Pharisees just like all other talmudic fake "Jews". They are no less fake than all other fake "Jews". You parrot talmudic lies about Hitler which you cannot back up. Now, I have no problem believing that Hitler is what you say if only you can provide adequate evidence, but you never can, but merely regurgitate kike disinformation. You shouldn't be this naive. I tend to agree with the rest, though.

                   It is dramatic. She died in 2010. Was well known artist around the world. I was given pictures and manuscript. Never wanted to talk about it.,was very disturbing and traumatic to hear.

                  <p>
                   It is a true story. If and when I release her identity and story it will be for the right reasons. I promised but am sharing her personal eye witness testimony because of pizzagate and what she told me then that turned a lightbulb on for me. I had never considered Nazi Germany in any other way than I had been taught or researched.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I spoke to many others including in an infamous German Pyschiatric Hospital in 2010 and was shown items and pictures and locations no one would have known except to have lived it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There are several galleries of her Work and I have videos of her painting and describing why she painted as a way to express trauma.

                   is sharing. That his mom was impregnated by the master of the house (a Jew) but that his mom was rejected by the father and thereby instilled Hitler's hatred for Jews. I didn't know that he was initiated but wouldn't doubt it being that the Nazi elite were extremely occultic.

            If I hear one more Bleeping Person defending Steven Spielgerg I am going to go off on them.  In the comments in Crazy Days there are people that keep saying Oh, I hope it's not him, Oh, I'm glad you said that, now I feel better.  WHAT?  I is so very obvious what he is. Stop It.  Here is something else from the comments that  will open your eyes, that is if you want to see: In 2013, Spielberg purchased the 282-foot (86 m) mega-yacht Seven Seas for US$182 million. He has since put it up for sale and in the meantime has made it available for charter. At US$1.2 million per month, it is one of the most expensive charters on the market.   He also was depicted in some show, and it was pretty obvious it was him.  The cartoon character stood behind a child and made it look like he was having sex with him.  WHAT WILL IT TAKE?  I WANT TO KNOW??? !!!  I am going to read all the Comments though it will make me really sick.  Read them.

             A lot of filmmakers hold Spielberg very, very high up on a pedestal because of the films he's made. Hopefully people will soon start to learn that just because a person made a good movie or recorded a good album, that doesn't excuse their behavior as a person or give them a "pass" to be a total scumbag. People love their False Idols, their Golden Calves.

              I find this with a lot of people regarding politics as well.  They are not going to admit that someone they have donated to for decades or bought tickets for their movies, is now a rapist.  Not only filmmakers.  There are movie fans as well that put  these Criminals on a Shelf.  They can do no wrong.  Why? Just because they put out this movie.  Hello!  It is a Ruse.  It is a Disguise to Hide Their Crimes. This for some reason in their mind, shows a sign of weakness on their part.  No, it is not about them, it is about the Rapist.  You are not weak when you are putting your trust in people.  We all hope that most people are good, but it is hard to know which ones.  We have been groomed just like the children.  I can;t even explain what I heard on Thanksgiving about the Franken thing.  I am trying to push it out of my mind.  There are some people that think they are so smart you will never get through to them.  OH GOD.  I Can't Wait Til They Find Out The Truth.  You Stupid Dumb Oxen.   You Will Look Like A Deer in the Headlights.

               Yeah, it's a pride issue. People are very egotistical and don't want to admit that they're wrong about ANYTHING at all, much less something as big as PizzaGate. That's why there are people in this world who will play mental gymnastics and actually start to question the Age of Consent and things like that, all because they don't want to admit that they were fooled by these people and that they're sick degenerates. I don't understand why people have such a tight attachment to these Directors, Actors, and Musicians. People act like they are personally friends with these people, like they talk to them all the time and see them on Holidays. They see these people like family members, and nobody wants to think of someone of that stature as being a pedophile rapist who's in a Satanic cult, getting famous by drinking blood and eating feces during rituals. Normies literally feel like their heads are going to explode when these topics come up.

                Yeah, and these people are the very ones that are buying poop emoji stickers for their kids  and now they are on pjs too.  That covers the feces part, I wonder how they are going to squeeze in the blood drinking.  Ta-da!  Pjs with the Sesame Street Count Dracula on them  possibly with little drops of blood on them.  How Cute.

             Steven Spielberg’s own daughter Sasha Spielberg lives an odd life away from fortune. She lives near the beach in a small apartment and basically lives hand to mouth trying to get by. Seems as though she wants NOTHING to do with her father. She dabbles in music.

                what about PMing ME the "further knowledge"? Honestly, whatever you have wont convince me that this sasha is nothing but another overdramatic spoilt druggie hwood brat who has all the money in the world but doesn't chose to study or travel or do some good in the world.

               WOW. Well  after reading Yolanda's article and seeing the pics of Sasha's "small apartment" which is really a 1800 sq. ft. nifty house on the beach that is quite lovely.  I don't think she is roughing it living there.  I don't believe she is living hand to mouth either if she can afford a home like this.   Gee Sasha I am sure there are many kids happy to "make do" in your place.

              She is a very fortunate woman.  She has not been tainted by her father's love for power and money.  I am sure she heard many of the sordid stories making the rounds in Pedowood. Wise decision.

             Fiona Barnett's videos interviewing other Australian victims seem to have vanished but I remember her talking to someone, Dean Henry, I believe who said that Spielberg molested him and that there was cult ritualistic abuse that went on at his house.  He even named a woman who he said was evil who participated in these rituals....he was the women on "Everyone Loves Raymond".  She played the mother Doris Roberts.
            </p>
            <p>
             So while I have residual nostalgia for his films....I am now of the belief that hes abused scores of children and is into some black evil stuff

                Yes. I believe that he became a "high level insider" and was entrusted with a lot of secret information around the time of 9/11. Remember, he was one of the celebs who was told in advance to not get on the plane, and his plans were changed. There were other celebs who received phone calls telling them they needed to reschedule their flights on 9/11. After this, if you watch Family Guy, you'll notice that the "predictive programming" material all started after 9/11.

              Yes.  We know Streep has defended Polanski.  Has she spoken highly of Spielberg.  There has to be some evidence out there about their backing of him.  I don't trust SS or GL.  GL is married to Melody  Hobson and she is very close to BO. This is that kind of club that none of us want to be in.  There must be a take down of SS GL and WD (Uncle Walt).  Believe me there are young children involved here.  That statement by SS of what kind of girl he was looking for is Epic, imo.

                OOPS!  So sorry, I wrote Hobson when it was Barnes.  He is married to Mellody Barnes.  Who is no slouch.  Major find raiser for BO as well and well connected in Chicago.  I saw a report of her on here that was pretty inclusive and I wonder if things have been scrubbed on the internet.  Would love to find something about what Streep said about Spielberg.  She seems to bee the spokeswoman of Hollywood degenerates. Lucas and wife had a surrogate. Another eye opener.

            This goes back even further. I was just reading up on Tuesday Weld last night. She turned down the role of Lolita because she already was Lolita.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Using Weld's résumé from modeling, her mother secured her an agent. Weld made her acting debut on television at the age of 12, and her feature film debut that year in a bit role in the 1956 Alfred Hitchcock crime drama The Wrong Man.[6]
            </p>
            <p>
             The pressures of her career resulted in a nervous breakdown at age 9, alcoholism by age 12, and a suicide attempt about the same time.[3]
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             For Fox, Weld was in Return to Peyton Place (1961), in the part played by Hope Lange in the original. Her portrayal of an incest victim was well received but the film was less successful than its predecessor.[3] She supported Elvis Presley in Wild in the Country (1962), along with Lange. Weld had an off-screen romance with Presley.[11]
            </p>
            <p>
             Weld's mother was scandalized by her teen daughter's affairs with older men, such as actor John Ireland, but Weld resisted, saying, "'If you don't leave me alone, I'll quit being an actress—which means there ain't gonna be no more money for you, Mama.' Finally, when I was sixteen, I left home. I just went out the door and bought my own house."
            </p>
            <p>
             She was Stanley Kubrick's first choice to play the role of Lolita in his 1962 film of the same name, but she turned the offer down, saying: "I didn't have to play it. I was Lolita."[12]

            Oh gosh, although I'm a bit late, I just saw this on reddit an came to the same conclusion that it must have been  Heather O'Rourke.  Additionally, i wanted to mention that  IMDB says she died on February 1, 1988 in San Diego, California, USA (cardiopulmonary arrest and intestinal stenosis) But I remember that the original official story was that she died of pneumonia.  Anyone else remember this?

             Yes, I think a lot of people remember. I thought before today it was some rare stomach ulcer. I remember years ago hearing about it in the
             <strong>
              E TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY
             </strong>
             of
             <strong>
              Poltergeist
             </strong>
             but after today on Voat, looked at Wikipedia, and says she died from "septic shock"
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_O%27Rourke">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_O%27Rourke
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, slightly inconsistent is that Heather's mom says she died after being taken ill at home, but the blind implies she (if it is Heather) was at a studio when the incident that killed her happened. The mom could have been paid off to lie about the time line maybe?

              Poor girl!   Pisses me off when MD's miss a dx.  Here's some stats on Crohn's.
Babies (0-2 years): very rare
Toddlers (3-5 years): very rare
Children (6-13 years): rare
Teenagers (14-18 years): rare
Young adults (19-40 years): common
Adults (41-60 years): rare
Seniors (60+ years): rare
She was way to young to have Crohn's.  Md should have been suspicious.  She would have had a hx. of GI problems, most likely.
Doctor was either incompetent, lazy or paid off to give a BS dx.

              How sad!   Dies at age 12?  and they claim Crohn's ?  UNLIKELY!
 Pisses me off when doctors miss a diagnosis.  Wonder who the Md was who made that dx.
              <br/>
              Here's some facts about Crohn's :
Babies (0-2 years): very rare
Toddlers (3-5 years): very rare
Children (6-13 years): rare
Teenagers (14-18 years): rare
Young adults (19-40 years): common
Adults (41-60 years): rare
Seniors (60+ years): rare
If she had it, most likely would have been sickly, with bouts of GI symptoms.  Man 'warning' signs.

               Yes if her intestine was perforated she would have had a lot of pain and bleeding as well.  There could have been an immediate emergency which the Doctors misdiagnosed because the parents believed the excuses of the TV execs.  Doctors could have thought her simply constipated and tried to treat her with drugs when what she needed was surgery.  She could have been ill with this for weeks

              "Senator" Al Franken joked about Rob Reiner getting raped by his father and other perverts. I have no idea what he is now, but it seems he was a victim of gross abuse when he was a boy.

            After reading the story last night in all of those threads on 4chan and being utterly sickened by them, I knew I needed to make more people aware.

            I had never actually posted in this subverse before, but was aware these types of stories were covered.

             I'm literally crying at this story. I remember reading the blind item and couldn't think who it was. Of course it was poor Heather O'Rourke who died from a mysterious 'stomach ulcer.' yeah right.

              Maybe we need to make a list of the children,   makes it easier to understand the Bittany, Lindsey, Amanda,Wyonna  stories

               Worst of all, the ones who make it to adulthood get turned into child abusers themselves. They go from victim to a combination of victim and perpetrator.

               Good idea which might also move the investigations of pedophilia further along....

                Maybe we need to make a list of the children, makes it easier to understand the Bittany, Lindsey, Amanda,Wyonna stories
               </p>

               mommy made money off her daughter... most parents who let these kids be in hollywood, love the cash flow. the kids never see the money after its all over. the parents spent it all. It is heart wrenching to see this too. i hear ya.

                 Like the Home Alone kid did. Now he looks like a heroin addict who sings in a rock band called "Pizza Underground." If these child stars try to fight back they get smacked down hard.
