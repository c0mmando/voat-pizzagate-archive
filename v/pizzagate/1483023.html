            It's only as good as the people here. You need to down vote the crap and up vote the prime information. And last but not least, let the moderator do their job without bitching about everything they do.

             I don't post anywhere but here and I get downvoted by shills and retards. I'll keep giving my 2cevts regardless. I know there are sane people here that understand there's horrible shit going on but it's not a global conspiracy of the illuminati and aliens. It's humans being humans aka scumbags.

              The down-voating is orchestrated by BOTS. You can test, now they're silent at this moment in time.  9 hours ago there were 100's active at once, they're all triggered by keyword. They feed off a shill-list that they themselves orchestrate.  They call anybody a shill that mentions ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Saudi, Kline, Podesta, brock, ... Kline &amp; Saudi seem to be their #1 activation.
             </p>
             <p>
              They want to slide a topic, they want to bury selective topic's.  There goal is the same as the mod's to control the narrative. To prove that pizzagate is an insane witch-hunt obsessed by Comet-Ping-Pong.
             </p>
             <p>
              You really can't call the bots retarded or shills, they're just programs ran by CTR. The only way to fight them is to have voat restrict their ability to operate.
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              The way voat works is that when a sub-verse becomes compromised by assholes that members spawn off to a new sub, that isn't working for
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               /v/pizzagate
              </a>
              , if this CTR bot brigade insanity continues all the good people will have abandoned voat ( pizzagate ) and move on.
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              The mod's here are far worse, like when they deleted all the work of blue-berry and legion-will, first the bots ( non human actors ) called blue/legion shills, and down-voated their work, later the MOD's came in an agreed with the bots that these two #1 investigators were 'shills'; The insanity here is that the the bots are the one's calling the human's shills.
             </p>
             <p>
              The bots are working for the MOD's, the bot's justify the action of the mod's.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just post a story on 'KLINE' you will get an immediate BOT saying its been 'debunked' and note the bot never proves its assertion, after an hour of dozen's of debunked from bots the MODS step in and say "So many ppl call this debunked that I have to take it down", and bingo the subject is gone.

            I fear that most sites have these point based systems where CTR can just flood the site with bot's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Atko ( king voat )  has our back, I think it might be better to add a google human-confirmation test to the down-voats that way the CTR shill-bots don't fuck-up the threads and op's
           </p>
           <p>
            Voat does a damn good job of non-censoring, and freedom of speech, but voat assumes that people will create their own sub and move-on when a sub is taken over by assholes ( such as
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            is ran by
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">
             /r/the_donald
            </a>
            ) aka CTR
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is many people want to come to '/v/pizzagate' there are already many other sub's that don't have the shill bots.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Most troubling is that the MOD's controlling this sub are pushing the same narrative as NYT, talk about Alefantis 24/7, and never talk about Podesta, Kline, or Brock. Never talk about Saudi ( Most likely because Saudi owns Twitter and may have already bought out voat )
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            You bring up a good point, but are there any sites that don't have these stupid negative votes that can easily allow bot's to censor and slide all topics?
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I have given a solution, now an account must have 100 points to down-voat, I suggest  that that person must also pass the TURING test and prove he is human in order to down-voat, that will end the automated down voat's that we're seeing.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Another thing is that it all comes in waves, only 8 hours ago there were 100's of bots down-voating now they're silent, then the MODS they will go silent for 1-2 days and then delete OP's by the dozens and then go silent. IMHO most of the

             /v/pizzagate

            is an automated script ran by CTR, note that King-Kong (CTR-SHILL) created this sub exactly 30 days ago and he came from
