              Also, I saw that the Egyptian heiroglyphic that matches that owl stands for the letter M.

                Yes I did notice that. I also noticed he was working for the state police during the latter couple of episodes when the girl's fingerprints turned up. I'm pretty sure Rapin' Bill used State Troopers to bring him young women at the Arkansas governor's mansion. And there is a heavy implication so far in the series that the black dude did something for the sake of the investigation that ruined his career. In the last episode, when "Purple Haze" is trying to keep himself from Alzheimer's by revisiting the case, the two have had a falling out because of something they apparently covered up. That hasn't been revealed, as of yet.

                 Yep, Troopergate.  ITT his squad had a nickname that I cannot remember at the moment. 
I've supposed the detective(s) killed the bad guy(s), but I see what you're saying: planting and stealing evidence, the death an investigator mentioned in the TV interview, and state police are nods to Clinton. I would be stunned, however, if HBO would allow it ... they may have to keep it super-meta.

            We have a sex offender who trolls us as PGisDumb named Rob Robertson. I was amused when I watched TD Season 3 tonight to see they beat up a pedo named "Rob". I think someone is using this board for their story development ideas.

            This season has been great so far, after that last pile of crap they tried to pass off as season 2, I am happy to see the show return to form. I'd actually say they were attacking SJW culture by showing how that white leftist lady was projecting her own sense of intersectionality injustices onto the minority character who said he didn't experience anything like that and seemed to be disapproving of her virtue signaling, not to mention the black detective seems to have respect among his peers, when usually you would have expected them to shovel in a scene where the southern white men would have been racist toward him.

             I agree they were attacking SJW jargon in the scene w/the reporter. However, HBO gets their racist white redneck stereotypes, virtuous Native American, etc. IMO the acting and writing were really strong.

              To be honest I think with how prevalent this agenda/propaganda can be it's easy to see it everywhere you look but I genuinely feel like everything presented here is valid within the story. Let's not kid ourselves, the white racist redneck does exist and certainly it would be something a black man of authority/power living in the south in 1980 would face and I think they handled it properly. Also, what is so virtuous about the Native American? So far he is just an outsider war vet that lost his family and picks up trash, could happen to any race and although he does face suspicion from the community, this is also another thing that is perfectly realistic to present and nothing about any of it was over the top. My issue is when that kinda thing serves no other purpose and is clearly shoehorned in, like you see in so many other things, like Bird Box for example. I am pleased that none of that garbage is present in this season, I mean hell, even the minority main character is a republican ffs, that's subverting the narrative. I hate the forced in narratives as much as you do but you have to give a show props when it deserves it and I see no foul so far in these first two episodes. Let's not become so puritanical that we can't even address real issues like these without thinking it's all propaganda.

            I loved season one and two, thanks for the heads up. I don't watch much TV so would be ignorant as to a third season airing.

            Honestly, knowing Pizzolatto, most definitely an attempt at soft disclosure / education rather than misinformation. I personally think he's a very informed and upstanding guy, the same goes for some of his cast and I think choice of crew. Still waiting for the whole season release before buying, but here is a moderately thorough analysis of season one, posted to

            Supposedly the central crime is based on The Memphis Three? (Which Hollywood libshits fell over themselves to free from prison by turning into a cause celeb, got them released via huge PR shitstorms, documentaries and literally throwing jew lawyers at the problem until they got the result they wanted. The three were released. And at least two of them now overtly play into the satanic killer personas IRL.)

                Sad that people always have to clarify everything, like their taking to a 6 year old, because this troll twists everything that someone writes! Does he even bother to actually read what is presented before he twists it up? I don't think so. He must be paid by the comment not by the hour.

             I saw they made a 3rd season so I just started rewatching the first 2 since it's been years since I've seen them. Halfway thru the first season and I'm astounded at how good this show is.
