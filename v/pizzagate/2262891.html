            I think he was a pedo, but he wasn't a satanic pedo like jimmy Savile. He was more of a kind pedo, but still a pedo, and thus a terrible person.

            Absolutely. I believe it perfectly illustrates the power of celebrity. Fans so firmly the illusion, that it's impossible to believe the preponderance of evidence because of the branding that's occurred. The same phenomenon applies to followers of Killary, Slick Willy, and The Kenyan. It why getting through to them is so difficult because proof isn't enough. And what's the word used to reinforce the followers do not wake up?
           </p>
           <h1>
            RESIST
           </h1>
           <p>
            That's a real mental cue. If causes hysteria and the mind to interpret questions as bringing down an idol in a relentless witch hunt that has no end but to persecute the victim. And PedoWood is a master of this type of illusion. So is Madison Avenue. "Resist" is from their playbook.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, of course, when all this is assimilated into tearing down the true victims. These were kids. I think the litmus test for maybe freeing yourself from this horrible mental conditioning is to think about an action as if someone you don't admire did it. HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE: If either one of the Pedostas submitted to an interview and admitted to having non-related minors share their bed because it's the best way to show love, what would you think? Would you dismiss the fact a grown man was admitting to sleeping with children in this instance? Or would you shout,"There! That's proof!" and share the incriminating admission on various forums to let others know what you discovered.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you don't think anything is wrong with that behavior no matter who does it, then that's what you think. But if you have a markedly different response to MJ doing this and a hypothetical adult that you dislike doing it, then you may be under the influence of PedoWood.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what "normalization" is about and how insidious it is because this is also about normalization. The fact that a grown man sleeping with no-related minors was so readily accepted by MJ's followers proves how dangerous this is and how people really need to be red pilled when "under the influence" of a spell.
