<p><strong>If you\'ve been lucky enough to somehow avoid Pizzagate, here\'s a primer: It\'s nuts.</strong>
<strong>In slightly more detail, it\'s theory that says a pizza shop in Washington, DC, was used as a hub for a child trafficking ring run by high-ranking Democrats - a claim so absurd even Alex Jones has apologized for promoting it.</strong>
<strong>But some alt-right conspiracy fanatics are clinging onto every last crumb of Pizzagate - and believe Swift is too, according to a thread on 4chan\'s right-wing politics board. An anonymous user posted up a 2009 photo of her standing next to a man with a swastika on his shirt - a man who told TMZ it was painted on him during a party - and claimed she was \'our girl\' due to her use of a Gothic font, favored by neo-Nazis.</strong>
<strong>More likely, the font on her album\'s cover was designed to mimic the masthead of The New York Times - in line with the cover\'s newspaper theme.</strong>
<strong>Another user claimed that the lyrics \'I don\'t like your games, Don\'t like your tilted stage\' are about how \'Taylor, being a white, blonde haired, blue eyed woman is made to be an object of hatred and degredation by the jews.\'</strong>
<strong>They also claim that the line \'I don\'t trust nobody and nobody trusts me, I\'ll be the actress starring in your bad dreams\' translates to \'The Jews call us Nazis no matter what we do simply because we\'re white. Now, we will give them Nazis.\'</strong>
<strong>Other users say that a section of her new music video in which a series of spiraling snakes represent Pizzagate - spirals supposedly representing pedophilia, according to conspiracy theorists).</strong>
<strong>Those snakes then shattering into triangular shards in turn mean that \'Pizzagate is unraveling, and spiraling out of the globalist\'s control,\' according to another user.</strong>
<strong>They then say the use of yellow is used \'as a reference to goodness or righteously exercised power.</strong>
<strong>\'The full-screen worldwide flash of yellow means the globalists are losing control of their mind control apparatus. Their poison cloud is about to dissipate.\'</strong></p>',

            Such fucking idiocy. Funny how the DailyMail latched on to only the most far-fetched, obviously ludicrous posts, and skipped all of the legitimate questions.

            The only symbology I was trying to point out was her new "one eye" avatar and the masonic checkerboard at the beginning of her lyric video. This "Pizzagate unravelling" and "globalists losing control" stuff is actual tin foil hat shit.

            This is as much a hit piece on Taylor Swift as it is " Conspiracy theorists"..... I'm no fan of any show biz sell out,but this does feel a bit "smitefull".... and I don't recall seeing Swift sucking up to any nominee's; legitimate or real.... Unlike Ms. Perry, who couldn't crawl up Clinton's rotted womb fast enough....... just sayin'....

            The false flag against us begins. Just as I've been warning about for the past 2 months.
           </p>
           <p>
            We ALL know which users we need to blame for this.
           </p>
           <p>
            We should start prepping for a move to another place. Archive what we have and begin the migration. Then establish a new set of rules at said community to make sure this never happens again.

             I have been saying that for weeks. Time to hit the restart button. Fresh start and shedding the riff raff that is stopping us from our goal and cause. The children 👶 are why we are here not to fight off shills all day long.

            This post not only drills us a new one, but it tears at Taylor Swift. Who had a long-running feud with Swift. That's right. Ms. Writhing on a Pizza Platter Katy Perry. So Katy continues to be rewarded for doing what? Starring in a video that mocks pizzagate? Gotta be something else. After all, she had that breakdown on  stage not too long ago. She was staggering around as if looking for something. Her morality? Her conscience? Her butthole that everyone in PedoWood has probably accessed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say let's go make like the humble gopher and dig, dig, dig dirt up on Katy "MK Ultra Programmed Skank" Perry.

            That's why the CIA started the term "conspiracy theory" in the first place. Anything they want to discredit, they label it a conspiracy by making it sound absolutely nuts. The media will spin it any way they want and the majority believe what they say.

             I don't understand the unchallenged premise that a conspiracy is inherently absurd or why calling is a conspiracy theory would work as a smear.  It
             <em>
              is
             </em>
             a theory, of a conspiracy.  The world doesn't contain conspirators?
             <em>
              That
             </em>
             is absurd.

             It's not just shills.  We  are being led into a cul-de-sac by the moderation here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a TS thread that seems to have passed MF's strict 'rules' :
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2084176">
              Something extremely disturbing going on with Taylor Swift. Satanic/illuminati stuff at play 100%. #pizzagate
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             and another one:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2085155">
              Taylor Swift. WTF?
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             and here's the reason given by the poster that it's pizzagate related :
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Pizzagate related because any strange behavior related to celebrities is Pizzagate related.
             </p>

                            you shouldn't be so upset about being a retard, you know, people are really opening up to helping people like you nowdays. i know your anger comes from the pain of social ostricization for being such a huge, huge fucking tard, hence why you spend so much time alone and online, but i can't talk to you when you're being so emotional and irrational.

                 Doesn't matter.  We have a mountain of collated information. My advice is to save and archive the information that you personally think is important before it disappears.

                  Most of the good stuff was saved. But the connections are endless. Silsby working for Alert Sense is hillarious. Nothing they can do to justify that, or the Clintons knowing and caring about her and her 33 children she was smuggling, or the Clintons getting her free. The kids in the pool stuff was pathetic too.

                we are. children and others are being trafficked for a bunch of reasons, including funding for black ops and including mind control/other unethical research. that's the target. i appreciate how we've aggregated information, i think we could do more in terms of dissemination (easier said than done given pizzagate's reputation) or some kind of real world implementation. sadly i just don't see us "cracking the case" here on Voat. i'm not saying the board isn't valuable, again we've awoken thousands and aggregated tons of relevant information. the shills are just here to keep our wheels spinning, keep misdirecting our attention, and keep attempting to get us associated with white supremacists and Jew haters.

                 Sadly if you go down the rabbit hole deep enough you run smack into Jews.  And if they are the unwitting minions of old European Families or they have Cuckoo's Egged or Crypto'd their way into total control is a question I cannot answer.  But the Jews are knee deep in this mind control matrix.  Of that there is no doubt.  Some argue that the Jews as a whole dont know anymore about what is going on than the rest of the planets population.  I believe that to a certain extent.  But the fact Jews are always used to control all the important news organisations and the top tech firms is no accident.  They used our tax payer money to create new technologies and when they want to let the population have it....they create some Jew company to claim they invented it.  But they dont really own it.   Facebook is not an independent company.  They are controlled.  They do the bidding of the NWO.  They were created by the NWO.   Mark Zuckerberg is a Life Actor.  He is playing out the role of a Jewish Technology Nerd....but in reality he is MKULTRA and a CIA minion....

                  i've never seen evidence for the Big Jew Conspiracy that was any more or less compelling than the crypto jesuit connection, evil aliens theory, or reptilians, or any other theory that relies on blaming an ambiguous "other"

                   LOL.....look who owns the media.....why would a tiny race of people want to own every single media company in America?   What could they do with all the media companies?  What could they do if they had black mail pictures of congress balls deep in some haitian kids ass?  Well?  They would use America to destroy any threat to Israel wouldnt they?   Oh wait....what is America doing in the Middle East?  Destroying any threat to our Jewish masters......this is the facts.  They are actually obvious...but you will have to get past a life time of Jewish thought control.  They have you in their Matrix.  Get out.  Learn....think for yourself.

                     You think you think for yourself...but your mind is just a product of your experiences and your imput over a life time.  You have been conditioned with endless Jew propaganda from Movies like Masada, Shindlers List, The Exodus, Sofia's Choice......it frankly is endless and mindnumbing the amount of shit they put out.  They have created a framework in your mind for anything they want you to think.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And they have run the Media from before your father was born.  They ran Broadway before moving pictures...and they jumped on the Film industry from the beginning.   They know to control the masses they have to control their minds....and in the old days it was News Papers....then it became Movies and then TV.  Now it is the internet.  Zuckerberg was gifted Facebook...from technology the American Tax payer payed for.

                      lmao you don't know me, you don't actually know any of my experiences. i have not had a normal life or normal Western conditioning. never in my life, not even as a child, have i given two fucks about television, never in my life have i seen any of the movies you listed nor do i even watch films outside of research purposes. The Jews(TM) don't control my mind and tell me what to think. your culty mindfucks don't work on me.

                         Look into it or not.  Your really up in arms over this?  How much have you gone down the rabbit hole?  How far?  The truth is out there.  In the internet age there are very little secrets left.  And they dont really hide it at all.  If your an open mind you can figure it out yourself.  But can you get past a life time of conditioning?   Probably not....and that is what the CIA is depending on.

                           So what is your answer to the Jew dominated media?  Where on any normal planet does a minority race of less than 1% get control of all the Media of the West?  Oh it is their real clever mind for money?  LOL.  Dude they get together and pool their money.  They intentionally go after business that control what you even get to see.  They work hard and plan this out over generations.  None of this shit is happening by accident.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The Jews use antisemitism to keep Jews scared and clannish.  They want them hated and fearful.  So they will always work with the Jewish elders....and the elders are the Luciferians....the ones in the know.  The ones killing the kids.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Think about it.  The truth is there.  Free your mind and let the facts guide you.  But first you must allow yourself to immerse yourself in the total wave of information.  If your honest with yourself and strong enough.......the patterns will make themselves clear to you.  And you will realize a higher conciousiness than you now have.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Good luck.   It is a tough pill.  I didnt want to swallow it myself nine months ago.  But.................I couldnt deny it anymore.  I wanted to.  I really did.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           But they control our language......and frankly the first step out of this mind control box we are in is the bravery to say the truth.....
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           That was the whole point behind all the Jew propaganda.....to make them seperate.  To make saying anything against them a crime.  This is what they have now in Europe.  If we fall for this we deserve the endless boot on the neck of humanity world we are living in.

                 How good as RESEARCHERS (you are not, and never have been, INVESTIGATORS) can you be if you are unable to get past your bias and look at the evidence?

                 Frankly, this venue was doomed from the beginning.  This is NOT an organized format for a research forum.  REAL research forums are organized by content/subject matter (for quick data retrieval), not spread out everywhere.

                   Because I'm a researcher -- with bona fides -- and have been doing CT work for about the past 25+ years.  I was into the Franklin Scandal when it broke, back in the late 1980s.  I didn't know what kind of format was here.  My critique of it is after the fact, of course.
