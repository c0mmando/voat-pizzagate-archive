            There seems to be an inordinate amount of abuse occurring in sports- from youth all the way to owners of professional teams. I think it would be helpful to begin to compile all the sports related information we have and branch out from there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even just today, Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots fondly recalled Tom Brady as "that skinny young man coming down the steps of the old stadium with the pizza box". Interesting little detail to add. Later in the same interview: "What a great example for young kids who come into the locker room; they were 5 or 6 years old watching him, or in their teens." He's obviously obsessed with their age.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember reading something about certain owners of NFL Teams being implicated in pizzagate. Does anyone have that information? The above interview I quoted can be found in it's entirety

              Is there a connection you had in mind here? I know Gillette is owned by Proctor and Gamble.

            Another pervert that would be trusted by Children. Coaches must be researched by parents. Demand to know their past records. Ask questions Parents too can be starry eyed over sports idols and this be too trusting.

             exactly, and while I think sports and exercise are good, it's not worth putting a child at risk in these crazy times.  I have a 5 year old grandson and I'm sure he can wait a few years before playing organized sports.
