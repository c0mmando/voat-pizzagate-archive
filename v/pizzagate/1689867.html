             Maybe they've been convinced it's better for them to cover up crime and focus instead on Fake News.

             Jill Wendy Dando (9 November 1961 – 26 April 1999) was an English journalist, television presenter, and newsreader who was 1997 BBC Personality of the Year. At the time of her death, she was the presenter of the BBC programme Crimewatch.
On 26 April 1999, Dando was fatally shot outside her home in Fulham, London. A local man, Barry George, was convicted and jailed for the murder but was later acquitted after an appeal and retrial. A Yugoslav terrorist connection was initially dismissed by police, but has since acquired more credence. The case remains open.

             The friend and retired BBC worker said the late Crimewatch host was told DJs, celebrities and other staff were involved in organised abuse. But the anonymous source says “no one wanted to know” when Miss Dando raised concerns about the alleged ring and other sexual abuse claims at the BBC.
She is said to have passed a file to senior management in the mid-1990s, but they never carried out an investigation. The 37-year-old TV presenter was shot dead on April 26, 1999, on the doorstep of her home in west London. The crime remains unsolved.
            </p>
            <p>
             The source said: “I don’t recall the names of all the stars now and don’t want to implicate anyone, but Jill said they were surprisingly big names.“I think she was quite shocked when told about images of children and that information on how to join this horrible paedophile ring was freely available.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Jill said others had complained to her about sexual matters and that some female workmates also claimed they had been groped or assaulted.“  Nothing had been done and there seemed to be a policy of turning a blind eye.”
            </p>
            <p>
             After Jimmy Savile’s sexual crimes were exposed in 2012, Jill’s fellow BBC presenter Sally Jones revealed that the disgraced DJ tried to kiss and grope her in a lift in the late 1980s.
At the time, she told Jill, who said Savile was “just a dirty old perv”.
The Crimewatch host “had to fend off plenty of unwelcome advances herself”, said Sally. DJ Liz Kershaw and former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly have also both claimed they suffered sexual harassment at the BBC in the 1980s.
Miss Dando joined a campaign to help children spot paedophiles the year before she died.
            </p>
            <p>
             She had received death threats, putting the BBC in lock-down, with armed guards patrolling Television Centre in London.
Her death sparked one of Britain’s biggest murder hunts. Barry George was found guilty in 2001, but his conviction was quashed in 2008.
Theories about her death range from the culprit being a Serbian warlord angry over her TV appeal on behalf of Kosovan refugees, to British underworld enforcers furious at her Crimewatch investigations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Miss Dando was also looking into the death of her friend, Chelsea vice-chairman Matthew Harding, who was killed in a helicopter crash.

            Thank you for the response. Un-FINGbelievable!  When animals get rabies they get put down and those who don't warn people about the threat are just as if not more guilty than the animals. The Global MSM is guilty of evil crimes.

            I wonder how many of these 18 Wheelers are carrying trafficked children?  It is yet another way to transport besides plane train and ships.  I would not be surprised.

            Hunting children by the Royals, man climbing down the sides of Westminster naked, naked boy running around the castle and disappears, and they still don't get it.  We have been woken up and we are going to shake up and wake up the others.  The cat is out of the bag and she likes it so much outside that she won't go back in.
