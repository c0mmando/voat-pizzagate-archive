<p>Pizzagate is not about a few small businesses, or even child trafficking alone. It is about a global system of corruption, racketeering, collusion, human and child trafficking, drug and organ trafficking, fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, market manipulation, blackmail, extortion, secret societies, unending wars, propaganda and censorship. Since the media does not want to tell you the truth, here are the real facts: Hillary Clinton setup a private email server and deleted tens of thousands of emails, including her IT contractor using Bleach Bit to permanently destroy all evidence of the emails. Huma Abedin had access to Hillary Clinton\'s emails, and Anthony Weiner had copies of the emails on his laptop computer which was retrieved by the NYPD during an investigation into allegations of criminal activity involving Anthony Weiner and minors. Verified emails published by Wikileaks revealed evidence of pay to play racketeering that has permeated all levels of local, national and global government. Verified emails published by Wikileaks revealed evidence of emails involving connections to known pedophiles, satanic rituals, human and organ trafficking, stenography, and code words that have been identified by the FBI as related to pedophilia. Verified emails published by Wikileaks revealed evidence of collusion between political campaigns and the media. Reports by Project Veritas revealed evidence of staged events and false flags, paid actors and social media bloggers, and inciting violence. Media and corrupt governments have a history of collusion, lies, and censorship, including covering up child trafficking , pedophilia and other crimes that involve prominent figures, and are attempting to narrow the focus of Pizzagate in order to create false victims of fake news and increase censorship to maintain</p>
<p>their dwindling profitability and power. Many high ranking officials and powerful people have been accused of being involved in allegedly nefarious activities, including trips on a plane referred to as &quot;Lolita Express&quot; to an island with a large estate owned by Jeffrey Epstein who has been convicted of crimes involving minors. Loretta Lynch met privately with Bill Clinton during an investigation into Hillary Clinton\'s private email server, and Loretta Lynch, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Kadzik, James Comey\'s brother, and others involved have a history of close connections and relationships with the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation. There are businesses in DC connected to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton and others involved with the Clinton Foundation, and a concentration of those businesses exist in a cluster among a block that is mostly owned by the same Saudi organization. Many people connected to the businesses within this cluster have shared artwork, photos and messages that involve child exploitation, code words for pedophilia, graphic satanic symbols and artwork, and violent acts. The key witness to the recent event involving a man with a gun was aware of the accusations involving the location, and despite accusations involving criminal activity exploiting children, he decided to take his wife and children there for lunch for the very first time after being such a fan of ping pong and years when he could have gone to this restaurant. In one hour, following an incident with a man who reportedly made two shots and despite not hearing those shot, nor being allowed in a large portion of the venue, the witness declared it to be a wholesome family place and that he had a great time. The witness\' father has tied to organizations connected with protecting children in Haiti. The man with the gun at the pizza shop did not appear to be conducting any legitimate investigating, did not have video cameras, had not investigated anything prior, was not arrested or handcuffed inside, was listed as an actor on IMDB, and had recently been involved in an accident where he hit a 13 year-old boy with his car traveling approximately 45mph. Pizzagate is about something much bigger than pizza places and child trafficking - it is about a global system of corruption, racketeering, trafficking, black markets, market manipulation, collusion, blackmail, fraud, propaganda and censorship. Officials including Obama, mainstream</p>
<p>media, and tech giants including Google, Facebook and other are attempting to censor information about Pizzagate and other scandals by labeling it as Fake News, after being exposed as providing misleading information and collusion throughout the 2016 election with the DNC and members of the Clinton campaign. In the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\'s email server, Huma Abedin and others involved violated their immunity agreement by lying or withholding evidence, including a laptop in possession of Anthony Weiner with reportedly over 650k emails, including emails deleted</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton and her staff. Julian Assange has been missing since October 16, 2016. Julian Assange\'s attorney, John Jones, was killed under mysterious circumstances, struck by a train in April 2016. Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband were shot and killed under mysterious circumstances after she was investigating corruption and human and child trafficking. Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman has been missing for over 40 days.</p>
<p>On election night, it has been reported that Hillary Clinton was in a drunken rage and that is the reason she did appear and had podesta speak for her</p>

             Notice the downvoting? What does that tell you? They are scared about Racine, Wisconsin being exposed for what it really is - a main "root" of the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption linked to Pilgrims Society, United Nations, Council of 13 and other groups involved at the top.

               We have posted hundreds of comments and replied to every inquiry or question. Many others have posted about Racine to which we have posted additional information. We communicate with anyone here that truly wants to know the truth, and we will answer any question you pose either here or in private.
              </p>
              <p>
               Please take the time to read through more of our comments, as we have provided more than enough information and connections to show that Racine is a main root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. If there anything specific that you need to know or would like to dispute in our months and months of posting? There is an enormous amount of research and information involved, along with first hand victims and witnesses that we are in contact with. We have lists on both sides.
              </p>
              <p>
               Start with John Jeffry Louis and The Pilgrims Society, or start with the history of the Knights of Pythias in Racine, or start with the Clintons beginning Sustainable Development in Racine, or start with the Clintons beginning Community Policing in Racine. Any of those will lead you to the same answers. Look at the Racine companies involved in starting the Art in Embassies program. Or look at the corporations and organizations that contributed to the Clinton Foundation. Then look at who made illegal donations to the corrupt (now resigning) mayor of Racine's campaigns.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look at the Foundations in Racine and who is connected to them. Or look at their newest cover-up organization called The Fight to End Exploitation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Which of these would you like to dispute or do you need more information on? You can also email us if you have any other specific questions. This is very dangerous, and Racine is a litmus test for anyone that wants to know the real truth about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Do you know what the Council of 13 is and how it ties to Kabbalah and Black Nobility? In order to understand their agenda, first you have to know their history.
              </p>
              <p>
               We know that Racine is a main root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Some day you will too. First you must want to find the truth.

              All the shills have been down voating me lately.  They want me gone because I am on here all the time.  But yes, this post and the others are scaring them.  The fact that so many are leaving alarming replies to the Katy Perry tweets and JP tweets is scaring them too  I believe they are in a panic.  But it is too late.  It is spreading like wildfire  If they get us to stop posting on here the cat is already out of the bag.  If we are quieted others will get angry and pick up the pace.  Truthfully, that will become like Wildfire and even worse.  Yeah, but what do I know.  People are on to them though, notice the deleted comment that was down voated.
