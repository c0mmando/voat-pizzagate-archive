            There are a few things that would link McGowans work directly to pizzagate.  The Dalhmer statue in the Podesta house I feel may have more significance than at first glance just being creepy. There was inference that Dalhmer may have been connected to the same cult that Henry Lee Lucas mentioned being part of  'the Hand of Death'.  Also the fact that it looks like both Podestas are total freaks only makes me suspect that there should be a way to dig into their past, and figure out the persons of influence who helped shape  them, and how.

            McGowan's writings are truly important, imo - he doesn't make wild leaps, simply connects dots and asks questions in a common sense fashion.

            we'd do well to consider his perspectives in this investigation, as the scope is likely far greater than merely the Washington DC power elite of today.  i will be disappointed if we, the people, miss this chance to thoroughly clean house, once and for all and all around the world.
