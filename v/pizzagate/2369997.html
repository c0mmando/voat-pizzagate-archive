            The only reason anyone would insist on redactions is because.....GUILTY!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            The innocent have nothing to hide. Therefore the only possible truth regarding those insisting on redactions before release is because they're guilty of the stuff they're being accused of in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cmon guys, go with the plan. Start pressuring those who wanted redactions to cave in to the people's demands of 100% open disclosure via a constant "guilty until proven innocent" inquisition using "only the guilty have something to hide" logic. Make it ENDLESS until they cave in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe wikileaks should be contacted to "arrange" for an uncensored and 100% public release of the FISA memos. This will be fun.

            In recent phone calls, Trump has told friends he believes the memo would expose bias within the agency's top ranks and make it easier for him to argue the Russia investigations are prejudiced against him, according to two sources.    The only Collusion was by the Democrats and Republicans committing Election Fraud.  They both do it.  Both sides.  But this time it is the Dems Crying Foul.  Muh Russia.  I am so sick of this Katzen Jammering from both sides every election.  But this time it is Just Plain Ridiculous.  Mueller needs to be brought up as well for Hiding 911 Collusion.  No one talks about that.

             If this is the case, both Nunes and Trump are basing their case on a dubious prospect, Carter Page.
            </p>
            <p>
             The way FISA warrants work is that they cannot be renewed unless they are producing intelligence.  They are only good for 90 days.   Manafort is facing like a 12 count indictment.  He was under surveillance sometime after 2014, then the surveillance was dropped, because the warrant was not renewed.   In the case where Rosenstein was involved, he was asking the court for a renewal of a warrant on Carter Page, so that warrant must have been producing active intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did the intel agencies get on Carter Page because he was part of the Trump campaign?   No.  He first came to their attention in 2013 long before he hooked up with Trump.   Why were they interested in him?  Because he was talking to Russian spies.
             <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html">
              https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI actually warned him these Russians were spies and were trying to recruit him.   So he was very much on US intel radar way before he joined Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not easy to get a FISA warrant, every fact contained in the affidavit has to accounted before the judge.  So if a FISA warrant was granted against him and was repeatedly renewed there's going to be a lot of evidence for this.   Most will be classified, but when the memo comes out, there will be lot of leaking going on I suspsect.

              The reason that the bogus dossier was USED for getting a FISA warrant to spy on Trump was that FISA warrants are "not easy to get"....They didn't have DICK on Trump, so they had to used a contrived peice created for and funded by the Clinton campaign.
             </p>
             <p>
              The fact that "FISA warrants are not easy to get" is NOT an indictment of Trump, because the Obama Administration was able to get one.....It's simply the reason that the Obama/Clinton crew and their supporters within the DOJ and FBI bothered to pay millions to foreign spies to create that dossier.
             </p>
             <p>
              BTW--the fact that Fusion GPS was given the money to buy the dossier from Steele and Co?  Akin to money-laundering.  If some spending is ILLEGAL for a campaign to indulge in, having your law firm do it for you is ALSO a criminal act.

               They did not get a warrant to spy on Trump.  They got one to spy on Carter Page who we know had been in contact with Russian spies.
Page passed documents to Victor Podobnyy who with Igor Sporyshev and one other man were busted by the FBI in 2016 as Russian agents.
              </p>
              <p>
               They got this FISA warrant AFTER Page stopped working with the Trump camapaign

               No, it's not illegal and no they didn't "buy the dossier."  It didn't exist at the time.  The Founder of Fusion said he was hired to get an overall view of Trump and when looking into his financing and business deals they notice he went to Russia a few times.  So Steele was hired to find out what Trump did in Russia.  The dossier is what he found out.
              </p>
              <p>
               If Fusion did something illegal or the Clinton campaign did something illegal, the White House and Congressional Repbulicans would have been screaming about it.  They wouldn't need Nunes to write up a memo.

               Here's what reporting is saying
              </p>
              <p>
               The Republicans are alleging bias and or abuse in the FISA process.   They are going to point to the Steele Memo as the evidence of this.
              </p>
              <p>
               The memo is only 3.5 pages, so it's probably all about the Steele dossier.   An affidavit for a FISA warrant is usually 100 pages or more.  So the Nunes probably probably doesn't go into the other evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact this is what the Democrats and the FBI are claiming that the dossier is ignoring all the other evidence that was presented to the FISA judge.  The FBI said "we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy."

                 I think the actions by Nunes are not in fact about transparency and that since he knew that items that were classified because of national security concerns, were not only not going to get released, they were not going to get discussed in detail at all.  So he could make the whole process look like it was about the Steel memo.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's been reported that Nunes himself has not looked that the underlying intelligence that the FISA application referred to.   The only two members of the House who have read it are Trew Gowdy and Adam Schiff.   And only 8 people in Congress are allowed to read it.   Congress doesn't control classification and declassification, that's why it has to go to the White House and the President to get the authority to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let's say that information in the FISA warrant is known because we have a live source in the Kremlin who is giving us information.   We wouldn't want that exposed.  This is why that info would be highly classified and be redacted before released to the Public.   And Nunes wouldn't know that what is in his writing might possibly expose that. It could be an unclassified fact that would reveal a larger picture. This is why in the normal course of business there would be an inter-agency review of the classified information to see what should be protected.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In Dec 2016 Russia arrested one of their senior intelligence officer on treason charges.  They say he told the US about Russia attacks on voting registration systems in Arizona and Illinois.
                 <br/>
                 They arrested him an FSB meeting in front of other intel officers.  They walked in and threw a bag over his head and took him right out of the meeting.

            Remember when Trump claimed he fired Comey because of how he treated Hillary Clinton, then a week later admitted on National TV the real reason was because he wouldn't drop the Russia investigation?
           </p>
           <p>
            He's doing that again.   CNN and the Washington Post are reporting that Trump is saying he wants to use the memo to discredit the Department of Justice and to fire Rod Rosenstein in particular.   And Trumps aides seem to leak this really quickly.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             President Donald Trump continues to tell his associates he believes the highly controversial Republican memo alleging the FBI abused its surveillance tools could help discredit the Russia investigation, multiple sources familiar with White House discussions said.
            </p>
            <p>
             In recent phone calls, Trump has told friends he believes the memo would expose bias within the agency's top ranks and make it easier for him to argue the Russia investigations are prejudiced against him, according to two sources.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Senior White House officials and advisers say that President Trump wants the document published because he sees it as key to making changes at the Justice Department, particularly pushing out Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Few things have frustrated Trump as much as the law enforcement agencies he cannot fully control,” Josh Dawsey, Devlin Barrett and Karoun Demirjian report. “Allies say he is upset that he can’t control ‘my guys’ at the ‘Trump Justice Department’ and that no one seems particularly loyal to him. He has also broken long-held protocols by directly calling Justice Department officials, and instructed his chief of staff to do the same, without the White House counsel on the phone.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Q.  Why were Trump's people so eager to let both CNN and the Washington Post know what is going on?
           </p>
           <p>
            A.   Because it's a terrible idea and it will backfire in a major way.   Also with so many of their colleagues talking to Robert Mueller, they know this will come out.  And if they participate in Trump's Obstruction of Justice, they will co-conspirators.   A Trump Legal spokesman is about to talk to Robert Mueller about one of Trump's closest aides, Hope Hicks and that she might have tried to hide documents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is executing his Saturday Night Massacre slowly.  He's working his way up to firing Mueller.  Rosenstein is the person in the way of that.
