<p>Hello Rabbi, thank you for taking the time to read my email. I came across some information and was wondering if you could disprove it. Everything appears to be factually sourced. Could you please help me understand this? I am considering abandoning the Jewish faith.</p>
<p>&quot; First of all you must understand that there are people here that would rather suppress this information and will try to discredit this post, however please note that nobody will be able to disprove the sourced facts I\'ve presented.</p>
<p>It\'s not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It\'s not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It\'s no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I\'m making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.</p>
<p>Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.</p>
<p>The Finders Cult</p>
<p>Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here\'s some information I\'ve compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/Amalek101/1232436">https://voat.co/v/Amalek101/1232436</a></p>
<p>I\'ve identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who\'s behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.</p>
<p>Here\'s the first Satanic band called Coven.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)</a></p>
<p>They\'re also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.</p>
<p><a href="http://sli.mg/senxlZ">http://sli.mg/senxlZ</a></p>
<p>Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.</p>
<p>Bill Traut Jewishhttp://wikivisually.com/lang-de/wiki/Bill_Traut</p>
<p>Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.</p>
<p>&quot;The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called &quot;Satanic Mass&quot; (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as &quot;the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio&quot;).&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)</a></p>
<p>So now I\'ve just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn\'t surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.</p>
<p>I\'m still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what\'s up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.</p>
<p>The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.</p>
<p>I\'m not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.</p>
<p>&quot; You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm</a></p>
<p>Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.</p>
<p>Now here\'s a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.</p>
<p><a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/</a></p>
<p>She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it\'s common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.</p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at their lyrics now. What they\'re describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don\'t forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.</p>
<p>Jewish Blood Libelhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel</p>
<p>&quot; Infants\' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. &quot;</p>
<p>Malchus is a servant to a Jewish high priest.</p>
<p><a href="http://genius.com/albums/Coven/Witchcraft-destroys-minds-reaps-souls">http://genius.com/albums/Coven/Witchcraft-destroys-minds-reaps-souls</a></p>
<p>&quot; In the book of Gideon I have read That the hoarde of evil is not dead In this place where Satan is said to dwell He leads his legions through the depths of Hell&quot;</p>
<p>Gideon was the son of Joash, leader of the Israelites, he won a decisive victory over a Midianite army despite a vast numerical disadvantage, leading a troop of 300 \'valiant\' men.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon</a></p>
<p>&quot; Beelzebub, the prince, is second in line Astaroth, the duke, is drunk with wine Lucifer, the prime minister, handles affairs General Satanachia firmly stares&quot;</p>
<p>All those demons are from the Hebrew bible.</p>
<p>This whole song describes Jewish Satanism. Remember, this was written by a Jew.</p>
<p><a href="http://genius.com/Coven-satanic-mass-lyrics">http://genius.com/Coven-satanic-mass-lyrics</a></p>
<p>Judaism is Satanism. It\'s not a coincidence that all the primary elites busted in paedophile rings are Jews. Epstein has a sacrificial alter on his private paedophile Island.</p>
<p>Anybody claiming that Judaism and Satanism are unrelated is a shill looking out for Jewish interest.</p>
<p>Judaism is Satanism. &quot;</p>
<p>This information was posted in a forum which was discussing the details surrounding  the possible  discovery of a  paedophile ring.  Either this is some top quality sophistry or it\'s accurate information , because I haven\'t been able to disprove any of these claims, and neither have any of my Jewish friends. I\'m hoping you could maybe debunk these claims.  </p>
<p>Thanks </p>

            Don't forget, these satanic groups are infiltrators. They are not Jewish. They call themselves Jewish so they are immune to attacks (like this one!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Be smart, and leave out the Jew references as much as you can, and if you refer to these people as Jews, always explain you don't really mean Jews, just that you mention it since they call themselves Jews.

                The link to Judaism was invented long ago, by themselves. They even concocted the horrors of '40-'45 to discredit people like you, who pick up on this invented link.

           <p>
            "LOL sure. I like how the rabbi's gender changes between your recent troll submissions too. This time she's a chick but your other ones it's a him.
           </p>
           <p>
            And yes I am defending Jews because I am one. A modern Jew who integrates, loves antisemitic jokes and doesn't care about the Talmud or Orthodoxy. But this is obvious trolling to portray us all as nuts and it's not working. From this Jew to an antisemitic troll, fuck off CTR."

             and this right here is why I told the op day's ago to not use the term Jew,,,, it's totally takes away from anything useful that might have been brought up or discovered. I tried to say that he would be better off saying 'Sabbataen Sect of Talmudic Zionist',,,, cuz i'm 100% sure that the average 'jew' has fk all to do with the followers of sabbatai zevi and probably even less knowledge of the Talmud. All his shit posting is actually doing damage and could be nullifing things.... I said it would be better to keep focusing on facts and evidence. If in the end it turned out that the super elite were involved a Sabbataen sect then so be it and we can talk about it then,,,, by dragging this out now and just saying jew is more likely to piss off good people like yourself, alienate future researchers and lay the groundwork for things to be ignored if in the end it does turn out that the super elite were involved in something like that. anyway,,,

              I'm just calling a spade a spade. This guy's a shill and tweaking the same post over and over. It's not a sincere attempt to discuss problems within Judaism or Jewish history. I'll be the first to condemn zionism, refusal to accept cultural integration, and the social backwardness of Hassidics and whatnot. I think a lot of nasty shit is in the Talmud even in context. But this guy isn't even 4chan-level antisemitic. Total shill posting the same garbage to misdirect us. I normally don't care about Jew-bashing because I don't get my feelings hurt over bullshit but this bullshit just so happens to be taking our attention away from pedophiles and that just pisses me off. I'm happy to crack jokes, talk shit, and make SJWs cry over the facts with the best of them. But this guy is a cunt no matter what username he uses. We need to keep it real. CTR spends millions of dollars to put out a narrative. It's so obvious we're literally predicting their every move, like the Russia-planting-cp line. This is more of the same to demonize us (investigators, not Jews).

              You literally just found a rabbi's name and emailed them. Didn't show the full exchange either, selectively edited your other bullshit posts, and are passing it off now as a unique submission.

              Btw, this is your rabbi, a woman who writes inter-faith chants:

                LOL sure. I like how the rabbi's gender changes between your recent troll submissions too. This time she's a chick but your other ones it's a him.

               <p>
                And yes I am defending Jews because I am one. A modern Jew who integrates, loves antisemitic jokes and doesn't care about the Talmud or Orthodoxy. But this is obvious trolling to portray us all as nuts and it's not working. From this Jew to an antisemitic troll, fuck off CTR.
