            Neede Holland!!!  Does that mean "need Holland", and isn't Holland very lax on pedophilia and drugs?  You're right.  KMG definitely needs investigation.  It's possible it's just a miscellaneous sign written for the attraction, but you never know.

            Netherlands is a mark against  but good work.

            Unfortunately the spirals are the least usable symbols to me - a spiral is just too universal and too common.  even the weird shakey smaller double spiral carries more weight.

            DHS put out an advertisement telling us that sometimes things need a second look and to help them to fight human trafficking.  I think you may have identified something serious,

           <p>
            Report it to DHS.  I'm serious.  There's information on reporting suspected trafficking here:

            If we are wrong and it's just coincidental then no big deal, better to be safe than sorry with these things.

            Just like pizza joints it's another venue to have a business and to have a side business that provides the opportunity.

            I am one of the skeptics when submissions used to come up(seem to have died down thankfully) where anything and everything was called TRAFFICKING PLEASE HELP.
           </p>
           <p>
            This definitely looks like good sightings to me.  That symbol on that bright pink bear WOW it has no relation to other stuffed animals that you saw (and usually parks have a lot of the same prizes)  and just how clear it is and with a kid holding it.  I honestly think you spotted something.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those signs -WTF.  You can read "Project Planning / Last (or Lost) 4- 911"  Am I seeing that correctly?  please weigh in.
Then this number 31 0 545 - 294545
           </p>
           <p>
            310 is a Los Angeles prefix.  If you search 310-545-2945 it leads to an eliminated page.  If you go to cache, it leads to an individual.  I don't want to dox, so here is a partial:  E******* C****h,  1xx0  21st St, Manhattan Beach, CA, 90266-4039
           </p>
           <p>
            Very good spot OP IMHO.  If you could have snapped shots of the woman and the girls, maybe turn to over to trusted law enforcement?

             I was going to say that 310-545-XXX IS Manhattan Beach as I used to live there.  It is a very affluent community at the beach just south of LAX.  It has multi-multi-million dollar homes and alot of Hollywood types, in fact Manhattan Beach Studios is home to A Lot of TV shows and Movies.  A good place to look.

            Jesus. It is everywhere. I saw at least ten swirls in two minutes randomly flipping on cartoons, Caillou was one of them. Glad you spotted those and took photos. you'd probably be gangstalked if you reported it to the police.

            It is truly every where!!! We all need to be aware of the signs. I was at the beach in Florida and two men were with a little girl she did not seem to be having a good time she had no emotion on her face. They let her play unattended, and I told one of them she needed to be supervised as she was too little to be in the rough water. The whole thing was very odd as they had absolutely no concern fir the child's safety, and she almost drowned. Even then they did not get her she just sat at the edge of the water breathing trying to catch her breath. When I left, the man tried to take the child that was with me by offering her an ice cream cone. While I was packing the car up. He literally was trying to take her by the hand! It was blatantly done. The traffickers are dangerous always keep awareness around them. I never thought of them as traffickers until I became aware of this investigation. Had I known then what I know today I might have been able to alert someone...who knows? Were you able to alert the authorities?

             As of right now, I don't trust the authorities.  The fair itself displays the logo.  So unfortunately no, I did not report.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I am looking forward to, however, is legitimately being about to report it AND have something done about it.

             However, we (society) cannot rescue kids because we simply do not have a safe place to put them RIGHT NOW.  Child protective services, in its current state, cannot be used.  We need to establish safe places to put these rescued children.

             Our infrastructure needs to be ready to receive both victims and perps if anything is done on a mass scale.  Medical care will be needed. Housing.

              It makes my blood boil. Raising awareness is the first step but as you so well describe so many other steps are necessary. There are so many resources to everyone else except the ones who most deserve it children who are victimized. What a tragedy.

               Yes, but raising awareness is such a SLOW process. Sometimes I just wish some talented hacker would hack Taylor Swift's (or any celeb with a huge following) twitter account and post that Ben Swann video saying PG is real.

            Not all swirls are pedo symbology remember.. I mean, I used to draw swirls when I was younger... I've even doodled ones fairly recently (albeit not in the last 3 months). The style in the FBI declassified documents was a triangle circle and sketchy (slightly triangled) swirl... NOT just ANY swirls...

             Exactly. I mean there are exactly two prominent features to describe that symbol(s). It's 1. a spiral and 2. a triangle.
If you now look for matches you should make sure both is featured in the symbol, otherwise it's nothing. It's not that hard. :D
