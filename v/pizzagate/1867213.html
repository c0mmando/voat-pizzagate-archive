             No.   He was always hinky.    Check out what he was most known for before this.    I think he's lying about his resume too.

             The Fox reporter deserves blame too.   Didn't call the family?   Didn't call the FBI?    There's no way a good reporter doesn't know this guy was hinky.

             Rod Wheeler backtracks statements about Seth Rich investigation

             We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.
            </p>
            <p>
             What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.
            </p>
            <p>
             In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:

Rod Wheeler Rod Wheeler backtracks statements about Seth Rich investigation
FOX 5 DC: “You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...”
            </p>
            <p>
             WHEELER: "For sure..."
            </p>
            <p>
             FOX 5 DC: “...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?"
            </p>
            <p>
             WHEELER: "Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed."
            </p>
            <p>
             In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as "miscommunication."
