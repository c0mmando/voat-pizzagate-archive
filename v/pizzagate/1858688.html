            It's actually worse than you think. According to

            , one particular B.C. lawyer, Peter Leask, played a prominent role in chasing Andres-Auger out of the province, getting Cram institutionalized, and getting well-connected Vancouver pedophiles off with minimal penalties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Care to guess where Peter Leask is now?

            I looked into this Vancouver club and it appears they have a website and for paid membership you have access to their club which is a lounge bar restaurant wedding venue type services but also, more interestingly, the rooms with beds upstairs. I suppose if you have a secure private back entrance and rooms with beds you can hide a lot of nefarious activity.

            Seems like a well sourced article, including who said what and when. Recommending to read to full article, but here's something quoted:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In B.C., there are persistent rumours suggesting that trafficking in drugs and the sexual exploitation of children, many of them Aboriginal, converge in corruption involving high officials in the judiciary and the B.C. Law Society.
            </p>
            <h1>
             The Experiences of Jack Cram and Renate Andres-Auger
            </h1>
            <p>
             In 1999, Jennifer Wade, a founder of Amnesty International in Vancouver, referred to this in a keynote presentation at the Global Conference on the Commercial Exploitation of Children and Youth. As part of her talk, Wade looked back at the experiences of Jack Cram and Renate Andres-Auger.
             <strong>
              Andres-Auger was the Cree lawyer in B.C. who brought forward allegations about the sexual exploitation of children.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1994, Andres-Auger hired Jack Cram to be her lawyer after she fell into difficulties. Wade explained this history as follows: “The
             <strong>
              sex trade in children
             </strong>
             is not a recent happening in Vancouver. While doing some research for this presentation, I came across the affidavit of a Cree lawyer named Renate Andres-Auger naming prominent legal personalities and the B.C. Law Society for destroying her legal practice and libeling and slandering her (I have a copy of that affidavit listing prominent plaintiffs with me).** Renate Auger alleged this
             <strong>
              happened partly because of her knowledge of pedophile rings operating out of the Vancouver Club and out of resorts in Whistler
             </strong>
             . In a very bizarre scene as it was described in the papers I discovered, Ms. Auger and her lawyer, Jack Cram, were first not listened to in the court, and then were handcuffed and dragged out of the courtroom to a jail cell. When Jack Cram eventually did speak, he put before the judge some of his
             <strong>
              allegations involving cover-ups by the head officers of the Law Society and the judiciary to aid and abet pedophiles and drug dealers
             </strong>
             . When he insisted on giving more details on radio, Jack Cram was
             <strong>
              met by ten policemen
             </strong>
             upon his return from a radio station. He was then
             <strong>
              put into an ambulance and taken to the psychiatric
             </strong>
             ward of Vancouver General Hospital. He believes he was injected again and again with
             <strong>
              mind disorienting drugs.
             </strong>
             ”
