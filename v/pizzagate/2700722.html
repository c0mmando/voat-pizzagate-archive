<p><a href="https://oliviacollette.com/">https://oliviacollette.com/</a></p>
<p>Last year she published an article on rogerebert.com openly discussing why she won\'t watch Woody Allen movies any more:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/why-i-stopped-watching-woody-allen-movies">https://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/why-i-stopped-watching-woody-allen-movies</a></p>
<p>This was unprecedented for a major, prestigious movie review site (also speaks well for the independence of the site\'s publishers.)</p>
<p>Then this year the entertainment section of Canada\'s largest newspaper ran an article detailing how many in the movie business regret having worked with Woody Allen, and having given him a pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2018/01/17/more-actors-express-regret-over-working-with-woody-allen.html">https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2018/01/17/more-actors-express-regret-over-working-with-woody-allen.html</a></p>
<p>That article mentions Woody Allen getting financing from Amazon, but now it looks like Amazon is cutting him loose and it looks like his financing for his next movie production has been cut off:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456497/woody-allen-will-not-film-a-movie-next-year-for-the-first-time-in-decades">https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456497/woody-allen-will-not-film-a-movie-next-year-for-the-first-time-in-decades</a></p>
<p>I think the take-home lesson is that even the most well-entrenched pedophiles can be brought down by continued highlighting of their crimes.</p>
<p>Now the question is, how to keep it up. Especially by people who don\'t write for mainstream media.</p>
<p>Social media posting for example? Posting comments at publications that still have comment sections? Demonstrations, like those being held outside the Catholic church locations?</p>
<p>Maybe it will be useful to stop the pedophile careers of crooked politicians and government insiders too.</p>
<p>People need to be reminded that Kamala Harris, for example, refused to prosecute Catholic pedophile priests when she was a DA in California.</p>
<p>And people need to be reminded that as a prosecutor in California, Robert Mueller let Isaac Asimov\'s son, who had been caught red-handed with one of the biggest stashes of CP on his computers ever found by the cops, get off with 6 months of house arrest. Then, when Robert Mueller worked for the FBI, he approved the deal that got Jeffrey Epstein off with a 13-month sentence where he was allowed out during the day to go to work.</p>
<p>These people need to have the meme attached to them, for example: &quot;<em>Harris covers for Catholic pedophiles</em>&quot; &quot;<em>Mueller lets pedophiles get off with a slap on the wrist</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe then they\'ll become toxic enough to the public that their handlers will throw them under the bus (and expose themselves at the same time.)</p>',

            There are a lot of pedos in the movie biz but I don’t believe Woody Allen in one of them. No hard evidence. I believe Dylan’s account was created by Mia as a revenge tactic against Woody.

            Rebecca, this is a perfect example of why you are STILL a danger to my family. 
Didn’t you ask all of your followers to write to ICE on your behalf? 
The blog? I turned it in to ICE cyber crimes. Are they asking for your passwords or electronics? 
I wrote a blog about you calling your attorney and telling her you thought you would look for a new attorney. Why would you call your attorney and say “oh hey! BTW I think I will look for a new attorney.” And then try to blame me? 
Why are YOU doing this Rebecca? 
You have driven this bus for over three years and it’s one HUGE drama incident after another. It’s like there is no stopping you. 
You know everything there is to know about me to the inclusion of my password to social media. You know I’m hiding nothing after living in my house for 15 months yet you come and make several posts, preying on the emotions of people on VOAT to investigate me. To find what exactly? I’m a paid CIA controlled opposition? 
I’m a 60 year old grandmother, who minds my own dang business and yet here I am. 
If my credit raiting will tell you anything? I have ZERO debt. I’m proud of that. 
Now what? 
This is not reality to you Rebecca. If you knew ANYTHING about me you should have known better than this. Reality has come knocking. Reality CHECK.

             And if you think I take any sort of joy in this? 
I have watched the case that could have meant something to future survivors get made social media fodder for months and it makes me sick. This has been an effort to be a social media presence, not a survivor, in need of rescue, taking their case seriously and working hard to prove to the US immigration court you are a good candidate to be a US citizen. This isn’t even in my scope of comprehension.

              I am sorry you feel that way. Please tell ICE I will be a good candidate for US citizenship. If you say I am a bad person it will only make you look bad, because you brought me here and told me how to play it, with the visas. I will keep praying for you.

            Lmao. More nonsense. So how come the stars out Woody, the pigs never make arrest, Woody keeps making films, stars that call him out keep working for him, the same stars that call him out cover for the rest of the industry? How long does it take for you guys to get it? You are so easily manipulated. You actually think they are in any danger?

            She is dishing the dirt on me and trying hard to take me down. Along with Sarah, Fiona and Howie!
           </p>
           <p>
            Catherine has posted here in the past in full support of me, so what has happened to make her changer her mind?
This is causing me extreme anxiety as i have an immigration case before the ninth circuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Catherine has threatened to expose me to ICE. Some one has got to her. Her entire blog is trying to discredit me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not sure how to handle this, so can you help me here researchers? Thank you.

            So Stanley Kubrick's infamous Eyes Wide Shut film had over 20 minutes edited out after he died mysteriously.  Kubrick's archives are located in London, and the original complete script might be there--

            It shouldn't be too hard to access the archive, especially if you are a student, just look professional and be prepared to say you're working on a paper or something.  I've accessed archives like this in the US and it was trivial.

            I think what people need to remember is that Harvey Weinstein sold his production company, then formed a new production company that was in direct competition with the old one. He made himself into an enemy of the Hollywood movie elite, then #metoo happened to ruin him. There has been financial benefit for Hollywood elites, because those who have been outed by #metoo are small fry directors, independents, and TV people: the competition. Woody Allen hasn't been socially relevant for a long time, but his movies are independent, they compete with Hollywood.

            It doesn't really matter about their fundage because all of these people are old as fuck and rich as hell already. They can live the last 10 years of their lives with all of the money that they already have. It doesn't matter if they lose their money unless they truly are retarded.

                 Mueller has been the insider who runs interference for the political elites, or the Deep State.

                <p>
                 Need for a useful pedophile to skate? Mueller's your guy.

                <p>
                 Need to bury stories about FBI intimidation of witnesses in the Franklin Scandal? Mueller's your guy.

                <p>
                 Need to promote Democrat myths about Russian interference before the midterm elections? Mueller's your guy.

                <p>
                 Need to make rumors that Seth Rich was killed in retaliation for the Wikileaks email releases go away? Mueller's the guy you need to indict a bunch of Russians, and claim
                 <strong>
                  they
                 </strong>
                 were the leak source.

                <p>
                 But Mueller's involvement in getting pedophiles off may be his weak point. If that gets publicized, the public will react.

                  Maybe we should flood the front page with Mueller posts.  Everyone on twitter should push all this info too.  We could do a Meme Campaign.  He just irks me to NO end.

                  Dupont  and Truesdale.  The fact that he intimidated the witnesses of the Franklin Scandal and just blew off the Boston Scandal should make everyone sit up and take notice.

                   When Lawrence E. King got out of jail, an old friend of his from Nebraska, who had moved to Virginia and started a chain of car dealerships, gave Lawrence King a job at a place called Stirling BMW.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   A Voater who lived near Stirling. Virginia, went to the car dealership and handed a packet of info on Lawrence King to the receptionist, and asked him if he knew a child rapist was working at the dealership.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   When he went back two weeks later, he said he was told that Lawrence King was no longer working at the dealership.

                 I'm sick of Mueller.  They keep pronouncing his name wrong.  It's not Muller it is Mueller.  Long U.  I knew about his brushing aside of Franklin Scandal and have hated him ever since.  Trump keeps talking about how Sessions has let Mueller have too long of a rope.  Why does Trump not fire Sessions.  This has gone on far too long.  Sessions needs to go if he doesn't dump Mueller now.  I have read on here that some think he may be related to Heinrich Mueller.  Maybe that is why he keeps insisting people call him Muller.

            Personally, I think they choose Woody Allen as a fall guy - kind of 'see, we
            <em>
             don't
            </em>
            accept pedos in Hollywood anymore, hoping after that it's gonna be business as usual. He's 80+, and at the end of his career anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            But as we know, #MeToo fired backwards too, and it become a remarkable movement in many countries, which no one of those who initiated it in order to throw Weinstein under the bus could have foreseen.

             Yes, I think this is something these people who live in the Hollywood bubble don't "get."

            <p>
             They're desensitized to it, I think they really are clueless as to how angry people get about sexual assault, and they have no idea how visceral the reaction to this stuff is among the public.
