Child Sex Rings: A Behavioral Analysis for Criminal Justice Professionals  handling cases of child sexual exploitation [Second Edition, 1992]

<hr />
<p>On Page 9, Lanning states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Society\'s attitude about child sexual abuse and exploitation can be summed up in one word: denial. Most people do not want to hear about it and would prefer to pretend that child sexual victimization just does not occur. Today, however, it is difficult to pretend that it does not happen. Stories and reports about child sexual victimization are daily occurrences. It is important for professionals dealing with child sexual abuse to recognize and learn to manage this denial of a serious problem. Professionals must overcome the denial and encourage society to deal with, report, and prevent sexual victimization of children.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we all can here unanimously agree to the truth of the statement above. Lanning goes on: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Some professionals, however, in their zeal to make American society more aware of this victimization, tend to exaggerate the problem. Presentations and literature with poorly documented or misleading claims about one in three children being sexually molested, the $5 billion child pornography industry, child slavery rings, and50,000 stranger-abducted children are not uncommon. The problem is bad enough; it is not necessary to exaggerate it. Professionals should cite reputable and scientific studies and note the sources of information. If they do not, when the exaggerations and distortions are discovered, their credibility and the credibility of the issue are lost.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I do not entirely agree with Lanning here entirely, however, I do believe he has a point. I, for one, do believe that the problem we are facing is indeed of a colossal size with regards to pizzagate, after having examined the persons and entities who are involved in the scandal. They are powerful, influential and extremely wealthy. The resources which they have at their disposal seem immeasurable. Not to mention the fact that, additionally, they also have the staggering influence and power of the Mainstream Media working on their behest. Also, the discovery of the vast and widespread underground subculture in the arts and the entertainment industry which seems to be working tirelessly, inventing clever forms of subliminal visuals and covert suggestions for psychological desensitization of the citizenry to the hypersexualization of children, and with the ultimate goal of achieving normalcy of pedophiliac relationships between adults and children within society. No doubt, the monster we face is indeed a Behemoth. However, I believe what Lanning is suggesting here is of use, which is to keep the focus of our campaign, concise and to the point. I know that we have mountains of evidence on our side, however, I believe it\'s time we devoted our energy into polishing the evidence which we have gathered. Which means the focus needs to be quality vs. quantity. And herein is where the research of persons such as Kenneth Lanning comes into play. </p>
<p>Here\'s what I mean: Kenneth Lanning\'s material is a mainstream source which is accepted as credible by the law enforcement agencies, as well as Child welfare and child protection/care agencies across the nation. His materials are used for educating and training personnel for the very purpose of engaging in investigations such as the one which we now find ourselves engaged in. What I\'m suggesting is, that we weaponize his research and materials and format pizzagate within it. Use it as the foundation for our evaluations and conclusions of the corroborating evidence which we have gathered. And not just his, but also of other mainstream sources of authoritative research: scientific and scholarly criminology works of evidence-based research.  
</p>
<p>In my last submission regarding this, someone mentioned that Ted Gunderson had said that Kenneth Lanning was Satanist. I was not aware of this prior to this individual informing me of this. Though it causes me to cringe that Kenneth Lanning may be satanist and his writing of these materials was nothing but a charade, however in my humble opinion, pizzagate nevertheless still fits the typology of what is described within his research and training materials. And that is the point. Because let us face it, Ted Gunderson is NOT accepted as credible mainstream source. No Whistle Blowers are (except perhaps WikiLeaks to a degree, which of course works to our advantage). The point is that their names and their stories have been so suppressed and so maligned, that the minute you bring them up as a source for reference, people either stare at you in a complete blank or in utter dismay and disbelief, due to the utterly shredded and stomped repute of your source. </p>
<p>This is not to say that Ted Gunderson or others alike are not credible or truthful. I wholly believe they are credible. However, we must face the fact that pinning our research on their words is not exactly working to our advantage when to comes to trying to convince the most statist and utterly comatose population of our citizenry because their minds have been so habituated to tune you out the minute that you bring up fringe sources and make them your foundation for catapulting your abysmal Red Pill down the public\'s throat.
