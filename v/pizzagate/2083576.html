In fact he was the first. This nutjob films in court (that you can never do in Australia - my dad couldn't even use a 2B pencil when watching the Port Macquarie 60C NSW Crimes Act case of an aboriginal teenager accuse of the crime of knowing a secret gay cop is gay) but pete is allowed to FILM. And he has been in Merkle's germany as a REFUGEE BEFORE THE BOAT PEOPLE INFLUX HELLO! The guy is a complete fucken nut, and that's coming from a real political refugee from Australia me.

Vinny eastwood is an OTO supporting shill who's best mates with Mark Passio and Cancel the Cabel - proven shills publshing disinfo they know is fake here on the Fiona Barnett threads.

            This post got some electrons firing in my keenly associative memory. I thought I would share.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guys this is pre-internet re-hashed news from the 90s - drawn up from my memory.
           </p>
           <p>
            A family that was
            <em>
             NOT done
            </em>
            for a drug bust (but should have) in NSW the home of Evelyn Pettigrew. we house swapped had naked family photo-shoots on the wall. Her husband was a psychiristrist who later killed his TEENAGE mental patient he was having an affair with and it was big news 30 years ago.

            The name of her murdering Husband is in that article but you'd have to go to the library and dig through the Microfische to find the story of the murder suacide.
           </p>
           <p>
            The was a shed full of "pot" seedlings growing in the backyard used to put the daughter through college. We never reported that of course. I remember hearing about massive drug busts in Tomerong but they never founded who planeted it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is where she used to live from memory: snipped it was in Tomerong two houses down from the intersection of jervis bay road I think.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google found her former address and it matches up with my memory. Unless it's been removed there should be a private monument to prince phillip and elizabeth going to this address and meeting some chidlren right here:

            Pettigrew E. 349 Hawken Rd, Tomerong,
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's where it gets interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a flag pole (wooden base &amp; steel) errected to with a plaque that says this is to commerate the visit of Prince Phillip and the Queen in the 60s to Australia, and talks about the children they met.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Everlyn She didn't own the house or the land then, but the plaque says they stopped in on their trek to Jervis bay for a spot of tea with their royal subjects. It was an interesting flag pole I remember them having in their front yard under that pine tree.
           </p>
           <p>
            God only knows what they did when the royals did were in Australia. How many aboriginal kids went missing from the settlement in Jervis bay eh?
           </p>
           <p>
            I also almost drowned in a pool owned by two faggots who tried to turn the neighbouring farm in Berry NSW into a amusement park but failed. Why not pull up where it was on google maps.

            Where I grew up got demolished and is now a retirement home. Just behind it is a hill. The whole place has been redeveloped by trendies. I knew it as the farming town it once was.

              I updated my comment. But I'm sure the king and queen visited that address and there was a flag pole put up there to commerate said visit - a private affiar. Only someone who visited that private poperty would know this trivia. Who knows if dead bodies are there.... Weird family. Into child abuse and killing children. My mother had strange friends from her Urban Hebicultre Tafe Course, I think that's how she met her.

               My son went to a house in Washington that had been bought by a rich female in the early 1900s. She had targetted homeless females. Rows of trees had bodies underneath.

              ask some ozzies to bring the shovel and offer to plant a tree if they don't find anything. Could be a good excuse of for a day trip 3 days south of sydney ;)

            Kevin Annett and ITCCS have yet to prove themselves legitimate. The only sources this article cites are a YouTube video and the ITCCS website. I would do more research before believing anything they say.
