<p>&quot;Lawrence Krauss, accused of sexual misconduct, received $250K from Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender now facing federal sex-trafficking charges, donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to an Arizona State University program run by Lawrence Krauss, a now-retired professor who was accused of sexual misconduct. </p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein, a high-profile financier, donated $250,000 to the Origins Project over a seven-year span.&quot;

<p>Lawrence Krauss “scientifically” shows Jeffrey Epstein is no pedophile</p>
<p>&quot;The question then becomes: why did Krauss really humiliate the scientific community by inexorably associating science—or shall we say scientism—with pedophiles? Well, Krauss launched the Origins Project at Arizona State, and Epstein was actually paying Krauss’ bill. “Epstein was one of the Origins Project’s major donors.”

             Certain states seem to be targeted.....in the past thought it was from mafia ties but now maybe not so much...the same types of people seem to go to the same places for their "work"........thinking Penn., Ohio, Fl, NC, Az  and now California. Still think ley lines have something to do with it as the works are amplified at crossings.As an example Minot , ND is on a crossing where WE store our nukes. Cathedrals are often on crossings ....Dr. Joseph Ferrell says the music and shape of buildings amplify energy , even the music. And the way western governments and vatican have systemically promoted pedophilia makes you wonder. When a child is taken and raped, the families and also entire communities are diminished. Easier to control that way. Would think a parent never gets over it , same as children.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Caris Life Sciences, Inc. (CLS)..Founded in 1987, based in Irving, TX, with additional offices in Phoenix, AZ, and Basel, Switzerland. .Dr. David D. Halbert, age 62, is the Chairman and CEO.
             </p>
             <p>
              About David Halbert - He graduated from Abilene Christian University in 1978 with a BS in business administration. Prior to founding CLS, he founded
              <strong>
               AdvancePCS
              </strong>
              , a leading pharmacy benefits management company...He also acquired Pathology Partners, Inc., in 2005, based in Irving, TX, which was later renamed Caris Diagnostics. He served as Chairman of the Nutrition and Scientific Advisory Boards of
              <strong>
               Herbalife International of America, Inc
              </strong>
              ., and as Independent Director of Herbalife Ltd. from March 2006 to May 2007. In 2008, he acquired Molecular Profiling Institute (MPI), a molecular life sciences company. In 2011, Caris Diagnostics was sold to Miraca Life Sciences for $725 million.
             </p>
             <p>
              How did Dr. David Halbert, with only a bachelor's degree in business administration from Abilene Christian University, become so successful and wealthy? ..David D. Halbert's grandfather had become rich on Texas oil, and his father was a prominent Abilene physician who led the building of one of the city's hospitals. After completing his degree in business administration, he began working in the oil and gas industry, as did his younger brother, Jon. In the mid-1980's, both David and Jon took an interest in the rising trend of home healthcare and began looking for investors to start a mail order pharmacy, whcih they called Advance Paradigm and later became AdvancePCS.
              <strong>
               One of the original investors in Advance Paradigm was George W. Bush. Halbert's career took off.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2001, then President George W. Bush came under fire for his business connections with Halbert in the mid-1990's. Halbert and his family had contributed funds to several of Bush's campaigns. Bush had sold off his stocks in Halbert's Advance Paradigm in 1998 to avoid a conflict of interest. The two had remained friends, however, and Bush approached Halbert in 2001 to help write a controversial proposal to offer drug discount cards to seniors. Many felt the move was inappropriate because AdvancePCS stood to benefit from the program if Medicare endorsed the company to issue the cards. The Medicare Prescription Drug Discount Card Program was enacted into law on December 8, 2003.

             <p>
              Why Did Kamala Harris Let Herbalife Off The Hook?
             </p>
             <p>
              Harris declined to investigate Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company that has been accused of fraudulent marketing practices. Documents exclusively obtained by Yahoo News show that in 2015, prosecutors in the San Diego office of the California attorney general sent Harris a lengthy memorandum that argued for an investigation into Herbalife and requested resources in order to undertake such an investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Similar investigations into Herbalife were already taking place elsewhere.
             </p>
             <p>
              About three weeks after the San Diego letter was sent, Harris received the first of three donations to her campaign for the U.S. Senate from Heather Podesta, the powerful Washington lobbyist whose ex-husband Tony’s firm, then called the Podesta Group, had worked for Herbalife since 2013. Heather Podesta’s own lobbying firm, Heather Podesta and Partners, would soon be hired by Herbalife, too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Harris did not pursue an investigation, even as the Federal Trade Commission proceeded with an investigation of its own, which had been opened the previous March and which suggested that sufficient grounds for such scrutiny did exist. In fact, the San Diego letter had meticulously laid out those grounds, pointing out that Herbalife presented itself to the public as a lawful enterprise, but that it could nevertheless be “engaged in less obvious conduct” that potentially harmed both Herbalife distributors and Herbalife customers. Allegations of such conduct, by 2015, had become commonplace in media reports
             </p>
             <p>
              Harris never gave a reason for declining to investigate Herbalife, but the decision stand in contrast to her oft-expressed promise to fight for ordinary Americans for whom the 21st century economy seems to hold little promise. Those are the very same Americans, critics say, that Herbalife recruited — and exploited.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wilkes did not know that at the time, Herbalife was represented by Venable, which also employed Harris’s husband, Douglas Emhoff. Emhoff does not appear to have been involved in Herbalife’s affairs, but his work at the firm came to the attention of Christopher Irons, a financial journalist who first reported on the Emhoff-Herbalife connection.
             </p>
             <p>
              The activists asking Harris to investigate Herbalife did not seem to know that she had a personal connection to the the law firm representing the corporation. “That’s news to me,” Wilkes said when told by Yahoo News about Emhoff’s law firm
             </p>
             <p>
              Podesta, the Washington lobbyist whose ex-husband represented Herbalife, donated $1,000 to Harris’s campaign for the U.S. Senate on March 31, 2015, at the end of the same month that had seen the arrival of the letter from the San Diego office, asking for an Herbalife investigation. She donated $4,400 to Harris’s senate campaign the following year. (Podesta had made smaller donations, of $100 and $500, to Harris in 2010 and 2014, respectively. She did not respond to requests for comment.)
             </p>
             <p>
              That July, Herbalife hired a top Podesta deputy, Eric Rosen, to serve as its top government relations official. The following year, Herbalife paid Heather Podesta $250,000 for her lobbying work.

              I think this Instagram deserves more scrutiny: (1) although Alefantis posted it and added the hashtag #carisjames he doesn't know who the child is - he refers to it as a HE (2) Izette Folger knows who the child is and informs Alefantis that it's a SHE baby.
