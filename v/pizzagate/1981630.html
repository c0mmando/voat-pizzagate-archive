<p>Hmm. Spidey sense tingling. I keep searching.</p>
<p>So I find the website to &quot;Roy Rogers Happy Trails Foundation&quot; and there are some interesting entries.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
Roy and Dale loved children and  spent a lifetime devoted to children and children’s charities, including the Happy  Trails Children’s Foundation for abused and neglected children....
The Happy Trails Children’s Foundation built the Cooper Home in Apple Valley, CA, the long-time home of Roy and Dale, to provide a safe haven for children-at-risk <em>who have been severely abused and/or neglected</em>...
Today, the Cooper Home serves as a long-term residential care and treatment center for <em>severely abused boys</em>. The day to day operations of the Cooper Home are provided by <em>Trinity Youth Services</em>, a national non-profit child care organization with more than 40 years experience operating children’s programs in 14 group homes and foster family agencies. Happy Trails Children’s Foundation in partnership with Trinity Youth Services continually operates the Cooper Home at maximum capacity with 44 boys between the ages of 10 and 16, plus we have a lengthy waiting list!  <em>These are boys who have been so severely abused, Child Protective Services has removed them from their homes</em> and the courts send them to us for a very intensive treatment program of group and individual therapy. 
&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Wow! so a Hollywood guy with a pedo swirl logo happens to have founded a charity for severely abused boys taken from their families by CPS!
Let\'s keep digging shall we?</p>
<p>What else do we know about Hollywood star Roy Rogers?</p>
<p>According to the website happytrailsforever:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/GXPx7">http://archive.is/GXPx7</a></p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
Roy was a loving husband and proud father of nine children, with 15 grandchildren, and 33 great-grandchildren. <em>He and Dale truly had an International family, adopting</em> Dodie, an American Indian girl, Debbie, a Korean American girl, and <em>Sandy, a little boy from Kentucky, who had been severely abused</em>. Marion , a foster daughter from Scotland, came to live with them as a teenager.... 
Through the years, <em>they made hundreds of visits to children’s hospitals and orphanages all over the country</em>....
...<em>he originally wanted to be a Dentist</em>...
<em>Roy was a 33rd Degree Mason</em> and a true friend of everyone. 
&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Wow! how many pizzagate checkboxes are we up to now? Hollywood, Children\'s Nonprofits, CPS kidnapping, International adoption, Masonry, even dentistry! Shades of Saville with all those childrens hospital/orphanage visits?</p>
<p>Also - check out how many of their own children died untimely deaths.</p>
<p>Let\'s check out Trinity Youth Services in California, which runs the Roy Rogers Foundation Cooper Home.</p>
<p>Wow, why are there so many locations all surrounding San Bernardino National Forest?
What goes on there?</p>
<p>I highly recommend pizzagate truth seekers consider that Roy Rogers and his foundation could be a big piece of the puzzle and help dig into any associated nonprofits still in operations.</p>
<p>Some parting tidbits:</p>
<p>According to a tell-all by porn queen Linda Lovelace, Roy had a perverted &quot;Jeckle &amp; Hyde&quot; personality:</p>

<p>It also seems that he may have actually been the first one to find Marylin Monroe, the future mind controlled honeypot.</p>

<p>Submission is relevant to pizzagate due to potential Hollywood pedo elite preying on children through nonprofit &quot;charity&quot; efforts, pedo logo, subjects documented Masonry and perverted sex habits</p>',

            Remind me to tell you about my meeting with Roy Rogers at his house you mentioned one night where he answered the door w/ a shotgun, in his pajama's. Unless I get in trouble for larping. Right now I'm kind of down lol.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: "But Bopper you always say that, my gosh!"  On a serious note, yeah he was big time Hollywood and he and Dale his wife were really into kids and charity work, supposedly big time Christians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing would surprise me, they kept a very friendly public persona but probably all show (as in show biz). I think Roy was quite powerful and def a big star back in the day. International star.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're gonna shatter my childhood memories of Roy w/ that Linda Lovelace story. Everybody is so screwed up and not who they appear to be. Roy prob'ly knew Reagan well.

             I am going to be shattered too, but am ready, especially after all the other let downs.  Thanks for bringing this to our attention. But.  I am not too thrilled with believing anything out of the Enquirer.  Was he a philanderer?  Could be.  Was his org. suspect.  Could be.  There have been many of these children's orphanages and homes that were horrible places where the elite "received" their victims.  I am saying we should do research on this and then come to a decision.  I am thinking this will not come out good for the org.  but that article with Lovelace is a little over kill.  They are not known for their high class journalism, Just Sayin'.

              Hey Carmencita, I'd be disappointed too. But I'm not surprised about anyone anymore. I didn't read the Lovelace article. You and I are close to the same age.

              When younger we knocked on Roy's door at 11PM at night cause my California cousins lived near him. He had no gates or walls. This was not long after the Manson murders and relatively close to same area. So I'm sure we spooked him (I was telling my cousins they were lying about knowing where he lived).
             </p>
             <p>
              Dale spoke through the door and we told her we wanted to see Roy and she said hang on and got him. He was in his PJ's and holding a shotgun. Asked us what this was all about. We convinced him we were just innocent kids wanting to see him and he relaxed. He said go to his museum tomorrow.
             </p>
             <p>
              So while at the counter to pay (next day) Dale called and told the cashier to let us in free, and apologized about Roy having a shotgun but that he was a "deputy sheriff" in the town. They were nice people outwardly. So we got to see Trigger who was stuffed. And the dog. Trigger is in Branson MO now but not open to public.
             </p>
             <p>
              Roy's museum was in Victorville, above LA, and his home was a few miles away in Apple Valley. We were surprised how relatively modest the home was. Of course back then the area wasn't so built up. I love California. Okay all done!

             Who the fuck put you in charge horsefucker. This is a fucking investigation, consider it a tribute to the "real investigators" the world has known in the past. In the face of adversity those long-gone heroes did their part to investigate, with the means they had. Much in the same way we're using our meager means to investigate PG. Also: It's about time someone gave a slap in the face of all the corrupt and chickshit "real investigators" who aren't doing shit.
