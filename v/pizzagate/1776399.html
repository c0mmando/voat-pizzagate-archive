<p>The above link consists of eight audios by an Irish-Catholic Jesuit priest who speaks of plans for the New World Order, Satanism and Pedophilia from a biblical and an historical perspective.  Although his name is not identified, it can be none other than the former Father Malachi Martin (1921-1999).</p>
<p>Father Malachi Martin, a/k/a Michael Serafian, was also a writer of 17 works of fiction and non-fiction books critical of the Catholic Church.  As a priest in Europe, he became disillusioned with the Church, left the priesthood, moved to NYC, and became a citizen.</p>
<p>It is said that Father Martin was the impetus behind the 1973 movie, &quot;The Exorcist.&quot;  If you recall, after the movie came out, there were actually a few bizarre, strange actor deaths.  There is evidence that Father Martin actually assisted in an exorcism in Egypt that he had to take over because the primary priest simply could not continue with the exorcism.</p>
<p>Controversy shrouds Father Martin\'s death which occurred 4 days after his 78th birthday due to a cerebral hemorrhage from a fall down the stairs of his apartment in NYC.   He survived the fall, but I could not determine a length of time between the fall and his death.  Regardless, he was able to attribute the fall to an invisible force that pushed him.  A former CIA agent said he died after speaking to a &quot;possessed&quot; child in America.  
</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Father Martin was working on his most controversial and important book - &quot;How the Institutional Catholic Church Became a Creature of the New World Order.&quot;</p>',

            There is also this ex-Jesuit Priest named Alberto Rivera who spoke up about the infiltration of the Vatican and their NWO agenda. He was later found dead in his apartment dead, poisoned. This is a Must Read and Watch!

            PG trivia:  Sir Richard Branson (who invited Clement Freud for the inaugural flight of his Virgin Atlantic Airline, who befriended Gerry McCann, and who recently invited Obama for the famous island getaway post POTUS vacation), invested in Mike Oldfield when no one else would: Oldfield helped to secure the success of Richard Branson’s Virgin empire with his 1973 instrumental hit Tubular Bells (above). It was the Virgin label’s first album release.
            <a href="http://www.mikeoldfield.org/index.php/info/biography/music-darkness/1973-taking-world-storm/">
             http://www.mikeoldfield.org/index.php/info/biography/music-darkness/1973-taking-world-storm/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "The only record company to show any interest was Mercury records from America who would only record if vocals were added. At this point Mike gave up all hope and was relegated to working as reserve guitars on the West End musical "Hair", and played a couple of gigs with Alex Harvey.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fortunately, though, Mike's luck was about to change. On a visit to a newly built 16 track studio in The Manor, Oxfordshire with is latest band, he played the demo to the resident studio engineer Tom Newman. He was so impressed by what he heard that he brough it to the attention of the then up and coming head of Virgin Mail Order, a certain Richard Branson. At this point Virgin themselves were in dire fanancial straits but Branson decided to take the risk of becoming Mike's manager and provide the initial sum of money so that recording could begin.
           </p>
           <p>
            On 25th May, 1973, Virgin Records launched their label by releasing Tubular Bells (V2001) on an unsuspecting world and were greeted by unprecendented acclaim. At this point Virgin decided to organise a live performance of Bells at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall to promote the LP."
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite fitting when you think about it.

             Father Malachi Martin was a guest on Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM a long time ago. Some of the best shows Art had done.

            Also, if you really want to head down the rabbit hole on the NWO. I suggest you start with William Cooper.

             Jimmy Church did a great show that is a good starting point.

            On top of writing one of the cornerstone books on conspiracy - Behold a Pale Horse, he also had a radio show "Hour of the Time" . He isn't easy to listen to at times, but when you dive into his shows where Bill Clinton was in office, you will see major parallels into what we are seeing today. Note that these shows are from the early 90's.

            I have heard Father Martin speak on numerous occasions...many on C2C.  He was investigating the black pope when he died.
