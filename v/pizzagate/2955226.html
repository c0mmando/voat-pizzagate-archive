With that said, what I DO remember was the very beginning of the whole thing but specifically, how Reddit systematically attempted to shut down any and all research into pizzagate within days or us organizing a subreddit. </p>
<p>Before I go any further, yes. I was a moderator for <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">r/Pizzagate</a> and helped mod the original pizzagate sub as well as facilitate the research in the beginning. My proof <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122231545/https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/about/moderators">here</a>. I was invited to become a moderator here at <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>, but declined. <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6zbh.png">Proof here</a>. With all of that said...</p>
<p>As you all know, before pizzagate was called pizzagate, we only had an idea about it from the leaked Podesta/DNC emails that came from WikiLeaks. My then co-mod at the time, pizzathrowaway777, created the subreddit called <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">r/Pizzagate</a>. People said the name choice was stupid but obviously it stuck. Within a matter of days we had an average of 20,000 people viewing per hour. We had about 3,000 people subscribe to our sub every day and had over 23,000 people within 14 days. To be honest it was more than we had any idea. We really didn\'t expect things to get that big so fast, but then that\'s when the issues started arising. </p>
<p>We would get messages from the Reddit Admins saying people were releasing private information and that if we didn\'t get a handle on it, they would shut the whole operation down. So we were left with no option but to strictly enforce a &quot;No PII&quot; rule. And we did just so. Anyone who had broken the rule had to be prevented from posting more PII, so we had to prevent them from posting...but then things got weird. </p>
<p>Reddit Admins, under the disguise of their system username &quot;reddit&quot; started unbanning  people we had kept from posting. These people were <em>purposely</em> posting PII to get <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">r/Pizzagate</a> shut down. See here - <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6zbm.png">http://magaimg.net/img/6zbm.png</a></p>
<p>That was Reddit removing the suspensions of people we disallowed from posting as these were the people <em>repeatedly</em> breaking the PII rule. They kept posting it over and over, with the purpose of getting it all shut down. We shared this evidence of Reddit interfering and trying to sabotage us but that made things worse. About 2 days later, we got a message from them saying they wouldn\'t be allowing us to operate any longer and they would be shutting us down. All of this was happening between mid November of 2016 to end of January 2017. </p>
<p>Immediately, we scrambled. <a href="https://voat.co/u/pizzathrowaway777">/u/pizzathrowaway777</a> created <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>. We started <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428510">backing up everything we had found</a> to hard drives and other resources. We launched private chat rooms where we kept digging. Reddit shutting us down PROVED there was something to hide and truthfully, without Reddit trying to censor us and pizzagate, I don\'t think it would have ever have taken off like it did. </p>
<p>pizzathrowaway777 sends <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/6zbl.jpg">this message</a> to Spez the Reddit CEO. Shortly after, <a href="https://voat.co/u/pizzathrowaway777">/u/pizzathrowaway777</a> came here but they didn\'t last long. I don\'t know what happened to him and I wish I did. He was a great person and was THE person who really took point on the whole thing. Without him, I truthfully think pizzagate may not be what it is now. </p>
<p>What you all have done since this all first started has been absolutely incredible and while I am not so much involved anymore and carry out my own side investigations, I have to say that you all need to keep looking and digging. Even when we first started all of this, there were multiple hard drives of information, and that was only in the beginning! Never forget <a href="https://voat.co/u/pizzathrowaway777">/u/pizzathrowaway777</a> - the person who really launched the whole thing. They created a ripple affect which has created a lasting impact on the world, for the better. He was one of us.

            Excuse me, but Pizzathrowaway777? 777 again? Really? 777 is Aleister Crowley cabalistic writings. Occultist infested on youtube and message boards use handles and channel names with 777. Jem777. Dahboo777. TruthUnveiled777. Iam777. You need to please explain why somebody against pizzagate would use a screen name pizzathrowaway777. Insults and ridicule will not be accepted as a straight ansewer. By the way, Vpizzagate is subverted just as reddit was, and if you brought your 777 friend with you from Reddit, I suppose the control moved from reddit to voat. Thank you for the evidence.

            You researchers are my hero’s! I’ve known about “Pizzagate” well before the Podesta emails dropped (it’s been 15-20 years now). I had stopped attempting to tell anyone about it years ago because I just came off as a lunatic. If it weren’t for you guys (and gals) researching this &amp; spreading the info, I would still look like an insane person to everyone &amp; I probably would’ve believed I were losing my mind by now. What you all have done is nothing short of amazing! Thank you for your hard work &amp; dedication to this concerning topic.

            Watching r.kelly ep 6, Azriel Clary’s mother states that her sister in looking for azriel noticed several girls isolated in different rooms with a bucket! She said the buckets were being used as bathrooms. Which triggered my memory to pizzagate when Podesta emails revealed a suspect surveillance view of several cameras on one screen, one of the rooms displayed was off a group of kids all sitting on buckets.  Ugh!

            pizzagate was a wet dream for me and still is since i started researching pedophilia at uni 15 years ago i havent stopped digging for information to share on social media and hopefully wake the masses to the massive problem it poses all over the world

            Muchas gracias for sharing this important piece of history. At the beginning, I was naive enough to think the whole thing could be solved within a relatively short time-frame. After that, I was naive enough to think that it will never be solved. And after that, I became aware of how complex and complicated and dangerous the whole thing is. Yes, it will be solved. Some day. And the people of

            in the sidebar, if you haven't read it yet. You might want to append it to the bottom of your post so people see it. I've been here just about every day since the Reddit ban, and it's been amazing to see new hands pick up the torch each time a great researcher leaves the battlefield.

            Despite the anti-Reddit culture clash at the beginning, Voat has been an outstanding host -- weathering
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2312390">
             severe financial persecution

            and

             DDoS attacks
            </a>
            which I have no doubt are directly related to our research here. The last time the site was shut down, QAnon

            it was because of our Rachel Chandler/Epstein Island research.

           <p>
            A few years ago a story came out about two gals that had been on Eppstein Island and became too old (18 or 19 I believe), so went back to NY. They brought tons of pics with them and showed them to NYPD. They also put them on the net, and I remember Bill Clinton sitting in a hot tub with two very young girls on either side of him with his arms around them. They didn't look older than 13 or 14. Totally disgusting lecherous old man. There were tons of other pics with other well known people as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            NYPD wanted to investigate, but Loretta Lynch threatened shutting them down with Eric Garner lawsuits and violations. So it never went anywhere. But the pics were already online. Someone used a pic of a slice of pizza to cover certain body parts so it wouldn't be considered porn as they went around the net.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two policemen decided to make it public knowledge against Lynch's order, but after doing so they both committed "suicide". Don't remember their names, and of course the internet has pretty much been scrubbed clean of much of pizzagate info.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm glad more people are coming forward to expose these sick people in politics and Hollywood. Can't even imagine what kind of an animal would harm a child.

              I have tried to find the pics of BC, but the internet has been scrubbed. There were also several Hollywood actors, including Bob Saget I believe. I will try to find info on the two NYPD "suicides", if it hasn't been scrubbed as well. Listened to both several times, and then their wives after their deaths.

              Someone on Voat suggested a way to get to more sites is to go to DuckDuckGo and turn off Safe Surfing. I wasn't able to do that on my computer for some reason, but you may have better luck.

            This doesn't actually tell us anything. It's just fluff as part of a larger story. It's funny how you still run around going, "I was on Voat all this time and never went back to Reddit, but I went back to Reddit despite solely being on Voat!" You still can't keep this one story straight after all of this time, how are we to trust anything else about you?
           </p>
           <p>
            What exactly is your aim? To gather SCP to look legitimate? Because that's exactly what it looks like you're doing here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate started on the Chans, that's where it begun. It became a big hit over on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">
             r/the_donald
            </a>
            until the mods were forced to limit discussion of it, so
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             r/pizzagate
            </a>
            was created. When that was banned, people came over to Voat for the discussion and research. You didn't mention anything about the "very beginnings" - no in depth details. You're telling you part of the tale for self aggrandizement.

            Everyone who has contributed to this sub and the research around it has my eternal deepest gratitude.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are things I can do and still retain my sanity.  There are horrible things I can see and still be an intact person.  ...But this is not one.  Although I have followed you from the beginning, I have never been able to contribute.  I cannot tell you how incredibly grateful I am for all of you!
           </p>
           <p>
            I have seen a guy go through a lathe (online).  Only his lower body and eyes left.  But the things that I know some of you have seen just from descriptions, would break me.
           </p>
           <p>
            You should not underestimate how much your work has helped.  They are being exposed.  Their symbols.  Their days.  They are running out of darkness to hide in and that is thanks to you!  I had no idea about Alice's day.  I no longer take my children out that day.  I know now some of the language, the symbols to watch out for now but only because of you and your work!  So even for the children who have not fallen prey, you have made the world safer for them.  Please know what you do matters!

              April 25th.  Basically national pedo day, holiday.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is a day that they try to spend in places where children will be.  Parks, playgrounds, etc.  They try to get pictures of theirself with children so that they can share in their pedo friend group.  It is a day for them to celebrate by being around children.  Aka, stalking unsuspecting children day.

               Weird, in Miss Congeniality, William Shatner asks Miss Rhode Island describe your favorite date?  It's April 25th because it's not too hot and it's not too cold.  All you need is a light jacket.

            Been following this site since Nov 2016. You are right-everything they could throw at it about debunking. Watching Pres Trump right now reiterating that big money on the border is running human adult/child trafficking.  He knows and therefore, we know it is true.

            My daughter had decided to major in criminology at her university. In one of her classes she had to go to the local state attorneys office and do a short internship. I noticed soon after she started that she was having trouble sleeping. I asked her what was going on and she brought up the subject of paedophilia. She informed me that a major case was working its way through the justice system. Being kind of news junkie I did think it was strange that I hadn’t heard about it. She stated that there were hundreds of thousands of actual pictures of children being molested. She said they were all different kids! This was back in the early 2000s.
I kind of put it into the back of my head and didn’t think about it until the Podesta emails. The gravity of this fell upon me like a ton of bricks. It is the reason I joined this forum. The reason I joined VOAT. Lack of sleep is a small price to pay for being privy to the greatest evil. It has became crystal clear to me it is the base of all evil. When Trump says “You don’t know how sick these people are” I do and for that reason alone I have become a fan. Light is the only disinfectant. I’ve lost a lot of friends sharing what I now know. Hell, the way I look at it they were probably part of it to start with. I only have friends that don’t sleep now and I understand why Trump gets such little sleep. I’d like to thank the researchers and thanks for a great post.

             Thank you for caring so deeply..I was sexually abused from infancy...when I told my mother at age 12, she did not believe me...nor anybody in my family. I became the problem, not my father. Every time I read a post like yours, it affects me very deeply and I can consciously see that it was just my family that didn't care....not that there was something wrong with me for talking about it....well, no. My father was in a pedophile ring out of , I think, Duke University, there had to be ripple effects. My father's was so close to Joe Ryan who started the parapsychology dept at Duke, they each knew when the other was going to call. Have read recently that the MKultra program was interested in extrasensory perception. ......which was what Joe Ryan's dept. was all about....don't think I was supposed to remember as much as I did.

              My condolences for what you went through. The thing that bothers me is how it is a taboo subject happening all around us. The twelve year old daughter of a woman I know was felt up by a church elder during bible study! She locked herself in the bathroom and called her mother. She rescued her from the situation and even told the mans daughter about it. The weird thing was they decided to let it drop. LEO was not notified. She wouldn’t tell me his name. He was a family friend was all she would tell me. I’ll never understand why people let them stay in the dark. Bringing them into the light is my first instinct. Why do people protect these perverts?

               If the police and judges is on their side ...they can be locked up for false charges..
We r living in a cartoon world...
I keep.posting the solution to getting out of their statutes and cartoon laws..but it falls on deaf ears..
People cannot undrrstand the simplicity with which we enslave our selves in this debt system..
All we have to do is reduce debt at the US tressury..
..that will turn the US into our debtor slave corporatiin...and can turn it into our personal bully...
Then these statutue and codes and the gremlins that hide behind them wont stand a chance ..

             Thanks for the story Deflo56    ----- did that group ever end up...  ultimately  prosecuted &amp; jailed?
            </p>
            <p>
             I wonder if they were foiled at the last minute by people higher up that protect these groups.

              I think he was found guilty and ended up getting ten years. He was a cop. I think it stayed a local story though.

               Oh my gosh, that's hard to hear. Can I ask does your daughter work for any agency or consultancy now? I recently took a big interest in criminology and tried following up what I could around my city's University and High Court, they happen to be next door to each other. Attended court hearings and trials of a paedophile for the first time in person, trying to learn anything I could about the proceedings. I never saw it go public, he was accused by 18 boys. I swear, no matter how loose you wear the suit, there was nothing comfortable about even walking through those rooms. Huge respect for prosecutors though.

                After a brief stint in the military (broken hip and ruptured vertebrae) she just finished up a masters degree in intelligence analytics with a 3.94 GPA. She’s looking for a job in some kind of public service. I think her experience fostered her desire to do something for society.

              Correct, But this sub is subverted like all the other subs on the net, so the agenda is to sell good guy government against bad guy government. Only factions are world government vs citizens. They have zero resistance.

            What sub did it all start on?  DNCLeaks?  I recall we were all going through the Podesta emails being released by Wikileaks.  It started on October 7, 2016 or so.  It was a Friday.  The following Monday or Tuesday is when I started to see posts about these strangely worded emails.  It was the one between Podesta and Herb Sandler.  I ignored it because I thought it was not important.  Lol.

            Anyone remember?  I should have taken a screenshot, but I did not know at the time.

             Oct 7 sounds right. Former LEO I knew on fb made a cryptic remark about the Podesta Wikileaks leak and then, the Weiner laptop was being talked about. I asked him on fb could all this info be true. My friend knew many NYPD and all had confirmed they had the goods on Clinton. Huma had either made the biggest mistake exposure or had her insurance program backfire on herself. But, still, all true.

              I agree.  I am just not sure what the holdup is with releasing it.   Trump MUST be using it as leverage behind the scenes.

              Someone I know went to high school with someone in the NYtPD.  He called and asked him about it, and the conversation got cut off really quick.  Very strange thing to do to someone you used to party with.

              Ok.  That is where I first saw it.  The drops started Friday, October 2016.  I believe I saw the first post on Monday the 10th or Tuesday the 11th.  I personally am not aware of any posts before the...  I was active  on

            Thanks for your hard work OP - was a subscriber from the beginning and can confirm. Also thanks for the proof that Reddit was actively undermining the mods.

            Pizzagate was more of a joke/meme than anything. I really see no reason to rehash it. Sure, a lot of Dems and politicians are Luciferians and sexual deviants, but that man’s business was nearly ruined and people were almost killed over a dumb hoax. Start a subreddit about real pedo shit like Bryan singer and the DEN Network. At least that stuff is true.

            Interesting info OP, I have been around since this stuff was breaking on pol.  I dont have a ton of time to research like you guys do, but I try to lurk and keep up with the latest findings (everyone here is amazing, by the way!)... I give my input when I have knowledge of something, but I really dont post very often.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to add to your post that Spez took the pizzagate stuff very personally, and even
            <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/12wr.jpg">
             admitted to editing users' comments after the sub was shut down!
            </a>
            .  If it was just a stupid conspiracy, why get all emotional?  He is the CEO of one of the most popular websites... but cant handle being called names? Ok.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, thanks for sharing, very interesting to see what is going on behind the scenes... and all the b.s. the mods have to deal with on the daily!

            The reason I signed up here in the first place was to investigate pizzagate without censorship. It was getting shut down everywhere else except here and 8chan. Eventually we realized even 4chan was compromised and censoring stuff. It still is I guess.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the early mods here at Voat were questionable too but after enough bitching and moaning I guess you guys finally got everything straightened out. I wouldn’t know though, I finally got burned out on the whole subject. There’s only so much of it somebody can take at one time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you guys for doing what you’ve done.
           </p>
           <p>
            Btw, pizzagate was the original “fake news” that the media swarmed all over. If not for this topic, that whole meme would have never emerged in the first place. Pretty fucking epic.

            Thank you. You’ve done even more to help the cause even with this post bc it’s somethjng I can share as a way to say “See!? If PG wasn’t true then why all the resistance for the OP within days of its emergence!??” Seriously, this is a useful post in and of itself!

             The day this broke, the term Fake News was coined. Scared much? Imagine coming into work at cnn and seeing that as your new talking point.... And continuining to work there. Very sad.

            Good post, OP.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was banned everywhere from every platform for digging and sharing information about John and Tony Podesta. I was banned from Twitter for asking John about Heather Podesta and her PG&amp;E, Jerry Brown and Disney connections.

            I've never been more "attacked" in all of my life. This was in October 2017, so I was a bit late to the game. Thank you to everyone that stuck around before me and compiled information.

              I can normally pull up a California government website that lists Heather Podesta's accomplishments to include something about Disney and PG&amp;E. Naturally the page is no longer coming up. I'll keep looking for it and make a new reply if/when I find it.

            there had never been such an attacked conspiracy theory. they threw every tactic they could manage at this theory and we still have lingering changes to the world, most notably the google and social media algorithms and pushes for shutting down "fake news".
           </p>
           <p>
            the spam of misinformation and shutdown of entire communities off free speech platforms... this wasn't done for 9/11 truth, school shooting hoaxes or even claims of bill clinton rapes/pedophilia before the podesta email leaks. this was very eye opening and alarming for someone who has been following conspiracies for 20+ years now

             And with no effort to deal with the evidence.  It was just dismissed out of hand.  With 9/11, scientists examined the arguments and replied to them. Same with JFK, RFK, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             With pizzagate, it is always handwaved away as "HRC traffics kids in a pizza shop basement that doesn't exist."

            <p>
             That's not the argument. That's not what we think. That's the evidence that they don't want to look at the truth.

             Blackmailing pedos and aiding their political careers is fundamental to the global power structure, and so is the secrecy of it. Other conspiracies implicate far fewer powerful people. So the response was bigger this time.

               Wrong, they are in 100% control with zero resistance. Agenda 21 is live and they are burning down california yearly for the next decade. Historic fires every year for no less than 10 years. You guys are not aware and wasting your time on this sub, nobody submits pizzagate evidence or threads here. Instead, so and so is a pedohpile. That is what this sub is now. Wake up.

              I think we're dealing with creatures that only look human. I'm really starting to buy into the lizard people thing, not literally lizards but just, I mean they just aren't human. I am selfish and want power and money but to live with knowing what would be done to achieve it..... They just can't be human.

             it was eye opening for me as well, especially when they shut us down so fast. I mean within a few days we even had articles trying to debunk the whole thing lol the friction against pizzagate was so strong so fast

            good post, I was there digging from the beginning too but got totally exhausted with it after the election, it got so sick and satanic that I couldn't go on and it breaks me that it still hasn't been blown wide open cause all the evidence is there. We did win the first meme war tho so thank God all that horror wasn't for nothing.

              further than I'd like, but I would never watch those tapes, knowing what they are. Mad respect to you, bro. I know
              <strong>
               why
              </strong>
              you do it, it was rhetorical. I no longer believe it's necessary. You can still come out of it intact, as a loving person, no different to kids who grew up in war-torn Sudan. Let me know if you ever want to talk anything, I would be interested.

                 I picked up on it because I found the password protected files on the CPP server interesting. Because of their potential content, I never downloaded them  myself. I wanted to try to open them to help, but I already have a record and couldn't risk it. So, I try to follow and comment when it will be helpful to the discussion.
