            Was it ever proven that Hillary actually paid for Silsby's defense? I know Bill Clinton actually went to Haiti to intervene on behalf of the entire group of people who were arrested ( all but Silsby were released fairly quickly after his visit) and I know it's proven that HRC was kept updated on the situation but i know of nothing which proves she directly paid tge trafficker-attorney.

            Also ""dr.nwo" saying "Whip up a Haitian special, extra cheese" may have been a pizzagate researcher. Several pizzagater comments got posted before Alefantis took his IG private.
