            it doesn't matter if there are reptilians or not, because humans are doing the same exact things. so you can take it literally or as a metaphor. there are people in the world set up to give limited amounts of information, and it's up to the people to decide what to do with that information. 
see, you don't have to be scared of humans or reptilians, you know what you're looking for, these humans and reptilians are scared of you. you are the storm. you are the ones meant to drive them wedge in between them. the truth movement, infowars, qanon, icke, and others, are absolutely 100% on the money with many things. these things were known way before 2010 and even before 9/11. there are several things they can't mention it's up to you, as a people, to figure out what they're not telling you. they have their own condition, red-pilled or not. see, after taking the red-pill, you must come into an unfamiliar world. qanon, infowars, icke, and the whole truth community are very close. you can not battle these humans or reptilians by consuming the same exact thing as them. there are going to be people livid about this at the highest levels. the things they do to humans, they learned from doing them to animals. after pizzagate, and after several truths that are being protected come to light, there will be a new battle for truth. how and why did all of this start? how old was the meat that you eat during the slaughter process? are you sure? what are your facts? where did those facts come from? who financed it? that's right, meat is all financed and researched by the same people that tell you pizzagate is fake news. i'm trying to tell you something without saying it, you can't have it both ways. there are things the truth community can't accept yet, and it is impeding on the progress. be fruitful, stay out of the slaughterhouse and don't send anyone to the slaughterhouse. bitcoin and cryptos will never destroy the pizzagate elite, this forum will not, unless you listen to this step. you need to change what is on your plate. it doesn't matter what alex jones or infowars or what the news says. if you stand with pizzagate, and change what's on your plate, they will freak out. it's hard for them to change this because of their own food preferences and their own economic investments, and they were given very inaccurate information, just like the public and the highest level scientists. those who "stay woke", are probably the most asleep generation i have ever witnessed. false awakening will only lead us further away from the rabbit hole. i am not saying these people are operatives, or counter-information, what i'm trying to say is, they don't even know it themselves, even though they know everything. the more someone convinces you that you are red-pilled or "woke", realies, you are being told the truth many times, but , there is a problem with this, it's a pseudo redpill filled with animal ingredients and pharmaceuticals. i will not tell you what to do, do whatever you like with this information, thank you respectfully for taking the time to read, God bless.

             it's hard to hide evidence if there are no animal farms. there are people involved in pizzagate truth that will send you away from this truth, because they want to destroy the pizzagate elite , just to make their own version, again, with animal farms. we are not on a plantation anymore brothers, we are on an animal farm. you won't believe me, but we are near close to all going to the slaughterhouse.  we are the product. we are the cattle. and no, it isn't a zionist conspiracy, i'm afraid, it's much worse than that. you are the literal conspiracy. if you promote the death and violence on animals, then you promote pizzagate, it's as simple as that. that's why people got the gag order about pizzagate. some people started realizing this, and it got out of their control. those main reporters on pizzagate, that still do pizzagate, they missed the most important part of the puzzle and it was in front of them the entire time, going into their mouths.

            So people laugh in my face for my Flat Earth beliefs, but listen to what this guy is saying.  It’s
            <em>
             mass hypnosis.
            </em>
            What does hypnosis look like?  A swinging watch?  How about the all-new high-tech super-advanced swinging watch called “computer animation” graphics?  Anyone ever notice how they have a thousand different representations of earth, but can’t give us one legit picture?
           </p>
           <p>
            Even a real globe can be used for hypnosis.  I swear, if you take a room full of rowdy kids, and you take a globe and just go to the front and start spinning it, the class will eventually go into a trance watching it.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can’t
            <em>
             feel
            </em>
            any motion of the earth whatsoever.  But for some reason we believe its moving.
           </p>
           <p>
            With telescopes and camera zoom lenses, we can see way further than we should be able to at the dimensions they give us.  For a 25,000 mile circumference ball, the curvature should be 8 inches per miles squared, but this is disproven over and over again by zooming in and seeing things that theoretically should be hidden by curvature.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe they are
            <em>
             deceiving
            </em>
            us when they tell us we are on a spinning ball going 1000 mph.  These are satanic sickos right?  Who like to invert the Bible?  Well in Genesis Chapter 1, it says God built a firmament, which means dome.  It says He made 2 Great Lights, one for day and one for night.  It doesn’t say He made a great light, and then a reflecting ball of dirt and rocks.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if you ask me, those stars sure do look like they are all stuck in the same thing, rotating perfectly around us.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s not just our politicians who are lying to us.  Like the guy in this video is saying, it’s our supposed scientists, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the globe is a tool used for hypnosis, and if you haven’t thrown away your TV yet, I highly suggest it.  Those spinning graphics are preventing people from being able to think critically.

              It’s kinda like 9/11.  I don’t definitely know what it is.  I just know that the official story is full of shit.
             </p>
             <p>
              But personally, it would work kind of like universal “gravity” where all you need is density and buoyancy.  So if it’s lighter than air like a helium balloon, it floats.  And if it’s heavier than air like me (or Neil De Ass’ microphone), then it falls.
             </p>
             <p>
              I recommend “200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball” by Eric Dubay for the scientific debate.
             </p>
             <p>
              [
              <a href="https://youtu.be/EiBJBVBez_w">
               https://youtu.be/EiBJBVBez_w
              </a>
              ]
             </p>
             <p>
              And I recommend channels like Rob Skiba for the science/religious debate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fair warning that there are numerous shills in the Flat Earth community, just like with every truth movement.  For example, “Flat earth Society” is absolutely controlled opposition, and they make ridiculous claims to make Flat Earth seem stupid.  Like they say Earth is moving upwards at so many miles/second, which I think is nonsense.

              I very much enjoy the channel ThePottersClay as well if that helps.

              My Flat earth beliefs began with science, and then it just so happened that religious texts back up the theory..
             </p>
             <p>
              For a good video about science vs religion, I recommend this video:
              <br/>
              [
              <a href="https://youtu.be/5tfiOms12v8">
               https://youtu.be/5tfiOms12v8
              </a>
              ]
             </p>
             <p>
              I find most people to be religious about the ball, because they’ve never even doubted or questioned it, but that’s exactly what science is supposed to be, doubting and questioning things..
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you for your question.  I welcome any other questions or comments.

               Well, i started the video ,tides wouldn't occur if the earth was flat .... and although your religion validates you, said religion is 2000 yrs old and full of superstition.

                Funny thing about tides.  They supposedly occur because of the moon, right?  But they occur twice a day..  And the moon only comes around once a day, right?
               </p>
               <p>
                There are many theories on what causes the tides.  I just think it’s obviously not what we’ve been told.  Cause it makes no sense.
               </p>
               <p>
                Honestly I could easily be convinced that the Bible is also Illuminati truth and lies.  Personally I like things that make sense to my scientific mind.  And I will admit that a lot of the Bible does not.
               </p>
               <p>
                But most ancient religions have some sort of Flat Earth/domed map.  Like check out the Egyptian one with the humans lying along the bottom and arching around the top..

             He's a CIA asset. They set him up as a limited hangout 20 years ago, so that everybody who talked about elite child sex abuse would be related to 'this crazy guy who believes in aliens and shapeshifting reptilians'.

              I think the reptillian thing is what turns most people off, some just can't get past it. But he is honestly so ahead of his time, he was saying 20 years ago what's just been confirmed now. All of his conference talks are so interesting, even if you only take half of it as being accurate it's still incredible. I thoroughly enjoy watching everything he does.

             My family don't understand what I go through
Under diagnosed for 20 years, ain't never broke through
You ever been in such a fog you don't know you?
Never being able to do the shit you're supposed to?
I wouldn't wish it on anyone that I'm close to
Wouldn't wish it on anybody that I'm opposed to
There's not an accurate diagnosis to show you
Basic neurobiology isn't close to it
I'm watching life as a spectator
I can't help myself, even though I possessed data
It's not a part of my spirit to want to test nature
You think you know what I'm feeling, cousin, then let's wager
I'm having trouble retaining new information
Familiar scenes starting to look foreign- derealization
Everybody tired of being patient
Mama wondering why her baby crying in the basement
Constant rumination just exacerbates it
To the point where I can't even barely narrate it
I've had doctors tell me that my mind is fascinating
But they can't tell me why the sickness has been activated
