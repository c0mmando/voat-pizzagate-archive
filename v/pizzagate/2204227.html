              I want to upvoat this post 100 times. I keep starting a comment then deleting it all. So I left that one. Greywind is the girl who got ababy stolen (( wtf? Placenta sniffing dogs?) and was killed and who's body they dredged the Redriver for and Alred us a  " fake adoptions  " attorney...my bleak understanding...and I think people stop reading about Haleiegh after they hear "trailer" or "Turner's disease" it's TMI im wondering if more people aren't deeply psychotic than the geustimate of 10%  of the population. Or conversely what level of mind control is weighing on the population to overlook the well being of the kids.

               I realize a lot of people are in survival mode, but I wish they would disengage their heads and take a good look around

                No time no time. Til it's too late. It's a good story for me to read. My daughter is 15 and is out of my touch, physically and legally thru the court of Marin county awarded custody to coming out transgender having had surgery since , so and PORNOGRAPHER. I discovered when I eused to track him online, and I reported the site and that report was held from me as confidential. Anyway, alot of bad players...I lost my kid. I'm not a patent or criminal or anything illegal. I was impeccable for the longest time as he just kept  getting more custody anyway...today...it's been 3 years and I'm so sick behind missing her, not knowing if she's ok. Because I did catch him once at something in appropriate when she was 3 before he was out. I did report it. He was molesting her. I saw it. I saw what happened and when I told them cps they did not come. But then two months after that Lisa lellis called and said she did want to come out, I said ok. She came and asked my three year old about it and said it did not happen. So I'm not sure, who all or what if people are helping him. He's gotten help all along. Perry Taibman was his probono attorney.  Anyway it's too disturbing, I'm just wondering how I let myself get handled. How to handle the obvious. I'm real ng with a ring if I am right. By now...alone for years, harvested from and left as a Hull...as far as a mother....I think I'm right. So I don't want to do anything to put my daughter at risk from of these people, what can I do to protect her.? There is a restraining order on me to keep 100 ft  from her for 5 years  filed with same corrupt judge Beverly Woods, because I went to pick her up at school on the wrong day of the order. Beverly gave the transgender pornographer dad  custody and took all mights away, they call me stalker, even though I got the police to write a report than says I'm not a stalker, that I just went to pick her up at school. So I would like to start a conversation with anyone who had this event happen in their lives, not here but on another thread,. And anyone who's waiting around like me for anyword anysign that the kid will come back. People say wait and it'll happen, but I don't know what he's or they're  doing to her. Long post...I hope you get some sleep.

                 chaos will ensue.

            A good rule to enforce with ur kids, is to never go into anyone's house! My neighbors with kids have all adopted the rule. The neighborhood kids all play outside at designated houses in the driveway, front yard ect.. 
There are older women who will come out and sit in chairs and visit while watching all the kids. 
It is also a good policy in general, kids are naturally trusting and this helps to an extent.

            At 13 minutes into this interview this case gets very strange. This guy who claims to be a minister was telling Holmseth that Caylee Anthony isn't really Casey, but really a demon that used to be worshiped on the earth as a god. It was his job to get the spirit out. He said she was the spirit was a Fallen Angel.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said Casey's family believed that Casey had been sacrificed in a ritual. Exorcism...etc....

            Gloria Allred represented Wayanne Kruger. The guy that molested her child had the name Richard Streate. While in prison he changed his name to Kyle Hochstraser. I'm assuming he picked that because when you listen to it its real hard to figure out how to spell.
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked him up in the pedo database and he didn't show up. So I checked his original name and came up not under Kyle, but under Lyle. His name in the database is off by one letter so that his name won't pull if you spell it right. I'm wondering if that is an accident or not.

              Most child molesters commit an average of 117 sexual crimes before being caught.
             </strong>
             One way to know if you have a child molester in your neighborhood is to perform a database search for sexual offenders. Should you have an offender in your neighborhood, teach your children to stay away from the criminal's house.

            HLN and Nancy Grace fall deeper into missing child pornography scandal
           </p>
           <p>
            At issue is Nancy Grace’s relationship with former HLN guests Art Harris and Levi Page.
Emerging facts reveal Grace and HLN may possess actual knowledge of serious felonies committed against missing children by operations involving their own guests, which network producers did not report to law enforcement.

             Art Harris, former CNN journalist and correspondent to Nancy Grace, filmed naked photos of HaLeigh Cummings, a missing child that was raped.

             William Staubs, Case Closed Inc., said he and others saw Harris put the photos up an easel in his motel room and film them.

             And…
            </p>
            <p>
             Secret emails from the Gmail account of the ranking detective at the East Grand Forks Police Department in Polk County, Minnesota, reveal the Minnesota police did not want the kidnappers and pornographers to get caught.
            </p>
            <p>
             Records show the East Grand Forks Police secretly conspired with Harris to suppress the publication of a local investigative journalist, Timothy Charles Holmseth (me), because the FBI in Florida was acting on information from Holmseth that was leading to the porn.
            </p>
            <p>
             On July 10, 2009 Lt. Rodney Hajicek exchanged emails with CNN Harris via Hajicek’s private Gmail account, as the two men discussed how they could possibly have the Polk County Attorney’s office arrest Holmseth.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I’m in shock, but just heard the FBI actually paid a visit to the Web design firm in Florida that donated their time to the website for the missing child. Based on [Timothy Holmseth’s] absurd accusations he’s now almost gotten a 23 year employee fired for sending the child’s photo on her company email to the pro bono web firm,” Harris said.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it wasn’t absurd.

             CHILD RAPE PORNOGRAPHY – EXISTENCE

            <p>
             Donald Knop, who was a legal assistant for a Florida law office during the HaLeigh Cummings investigation in 2009, told Holmseth about the photographs, which he said were handed to him by the attorney that employed him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Holmseth was also told about soft porn photo shoots of the little girl by other witnesses, as well. The following is a limited excerpt from discussions Holmseth had about the photos.

             (HOLMSETH) Does it have anything to do with the photos of HaLeigh’s vagina that you have?
            </p>
            <p>
             (KNOP) I don’t know. I don’t know that REDACTED knows I have that. But I’ve just, through working in corporate America, I’ve learned, I keep copies of everything that I’m asked to copy, that way when its alleged that I did something or didn’t do it, and more times than not, when it comes later, hey we didn’t get those copies can you sent it again, I have a copy to just fire off right off hand and I don’t have to go through the whole food chain to get them again you know.

             THE CHILD PORN WAS PLACED ON A CD
            </p>
            <p>
             Knop said he was told by his employer to place the photos on a CD. He said he was told to give the CD to a Florida DCF social worker named Bonnie Warner.
            </p>
            <p>
             But…
            </p>
            <p>
             Knop gave the CD to DCF Warner after business hours in a gas station parking lot, and the pictures were never turned over to Warner’s supervisor or law enforcement.
            </p>
            <p>
             The following is an excerpt from a three-way conversation between William Staubs, Case Closed Inc. Knop, and Holmseth.
            </p>
            <p>
             (HOLMSETH) – Don – Don – where were you at when you handed that disc to Bonnie Warner?
            </p>
            <p>
             (KNOP) – I was in a gas station parking lot. I wanted to say it was the BP. Yeah, it was that BP you know Bill, that’s across from where the red house was.
            </p>
            <p>
             (WILLIAM STAUBS) – Yeah, yeah
            </p>
            <p>
             (KNOP) – Because she was ending her day and I was getting into town late so we just met
            </p>
            <p>
             (WILLIAM STAUBS) – Okay
            </p>
            <p>
             (HOLMSETH) – You just met by accident or was it arranged?
            </p>
            <p>
             (KNOP) – No we arranged to meet because she was expecting it and that’s when I was told there was some deadline they were having some meeting they had some final decision – I arranged to meet with her and it turned out it wasn’t that day it was the next day in the morning and then it turns out who knows if that damn thing even happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was no meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
             And…
            </p>
            <p>
             THE UNDERCOVER PEDOPHILE FOR THE FBI AND CIA
            </p>
            <p>
             Evidence shows the child pornography of HaLeigh was produced by a career child molester named John Regan, an alleged human sex trafficker for the FBI and CIA, and was being passed around in an underground.

            </p>
            <p>
             William Staubs was the private investigator hired by the Florida law office that worked for the missing child’s mother’s legal team.
            </p>
            <p>
             Staubs talked to Donald Knop about where the photos originated. The following is an excerpt from the telephone call recorded by Holmseth.
            </p>
            <p>
             WILLIAM STAUBS: “Here’s the excuse – here’s what she told me happened with the photographs. She got all the photographs from Wayanne (Kruger) and, from, she put Wayanne’s name in there and you (Donald Knop), you got them from Wayanne, who got them Marie (Griffis), and all this tangled Web of shit. Then she told me she got them from Marie.”
            </p>
            <p>
             However…
            </p>
            <p>
             Knop told Holmseth he saw a man named Jeremiah Regan arrive at a motel room with the photos. Jeremiah Regan is the son of John Regan, Hastings, Florida. John Regan dressed as a pastor and told searchers during the HaLeigh Cummings investigation that he was an “undercover pedophile” for the FBI.
            </p>
            <p>
             During a fake search for HaLeigh Cummings in rural San Mateo, Florida on March 22, 2009, John Regan told Judy Lucia, Interlachen, Florida, that he was an FBI agent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knop and Wayanne Kruger told Holmseth that John Regan claimed he was a CIA agent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rev. Richard Grund, a case witness in the Casey Anthony murder case, told Holmseth that John Regan boasted that he impersonated a police officer at the Jacksonville airport by flashing his “chaplains’ badge”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Holmseth was interviewed by the FBI in 2010. Holmseth asked FBI special agent A.J. Eilerman why they would have planted evidence at San Mateo. Eilerman replied, “So people will stop looking for her.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Records obtained by Holmseth reveal John Regan is a convicted pedophile.
            </p>

             DCF SOCIAL WORKR ADMITS SHE RECEIVED THE PHTOSO AND NEVER GAVE THEM TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR HER SUPERVISOR
            </p>
            <p>
             Staubs telephoned DCF Warner at her home, after hours, and she readily discussed the HaLeigh Cummings case. The following is an excerpt from that conversation, which was recorded by Holmseth.
            </p>
            <p>
             (WARNER) Oh my gosh I do have those I haven’t even seen them.
            </p>
            <p>
             (STAUBS) Well good God almighty then that’s why they trying to rope you off in this and here’s why – they allegedly Photoshopped these dammed pictures and sent them to you so that you would give them to your boss man and have an unfavorable ruling against Ronald.
            </p>
            <p>
             (WARNER) No – the pictures…
            </p>
            <p>
             (STAUBS) Well this is on a CD honey…
            </p>
            <p>
             (WARNER) It’s on a CD but those were the pictures they couldn’t send to my supervisor and they ended up sending them to another PI Kevin Coleman and - and he brought the stuff in and it was late in the game and they didn’t even - I don’t think they even saw them.
            </p>
            <p>
             (STAUBS) Well that’s cool but somebody met you on the side of the road at a gas station
            </p>

             SCUMBAG CNN JOURNALIST PHOTOGRAPHED THE RAPE PORN
            </p>
            <p>
             The following is an excerpt of a conversation between Staubs and CNN Art Harris.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Now, Art took them, pinned them, I don’t know if these were little five by eight glossies, or if these were on a sheet that were already printed out on paper, photocopy paper, or how these photographs looked, but he had an easel I guess set up in his room and he set that easel up down in one of them rooms down at the hotel. She was very emphatic with her details so anytime somebody get empathic about something stupid like this I’m thinking okay there setting it up. So he puts all these pictures on his easel and he takes his cameras which is the exact same camera that I have and he films each one of them. He films all of them okay? Then he’s got them locked into his camera and he sends them to get done or whatever and then he also took some still copies with him – some copies of those copies – but he already had them locked in his camera that were pinned on the easel – then they got all their pictures back.”

             Donald Trump is very unlikely to choose Florida Governor Rick Scott as his VP running mate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Scott is the focus of a pending federal lawsuit against the State of Florida that involves the Scott Administration covering up organized kidnappings and a child pornography sex trafficking ring.
            </p>
            <p>
             The federal lawsuit, which was originally filed as HOLMSETH V. CITY OF EAST GRAND FORKS ET AL – DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA, is being expanded, based upon new evidence that links the Scott Administration, Florida Department of Children and Families, FDLE, and other agencies to extortion, blackmail, and child sex trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Donald Trump, the front runner for the GOP, would never survive the horrendous details of the scandal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Donald Trump
The Scott Administration and AG possesses audio recordings of a Florida DCF child protection worker discussing a child sex trafficking operation. The DCF agent is heard admitting she received a CD that contained secret naked photos of a raped missing child, HaLeigh Cummings.
            </p>
            <p>
             HaLeigh Cummings was reported missing in 2009 and is classified as a Missing Person by the FBI.

             Wayanne Kruger w/ Timothy Charles Holmseth describes CIA/FBI child rape and baby sales

            <p>
             by Timothy Charles Holmseth on October 18, 2017, 9:15 P.M. CST
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2009, Wayanne Kruger was still closely associated with Gloria Allred when she (Kruger) became the official victim’s advocate for Crystal Sheffield, the mother of missing child HaLeigh Cummings. Kruger was deeply involved in both the Casey Anthony child murder case and HaLeigh Cummings kidnapping.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wayanne Kruger told Timothy Charles Holmseth that Gloria Allred was guiding her during the Anthony/Cummings cases and something went wrong. Wayanne Kruger gave Holmseth minute details about an international child sex trafficking operation being run by CIA/FBI that involved brutal rape of small children and baby sales through the U.S. Embassy.

             Allred seems to put herself into situations like this
I know my post didn't do Haleigh right
but there's so much lies and cover-ups it gets confusing
I still looking up stuff, Holmseth said he received phone calls with voice changer, like what Wasserman did,  Plus you have Silsby down there too
Haleigh had strange disease that basically keeps her a kid,  This is so fked up, gonna keep digging
