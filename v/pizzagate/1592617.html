            While I have been far from impressed with his performance so far, I will absolutely agree that Bill Maher is a hypocrite and an elitist. I find him so disgusting. The bad reputation that the Left in general has is entirely because of people like him. I'm willing to be wrong about Trump. I even hope I am. I just know that after watching everyone think every previous president was going to be their savior; I expect betrayal. This pipeline situation is a good example of elitist machinations, with both "liberal" and "conservative" media conspiring to cover it up. So, perhaps we're going to end the pedo cults, but we also will end up drinking oil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our leaders always betray us because the entire way we pick leaders seems to work very well for psychopaths. The ironic result of that is that every effort in history to force out corruption has always eventually fallen to corruption itself. Every major political revolution, every war, every religious movement; psychopaths place themselves at the head of these things and people fall for it, again and again and again. Forgive me if I wish to remain cynical here and assume Trump is going to betray us. Then, if he doesn't, I get to be wrong and the world might just improve in at least a couple important ways.

            The NWO exists and was outlined in the HRC emails. It's a global agenda and it's real. One government that we all answer to. Don't know what you've been reading, but whoever you're listening to is wrong. Read the emails if you haven't already. And they did topple the established order. They overthrew the constitution with what they were doing. The President is sworn to uphold it, and the presidents have not done that. The last one openly defied it and abrogated the rights of the people by not recognizing his country's borders. Sanctuary cities defy it as those cities operate outside federal law.

             Alternatively, since there are multiple secret societies and Gingrich did not indicate which one he meant, it can

               It makes sense -- at least, AFAIK -- if Gingrich was using the phrase "the secret society" in a general way.  Do you know the social strata of the "elite"?  I don't.  I could make a comment like Gingrich's and I would mean that he's not part of "their" "club", even though I wouldn't have a particular specific occult group in mind.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump "isn't one of them" would be another way of saying the same thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               I really think you guys are off base assuming Gingrich must have had a specific group in mind here.  I think that would be very strange, although I'll stop short of claiming impossible.

                Newt's allegiance is to the Bohemian Grove. (I edited my post to show evidence of that just btw.) Possibly Newt is saying that Trump's not a member of the Bohemian Grove. I think as far as 'initiation rites,' the simplest explanation is that they do exist, whatever they may be (some take the meaning to an extreme, but who knows what they are for sure, assuming they do exist).

                 Well, I think there's little point in debating this further here.  We have trouble agreeing on the meaning of Newt's words, because they are so few.

            Thank god he never went through that initiation! I think intelligence guys approached Trump long ago because they knew he wasn't part of "them" and they also knew his personality type is the type that won't back down...he was the only chance the USA had to get this shit under control...a brilliantly executed game of chess has been in play...we are almost at "checkmate" I would like to thank everyone that has stuck up for what is right...it's called integrity: doing what's right even when no one is looking!

            Before I met my husband I actually dated an Italian, I mean legit Roman and Calabrian Italian guy for 2 1/2 years and he explained why the Mafia was started in the first place. It started at first being a secret group of Italians, specifically Sicilians who couldn't get jobs to actually get together and rise up against the Fascist power of Mussolini so that they would be able to get jobs and provide for their families. At first it was more like a secret union of sorts. Unfortunately, once it was widespread and several corrupt Italians got into it, that is when it got very violent very quickly, like in the span of about 5-10 years.

                 Yeah, I was just trying to give another example/proof of secret societies. There are other examples But some folk will still not believe. I heard a lady say once that if Neil Armstrong himself said we didn't go to the moon she would not believe it. And another that if indeed 911 was a hoax she (or he) would not accept it. (I am simply stating these as illustrations.)

              IDK. I checked my own time and it was one month. A bunch of Redditors abandoning ship?

              Always leery of misdirection and derailment.  All this talk of secret societies smells like bullshit and a dead end.

              Oh it's the Masons, no it's the Illuminati, you're wrong it's the Jesuits.  Mix everything up and confuse the shit out of people so they lose interest.  It's an old and effective ploy.

               Good grief, there's no nefarious plot here. People like to talk about this stuff and yeah it gets away from pizzagate some, but the point is that Trump isn't compromised according to Gingrich therefore he can kick some pedo butt. duh

            I vaguely remember somewhere in the 1980's Newt was involved in some kind of weird sex crimes that got swept under the rug.
I think I saw a little report about it on "Inside Edition with Debora Norville" Does anyone remember this?

             They tried corrupting him but saw that he was into tall models, period! His tweet on Oct.8 2012 is revealing. Ask yourselves, would a pedophile tweet that, not in a billion years! Trump is one of us, he's good - and believe me guys, I would not say this about anyone, not even his running mate Mark Pence.

             This is a good question, but it should be noted that Trump personally banished Epstein for trying to pick up an underage girl in his club. Trump acts like a sex offender in public, but in private he handles things differently. Pedos don't openly advertise things like wanting to screw their own daughter, and his daughter does not act like an abuse victim. By all accounts, she's the most business-savvy of the entire bunch and has great authority over her subordinates. It would make sense if he's been infiltrating them though. It would explain him building this bizarre public persona. He may just be one of them though. Hard to say at this point.

            I can't help but think Trump has a powerful class of people behind him. Are they the secret watchers? Or a group of individuals that will only let things go so far in terms of ruin and destruction? Is this the group that the secret societies mean to destroy and is it them they wage war against? I've really never heard or seen anyone talk to HRC the way Trump did. She was in disbelief.

             I believe that Trump belongs to the white lodges of secret socities. His tweet on Oct.8 2012 says it all. No way in the world a man involved in pizzagate type thing would ever tweet about advocating death sentense to the pedophiles. One thing I don't get is why at his inauguration he let the Clintons in, and paid them respect! Cognitive dissonance! Wish somebody could explain that to me.

              Oh, he always plays The White Knight. He'll eviscerate someone and if someone asks about that person, he'll say, "So and so is a great guy!!! Just great!!!" This is his MO so I wouldn't read anything into it. I just keep that picture in my mind of his looming over her in the debate and actually saying she should be in jail. She was shocked ... shocked!!!

              So it wasn't a group per se. It was individuals that got together as a group for a common cause. Would that really give Trump that much confidence to do what he did in those debates?

             The person that called himself "high level insider" that did Q&amp;A's on 4chan said something about his group being called Triad??  From the way he described his group when people would ask directly, he painted a picture of one very much like you describe.  His group seems to be the watchers.  They manipulate and step in when things get out of hand - like things would have if Hillary would have won.
            </p>
            <p>
             I gathered from his answers that the old world order (the bad guys) came about with the neo-assyrians as they conquered much of the world - their power spanning more than 2 continents.  They would conquer and land and force the people to assimilate to their ways.  Eventually they had taken over so many different lands that after about 300 years of brutality, those people rose up against them from the inside and took the empire down.  Egypt did not join the rebellion, but most others did.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe this old world order is the one world order of Today that wants to rule the world.  I think Triad tries to keep them in check.

              Yes, during the weeks and days leading up to the election, there was a plethora of juicy info released.  Some of the really good stuff was released on /pol 4chan.
             </p>
             <p>
              You have to take a lot of the stuff posted on /pol with a grain of salt, but there was definitely an attempt at communication from an alphabet agency or other ((secret)) agency with /pol.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most of the really juicy stuff was released around the time of Weinergate.  Coincidence?  Maybe.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyways, I kept some of the stuff, so I will go dig for it and link it.

              Well, there you go! I have a theory about the New World Order and what it goes back to. I believe JFK definitely got caught up in it, but he was a good guy. He belonged to a group that opposed this NWO. When I found out about it, the bell went off and a light went on and I think I know where this started. Thanks!

             Absolutely.  Nation Shapers, as they are called, work in secret with the Pentagon.  They are uber talented and extremely brilliant people that help shape the nation when shit hits the fan.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ultimately it is the generals of the military that have the upmost power, final say in protecting the country.  They must protect the nation from threats, foreign AND domestic.
            </p>
            <p>
             These ((people)) really started cooking with gas after Obama started ((ousting)) high ranking generals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Steve Piezenck even speaks about a silent coup that was taking place before and during the election.  Obama's hands were tied.... finally.
            </p>

             Feels good that there are some VERY patriotic people looking out for the country.

              This is quite fascinating. How did you hear about them? This gives me hope - I've been afraid with all that Trump has done to immediately counteract the prog. agenda he would be in serious danger of an assassination attempt.

              Thanks so much for the info. That's the sense I got. Thank God someone was willing to take on this thankless job. Trump is no angel, but that's not we're asking of someone. We just don't want the scum of the earth leading things and that's what human traffickers/child abusers are.

             I think you're spot on - there is absolutely no doubt that Trump has some type of military muscle behind him, a soft coup has taken place, as he would hardly be where he is at this moment. There are still good people out there, it's not like they don''t have families and take their kids to Little League. That's why at the convention they played Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond. Check out the lyrics, kinda moving.

              Agree. Didn't notice the song, but I'll look at the lyrics. You know, I hope this is true because it would explain what Gingrich said. And how about a round of applause for the American voters? I feel they pulled our a$$ out of The Devil's fire.

                Me, too. I like that I got the feeling I could count on people. I haven't always felt that way. You really have to clear away all the static and focus on real issues like do you want pedophiles running the world? Pretty basic. The rest of the stuff is distraction.

            He also just recently named the society in an interview on Fox a few days ago. He has been in his own way helping it seems. The name he gave live on air was "shocking" so research my fellow investigators!

            Yep this is what they do.  Then they swear an oath that they will do anything to help each other get ahead in life.   Many Presidents have been members.  Its all very horrible and we should begin spying on all these groups....bugging their communications and sending death squads after them in the dark of night.

            Yes I have. To me it seems like part of the set up (like how the 3rd party candidate works), "oh no he's uncontrollable and outsider who won't follow our evil plan! I guess if you vote for him we lose! ;("
           </p>
           <p>
            Assuming that is true he hasn't been officially initiated - and I haven't seen anything to support him having been initiated into any evil group - he still works for them and not us.
           </p>
           <p>
            A good example is his connections to Scientology (which like freemasonry is just satanism in disguise).
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't forget his ties to business and banking - I wonder who has the most power and influence in those two sectors?
           </p>
           <p>
            If he wasn't controllable and somewhat in on the agendas of those satanists, he wouldn't have gotten nominated.

             There is a theory that Trump's spies got hold of the pizzagate information and a lot more and Trump is using this as blackmail - 'If anything happens to me, all the files, photos, videos will be spammed to everyone with a PC or iphone, and the entire government and the country is going down!' That would make Trump untouchable. Look how quickly he signed executive order, terminating TPP without any resistance (believe me guys, TPP was the thing that would end US sovereignty). Do not let anyone tell you that it was no big deal. TPP was NWO gold standard. Hillary was about to sign it on day one! Remember how Michael Flynn tweetet about Hillary's alleged involvement in child trafficking? Who would be bold enough to tweet that unless they had dirt on hard drives by the dozen. Some believe that Trump owns them. To terminate TPP with no resistance makes no sense otherwise.

              I think you are 1,000 % correct on this. This is what allows me to sleep like a baby (9 MM on night stand helps too) and know that many good things are coming and the USA will regain what we have lost to these NWO, satanic feces.  I have noticed how they are all being nice and Trump has his boot on their neck.  I fuckin love this shit.

               There is a TiSA that was leaked by Wikileaks in late 2015, and it is a monstrocity. I urge you to look at it. One of the clauses says that the public should no nothing about the bill untill 5 years after it has been passed! Welcome to Democracy.

             Satanism is a red herring, meant to misdirect you into believing bullshit while you are being fleeced.  Follow the money.  It's always about money.

              No it's not always about the money. It's about power and sacrificing children to moloch and pedofilia. The money is a positive by product that is used to control the masses.  Money is theoritical and the elites know it. It's the masses that have no idea and allow ourselves to be enslaved by it. The end goal is thousands of child sacrifices and sex rituals and hunting parties for entertainment and who knows what else they do in their miserable and bored lives for entertainment.

               Could be.  But you need proof which as far as I can tell you don't have.  If you're right, I'd like nothing better than to see the sick fucks doing the shit you're telling me they're doing beaten to death.  Until you have actionable proof, that's a pipe dream.

              Satanism is made up by Christians to demonize non theistic beliefs. Keep seeing anything that conservatives dislike being described as satanic, Its the oldest trick in the book. Read Anton LaVeys satanic bible its a complete joke. Any other form of "satanism" is the doing by seriously deluded people. Youre right about following the money,

                  I was using the youtube video to explain how the satanic angle can't be underestimated.  I thought about it while I was listening to this podcast earlier the same day, I provided the youtube version. Consider moral relativism and its implications. What would the people who create and control money want?

                 Satan is part of Self.  As is God.  Without "evil" you cannot experience "good".    Satan and God are archetypes.  Profound impulses that exist within our subconscious mind.  Once you start thinking of Satan as a real being, you are essentially worshiping false idols.  It's all inside.

                   But you do want a cop to show up when you're about to be beat to hell prob'ly. (I understand though, I see the virtues of 'proper' anarchy.) If you don't trust Trump by now you probably never will. Watch out for confirmation bias. (That goes for me too.)

                    Trust has to be earned, and Trump is in an untrustworthy position (not a doctor - a pollie! Which is worse than any used car dealer) so they may a while.

                    If he is who he says he is, he will earn my trust eventually, but I'm not as optimistic / naive as I used to be.

                     Fair enough, I understand. But not all cops are bad of course.

                    <p>
                     I never knew Trump still I started following his rallies. They say this (the rallies) changed him, plus I hear that he's gone through a spiritual awakening.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Anyway, I began to trust him more after following him a while (probably helped that I never initially knew much about him). Also Trump is far from being a politician.

                      Not all of ISIS are bad people either, but when when someone joins such an organisation it may be wise to make some assumptions about them for your own safety.

                      A pollie is a a person who is professionally involved in politics, especially as a holder of an elected office. 
He is not "far from being a pollie" he literally is President of the leader of the slave word.

                       Trump's election was/is revolutionary. The whole point is/was that he is not a politician, isn't that correct? Not an insider (though far from perfect and squeaky clean). I guess time will tell, but he's certainly making all the right enemies.

                      <p>
                       I'm an older guy, so I've seen a lot of pollies come and go. I have been fooled by them in the past, and I trust none of them (I think they're all puppets). Trump is obviously quite different, but again, time will tell. He def has an ego but I think he wants to be a hero (back to the ego again) much more than he wants to continue the fleecing of the people.

            I think this is almost certainly true, because the extent of opposition to Trump goes far beyond anything that could reasonably be provoked by his policy positions. It looks like they are determined to hound him out of office before he's been president for very long (impeachment, perhaps?) and replace him with someone who is a member of the secret societies.

              Trump is not part of their group. To quote the Bible: a house divided against it self will fall. He is not part of the NWO house. If he was, he would be acting like obama did. Trump is keeping the public aware of his actions all the press conferences and tweets. He wants the public AWARE. This is in direct contrast to the NWO puppets such as obama, who avoided the public eye and did their dealings in private. Remember hillarys public and private positions speech? The truth is : You shall know them by their fruits not their words. I recognize that Trumps words can be abrasive and taken out of context,  but his actions speak louder than words. His respect for the "rule of law" says everything to me!

               I hate bush and clinton even more.  I'm just saying I'm not counting on Trump to fix things, I think he's in it for himself.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just like the democrats have used social justice issues to get half the country to love them while they do their wars and child-harvesting, Trump can use his pro-america thing to get half the country to love him while he does whatever he wants or takes huge bribes to allow the evil to continue.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hope you're right about Trump, but how many weeks must we wait before he does anything to unravel this mess?  I don't just mean pizzagate, but all the wars and stuff.  Why is he silent on our arms deals with saudi arabia?  Why is he silent on yemen?

             Ok I also hope Trump will do something about this stuff, but you don't think Trump's policy positions are enough to provoke intense opposition? A lot of people think climate change is the most pressing issue of our time and that if we don't take radical steps, we could cause serious damage to the human race and society as we know, and Trump is already making it so that the EPA can't release its own research to the public. As someone who hates the Democratic Party, I am also definitely against a president that would hire billionaire oil execs and do something like that. The opposition is completely proportionate to Trump's policy positions.

              Climate change is a scam.  That said, I'm interested in your assertion about the EPA.  Source?
             </p>
             <p>
              Debating of objective merits of positions aside, I also agree with you about the degree of opposition to Trump from the left based on his policy positions (and everything else about him).  He -- with the backup of the based of America -- is effectively destroying leftism.  It has become totally dependent on the federal government to enforce its whims on everyone, and that is being stopped now.  This is really the existential crisis point for the left, and they are right to be in a total panic over it.  All JMO, of course.  :-)

                Interesting indeed.  Short article, but definitely something to keep an eye on.  I'll be especially interested in what climate realists have to say about this policy.  ("Chinese hoax"?  Where did they get the "Chinese" part?)

            I think right after Trump won the Republican primary, or when he was about to. More info at the actual youtube source - and the comments are good.

             Trump is a high degree Freemason and a Jesuit, but that does not make him the member of 'the club' - satanic ritual sacrafices at Eyes Wide Shut lodges makes one a member. They tried corrupting Trump by flying him to the Epstein Island but when he got spooked at the sight of under age girls (never mind children) they abandoned the idea of recruiting him. That is why his election was a huge coup against the satanic NWO, and that was the reason he got so much backlash from the Hollywood. With Jeff Sessions and Michael Flynn, the reign of pedophiles in high places is comming to an end.

              Personally, I don't think Trump is either of those things (mason, Jesuit) - I don't think he has the attention span to make any progress in either of those groups. And he is most definitely NOT religious or spiritual in any way. However, I agree with your assertion that he is NOT a member of "the club" - he could not be trusted with secrets, and also - he's really not that high powered or influential or anything. He's merely a puppet that people use for ratings and shit. I totally hate the guy, but I am also relieved that Hillary didn't get elected. But I am scared of the destruction Trump will cause to our country and our world. Fuck. We're screwed either way really. Can you explain to me why Sessions and Flynn are on the "good" side of fighting this pedophilia problem? I'm new to all this so I don't know about them specifically. Sessions kinda totally creeps me OUT though.

               For the likes if Trump, the elite have simple rudimentary rituals. For others, they partake in the full rituals, and for the psycopthic pedophiles they go through the dark lodges - Invisible degrees. The best book on the subject is Architects of Deception by Juri Lina

               I guess we will find out in 100 days. Michael Flynn tweeted about Clinton being into child trafficking that caused a media backlash. No way would a national security advisor tweet such a thing unless they have some heavy artilery to back it up. Hillary did not respond which is a red flag. Nor did that freak Podesta.

              I do not agree with that statement he is a Freemason or especially a Jesuit. To understand the depth of the NWO you must look at the Vatican. This is spiritual. Deception is the key. These people revel in the art of deception. Hiding in plain site. The Vatican (Jesuits) are the very top of this NWO. The epitome of deception. 
This does not mean all Catholics are bad they are being decieved by the Vatican. Inside the occults inner circle are the deepest of all rituals. Remember the Vatican was involved with the SS&amp; dark black magick (Crowley).
Research the Black Sun &amp; swastika symbol...Iconography.
             </p>
             <p>
              Check out The Outer Dark Youtube. 
Remember during the election this Pope 
(Francis) spoke out against Trump. Unheard of in for the Vatican. 
Pres. Trump sent out tweets against Pope Francis in return. People were shocked.
Research who Pope Francis gave private meetigs to just in the last year!
             </p>
             <p>
              Why is it hard to find documents on Pope Francis past (Joseph B.) from Argentina?
             </p>
             <p>
              If Trump was a Jesuit he would never have spoken against the Pope.

             He was asked before, about his memberships in Bohemian Club an others, wudnt say anything. Yale skull and Bones another big 1, they've been very close to presidency recently, the Clintons, Bushes, Kerry. Skull and Bones favour authoritarian centralised government and were heavily involved in the OSS and eventual CIA, founding members made lots of money investing and providing liquidity for Nazi steel and coal, despite an embargo and it being treason. It's speculated they are a huge influence in the gradual federalisation/socialisation of America, even under republican governments. At the end of 'the Franklin Cover Up' deCamp tell the story of, I think his name is Gordon or Gary Kahn/Kuhn. A tax/corruption protester and constitutionalist/gun advocate. They arranged an ambush and forced him into a shoot out after persecuting him for years. These societies are shockingly evil and influential.

               There are pictures that show a guy looking just like daddy bush...and an FBI report signed by Hoover that Bush called the FBI that day from Dallas.   The story on the street is Bush was the one running the show in Dallas.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bush dadddy was involved in the Bay of Pigs.   Two of the boats that went on the mission are named after women in his immediate family.  One Barbara and I cant remember the other one.

              <p>
               And if you really want to take a walk on the wild side.   Rumor has it that Barbara Bush is Alliester Crowleyś sex ritual child and it isnt as crazy at it seems.

               Yes, there's plenty info about it. He's always denied it of course. He was good friends w/ (innocent) Oswald's handler George de Mohrenschildt.

              Officially they try to make out like that speech was about Communism. Er, nope, it quite clearly was not about communism, otherwise wouldn't he have used the word communism? To think, that the bloodiest communist or fascist regimes had/have nothing on the sick, corrosive brutality of the so-called democratic governments of the so-called 'free world.' At least under Stalin or whoever, the suffering was known and seen and felt by others alongside you - not this private, secret hell that has children screaming in essentially a sound proof room, while all the world busies themselves around them, smiling, or calling them crazy and mocking them and telling them to shut up, should their muffled screams ever get the chance to penetrate into the unreal world for a moment. And all that in their short lives before they are brutally slain, utterly unknown, utterly unloved and unheard, nothing but a stain on a butcher's block, the entire purpose of their young existence twisted into being a mere plaything for the most vile, despicable, abhorrent, depraved, degenerate, base abominations that ever took a breath in this universe and all those before and since.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thinking about it too much hurts, and it makes me furious at the zombies who refuse to believe and would allow such suffering to slide back into the depths without so much as an acknowledgement. We all are trapped into unwittingly supporting this evil every day as we work to earn to buy things, using their twisted, rigged system of money against ourselves and against all that is good, with seemingly no way out, being so tied in to the web of zombies but unable to warn them of the giant spider lurking at the centre of their world. Ugh. I've thoroughly depressed myself.

               Stalin's surname was Juxasjvili, he was a Georgian, from my birth country. He was trained by the satanic Jesuits to advance NWO but Stalin was a poet and a philosopher and went against NWO. During the great purge he sent all top zionist feemasons such as Karl Radek to gulag. To truly infuriate the international bankers Stalin's spies tracked down NWO top agent and mass murdering pedophile Leon Trotski in Mexico and assassinated him. Why is Stalin demonized by the western media while sugarcoating Mao Ze Dung - because Mao played the game. Two unsung heroes saved the world from the clutches of Satanic NWO - Joseph Stalin and US General Smedley Buttler - who was recruited by the elite bankers in 1933 to stage a coup. Buttler exposed the treason. Without these two men we would be living under Orwellian State.

                What about the millions starved to death under Stalin?  What about his aggressive invasions of multiple countries?  Hitler invaded the USSR because Stalin was about to invade Europe.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think you're at least somewhat correct about Stalin eventually turning against the (((NWO))), but I'm not at all sold on his being a white hat in general.

                 Millions starved to death on the orders of bolshevik freemasons that initiated the great purge. Stalin was a facinating character. He was responsible for getting rid of virtually all satanic freemasons. Hillary Clinton is a product of communist faction. Donald Trump is a Nationalist, hopefly he delivers. This pedophile ring is the NWO, if you bring this down you bring the whole NWO down.

                Wow, even though I now know I can't trust anything I've been told by the media or the official narrative on things, I keep forgetting that this also applies to all the history I learned in school. How did people find out that this was what actually happened, there must be evidence and stuff - are there any sources you could point me to to read more about it? Thanks!

                 Best book I can recommend is Henry Makow's 'Illuminati, the Cult That Hijacked The World.' It's compact, to the point, factual, exposing the whole game. Of the hundreds of books that I have read, for anybody new to this subject I would recommend this one.

                 Keep in mind that history is written by the victors. And, "the greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.” If you attended public school, even college, you've been indoctrinated. You have to search things out for yourself. Good luck.

                Women are not wrong to want equality and justice. They have been deceived to think that H would have brought this. Trumps's rhetoric, his pussy comment, his anti womens' health and choice positions are problematic and divisive.

                 Any position on abortion is going to be problematic.  The country has been divided on that for many years.

                  I heard that he was planning to defund planned parenthood which does do women's health. Granted I'm not sure the source or what is really going on with the whole fetal matter stem cell posts, so I appreciate you calling me out on this. However, as the word on the street,  that's also what the women protesting are probably thinking. The abortion issue has been more a court issue, so I think the marchers will make sure that Trump's appointment to scotus will be closely scrutinized.

                   Yeah, I think what he's looking at is making sure PP doesn't use tax money for abortions, not defunding them altogether.  But I'm not certain either.

                It's like they are under a spell, it's not about intelligence. I have seen the same thing to with some of my family members. I have often wondered if there is a subliminal technology out there that some people are succeptible to. I have no basis for this suspicion, these people seem to react the same exact way. Down to their shrieking and outcries without logic.

            Initiation rites involve masturbation....letting somebody stick there Penis in your butt....sexing an underage girl....and to move up to the real high ranks it would help if you would slit a kids throat and prance around with its blood on you.  Take a bite of its little heart still beating.  And let them take photos....this is what these clowns are doing.

             It was a great system until that damn internet came along. The whole purpose of the internet was to make communications easier to get, archive, and more accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem is that you can't have secrets with a system like this, and it advanced too quickly to be stopped. They where also completely unaware of it. They scorned it
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the more interesting aspects of all the recent developments is how the elites seem to hold disdain for stem, but place arts on such a high pedestal. This goes back to the whole bard caste nonsense that was real big in the cult scene back in the 60s and the 70s. Philip K Dick wrote a short story about all this, and it was disturbingly prophetic.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the biggest indicators that there is  a cultural coup going on is how quickly the technocrats and the futurists are jumping onto the trump train. I suspect that either they smell blood in the water, or they are somehow behind this information getting out.

              It's not just blackmail, this is what they do for fun and to serve their god. It's not like they are reluncyantly participating and are being blackmailed. They share this belief and lifestyle and practice amongst each other. Blackmail is an extra benefit. Not the end goal.

                   I am curious if the CIA's heart attack gun still works that they already demonstrated  they had way back maybe in 70's?
Just wondering?

              Baptism by fire buddy. The Phoenix rose from the ashes, blah, blah blah. I be always wondered how people get into secret societies. I guess you have to be chosen. My grandfather was 33rd, and a Shriner, and a state level politician. No one has ever even hinted I join freemasonry. I guess I should be thankful I'm not of the ilk. I always knew my grandfather didn't get to where he was by his brain. It was most likely due to a deplorable habit he had. My guess would be necrophilia, considering he was a mortician in the military.

               I think they only invite you into the group if they see your kinda bent.  If you seem real moral they dont want you.  If your kinda sneaky and show criminal habits this is the kind of person they want.

               My wife works for an agency of the government.   They make you do lie detector test and answer a huge questionaire that is around 1200 questions long.   They ask all kinds of weird stuff about if you hurt animals as a kid....other awful stuff.  Then they have you talk to a Dr.  My wife said she could not believe anyone would ever answer yes to some of the stuff.   They told her you would be surprised and if you answered the more weird questions they had special jobs for you.   The Government has gone insane.  They used to want the Boy Scout type.  Now they want different types of people.  And not the type of person we would want to live next to.

                Police use this now too. Insane. They can easily identify sociopathic traits by these tests and THOSE are the degenerates they are after. Beyond messed up.

                The CIA recruited David Ferrie (of JFK fame) because he was a known fag and pedo and was fired from his commercial airline pilot position because of this. The CIA used this to control him. Adds new meaning to the CIA term controller (used to be called 'handler').

               OMG!!! Please tell us more about your grandfather. People keep trying to pass of freemasonry and all those secret societies as super normal and nothing to be concerned about, but I don't buy it. Were you close with your grandfather? What was he like? What kind of people did he mingle with? Does anyone else in your family have any info to offer?

                I was close with him as a kid, as an adult he was very controlling towards me and I rebelled. I said some things that got me disowned by him. I never got to see him before he died. He presented himself as mister perfect, he appeared to be perfect. He was your typical black socked republican. That reminds me. He used to make rub his feet. However our family wasn't perfect. My grandmother was an alcoholic who beat my dad and my uncle, really really bad when they were kids. My grandfather swept it under the rug, along with my dad's rampant drug use. My grandfather always said he did everything by the book. What book that was? I don't know. He hung out with military buddies. They would tell stories about them beating up "dopers" as they called them. They were all WW2 guys. Navy. Most of my family on that side has passed away, except my uncle. My father told that when I was really young, I traveled around the west coast with my grandfather while he was in the FBI. My father told me what he did for the FBI, but like a good ol boy, I know when to keep secrets, so I won't say what my father told me he did for the FBI. As far as freemasonry, I never knew he was one until I read his obituary. I knew he was a Shriner because me and my sister would always go to the circus with him. As kids. My grandfather was very good at keeping secrets I suppose. He had a real skull on his desk, which I loved to play with until he told me it was real. It had the jaw connected and you could move it. It also had all of its teeth. He told me it was my great grandfathers, who was a dentist. My father was a mortician, my grandfather was his teacher. I didn't have the stomach to carry that on.

                 Wow. Just wow. Thanks for sharing. The fact that your grandfather was in the FBI and the masons/shriners says a LOT. I wonder what the story was with your grandmother and her alcoholism... there's often some trauma in the past of addicts - which could explain your dad's problem with drugs. The skull on the desk is really freaky, and the fact that both your father and grandfather were morticians.... ummm... yikes. I mean, maybe your grandfather supplied dead bodies for the necro's to use? (a la Jimmy Savile). Also.... back to the skull... isn't it a bit strange that it had all of it's teeth? Did your great-grandfather die young or something? Because in those days, older folk generally lost a whole lotta teeth as the years went by. So it seems a bit more likely that the skull belonged to a younger man, no? Oh god - I'm totally creeping myself out here.

                  It belonged to my great grandfather. He used the skull to practice dentistry. My grandmother was abused by her father, he also abused my father and uncle. He put a cigar out on my uncle when he was a kid. He was mean as fuck.

                   Holy shit. Sorry to hear about all the abuse in the family. That just fucking sucks - there's not much else I can say about it. We aren't a civilized society when we're treating our children so horribly. And as for the skull - well I guess "back then" it was much easier to get your hands on a human skull - especially if you were in the medical profession. It's still weird though, to think of practicing dentistry on a skull with teeth? Like... you can't exactly clean the teeth, and once you look for cavities it's kind of over (it's not like it's going to develop new ones - ha!). Maybe it was an interesting prop to have? I dunno. I'm suspicious of basically everything these days.

                    Yeah my dads side of the family is Podesta creepy. I'm glad my mom kind of kept me away from them. I think she knows more than she tells me about what really went on, but they grew up in the era where you don't talk about family secrets, and you sure don't talk about abuse, and molestation.
