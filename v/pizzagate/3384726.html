              Well, burying it doesn't get rid of it. And whoever did the work will be able to be put on the stand. Wouldn't surprise me at all if those individuals weren't the simple worker bees Jeffrey thought he was hiring to secure the evidence two years ago, either. A certain US president has a lot of friends in the construction business.

            HAW haw: "Once Simpson assigns a committee to vet nonmembers for access to One [the world's biggest yacht], they’ll be working on a referral basis and looking for “THE GREAT AND THE GOOD who can get together and discuss the key issues of the day.”" All he has to do is call everyone in Epstein's black book — a directory of the world's Great and Good.

            The NY Post has come up with a new term of endearment for fair maiden Ghislaine (today discovered at an In-n-Out burger in Los Angeles. They refer to her as Jeffery's Gal Pal. Somebody is planning to run her for the Senate, even the presidency as Democrats have no one and she certainly has name recognition.

            We researched cement before. There is blood in it quite often and maybe more than not. Seems there was an extreme urgency. Who drives this cement truck?  Epstein? Hired help? Can they be broken?  Do any of us really believe the FBI will do the right thing? I sure hope so but there is just only a sliver of a chance and next to none.

            The photos are on the q sites way past tense, but I can't verify that information. Rumors were he already buried those tunnels! Unless you were living down there, I doubt we will get much real info nowadays.Sorry to drop your thread, but MO Man Mahamud Tooxoow Mahamed ID’d A Suspect In Kidnapping Kids Of Murdered Woman Jessica McCormack, just in case someone sees a bigger picture than I do.

            There's something wrong in the speculation that Mossad or other state agencies had Epstein running a honey pot, or there's still information awaiting revelation. Thus far, were expected to believe Jeffrey's sordid business is based on his elite "clients" all desiring 12 to 17 year old females. Sure, it's illegal in most of the US, but not that outrageous or scandalous in many parts of the world. If unmasked the perps need only avoid the US and arrest and go about their business, like Polanski. What happens when a target wanders into Epstein's web and lets it be known that his (or her) preferences are for two-year-old males, or bestiality with aardvarks or a nice cannibal lunch or a custom made pair of red shoes. Do Jeffrey or Ghislaine go, "I'm sorry, we don't do those things and have absolutely no idea where you might indulge those strange desires. Be gone!" Not likely. They either provided those services or handed them off to parallel operations.

             This will come out in due time.  The island was much worse than just teenage sex parties.  Human sacrifice also part of the fun.  Santa Fe property, Venezuela(Chavez and Maduro let it happen) and likely other places.  The teenage sex angle is to get people used to what is coming, which is way worse.   All going to come back to spirit cooking, baby killing, pedo rape, and pizzagate which as everyone here knows was not just about a pizza parlor.

             But getting filmed with young girls who were sexually exploited is definitely illegal, not only in the US, but in most other countries. Rape is illegal.
