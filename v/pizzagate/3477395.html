            Myatt used O9A as a honey trap in the 80's to recruit smarter neo-Nazis other than drunker skinheads. With his friend Richard Moult. It's doubtful that the O9A ever really did exist, but was simply a convenient way to attract clever folk and a way that Myatt could create an alter-ego, which O9A literature instructs the aspiring adept to do as part of their path to the Numinous. One thing for sure, O9A has nothing to do with Aquino or TOS.

             Thank you. These examples do seem to be 'smarter' and aware of ways the world works, yet so far from the way most of us would think. Interesting. Less the actual iteration of cults (O9A) or individuals behind and in them (MA of TOS), BUT more the
             <em>
              belief systems
             </em>
             that underly and reoccur.

            I thought it was shockingly red-pilled for anything on TV these, let alone something produced by Netflix. Don't think they understood what they were producing to be honest. They probably thought it was anti-Christian, when in fact it is something else entirely.

             Posted about it in his Monsters Inc Discussion which is going off.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had the same feeling when I watched it. Jim Henson the original creator seemed like a real deal creative who was indeed perhaps pilling via puppets. He is dead now, but his wife and studio seemed to have more control than is usual over the Netflix series. Perhaps she was honoring his legacy and intent.

              Yeah, I mean, it's not even subtle about it. At all.
             </p>
             <p>
              You've got these awkward and nasty hook-beaked creatures with whiny voices, who are aliens that showed up thousands of years ago, and subverted the old gods of the land, to take over and rule from the shadows, by manipulating the truth and spreading deception, in a land full of productive people who naively trust them, while they themselves produce nothing, but demand annual tithes, and drain them of their very life force, in a vain quest for immortality.
             </p>
             <p>
              And that's just the general theme. The parallels continue and become deeper as you look closer. There's even a Jesus figure, as well as references to old vs new testament, the Eye of Providence, mass media, propaganda, class warfare vs class unification, miscegenation as a weapon, etc, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              I still can't wrap my mind around how this was produced by Netflix in current year.

               Netflix is probably more interested in domination than what they leak. Airwaves, our time, attention and perhaps our emotion, keep the media machine rolling.
              </p>
              <p>
               While I like to believe Hensen had positive intent, They seem to be more concerned with feeding the same story. Even straight up telling us in some karmic neutrality play.  Or perhaps they figure puppets like cartoons will dismiss or desensitize us from the truth. Glad you can see through it!

            There has been an ongoing discussion on internet for years whether this 'culling' and 'human sacrifice' stuff is just a larp.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the guy who most people think has founded the ONA is rumoured to be an MI5 asset. In fact, some people think the ONA is just a honeypot for possible radicals, set up by intelligence agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The founding myth says that the ONA merged three existing occult circles into one, Jimmy Savile allgedly was a member of one of them (the satanic one), but I wasn't able to find more info at the time I looked into that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Atomwaffen Nazi guys in the US are connected to the ONA, which operates via independent cells in different countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a guy on YouTube who also runs a blog, who has called out other ONA members, and has accused them of being pedos. (You'll find him when searching for 'Order of Nine Angles' on YT).
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR - these guys are Satanists, some of them seem to be pedos, but every info you'll find about them in and in their texts is a mixture of myth, larp and (maybe) some real info.

             Thank you for your input. Interesting about Savile. I agree with you- but have garnered some interesting information from their beliefs that have helped me pick up on symbolism. I care less about the actual current incarnation of the cult-ure (O9A), and more about what archetypes and mythos reoccur throughout all predatory efforts across history.  Filtered through whatever it may be, there are themes that are pervasive and must have some truth to Them.

              The satanic circle Savile was said to have been a member of was the 'Temple of the Sun'. There is indeed a photo of Savile in a cloak with a sun symbol on it. Looks a bit Indian at first glance.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are also two reports by alleged survivors who say they were abused by Satanists including Savile.

              Well, they certainly have (re)created an interesting female archetype - as represented by the alleged female who introduced David Myatt to occultism and the alleged local witchcraft tradition. Which was at least partly made up by Myatt though, imo. Lol.
             </p>
             <p>
              In one of his autobiographic writings he claims that he had a female friend he was close to in London, she ran a brothel, and gathered info about the men who were clients. This might be closer to the truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              Probably the lady ran a sex trafficking and blackmail operation for MI5.
