            The lack of compassion link is fascinating! I had not heard that. I've heard of E-D but not sure why - might have been someone on the forum. I wish I had more time to spend on all this. Maybe after the PG urgency has passed. Hopefully.

            That is VERY interesting - I do hope they study it. The anecdotal information like that is invaluable.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have chronic Lyme and moderate an online Lyme forum so I've interacted w/ hundreds of Lyme patients over about 2 yrs. I have yet to observe a female Lymee who wasn't initially diagnosed w/ fibro. Not suggesting that everyone w/ fibro has Lyme, but the symptoms are so similar they are impossible to distinguish (but most Lymees also have a ton of other symptoms - so that's one huge clue). There is also no testing for fibro and NO reliable testing for Lyme... it's like the holy grail.
           </p>
           <p>
            You probably know all this - posting for others: Fibro is very real, however, it was legitimized only when Big Pharma developed expensive (and mostly ineffective) drugs to treat symptoms. Before then, as you well know, women were ridiculed. This "omg fibro might be real" trend helped so many women finally be heard and understood, but it also allowed patients and MDs to focus only on symptoms and abandon the search for root causes. And for those women (and some men) the infection continues to do irreparable damage as it goes untreated. Sorry - I could talk forever about links btwn fibro and Lyme and ME and chronic fatigue and MS and lupus - so many misdiagnosed conditions that are actually lyme and coinfections. More than you wanted to know, I'm sure! I'm so sorry you have had to deal with all this. Dealing with a child's issues is entirely different than dealing with your own.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've also read about links with mothers taking acetaminophen during pregnancy.  And I know some parents have had success through discovery of DNA-mutations for methylation and detoxing issues to help resolve some autism symptoms.

           <p>
            I've been so busy w/ PG that I missed this news story of an outstanding study
            <strong>
             demonstrating a relationship between the cocktails of vaccinations now given to young children, and autism
            </strong>
            , says it all. The study was BANNED from your eyeballs ever seeing it:
            <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/study-proving-vaccines-cause-autism-banned-from-internet/">
             http://investmentwatchblog.com/study-proving-vaccines-cause-autism-banned-from-internet/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "A peer-reviewed scientific study that proved vaccinated children are three times more likely to be diagnosed with autism and other neurological disorders and health problems has been unpublished and pulled from the internet after receiving heavy criticism from the vaccine industry and mainstream media."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Results: A total of 415 mothers provided data on 666 children, of which 261 (39%) were unvaccinated. Vaccinated children were significantly less likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and pertussis, but significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia, otitis media, allergies and NDDs(defined as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and/or a learning disability). After adjustment, the factors that remained significantly associated with NDD were vacvcination… male gender… and preterm birth. In a final adjusted model, vcaccination but not preterm birth remained associated with HDD, while the interaction of preterm birt and vaccination was associated with a 6.6-fold increased odds of NDD….
           </p>
           <p>
            Conclusions: In this study based on mothers’ reports, the vaccinated had a higher rate of allergies and NDD than the unvaccinated. Vaccination, but not preterm birth, remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors. However, preterm birth combined with vaccination was associated with an apparent synergistic increase in the odds of NDD."
           </p>
           <p>
            This was followed by scrubbing the paper from the internet, but not before a screen shot of the abstract - which appears in the article - was saved:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Not only has the first study into vaccinated versus unvaccinated children been unpublished by Frontiers In Public Health, but a cached version available on internet archives has also been removed, suggesting there is a serious campaign to stop members of the public from viewing the study. However a screenshot of the abstract was saved before it was scrubbed from the internet."

            Fraudulent science. Most MDs aren't even aware but it's also the least  "inquisitive" profession... so... families and children suffer. The statistics used to be 1 in 80 kids developed autism. Then it was 1 in 60. Now, it's estimated to be 1 in 45. An MIT professor did some simple math and suggested that by 2025 half of all kids would be dealing with autism.

            Imagine how that changes the needs (and funding) for health and educational services and other public programs. And imagine what that means for the future of this country when more and more adults are not fully-functioning.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm so sorry you were accused by your doctors - that infuriates me. I've had my own experiences with that (unrelated to autism but when many of these MDs don't know something, then it's not their problem). It's a joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's a great letter - my MD suggested I should start treatment for a mitochondrial disorder so that might happen in a few wks.

            I've not seen seen that yet but I have read other interesting pieces on the Polio vaccine and the fraudulent "science" on how prevalent it was (not) but the vaccine certainly was a medical "breakthrough".
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not an anti-vaccer. However, I am 100% dubious of modern "science" and collusion between the CDC, NIH, academics and medical publications. I've uncovered an UNBELIEVABLE amount of fraud it is terrifying. It didn't take much to see the MSM hype about vaccines. Knowing what we all now know about who owns the MSM, it's not a stretch to understand why there is such fear mongering about vaccines. Unfortunately, that IS a war that independent parents are not winning. The problem is that you cannot trust the science. That's horrifying to me.

             The gag order is to keep the public from knowing what is going on.  How CPS steals children.  Parents will do anything to get their kids back and will comply comply comply as the courts drag on and on until its too late... The gag order is made under the pretense of "HIPAA and privacy for the child"

            I'm very relieved your son is doing well now. When I learned of how many vaccines they were giving in the first few months of life I was absolutely astounded. How can ANY reasonable adult claim that a newborn needs to be vaccinated against Hep B - a disease primarily contracted through drug abuse and risky sex. First of all the CDC schedule is optional, yet the brainwashed and their MDs seem to think it's some sort of law. It's completely unreasonable to argue against delayed vaccines - and yes, ONLY the critical diseases and there aren't many of those here in the US that most people need to worry about. The rest is peddled very successfully by the $35+ BILLION DOLLAR pharmaceutical cartel.

            This is very good news. The Courts are corrupt and they are stealing children, stacking the deck against parents and encouraging lawyers to create contention and excessive fees. Most of the time I see those horrible murder/suicides I think, those people were probably involved with the courts and couldn't take anymore of it.

            I really think I'd go in there with a machine gun to get my baby back.  I know that doesn't sound logical but all logic would be lost on me.  I would literally go crazy from the despair.   Breastfeeding and those first months - years really - are SO important and I don't think I would be able to be kept away from my baby.

              I would literally go nuts.  There would be no reasoning with me.  Newborns and their mothers falling in love -  it's just so crucial.  I'm strict with my kids and not a warm and fuzzy person, but with newborns it's a whole nother ballgame.  It's a thing of nature that you just don't mess with.

                 frankly, if you have something they want, they will arrest you whether you have guns or not. And also, you can't go in with guns. There are metal detectors in Courthouses for that reason. So, keep your kids safe, stay healthy, and dispense with anyone who threatens you in your own home. It will be your word against a dead guy who threatened you physically.

                  Yeh.  I'm not a confrontational person.  I cry and fall to pieces when I get pulled over for a speeding ticket.

                  We have 6 children so I'm hoping that there won't be any more little bundles in my future.  So I don't expect anyone to try and steal my babies.  I am watching my younger 3 like a hawk right now though.  I worry so much

                   I would recommend taking practical steps to keep them safe, like get a dog or security system etc and try to worry less. you'll make yourself crazy and your kids won't take your  concerns seriously.

                    We have an alarm system and a shotgun, but I'll never stop worrying.  I try not to nag them, and I want them to grow up with some real sense and some independence, so I don't helicopter.  I don't want them to turn out like the snowflakes!

                    They ride their bikes etc around our neighborhood without me - the older 3.  I worry when they are out, but I know it's important for their development so I just pray to their guardian angels.

            It's one of the most terrifying things I've ever read. Like a NEWBORN child is better off w/out its mother? I would sue from one end of that state to the other. They were SMART to go public.

            Just think of how many babies are taken every day because the mother "tested positive" for some drug at delivery. Fabricating false positive results could be a lucrative business for an ob nurse.

             I believe it was mentioned in this video I'm sharing below - although it could have been in one of the other 50 vids I've watched on corruption in CPS, but dubious contracts were uncovered between CPS in CA(?) and LabCorp...

            TY! Adding it to my CPS corruption file.
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW - Here is some off-topic truths about vaccines...
           </p>
           <p>
            FACT: 
The "antivaxxers" are very few and far between. Very, very few people think ALL vaccines in existence should be mandated for everyone, all the time. And very few people think no one should be vaccinated. Most people believe that for most of the dangerous, communicable diseases (polio, measles) everyone should be vaccinated. But more and more people are unwilling to follow the CDC's vaccination schedule, all the time, and there are several vaccines that are unnecessary and probably shouldn't be mandated for everyone. Sorry - that's not the overly dramatic scare-tactic version Big Pharma and .gov are desperately trying to permeate through mass media, but that's the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            FACT: 
If you've been paying any attention to the concerns regarding the MMR vaccine, you'd know that the CDC whistleblower shared classified documentation of the underlying data the CDC covered up that clearly showed increased risk the earlier the MMR vaccine was administered. The data literally showed that black boy infants had 236% increased risk to develop autism w/ MMR if they received the MMR "according to the CDC schedule" which is under 36 months). The biggest risk was "isolation" cases, or children with no prior or comorbid issues in the first year of life. This includes EVERY HEALTHY CHILD and the data showed 700-800% elevated risk for some of these kids and this likely accounts for the insane increase in rates over the past decade or so.
           </p>
           <p>
            FACT: 
Some kids are getting over 70 vaccines. One of the vaccines given to INFANTS is Hepatitis B! How in the world was any responsible and intelligent adult (much less the government, medical and scientific industry and parents) convinced that infants need vaccination against a relatively uncommon disease typically acquired through risky sexual activity or needle sharing? And there are over 217 more vaccines currently in production.
           </p>
           <p>
            FACT: 
Vaccines are not classified as "pharmaceutical drugs" and therefore, are NOT vigorously and thoroughly tested and vetted by the FDA like ALL other drugs (double-blind, placebo-based, long-term controlled trails, etc.) And they certainly aren't tested in combination with other vaccines. If they were tested like other drugs, they wouldn't make it to market. SHOCKING, since they are mandatory. This allows Big Pharma to fast-track the production.
           </p>
           <p>
            FACT: 
As a result of Big Pharma lobbying, Reagan passed 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act which shielded mfrs for liability in injury/death caused by their vaccines, which the Fed. government admits are unavoidably unsafe 
- subsequently, .gov created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) whereby parents are forced to petition the Dept. of HHS 
- if Fed officials oppose compensation, cases are argued by a "special master" before a "vaccine court" as part of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims 
- Pharmaceutical companies do not have to participate in proceedings
- Dept. of Justice acts as the government's lawyer, HHS lawyers are paid for by tax dollars
- Tax payers pay for all damages awarded - money comes from a $.75 tax added to all vaccines, paid by parents of harmed and unharmed children 
- To date, the court has paid out $3-5 billion (I don't have current numbers)
           </p>
           <p>
            FACT:
By 2002, there were thousands of cases accumulating in "vaccine court" with avg. compensation of $5M (assoc. with costs of raising an autistic child), creating a potential liability of hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions in damages to be awarded by the Fed .gov as the autism rates continued to escalate (the "fund" paid for by tax dollars was $5B and since 1986 $3B has already been paid out). So they had to develop studies that could exonerate the MMR vaccine to help disprove causal relationships w/ the vaccines.
           </p>
           <p>
            FACT: 
The MMR study was part of this, according to Thompson's whistleblower lawyer, 
"...as part of fraudulent studies that would exonerate MMR vaccine used to deliberately avoid paying out. Thousands of petitioners were denied their fair day in court by a corrupt and deliberate obstruction of justice--is one of the most unethical medical decisions of all time because it was made with knowledge to sacrifice these children as a direct affront to the Congressional mandate that they all be compensated."
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2014, the CDC whistleblower came public with the CDC's fraud. You would have expected this to be a huge story and picked up by most news outlets; WRONG. Most news outlets are funded by Big Pharma (when's the last time you watched prime time TV without seeing a pharmaceutical commercial?) The breaking news about the CDC's fraudulent study and potential damage to America's kids got no coverage. Instead, coverage of the 644 cases measles during the outbreak due to the antivaxx movement--was instead urgent and breaking news all over the country. 644 measles cases compared to 1,082,353 cases of autism in 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...there is MUCH more. Do your research.

             100% true and upvoated.  CDC's own research showed the autism rates were higher with MMR.  They STILL refuse to compare data of non-vaxxed children...could it be because non-vaxxed children have a 0% autism rate?...One wonders...

              Excellent point - these studies are all on vaxxed children.

             <p>
              If you haven't already, please watch the docu "Vaxxed" - they successfully banned it from Tribeca film festival, which gave it MUCH more publicity than if they had just shown it. Thanks Babs! It's quite revealing.

             No vaccines here for my two girls, now ages 2 and 4. And I can absolutely say without a doubt their immune systems seem to work far better than those of my coworkers and friends children who are vaccinated.  I am constantly hearing about how their kids are sick all the time, ear infections seem to occur a dozen times a year for them. My kids have never had a single ear infection.  You would be amazed how much you get harassed by doctors about getting ur kids vaccinated. It is very hard to find one who isn't pushy or even just a huge asshole to you when they learn you are anti vax.  Even when you do find a decent doc, you have the nurses, clinics and schools pushing their vaccine agenda. I was lucky to get my kids enrolled into a preschool just before they made it mandatory to have their "immunizations" up to date in order to go there. In a school with over 100 kids, mine are the only two not vaccinated. This is in a state that still allows conscientious exemptions.  No one is going to tell me that I am required to put toxic substances into my childs body.  It's negligent mass medication. Just like the fluoride in our water. Trying to dumb us down, put everyone on the spectrum. Make us Compliant and unaware.

              My journey toward the red pill has been interesting, but it gets easier and easier to understand what is going on... I hadn't really understood much about the vaccine issues when, in doing about 2 yrs of research into a whole other health controversy and corruption in science, I realized how deep this goes. And knowing what I know now about the MSM cartel - I cannot believe that parents are being attacked like they are simply for questioning and trying to protect their children. Stay strong and stay healthy.

               I read everything you posted and , I agree after very deep research, I have a child on the spectrum. we do not take any shots at all. NO shots, and I have a compromised  immune system, I have late stage lymes, But you could not pay me to take a shot not even for pneumonia . I have not been sick in years since I stopped my yearly flu shot 15 years ago.
But we need to get back to the investigation..

                I tagged this as "off-topic" to fend off the "antivaxxers are evil" vultures, so that we could get a decent conversation underway. But make no mistake about it - v

                </strong>
                , which is a serious component of trafficking. You need to dig into the history of CPS corruption to understand and appreciate its relevancy. One example of many is Georgia Senator Nancy Shaefer and Husband who were "murder-suicided" (allegedly over financial woes although they were fairly wealthy with well-off children) weeks before she was to complete a documentary on her exposure of pedophilia in Child Protective Services and coverups at all levels of  state and local governments.

                Secondly, I am emerging from 3 yrs intense treatment for late-stage lyme and several other coinfections and system breakdowns. I've battled this for 19 years. I have tons of resources if you are interested - PM me. You are very wise to avoid the flu shots - they are pretty dangerous for anyone w/ compromised immune systems, the young, the old and the pregnant - the exact people they're marketed to. The only flu shot I received was before I got the lyme diagnosis and it sent me reeling into a very difficult relapse.

                  So sorry to hear about your Lyme! Do you know if you had it before your son was conceived? That is such a classic experience w/ Lyme. I used to love running - ran 5 mi a day. I used to be a dancer. I don't know how or where I got mine but it was 18+ yrs ago. Been a long haul.

             Pizzagate, now home to actual conspiracies. There are not legitimate reproducible studies that link autism and vaccines. The rates of autism are not reported on because it is status quo. A sudden outbreak of a disease that would have been eradicated by now if not for people wearing tinfoil hats
             <em>
              is
             </em>
             news. Furthermore, autism is a very wide spectrum with many manifestations and causes. It wouldn't be fair to talk about
             <em>
              all
             </em>
             cases of autism even if there was a link vaccines.

              Seriously? We are investigating PIZZAGATE.  We know MSM doesn't report anything accurately. We know corruption exists. We know the elite don't give a crap about our children.  You think there couldn't possibly be a cover-up in the vaccine-autism link?  I agree the vaccine discussion is off-topic... as we need to focus on Pizzagate here.  But,

              , if autism is a topic of interest to you, I encourage you to "dig deeper" as children are recovering from "autism" by treating vaccine injury.  Vaxxed or Trace Amounts would be a good start.

               Pizzegate is a private investigatory initiative. The aim is to collect actual evidence, avoid conjecture, and expose the truth through those facts. The only thing that anti-vaccine advocates seem to be able to do is say everyone is lying. I am not saying there "couldn't possibly be a cover-up." Even aside from the fact that "vaccine" is an incredibly broad group of things, and that "autism" is an incredibly complex spectrum with many different causes - even if the allegation was
               <em>
                certain
               </em>
               vaccines are causing
               <em>
                certain
               </em>
               types of autism, I still have seen no compelling evidence supporting the claim.
              </p>
              <p>
               Specific things happening in specific places for specific people is only anecdote. There are too many confounding factors to make the claim that it's "vaccines" except maybe that it's a specific vaccine. I think probably there is bogus medicine happening in some countries that can cause problems because their medical science is poor, but I do not believe that there is a grand conspiracy in the US and/or Europe where vaccines cause autism and it's just being covered up.
              </p>
              <p>
               That sort of thing
               <em>
                does
               </em>
               happen. It took decades for the actual studies of the horrific dangers of cigarettes to get out, but the tobacco companies had only the one product to profit from, and they didn't have a layer of doctors between them and the product.
              </p>
              <p>
               The rates of all forms of autism are in line with other mental health issues, such as mood disorders and behavioral disorder. The rates are simply too low, even if the assertion was that vaccines caused
               <em>
                all
               </em>
               forms of autism, to imply any compelling link.

              First, if you even bothered to read the OP's article, it was about vaccines and my post was about vaccines, not all forms of autism. Although I have two autistic family members - so I'm happy to debate you on autism facts, as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Secondly, you need to do your own research (I doubt that you even read my post and if you did, debunk it - fact by fact). PROVE that the "legitimate, reproducible studies" do NOT link autism and vaccines. MSM claimed that it's been proven so you seem to be content to be told what to think but I've actually done my homework.
             </p>
             <p>
              A CDC whistle-blower debunked THE main study used to claim no link - in 2014 he exposed the truth behind the CDC's autism link coverup. Of course, no one in the MSM covered it. Look into it.
             </p>
             <p>
              For reasons that have nothing to do with vaccines I've done quite a bit of investigation into other studies that have been "engineered" by the CDC, NIC, and articles and other publications. Here's a quote from the former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine:

               I read OPs post. You literally said your post was diverting the topic. I read your post. I'm not going to refute your "facts." You provided zero evidence in your post, and I'm not going to waste my time refuting your claims - you made the positive claim, you get to prove it.

                Friend, you seem to have forgotten your own claims that there is no proof of link, so you also get to also prove your claims. If you aren't too lazy to actually do that, you'll simply cite a bunch of studies that the MSM have been slinging around - doubt you'll get much credit for that around these parts.
               </p>
               <p>
                Once we get past the PG urgency, I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have and share my proof. Unfortunately, the vaccine community on voat was abandoned a few yrs ago.
               </p>
               <p>
                Chances are, you don't really have any questions, haven't really looked into the vaccine and CDC corruption, you've likely never read an actual study that's been done on anything associated with it, and are just parroting what you've been told to believe.  I'm not sure you belong here.

                 You're right. I should have said that as yet no one making the claims that there is a link has provided evidence for that; i.e., I have been exposed to no proof.

                  <strong>
                   You are a prime example of the kind of ignorance that the PG voat community is fighting
                  </strong>
                  - trying to dispell the MSM bullshit. You're providing the perfect example of how the public just blindly, ignorantly, and lazily lets the MSM bullshit infiltrate their brains and rob them of all rational thought, natural curiosity and critical analysis. You're clearly not a scientist, nor anyone close to autism. You don't even attempt to qualify your arrogant declarations with any query about what might be harming those kids and fooling those parents, if not vaccines. Yet you reply to a conversation without any respect for information you don't have or bother to ask ANY questions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is EXACTLY what PG is fighting here. Again, this isn't the place for your mindless blathering. There are tons of other social media  outlets for that noise.

               Remember when Gates made that gaff on his Ted talk where he claimed that his vaccine programs were going to reduce populations?  It was no gaff.  I regret not having links, but there was a group of Catholic missionaries in Mexico who were vaccinating children in a small town and all of the new pregnancies were resulting in miscarriages.  So, they sent a sample of the vaccines off to be tested.  The results were that they contained hCG hormone, the hormone which prepares the body for pregnancy and prevents the body from aborting the child.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thing is, since the Civil War we've known that introducing proteins directly into the bloodstream results in antibodies formed against it.  The result was that the woman had antibodies formed against hCG and when they became pregnant, their bodies began producing it normally, the antibodies forced an abortion.  This has been repeated in Africa with Tetanus shots and in other vaccines.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is just one of many such programs done clandestinely and against the people's consent. Eugenics is alive and well today.

                 I've tried to locate from where I originally was following this story, but can't.  Current links make mention, but lack the evidence.  That said, somewhere I have the actual analysis report and the letters written trying to raise awareness within the WHO and US government.  The missionaries involved were trying to get citizen support at the time.  Here's a Snopes report making only passing mention of Mexico:

                <p>
                 This is obviously incorrect, since I have the documentation, including patient studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's an anti-vaccine site which gives a general overview, but without any documentation:

                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 I never would have believed information could essentially be scrubbed from the internet, but in many instances it has.  The documentation I have bothered to keep was for my own use, but now I archive everything (just need to create a database to locate it effectively).
                </p>
                <p>
                 To give you an idea of what briefly appears and then vanishes, were you aware that a former director of the WHO stated that AIDS was not a sexually transmitted disease?  Around the same time he stated that, there was a very well-structured, simultaneous study encompassing a brothel in Tijuana with a very high turnover, and a large selection of prostitutes operating in the San Diego area.  Despite the number and variety of clients at the brothel, there were only two who reportedly acquired AIDS, while &gt;70% did in San Diego.  Further, protected sex was almost unheard of in Tijuana, while it was much more common among the San Diego prostitutes.  The difference?  Intravenous drug use.  In fact, the two who were infected in Tijuana were intravenous drug users, uncommon within the community of women at the brothel.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Somewhere I have both archives of the pages with quotes from the director of the WHO and a copy of the published study.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The one thing I wish I had archived, and believe I found the website, yet it isn't available through web archive, was a site ran by a guy who traveled all over treating cancer patients.  His site was incredibly documented with a massive amount of images from the patients he had treated with "black salve", a mixture of bloodroot and chaparral.  Some of the patients were very far gone and the images extremely graphic, yet they survived and there were images of after they had healed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm going to be building a new computer next month and will most likely be going through my old archived data,  If you are still active I'll pass along any info I come up with regarding the vaccines.

                Good post. I should clarify my previous post - I forgot a tidbit:
               </p>
               <p>
                "According to an MIT mathematician:,
                <strong>
                 from a previous rate during early 90s (before the vaccine explosion) of 1 in 15,000 to the current rate of autism showing up in kinds
                </strong>
                (currently, 1 in 45 kids), by the ear 2032, half of all kids and 80% of boys will be dx with autism." In the links I provided, the target year was 2025 so maybe it's a more current calculation.
               </p>
               <p>
                A few other tidbits that might interest you:

                 Other well-known controversies regarding the CDC include:
                </strong>
                CDC does research reactionary - whatever is getting press and causing concern about vaccines gets studied, not the safety of the drugs in the first place.
               </p>
               <p>
                Another site shares yet another whistleblower from Utah exposing crucial flaws in CDC surveillance, including "negligent design, willful ignorance and possible fraud" - SOUND FAMILIAR?
               </p>
               <p>
                There are over 217 more vaccines in production.

                "Henrietta Lacks was the source of the first line of immortal human cells to ever be cloned back in the 1950s, but the removal of her cells was done without her permission or knowledge. Doctors noticed that Lacks’ cells were able to stay alive for longer periods of time than previous cells, so in order to conduct research they removed two samples of her cervix during surgery – one part that was healthy and one part that was cancerous. Researchers have grown roughly 20 tons of her cells since her death. In addition to harvesting Lacks’ cells without her knowledge or permission, researchers also published the family’s medical records without their consent."

                When the CDC was founded--right after WWII, it's original focus was communicable disease and they were located in the SE part of the country primarily due to the fact that that was where malaria was endemic--and they sprayed more than 6 million homes with DDT...

                Revising polio case numbers so that the vaccine showed to be effective at "elimination" - I understand this less but a colleague shared w/ me:

                CDC was effectively intimidated by NRA-backed politicians who attacked researchers, research and the CDC for publishing data on firearm research as "not legitimate science". Despite a 2013 executive order by President Obama (after Sandy Hook) to resume research on gun violence, the CDC has adhered to a two-decade-old Congressional restriction that effectively bans such inquiries.

                In '94 the CDC admitted they sent biological warfare agents (at least 80) to the Iraqi government for from '84-'89 ---This information comes from a report, IRAQ’S BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM, prepared by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, which contains ample reference citations.

                A CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson blew the whistle on a report documenting that African American boys under 3 were three times more at risk of developing autism from the MMR-II vaccine, which the CDC buried and parents were not notified before vaccination. An associated scientist had omitted statistically-significant information in an '04 article published in the journal of Pediatrics that documented increased risk for this geo group and that final study protocol was not followed after those findings were buried:

                Did you know that it wasn’t the CDC responding to the AIDS crisis that got the drugs we needed to save lives; it was the AIDS activists who got the FDA to fast track treatment options but it took civil unrest to gain attention to that devastating disease. I learned this from watching the documentary, “How to Survive a Plague” (Netflix).
