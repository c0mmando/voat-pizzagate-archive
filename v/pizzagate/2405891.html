            There is a cover up taking place amongst cases of pedophile convictions where the perpetrator is part of a Satanic cult. Unfortunately I lost the Facebook page, but there was a dude on Facebook several months back posting something about a conviction and his page said he was a Satanic high priest. He linked to his blog and it said so and so the high priest of such and such was convicted of child rape or child porn. Then it had a reference to an outside article on Daily Mail and the article made no mention of the involvement of SRA or Satanism. I so wish I could find that information again.

             i think a lot of these prosecutors avoided the Satanic aspects of these cases because of the propaganda push that it was all hokey
            </p>
            <p>
             but it came out in the children's testimony, and there still was convictions
            </p>
            <p>
             we know these rituals are still going, this is the part of the red pill that is one of the hardest to deal with
            </p>
            <p>
             you will probably come across it again while looking for something else

            <p>
             that happens to me a lot

            Mansfield Ohio.  This sounds somewhat fishy.  Possibly the crimes were pushed onto the teenagers and elders were spared.   As many as 50 children described being sexually abused and taken from the church to wooded areas where they said they were forced to participate in child pornography, infanticide, and mutilation of corpses. Victims' parents demanded that charges be filed against adult church members who allegedly were involved, but only Rohde and Butner were indicted. (Hobbs, 1992). adults who allegedly were involved, but only Rhode and Butner were indicted.

             We have seen many times when a group is caught only one or few get convicted

            <p>
             Maybe check into the appeals, or check into areas where there were convictions

              I recently had to completely wipe and reformat mine, n4n. After modding through those terrible DDoS attacks, it just kept getting slower and slower and more buggy. The complete wipe fixed it better-than-new, though.

               It's the wire to monitor

              <p>
               Sometimes I work with it at 1/4 closed
              </p>
              <p>
               Had it opened at half so I went for it, hit my favs
              </p>
              <p>
               Hope to get it fixed soon before it flies out the window

               Do every thing that doesn't need copy on phone, I learning, but it's slow going
