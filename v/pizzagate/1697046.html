<p>Here is the event description: 
As we all know, our friends over at Comet Ping Pong have been the victims of a terribly stupid and fictitious online conspiracy called &quot;Pizzagate&quot; recently. The situation has become sort of insane, so we thought we\'d set up a cool show to show our support for them.
Doors for this show will open at 10:00PM, so come early and eat dinner after the Million Woman March and then stick around and party for the show.
Line Up:
-WE WERE BLACK CLOUDS
-FOXHALL STACKS (featuring members of Bad Religion/Minor Threat/Burning Airlines/Government Issue).
-LOUD BOYZ</p>
<p>If you look at the list of those who attended on FB- Sasha Lord is listed and over 200 other people who i feel all could be looked into for links (anybody?) According to the google search above Christopher Holland \'liked\' this event. This page its events and attendees beg a another sub which I will do soon. It is PACKED with clues and people of interest.</p>
<p>For example. THE WASHINGTON POST article on Loud Boyz  from Jan 19 pre-inaug</p>

<p>Music
Partying like there’s no tomorrow, Loud Boyz still hope for a better one
Further proof that our illogical world has fully submerged itself in Bizarro toilet waters: Loud Boyz have something in common with U2. The former are Washington’s leading punk hedonists. The latter are rock-and-roll’s most beloved altar boys. But as disparate as these groups are, they currently reside on the same planet, and that planet is a mess</p>
<p>THe WP was even nice enough to post this video </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/txYEASDulJs">https://youtu.be/txYEASDulJs</a> (sick fucks)</p>
<p>So it is safe to say that the pedo establishment loves the band Loud BOyz (compares them to U2???) seems they are the darlings of Comet and refers to &quot;all of there friends&quot;  more on that later.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to the Fentz (furries pedo arrest) and Christopher HOlland and the clues on the Fairfax Underground page from Make the Connection &amp; Code Cracker. I will start another sub on Loud Boyz connection to Comet, Sahsa Lord and ultimately POdesta.</p>

&quot;It all started right behind Andy’s Pizza in Woodhaven and ended on West Road - with that pizza delivery driver being thrown from a moving vehicle.Christopher Holland is lucky to be alive after trying to stop a thief from stealing his cell phone.
Surveillance video from Tuesday night captured in the back parking lot of Andy’s Pizza in Woodhaven shows a pretty clear image of the guy police are looking for...&quot;

            "It all started right behind Andy’s Pizza in Woodhaven and ended on West Road - with that pizza delivery driver being thrown from a moving vehicle.Christopher Holland is lucky to be alive after trying to stop a thief from stealing his cell phone.
Surveillance video from Tuesday night captured in the back parking lot of Andy’s Pizza in Woodhaven shows a pretty clear image of the guy police are looking for..."

            HERE IS A COMMENT FROM CHRIS HOLLAND DEFENDING  PIZZAGATE CLAIMS 
Chris Holland MARCH 2, 2017 
Talking about making fools of ones' selves, you might consider reading news from actual local sources in Sweden. I'm no fan of the media's mis-quoting trump on terror attacks because i agree there that he didn't technically, reference a specific terror attack. With this said, Horowitz's "documentary", as most documentaries do, has a clear bias. What separates good documentaries from bad documentaries, is how well they support their bias with reliable &amp; accurate sources. Horowitz's documentary falls in the latter category:
           </p>
           <p>
            AND THEN CHRIS HOLLAND POSTS A HIT PIECE ON THIS:
Swedish Fox News cops hit out at filmmaker: 'He is a madman'
            <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20170220/swedish-fox-news-cops-hit-out-at-filmmaker-ami-horowitz-he-is-a-madman">
             http://www.thelocal.se/20170220/swedish-fox-news-cops-hit-out-at-filmmaker-ami-horowitz-he-is-a-madman
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            SO WHO IS CHRIS HOLLAND? WHAT IS HIS CONNECTION TO PODESTA/CLINTON/PIZZAGATE? WHY IS HE DEFENDING AND POSTING SOROS BACK MSM HITS? DIGGING

             Everybody's got a hobby
Everybody's got a schtick
Please, consider me eccentric
Don't think of me as sick.
            </p>
            <p>
             Didn't mean to spoil your party
Didn't mean to be uncool
But I'm standing here holding
The genitalia of a fool.
            </p>
            <p>
             'Cause I thought if I exposed myself, you'd fall in love with me
But when I burst in to my chagrin, you had company.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm afraid I've shown your family
The wrong kind of family jewels
'Cause I'm standing here holding
The genitalia of a fool.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, I guess the show is over
So I'll just go on home
I'll pack my prize possession
It's the nicest thing I own.
            </p>
            <p>
             Didn't mean to scare the children
Or make your grandma drool
But I'm standing here holding
The genitalia of a fool.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I pray that you'll forgive me and try to understand
But I'm afraid you'll always picture me with my whole world in my hands.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I'll go through life just wondering
How fate could be so cruel
Left me standing here holding
The genitalia of a fool.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now I wish that you were holding
The genitalia of this fool.

             I found Jools Holland and some wierd pedo shit. his twin brother is a keyboard player and child star. could this be the same chris holland that we are talking about. I am not yet sure but it appears to link in. Anything else you can add since you are familiar with this guy, his band (with high level connections) and possibly a link to Lost Boyz band that played at Comet Pizza in an anti-pizzagate bash on Jan 19 2017 (promoted by Sasha Lord)  Is this the same guy that interviewed Ken Fenske of Fensys Ltd (aka - the furry guy who rapes children).  there is so much here, but what is the link?

              Jools Holland is famous in the UK. He has his own TV show here where he invites artists to play... usually blues etc. I've always found him to be arrogant... very self absorbed. Although that doesn't constitute calling him a pedo without seeing evidence of it. Can you tell me where you found this stuff? I will have a dig

            Hi, this is my first post, so I may be all over the place and you may have covered this.
John Podesta is a member of the American Solar Energy Society.

           </p>
           <p>
            Ken Fenske's Anapode Solar says they are part of a company called FenSys Ltd. that does computing work. And even though FenSys Ltd. doesn't have a website, the archived Anapode site says "Anapode ships nationally from our warehouses in California, Colorado, New York and Pennsylvania. Corporate headquarters is located in lovely but cloudy Pennsylvania so we know how to make solar work in a marginal solar location." Warehouses? All over the country? For a high-tech start-up that appears to do solar on the side. And FenSys Ltd. is called a "high tech start-up" according to a Google search but they don't have a website. The Anapode site says:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Anapode Solar is a division of FenSys Ltd., founded in 1995, and provides a wide variety of solar products for commercial and residential solar photovoltaic installations. We also provide systems engineering and design services on a consulting basis."
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a creepy picture from the FenSys Ltd., search on Google. Guy's got an animal costume on, and two kids are looking at the skeleton of a horse. Just disturbing, no nudity.
            <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&amp;pb=!1s0x89c42303d8c08e43:0xa54c29ff4f24bb83!2m19!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m13!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!3m1!7e115!4s//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1qGmjGi1hgs/WAPbndHc4aI/AAAAAAAAAMw/SBnFZX8SUXMfhByTJnjMrpOzR7Qc9CYXACLIB/s284-k-no/!5sFenSys+Ltd.+-+Google+Search&amp;imagekey=!1e3!2s-1qGmjGi1hgs/WAPbndHc4aI/AAAAAAAAAMw/SBnFZX8SUXMfhByTJnjMrpOzR7Qc9CYXACLIB&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE7L6pssDSAhXBzFQKHQUKC2oQoioIWjAK">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If you search Google images for FenSys Ltd. I found this on Foursquare - chickens?:
            <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/fensys-ltd/4ba76ab8f964a5202d9239e3/photos">
             https://foursquare.com/v/fensys-ltd/4ba76ab8f964a5202d9239e3/photos
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And they said that Fenske dressed as a fox, which explains this:
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=FenSys+Ltd.&amp;rlz=1C1AOHY_enUS708US708&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigqb3As8DSAhWpq1QKHXq_BzUQ_AUICygE&amp;biw=1239&amp;bih=710#imgrc=-7eLYywoqo73cM:">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the Podesta/Pizzagate/Fenske link is the Solar Power/Green industry? Maybe that's why the elite are obsessed with "Green" energy and Climate Change. Lot's of money moving around and disappearing into it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also appears Fenske bought a Tesla for some sort of project which caused them to drive all over the country? Not good. Where did they get the money? Base price on a Tesla is $79,500 (and of course they had to add chickens in the video).

            Just a thought. I'll explore further.

            I did a quick search on the name Christopher Holland looking for a writer.  I don't know if this guy is the one that wrote the article about Comet Ping Pong but this brIef synopsis is kind of bizarre of him.  The very last line of the paragraph said that "he believes HOTDOGS ARE NOT SANDWICHES." [Emphasis added.]

             ** "Sexual Fantasy and Human Mating Strategies," **
             <strong>
              Holland's previous McNair research project, conducted during the summer after his sophomore year, focused on psychological attachment between humans and their pets, especially cats and dogs.
             </strong>
             "I was talking about pets one day with some friends, and we started arguing whether cats or dogs were better pets," said Holland. "That led me to wonder why certain people develop these interspecies bonds, and others don't."
As he did on the more recent project, Holland also used surveys to collect the necessary data about people and their pets. He concluded that people with certain psychodynamic attachment styles are more likely to form strong emotional connections with their pets.

            <p>
             Here Chris HOlland is referred to as "Satans Little Helper" at a Tween Movie Fest - sounds like a small group, lots of drugs and total sickos. Chris HOlland appears to be a star attendee...

             " T-Fest involves people spending the day planted on their asses while watching crappy movies and scarfing snacks full of fat, sugar, and chemicals most people can’t pronounce, much less identify. At least we’re in a climate-controlled building.  We may be self-abusive to a frightening degree, but we’re not insaâ€“no, wait, we sat through Funky Forest.  Well,we’re self-abusive, but not suicidal."   At least not until after Chris Holland’s picks, at any rate.
 All the luminaries were thereâ€“Mr. Kenneth Begg, High Priest of Jabootu; Mr. Sandy Petersen, the Gamesmaster, as well as his son and the son’s wife (not girlfriend) and two other sons as wellâ€“my apologies to all involved for forgetting them the first go-round; Mr. Chris Holland, Satan’s Little Helper; and Dr. Freex, the man, myth, and legend (along with, unless I’m mistaken, Freex Jr.)  ..." it goes on. there is so much pedo shit here i cant even sort it all...
            </p>
            <p>
             IS CHRIS HOLLAND SATANS LITTLE HELPER / FILM MAKER or a KNOX Graduate WHO WRITES ABOUT SEX FANTASIES WITH ANIMALS??? Perhaps the son of the other Holland?

Hi, I'm Alex. I've been in the film industry for over 20 years and have worked on over 1000 feature films, shorts, commercials, music videos, network promos, documentaries and webisodes. My personal films have been screened in 600+ film festivals around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many filmmakers have walked through my doors over the years and I have had the pleasure of a front row seat to see how all these projects start and finish. I've worked with Sundance and Academy Award™ winners as well as the beginning film student. Some projects make it and many never see the light of day.
            </p>
            <p>
             You'll find my approach to my courses a bit raw and real. That's because I care about my students, fellow artists and filmmakers. I've seen and personally made many missteps over the years and I want to help you avoid making the same costly mistakes. The industry is abusive to the new comer and I hope I can help you navigate the shark infested waters.

The cost of responding to a discovery request can be in the millions of dollars if several years' worth of archived e-mail
and files must be located, restored, sorted through, and cleansed to remove nonrelevant confidential material [Sleek, 2000]. Those costs are often in the millions
of dollars. At the extreme, Chief of Staff John Podesta estimated the cost of the effort to reconstruct, retrieve and analyze e-mail related to the Monica Lewinsky case to be $11.7 million [Streza, 2003].

              Yeah the one I found was the guy from UDemy. He made the statement about hotdogs were not sandwiches. Reading your latest finds those movies you outlined have a lot of canabalism  crap in the movies.  The UDemy guy is I think 57 yrs old so maybe more in age frame of Podesta.

            FURRY MEDIA GROUP COMMENTS
Going by the reports, five people have been arrested as part of investigations into a child sex ring: Kenneth Fenske (LupineFox), David Parker, Jeffrey Harvey, Craig Knox and Stephen Taylor.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             It is not immediately clear how many of them, other than LupineFox, are furries, but an another report in the Philadelphia Enquirer mentions Craig Knox "who had a rottweiler costume and nine rottweiler dogs at his Henrico, Va., home - admitted having a years-long sexual attraction to young boys and dogs".
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              I managed to get a quick look at Lupine's FA and FB accounts last night after seeing the story, looked like people were already sending him death threats. He took down both accounts about an hour after I looked at them, but before he took down the FA account he made a post saying the accusation is a lie and that he was not guilty.
             </em>
            </strong>

           </p>
           <p>
            I hope we find out he's innocent, I only met the guy once so don't know much of anything about him past that encounter. I also know he'd employed at least one friend of mine for awhile through his business. It's hard to tell one way or another, on the one hand I could see furries doing this sort of shit and on the other I can also see furries creating a lie to destroy someone.
EDIT: But reading more updated details on this case... kinda making it hard to believe in the innocence possibility ^.^;;;
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I'm hoping the story stays buried, I perform at a number of charity events with my fursuit and don't want to see that jeopardized by disgusting stuff like this.

legendary Nancy. Chris gave up a promising 
athletic career in basketball and track to en- 
hance the company intramural teams and his 
own rack time. Wherever Chris' sore hip and 
color blindness leads him, he can be counted on 
to do an outstanding job and obtain many last- 
ing friendships, as well as always be loving it.
