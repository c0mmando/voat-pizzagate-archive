<h2>Cardinal Donald Wuerl’s resignation was accepted by the Vatican on Friday after months of mounting pressure, following revelations of systematic abuse by priests in the state of Pennsylvania, and a cover-up by bishops. Wuerl was bishop of Pittsburgh from 1988 to 2006.</h2>
<p>\'The archbishop of Washington has become the most senior figure in the Catholic church to quit in the sexual abuse scandal that has engulfed the Vatican and embroiled Pope Francis.</p>
<h1>The state’s attorney general, Josh Shapiro, said Wuerl “oversaw and participated in the cover-up”.</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Wuerl offered his resignation when he turned 75 almost three years ago, as required under canon law, but Pope Francis kept him in post. He resubmitted his resignation last month.</p>
<p>In a statement, he said his departure “permits this local church to move forward”, adding: “Once again, for any past errors in judgment, I apologise and ask for pardon.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I\'m sure the apology will help victims tremendously. /s</em></p>
<h1></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>**In an emollient letter accepting Wuerl’s resignation, Pope Francis said: “You have sufficient elements to ‘justify’ your actions and distinguish between what it means to cover up crimes or not to deal with problems, and to commit some mistakes.\' </p>
<p><em>Err....what?! \'Sufficient elements to justify\' his actions? It\'s \'not to deal with problems\' now, not a cover-up? Some mistakes? Gosh, the Pope should really consider to just shut up. On the other hand, here as in other statements, his true colours show.</em></p>
<p>“However, your nobility has led you not to choose this way of defence. Of this, I am proud and thank you.”</p>
<p><em>He dares to speak of nobility?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in a move likely to anger abuse survivors, <strong>the pontiff said Wuerl would stay on as the archdiocese’s caretaker until the appointment of his successor. He is also expected to remain a cardinal, helping appoint US bishops and choose Francis’s successor.</strong></p>
<p><em>Note to anyone who puts hope that a potential axing of Francis will change things for the better: Please read the last sentence carefully. That he will remain a Cardinal is a slap in the face of abuse survivors.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wuerl had attempted to downplay his role in the cover-up of sexual abuse in the state, which was set out in graphic detail in a grand jury report.</strong></p>
<h2>The report said he had approved transfers for abusers rather than removing them from ministry, and had withheld information when priests were reported to police and other authorities. He also offered financial support to priests accused of child sexual abuse.</h2>
<p>Responding to the report, the cardinal said he had “acted with diligence, with concern for the victims and to prevent future acts of abuse”. <em>Concern for the victims - yeah, right. /s</em></p>
<p><strong>There was also widespread scepticism over his insistence that he knew nothing about years of alleged sexual misconduct by his predecessor as archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick.</strong></p>
<p>McCarrick resigned as a cardinal in July after he was accused of the sexual abuse of two children, following decades of rumours about sexual misconduct with trainee priests. McCarrick, 88, denied the charges.</p>
<p>In August, a retired Vatican diplomat [Archbishop Vigano] released an incendiary 11-page letter claiming Francis had known of abuse allegations against McCarrick from 2013 but failed to take action.</p>
<p>Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, 77, a former Vatican ambassador to the US and a conservative within the church, said the pope knew the former archbishop “was a corrupt man, [but] he covered for him to the bitter end”.</p>
<p>Viganò named a string of cardinals and archbishops who he said also knew about the claims. Calling on the pope to resign, he said: “Corruption has reached the very top of the church’s hierarchy.”</p>
<p>The letter galvanised Francis’s many enemies within the church and unleashed a torrent of accusations and personal attacks.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>A recent survey of US Catholics by Pew Research Center found confidence in the pope’s handling of the sexual abuse crisis had plummeted.</p>
<p>More than one-third of Catholics believe the pope is doing a “poor” job on the issue of sexual abuse – three times the proportion in 2015.</p>
<p>The proportion of Catholics who have a generally favourable opinion of Francis has fallen by 12 points this year, down to roughly 70%. Only 30% say they have a “very favourable” view of the pope.</p>
<p><strong>Since the publication of the Pennsylvania grand jury report, at least 13 US states have opened official investigations.</strong></p>

            Catholic dogma is masturbation is a venal sin...pedophelia is a mistake. Think masturbation used to be an even worse sin...this should take away their tax exempt status and label them as a criminal organization.

            Does Skippy or Tony have any connections to Wuerl? Both powerful men, both wannabe Catholics, both at least tolerant of paedophilia.  Skippy has a couple groups to push liberal politics on the Church.

            Here is another article from Church Militant
            <a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/wuerl-gone">
             https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/wuerl-gone
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            AND this one
            <a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/wuerl-out">
             https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/wuerl-out
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Pope Francis is saying that Cdl. Donald Wuerl's actions in protecting predator priests — actions that destroyed the spiritual lives of many and the physical lives of some — were justified as simply "mistakes" made in good faith.
           </p>
           <p>
            In his letter accepting the resignation of Wuerl as archbishop of Washington, D.C., Francis said in a letter Friday, "You have sufficient elements to 'justify' your actions and distinguish between what it means to cover up crimes or not to deal with problems, and to commit some mistakes."
            <strong>
             mistakes?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            When Pope Francis says Wuerl can "justify" these moral crimes, which he then writes off as mere "mistakes," he's not aiding Wuerl to make the acts of contrition that are necessary for Wuerl to confess and be absolved from these sins of his. By seemingly downplaying the gravity of these sins and Wuerl's moral culpability for them, he is thereby participating in these sins.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains the ways in which a person may participate in the sins of another in paragraph 1868.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6D.HTM">
             http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6D.HTM
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Sin is a personal act. Moreover, we have a responsibility for the sins committed by others when we cooperate in them:
           </p>
           <p>
            by participating directly and voluntarily in them; 
by ordering, advising, praising or approving them; 
by not disclosing or not hindering them when we have an obligation to do so; 
by protecting evil-doers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The greatest concern of each Catholic is always the salvation of his own soul and the souls of others, which include his enemies. The faithful, therefore, must pray especially hard for the wolves in shepherd's clothing so they receive the grace of contrition necessary to be absolved from their sins before having to give an account to the Good Shepherd of scattering the very sheep they had pledged to shepherd.
           </p>
           <p>
            Imo the  pope has stirred up another hornet's nest.   Read the comments after the article.  Here are two.
           </p>
           <p>
            This. Bergoglio promoted Weurl for one reason: it gives him more influence to break the Church in the US. He can, and will, elevate bishops like Weurl to rich sees.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this letter the single most diabolical document to come out of the Francis papacy? He literally used the word 'justify' to approve of the actions of someone who aided and abetted child molesters.

               Yes. Francis doesn't even try to hide it, does he? Although I'm totally pessimistic regarding a potential successor (whoever will be elected will likely be as bad as Francis, even if it's a conservative), I can't wait to see him resigning.

                I am sitting on the fence right now.  I don't know how this will end.  If Catholics don't get out in the street, he will stay, unless something Really Big comes out.  God, this is horrible.  I will look like Venus de Milo by the time it's all over. Nail biting.

            I'm glad that guy has had to resign. Disgusted he is still a cardinal. However, at 78 years old, he's only got two more years left before he's not allowed to vote for a papal successor anyway (cutoff is 80).

             I wonder if he will still be allowed to be on the Board of the Papal Foundation when he turns 80.  Another job until death?  I hope not. He is another one that gets to vote yes whenever the pope holds his hand out.  The last request was for $25M.  He got it.
