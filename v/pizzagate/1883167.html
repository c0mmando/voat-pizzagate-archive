            As a Catholic who has followed this stuff closely for a while now, I'm going to present some facts that a lot of people here probably haven't heard and probably won't like.
           </p>
           <p>
            The vast majority of these cases occurred between the 1960's and 1980's.  In most instances, the presiding bishop presented the case to the police and the police advised them that it was an internal church issue.  The prevailing psychology of the time said to move the offenders out of the situation so they would be less likely to offend again; this is why you see bishops moving these priests around.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only about 3% pf priests have been accused of abuse, and of that 3%, only a small percentage has been convicted. Also, almost 95% of these cases were hebephilia and not pedophilia. No, this isn't splitting hairs, because one involves sexually mature individuals and the other involves actual children.  Yes, both are wrong, but it is an important distinction.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this is detailed in the John Jay report.  The one thing I disagree with in that report is that they claim that these were crimes of opportunity and that homosexuality played no role. The non-PC truth is that homosexuals were being admitted to the priesthood in larger numbers beginning in the 1940s (the communist infiltration of the Church played a role in this); so much so that Pope John XXIII wrote a letter to the seminaries requesting that they stop admitting homosexual seminarians. Homosexuals also have a higher incidence of abusing minors, so it's probable that this played a role in the scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            So there's that. Sorry if it ruins the narrative that all priests are pedos, but it's all evidentiary, so feel free to fact check at will.

              That's true, but the cases being prosecuted now are generally from the latter half of the 20th century.

             Never said all priests are pedos. In fact, I intimated the opposite, hence my statement about priests, teachers, cops dont become pedofiles, but pedofiles become those things. The majority of people in those professions would never hurt a child, but how does one know who is part of the 3% and who is not? It's not worth a child's safety to take the chance that a priest or teacher or whomever is part of the 97% percent who wouldnt and the 3% who will.
            </p>
            <p>
             Btw, I know of a few Protestant ministers who have sexually abused children.

            Are there any studies out there on percentages of pedophiles and/or child molesters  within these groups versus the general population. If significantly higher then maybe one place to start addressing this problem is at the employment application stage via psychological questionaires,  deeper background checks, etc.

             Google teachers or coaches committing suicide because of sex abuse allegations and note how long alot of them have been operating in different schools. Moving around to different schools is a tell. Thankfully, school boards are becoming more aware.

              School boards are a safe place for successful pedophiles. Parent Teacher Association is another safe bet..
Of course, the strategic member(s) of local courts and police force must be established before the exploitation can continue in relative obscurity.
But this can only work if social services and "strategic" medical personnel can suppress incriminating evidence.
That is why the privacy of children is so important, it hides the truth.

             I agree. I dont have experience with Catholic church but I do with public school system and the same problem exists. In Tx, teachers are on yearly contracts that must renew every year. If a school breaks a teacher's contract for any reason, they must pay out the rest of the contract. Most schools dont have the money to pay out one contract while paying a new teacher to take the old teachers place, so they usually take a "just leave our district and we wont contact LE" approach.  I know 4 separate cases where school systems did not renew contract of accused teacher, did not report to LE, and when the accused teacher applied at another school and that school called for reference, the standard answer is something along the lines of "nothing documented in their personnel file" which was true, but it was true because the school didnt document it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Said teacher can just move from school to school and when background checks are done, nothing comes up because no charges ever filed.
            </p>
            <p>
             As far as I'm concerned, those school systems should have been charged with aiding and abetting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thankfully, that process is beginning to change as awareness is being raised.

              I believe our campaign is having an effect on some people.  They may not believe all of it, but they are paying attention to the sexual abuse and sex trafficking numbers . We must keep hammering that part of it home for that will start the ball rolling.  The rest may come later.
