<p>Those close to this disgraced former A- list mostly television actress from a long running hit show know the identity of the person footing the bill for legal services in exchange for sex. He has got some very big pockets and is close to some other people who also are in need of legal services for the same issue. What people didn\'t know is who is the second person she has been hooking up with. The guy she says she wants to be with forever. No one has seen him. It is a jaw dropper. Apparently it is one of the people that was investigating her. Not sure if the person is local or federal. It seems like a huge conflict of interest regardless of their jurisdiction.</p>
