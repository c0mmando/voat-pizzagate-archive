            As conscientes objectors, JW’s are especially reviled by militant regimes because they refuse to take up arms and kill other humans. They are especially resolute in their unity worldwide, unlike virtually every other major religion (many of which actively encourage their followers to fight each other over invisible lines of nationality).
           </p>
           <p>
            Soviet Union:
Jehovah's Witnesses did not have a significant presence in the Soviet Union prior to 1939 when the Soviet Union forcibly incorporated eastern Poland, Moldavia, and Lithuania, each of which had a Jehovah's Witness movement. Although never large in number (estimated by the KGB to be 20,000 in 1968), the Jehovah's Witnesses became one of the most persecuted religious groups in the Soviet Union during the post-World War II era. Members were arrested or deported; some were put in Soviet concentration camps. Witnesses in Moldavian SSR were deported to Tomsk Oblast; members from other regions of the Soviet Union were deported to Irkutsk Oblast. KGB officials, who were tasked with dissolving the Jehovah's Witness movement, were disturbed to discover that the Witnesses continued to practice their faith even within the labor camps.
The Minister of Internal Affairs, Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov proposed the deportation of the Jehovah's Witnesses to Stalin in October 1950. A resolution was voted by the Council of Minister and an order was issued by the Ministry for State Security in March 1951. The Moldavian SSR passed a decree "on the confiscation and selling of the property of individuals banished from the territory of the Moldavian SSR", which included the Jehovah's Witnesses.
In April 1951, over 9,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were deported to Siberia under a plan called "Operation North".
Importation of Jehovah's Witnesses' literature into the Soviet Union was strictly forbidden, and Soviet Jehovah's Witnesses received their religious literature from Brooklyn illegally. Literature from Brooklyn arrived regularly, through well-organized unofficial channels, not only in many cities, but also in Siberia, and even in the penal camps of Potma. The Soviet government was so disturbed by the Jehovah's Witnesses that the KGB was authorized to send agents to infiltrate the Brooklyn headquarters.
In September 1965, a decree of the Presidium of the USSR Council of Ministers canceled the "special settlement" restriction of Jehovah's Witnesses, though the decree, signed by Anastas Mikoyan, stated that there would be no compensation for confiscated property. However, Jehovah's Witnesses remained the subject of state persecution due to their ideology being classified as anti-Soviet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Turkmenistan:
The United Nations Human Rights Committee has indicated that Jehovah's Witnesses in Turkmenistan have been prosecuted and imprisoned for refusing to perform compulsory military service, despite Turkmenistan's constitution guaranteeing the right to "practice any religion alone or in association with others" and the right to "freedom of conviction and the free expression of those convictions". The UN committee noted, "The State party should take all necessary measures to review its legislation with a view to providing for alternative military service. The State party should also ensure that the law clearly stipulates that individuals have the right to conscientious objection to military service. Furthermore, the State party should halt all prosecutions of individuals who refuse to perform military service on grounds of conscience and release those individuals who are currently serving prison sentences."
According to the US Department of State, Turkmenistan's Ministry of Justice described Jehovah's Witnesses as foreign and dangerous. The US State Department also stated that the Turkmenistan government imposes restrictions on the freedom of Jehovah's Witness parents (and members of various other religious groups) to raise their children in accordance with their religious beliefs. In 2003, Witnesses' religious literature was confiscated, members of Jehovah's Witnesses were denied exit visas, and others were stopped after crossing a border and forced to return. In 2004, five Jehovah's Witnesses were stopped and prevented from boarding a flight to another country because their names where included on a "black list" of citizens prohibited from leaving the country. In 2015, a Jehovah's Witness in Turkmenistan was sentenced to four years in prison for allegedly inciting hatred at a religious meeting held in a private home, and other attendees were fined.

            United States:
Main article: Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States
During the 1930s and 1940s, some US states passed laws that made it illegal for Jehovah's Witnesses to distribute their literature, and children of Jehovah's Witnesses in some states were banned from attending state schools.
           </p>
           <p>
            The persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses for their refusal to salute the flag became known as the "Flag-Salute Cases". Their refusal to salute the flag became considered as a test of the liberties for which the flag stands, namely the freedom to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience. The Supreme Court found that the United States, by making the flag salute compulsory in Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940), was impinging upon the individual's right to worship as one chooses — a violation of the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause in the constitution. Justice Frankfurter, speaking in behalf of the 8-to-1 majority view against the Witnesses, stated that the interests of "inculcating patriotism was of sufficient importance to justify a relatively minor infringement on religious belief."[102] The result of the ruling was a wave of persecution. Lillian Gobitas, the mother of the schoolchildren involved in the decision said, "It was like open season on Jehovah's Witnesses."[103]
           </p>
           <p>
            The American Civil Liberties Union reported that by the end of 1940, "more than 1,500 Witnesses in the United States had been victimized in 335 separate attacks".[104] Such attacks included beatings, being tarred and feathered, hanged, shot, maimed, and even castrated, as well as other acts of violence.[105] As reports of these attacks against Jehovah's Witnesses continued, "several justices changed their minds, and in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), the Court declared that the state could not impinge on the First Amendment by compelling the observance of rituals."[102]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1943, after a drawn-out litigation process by Watch Tower Society lawyers in state courts and lower federal courts, the Supreme Court ruled that public school officials could not force Jehovah's Witnesses and other students to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.[106] In 1946 and 1953 Supreme Court decisions were handed down establishing their right to be exempted from military service.

            And some more, all from modern times:
           </p>
           <p>
            Russian Federation:
Russian anti-extremism laws were extended to non-violent groups in 2007 and Jehovah’s Witnesses have been officially banned from the port city of Taganrog since 2009, after a local court ruled the organisation guilty of inciting religious hatred by "propagating the exclusivity and supremacy" of their religion. On December 8, 2009 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the ruling of the lower courts which pronounced 34 pieces of Jehovah's Witness literature extremist, including their magazine The Watchtower, in the Russian language. Jehovah's Witnesses claim that this ruling affirms a misapplication of a federal law on anti-extremism. The ruling upheld the confiscation of property of Jehovah's Witnesses in Taganrog, and may set a precedent for similar cases in other areas of Russia, as well as placing literature of Jehovah's Witnesses on a list of literature unacceptable throughout Russia. The chairman of the presiding committee of the Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, Vasily Kalin, said: "I am very concerned that this decision will open a new era of opposition against Jehovah's Witnesses, whose right to meet in peace, to access religious literature and to share the Christian hope contained in the Gospels, is more and more limited." On December 1, 2015 a Rostov Regional Court convicted 16 Jehovah's Witnesses of practising extremism in Taganrog, with five given 5 1⁄2-year suspended sentences and the remainder issued fines they were not required to pay.
On May 5, 2015, customs authorities in Russia seized a shipment of religious literature containing Ossetian-language Bibles published by Jehovah's Witnesses. Russian customs officials in the city of Vyborg held up a shipment of 2,013 Russian-language copies of Bibles on July 13, 2015. Customs authorities confiscated three of the Bibles, sent them to an "expert" to study the Bibles to determine whether they contained "extremist" language, and impounded the rest of the shipment. On July 21, 2015, the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice added Jehovah's Witnesses' official website to the Federal List of Extremist Materials thereby making it a criminal offense to promote the website from within the country and requiring internet providers throughout Russia to block access to the site.
           </p>
           <p>
            Singapore:
In 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses on the grounds that its members refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the flag, or swear oaths of allegiance to the state. Singapore has banned all written materials (including Bibles) published by the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, both publishing arms of the Jehovah's Witnesses. A person in possession of banned literature can be fined up to S$2,000 (US$1,333) and jailed up to 12 months for a first conviction. In February 1995, Singapore police raided private homes where group members were holding religious meetings, in an operation codenamed "Operation Hope". Officers seized Bibles, religious literature, documents and computers, and eventually brought charges against 69 Jehovah's Witnesses, many of whom went to jail. In March 1995, 74-year-old Yu Nguk Ding was arrested for carrying two "undesirable publications"—one of them a Bible printed by the Watch Tower Society.
In 1996, eighteen Jehovah's Witnesses were convicted for unlawfully meeting in a Singapore apartment and were given sentences from one to four weeks in jail. Canadian Queen's Counsel Glen How flew to Singapore to defend the Jehovah's Witnesses and argued that the restrictions against the Jehovah's Witnesses violated their constitutional rights. Then-Chief Justice Yong Pung How questioned How's sanity, accused him of "living in a cartoon world" and referred to "funny, cranky religious groups" before denying the appeal. In 1998, two Jehovah's Witnesses were charged in a Singapore court for possessing and distributing banned religious publications.
In 1998 a Jehovah's Witness lost a lawsuit against a government school for wrongful dismissal for refusing to sing the national anthem or salute the flag. In March 1999, the Court of Appeals denied his appeal. In 2000, public secondary schools indefinitely suspended at least fifteen Jehovah's Witness students for refusing to sing the national anthem or participate in the flag ceremony. In April 2001, one public school teacher, also a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, resigned after being threatened with dismissal for refusing to participate in singing the national anthem. Singapore authorities have seized Jehovah's Witnesses' literature on various occasions from individuals attempting to cross the Malaysia–Singapore border. In thirteen cases, authorities warned the Jehovah's Witnesses, but did not press charges. As of 2015, there are 19 members of Jehovah's Witnesses incarcerated for refusal to carry out mandatory military service. The initial sentence for failure to comply is 15 months' imprisonment, with an additional 24 months for a second refusal. Failure to perform annual military reserve duty, which is required of all those who have completed their initial two-year obligation, results in a 40-day sentence, with a 12-month sentence after four refusals. There is no alternative civilian service for Jehovah's Witnesses.

            Here is some more that indicates why they may be wary of arrest:
           </p>
           <p>
            Georgia:
In 1996, one year after Georgia adopted its post-USSR Constitution, the country's Ministry of Internal Affairs began a campaign to detain tons of religious literature belonging to Jehovah's Witnesses. Government officials refused permits for Jehovah's Witnesses to organize assemblies, and law enforcement officials dispersed legal assemblies. In September 2000, "Georgian police and security officials fired blank anti-tank shells and used force to disperse an outdoor gathering of some 700 Jehovah's Witnesses in the town of Natuliki in northwestern Georgia on 8 September, AP and Caucasus Press reported." In cases when the instigators were formally charged, prosecution was impeded by a lack of cooperation by government and law enforcement. In 2004, Forum 18 News Service referred to the period since 1999 as a "five-year reign of terror" against Jehovah's Witnesses and certain other religious minorities. Amnesty International noted: "Jehovah's Witnesses have frequently been a target for violence … in Georgia … In many of the incidents police are said to have failed to protect the believers, or even to have participated in physical and verbal abuse." Individual Witnesses have fled Georgia seeking religious refugee status in other nations. On May 3, 2007, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against the government of Georgia for its toleration of religious violence toward Jehovah's Witnesses and ordered the victims be compensated for moral damages and legal costs.
On October 7, 2014, The European Court of Human Rights, giving its judgement concerning violence against Jehovah’s Witnesses in Georgia in the years 2000-2001, unanimously held that Georgia’s state officials, in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, Articles 3, 9 &amp;14, had either directly participated in those attacks or had tolerated violence by private individuals against members of this religious group.

           <p>
            Germany:
Main article: Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany
During 1931 and 1932, more than 2000 legal actions were instigated against Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany and members of the religion were dismissed from employment. Persecution intensified following Adolf Hitler's appointment as chancellor in 1933 and continued until 1945. A "Declaration of Facts" was issued at a Jehovah's Witness convention in Berlin on June 25, 1933, asserting the religion's political neutrality and calling for an end to government opposition. More than 2.1 million copies of the statement were distributed throughout Germany, but its distribution prompted a new wave of persecution against German Witnesses, whose refusal to give the Hitler salute, join Nazi organizations or perform military service demonstrated their opposition to the nationalist and totalitarian ideologies of National Socialism. On October 4, 1934, congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany sent telegrams of protest and warning to Hitler. According to one eyewitness account Hitler was shown a number of telegrams protesting against the Third Reich's persecution of the Bible Students. The eyewitness, Karl Wittig, reported: "Hitler jumped to his feet and with clenched fists hysterically screamed: 'This brood will be exterminated in Germany!' Four years after this discussion I was able, by my own observations, to convince myself … that Hitler's outburst of anger was not just an idle threat. No other group of prisoners of the named concentration-camps was exposed to the sadism of the SS-soldiery in such a fashion as the Bible Students were. It was a sadism marked by an unending chain of physical and mental tortures, the likes of which no language in the world can express." About 10,000 Witnesses were imprisoned, including 2000 sent to concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1200 died, including 250 who were executed. From 1935 Gestapo officers offered members a document to sign indicating renouncement of their faith, submission to state authority, and support of the German military. Historian Detlef Garbe says a "relatively high number" of people signed the statement before the war, but "extremely low numbers" of Bible Student prisoners did so in concentration camps in later years.bDespite more than a century of conspicuous activity in the country, Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany were not granted legal recognition until March 25, 2005, in Berlin; in 2006 Germany's Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG) in Leipzig extended the local decision to apply nationwide.

            India    :
Jehovah's Witnesses' Office of Public Information has documented a number of mob attacks in India. It states that these instances of violence "reveal the country's hostility toward its own citizens who are Christians." There have been reports that police assist mob attacks on Jehovah's Witnesses or lay charges against the Witnesses while failing to charge other participants involved.bIn the city of Davangere on December 20, 2010 a mob confronted two female Witnesses. The mob broke into the home of one of the Witnesses where they had taken refuge. Property was damaged and one of the Witnesses was assaulted. When the police arrived, the Witnesses were arrested and charged with blasphemy. In another incident, on December 6, 2011, three Witnesses were attacked by a mob in Madikeri, in the state of Karnataka. The male Witness "was kicked and pummeled by the mob" and then the mob dragged them towards a nearby temple; while making lewd remarks, the mob "tried to tear the clothes off of the female Witnesses." According to the report, the police came and "took the three Witnesses to the police station and filed charges against them rather than the mob." During a July 2012 incident, a group of fifteen men assaulted four Witnesses in Madikeri. The group was taken to a police station and charged with "insulting the religion or religious beliefs of another class" before being released on bail.

            Malawi:
In 1967, thousands of Witnesses in Malawi were beaten by police and citizens for refusing to purchase political party cards and become members of the Malawi Congress Party. While their stand of not involving themselves in politics during the time of the old Colonial government was seen as an act of resistance their continued non-involvement with the new independent government was viewed as treasonous. The organization was declared illegal in the penal code and the foreign members in the country were expelled. Persecution, both economic and physical, was intensified after a September 1972 Malawi Congress Party meeting which stated, in part, that "all Witnesses should be dismissed from their employment; any firm that failed to comply would have its license cancelled." By November 1973 some 21,000 Jehovah's Witness had fled to the neighboring country of Zambia. In 1993, during the transition to a multiparty system and a change in leadership, the government's ban on the organization was lifted in the country.

           <p>
            Here is an excerpt that I keep on hand, culminated from some historical encyclopedias NOT affiliated with JWs:
           </p>
           <p>
            Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout Jehovah's Witnesses' history, their beliefs, doctrines, and practices have engendered controversy and opposition from local governments, communities, and religious groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to law professor Archibald Cox, in the United States, Jehovah's Witnesses were "the principal victims of religious persecution … they began to attract attention and provoke repression in the 1930s, when their proselytizing and numbers rapidly increased."
           </p>
           <p>
            Political and religious animosity against Jehovah's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries, including Cuba, the United States, Canada, Singapore, and Nazi Germany. The religion's doctrine of political neutrality has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription (for example in Britain during World War II and afterwards during the period of compulsory national service).
           </p>
           <p>
            During the World Wars, Jehovah's Witnesses were targeted in the United States, Canada, and many other countries for their refusal to serve in the military or help with war efforts. In Canada, Jehovah's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Japanese and Chinese descent. Activities of Jehovah's Witnesses have previously (and currently) been banned in the Soviet Union and in Spain, partly due to their refusal to perform military service. Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries, for example in Singapore, China, Vietnam and many Islamic states.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the journal, Social Compass, "Viewed globally, this persecution has been so persistent and of such an intensity that it would not be inaccurate to regard Jehovah's witnesses as the most persecuted religion of the twentieth century". Here are some examples from various nations:
           </p>
           <p>
            Benin:
During the first presidency of Mathieu Kérékou, activities of Jehovah's Witnesses were banned and members were forced to undergo "demystification training."
           </p>
           <p>
            Bulgaria:
In Bulgaria, Jehovah's Witnesses have been targets of violence by right wing nationalist groups such as the Bulgarian National Movement. On April 17, 2011, a group of about sixty hooded men carrying BMPO flags besieged a Kingdom Hall in Burgas, during the annual memorial of Christ's death. Attackers threw stones, damaged furniture, and injured at least five of the people gathered inside. The incident was recorded by a local television station. Jehovah's Witnesses in Bulgaria have been fined for proselytizing without proper government permits, and some municipalities have legislation prohibiting or restricting their rights to preach.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cuba:
Under Fidel Castro's communist regime, Jehovah's Witnesses were considered "social deviants", along with homosexuals, vagrants, and other groups, and were sent to forced labor concentration camps to be "reeducated". On July 1, 1974 the group was officially banned and their "churches" closed. Following the ban members who refused military service were imprisoned for sentences of three years and it was reported that members were also imprisoned because of their children's refusal to salute the flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            Canada:
Main article: Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Canada
During both world wars, Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted for abhorrence of patriotic exercises and conscientious objection to military service.
In 1984, Canada released a number of previously classified documents which revealed that in the 1940s, "able bodied young Jehovah's Witnesses" were sent to "camps", and "entire families who practiced the religion were imprisoned." The 1984 report stated, "Recently declassified wartime documents suggest [World War II] was also a time of officially sanctioned religious bigotry, political intolerance and the suppression of ideas. The federal government described Jehovah's Witnesses as subversive and offensive 'religious zealots' … in secret reports given to special parliamentarian committees in 1942." It concluded that, "probably no other organization is so offensive in its methods, working as it does under the guise of Christianity. The documents prepared by the justice department were presented to a special House of Commons committee by the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in an attempt to justify the outlawing of the organizations during the second world war."
           </p>
           <p>
            Eritrea:
In Eritrea, the government stripped Jehovah's Witnesses of their civil and political rights in 1994 after their refusal to engage in voting and military service. Members of all ages have been arrested for participating in religious meetings. On 24 September 1994, Paulos Eyassu, Negede Teklemariam, and Isaac Mogos were arrested, and remain imprisoned. More than 50 other Witnesses are also currently imprisoned, one since 2001. International rights groups are aware of the situation of Jehovah's Witnesses in Eritrea and have repeatedly called for Eritrean authorities to end the persecution.
           </p>
           <p>
            France:
See also: Jehovah's Witnesses and governments (France)
Prior to World War II, the French government banned the Association of Jehovah's Witnesses in France, and ordered that the French offices of the Watch Tower Society be vacated. After the war, Jehovah's Witnesses in France renewed their operations. In December 1952, France's Minister of the Interior banned The Watchtower magazine, citing its position on military service. The ban was lifted on November 26, 1974. In the 1990s and 2000s, the French government included Jehovah's Witnesses on its list of "cults", and governmental ministers made derogatory public statements about Jehovah's Witnesses. Despite its century of activity in the country, France's Ministry of Finance opposed official recognition of the religion; it was not until June 23, 2000 that France's highest administrative court, the Council of State, ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses qualify as a religion under French law. France's Ministry of the Interior sought to collect 60% of donations made to the religion's entities; Witnesses called the taxation "confiscatory" and appealed to the European Court of Human Rights.bOn June 30, 2011, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that France’s actions violated the religious freedom of Jehovah’s Witnesses by demanding 58 million euros in taxes.
Jehovah's Witnesses in France have reported hundreds of criminal attacks against their adherents and places of worship.
           </p>
           <p>
            French dependencies:
During the ban of the The Watchtower in France, publication of the magazine continued in various French territories. In French Polynesia, the magazine was covertly published under the name, La Sentinelle, though it was later learned that The Watchtower had not been banned locally. In Réunion, the magazine was published under the name, Bulletin intérieur.

             Thank you so much for all this research! Everything you said about your experience has been my same experience! We are all individuals and nothing like a cult . Never once have I felt pressured to give money or anything else . Finding out about the pagan origins of Christmas and Other secular holidays made it simple for me to stop celebrating them .  Jehovah's Witnesses IMO , are the most mild tempered loving people on the planet . Why do people hate that so much ? The teachings are directly from the Bible and promise a future where there will be no more evil on this earth . Why do people hate that message so
Much ?  If their teachings are more accurate, then why not do what Jesus told us to do at Matthew 24:14 ? Because other religions have tried to do what we do and have been unsuccessful.  I studied for 2 years before getting baptized . Funny thing is I quit celebrating holidays and birthdays right away because that all made perfect sense to me , so even if I never decided to get baptized, I would have never continued celebrating that stuff because I knew the truth about the origins and just couldn't do it .  Same with the blood thing . After diligent research on the subject , if I wasn't a JW I still would never put someone else's blood in my body . Why does this make people so mad as well ? We certainly want the best medical treatment for our loved ones . There are way safer alternatives that wouldn't be violating Gods laws. Why not choose the safer route?

              I think it’s understandable for people to be skeptical. That’s fine. I’m the same. If an ignorant person ignores their doctor, they can suffer tragic consequences. An informed person that makes a choice is prepared for those consequences and faces them whatever happens.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I have a chance to speak one-on-one about the blood issue, inevitably we get to those families that lost a little one and the doctor blames the blood issue. People get passionate about that, understandably. 3 things:
             </p>
             <p>
              1.we can’t know what really happened, because we weren’t there; and the doctor already has a ready made excuse to cover his own errors (the blood refusal).

                The organization does not pressure parents to make this choice for their kids. In fact the opposite, they make it clear that the choice is all theirs.

                The people in that case have INCREDIBLE faith in the resurrection, for sure. That impresses me a lot.

            Jehovah’s witnesses are fully informed about the disfellowshipping polices and the blood transfusion rule.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before anyone ever gets baptized, they consider these concepts thoroughly.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I learned that if I adopt the high standards that this organization tries to follow, and later reject them, I am subject to disfellowshipping. I was thoroughly warned. I did not have to request to get baptized. Nobody twisted my arm. Family and friends would have been scripturally obligated to respect me if I never chose to get baptized.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for blood, if you do research, you may discover that there exists an advanced type of surgery that is ‘bloodless’. There are whole hospitals that practice it. Ignoring the fact that very little of donated blood are tested for diseases or drugs, that drugs have all of the persons hormones, toxins and nutrition, and that the hospital can barely afford to collect, handle and preserve these fluids; as far as I have found no one has ever been disfellowshipped for failure to adhere to this policy. They would certainly lose s rice privileges, and possibly rebuked publicly (though each circumstance is unique).
           </p>
           <p>
            Parents are not obligated by the organization to apply it to their kids, though some have with tragic results. However, I have found at least two cases where the patient died from their injury, and the doctor conveniently blamed the patient’s religious beliefs. One a shooting, another a car accident. In both of those cases, the believer had willingly filled out the ‘no blood’ card themselves and requested assistance from the organization’s hospital assistance people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those supporters ONLY comes to the hospital f the believer asks for them, if they need help protecting their religious integrity from persistent, though often well-meaning doctors.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to your assertions about the governing body... a common ad hominem attack... please just let me share my own personal experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been a Witness for awhile now. I still don’t know or really care who the governing body is. They do not interfere in my worship of my creator AT ALL. I am a poor worshipper in a poor area. I have NEVER been asked for money. I ONLY receive love, respect and support from others in the congregation. I have never been ‘ordered’ to obey any command from them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody follows me around, or spies on me to see if I go to birthday parties. Nobody asks me what I do in private, in my bedroom. If I share something personal, they respect me. They confirmed that I believe as they do when I requested to be baptized, and it been a source of great joy and strength for me.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to the link you provided:
           </p>
           <p>
            You may not be aware of the Jehovah’s Witnesses that are currently imprisoned, in lands like South and North Korea, China, Eritrea, Russia and any Muslim nation. It’s a high number, I believe over 3,000. This is verifiable on their website and independently.
           </p>
           <p>
            I appreciate that you may not like JWs. I respect your feelings. However, I don’t agree with your assertions, obviously. That said, I cannot defend EVERY JW or congregation. I can’t even defend the governing body. There may be bad ones. On the whole, I have found it to be a very good organization composed of imperfect humans.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best I can do is share the benefit of my personal research into the matter, which I did (I feel) diligently.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the governing body, or the organization or my congregation were clamped down by the government, under any circumstances, under any report, I would continue to worship ,y creator in just the same way, because Of the hundreds of brothers and sister that I know to be fine people, and because I have seen God’s hand in my life, blessing me from the moment that I started studying the Bible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please don’t paint all sincere worshippers with the same brunch. We are not a cult, nor is their any evil conspiracy among us. As you can see, I think for myself, and ultimately I answer to no human.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for giving me an opportunity to share my research.

            Jehovah's witnesses do believe the day will come when some will be thrown into prisons based on false accusations . Recently in Russia JW have been banned . Russian authorities planted false evidence in a Kingdom Hall and its all on video . Do I think this is religious persecution? Yes

             Religious persecution? Yes. I agree with you. Targeted because they are the one true religion? No.
            </p>
            <p>
             To turn on the Witnesses, because they represent God is one thing, to turn on the religion because they have wickedness within is another.

              What's the wickedness within you speak of? There are wicked ones in all religions and we can see them being exposed before our very eyes . Why would anyone be in a religion if they didn't think it was the true religion ? There's nothing wrong with believing in your faith . The disfellowshipping that goes on is a biblical teaching as well as to abstain from blood . With all we've learned about blood and PG , you think maybe JW are right about blood being sacred and not something we should eat wether it be through our veins or through our mouths ?

            JESUS CHRIST was accused of being a drunkard, a glutton, a Sabbath breaker, a false witness, a blasphemer of God, and a messenger of Satan. He was also accused of being subversive.​—Matthew 9:34; 11:19; 12:24; 26:65; John 8:13; 9:16; 19:12.
           </p>
           <p>
            After Jesus’ death and resurrection, his disciples were likewise the target of serious accusations. One group of first-century Christians were dragged to the city rulers by people crying out: ‘These men have overturned the inhabited earth.’ (Acts 17:6) On another occasion the apostle Paul and his companion Silas were taken to the authorities and charged with greatly disturbing the city of Philippi.​—Acts 16:20.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul was later accused of being a “pestilent fellow and stirring up seditions among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth” and of trying “to profane the temple.” (Acts 24:5, 6) The principal men of the Jews in Rome accurately described the situation of Jesus’ followers when they acknowledged: “For truly as regards this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.”​—Acts 28:22.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evidently, this new group established by Jesus Christ was considered by some to be a religious group with radical views and practices that clashed with what was accepted in those days as normal social behavior. Undoubtedly, many today would have considered the Christians a destructive cult. The accusers were often prominent and respected members of the community, and this seems to have added weight to the allegations. Many believed the accusations against Jesus and his disciples. Yet, as you probably know, every one of these charges was false! The fact that people said these things did not make them true.
