<p>Tamera Luzzatto brings her 3 children to the &quot;Farmers L&quot; party, for some reason they need to be transported separately ?</p>
<p>&quot; Bonnie will be &gt; Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and &gt; almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in &gt; that pool for sure.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54545">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54545</a></p>
<p>It does sound odd to refer to your children as &quot;further entertainment&quot; but children in a pool may indeed brighten up a party the same way dogs would.</p>

<p>&quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels?&quot;</p>

<p>Quite the outrageous claim, however if we search those GI files for &quot;hot dog&quot;, we find that these Stratfor guys do actually eat hot-dogs AND have a sense of humor:</p>
<p>&quot;In case al-Qaeda could be surveilling the hot dog stand, suggest you vary
your routes to/from and eat vegetarian dogs vice pork.&quot;</p>

<hr />
<p>So far it seems like hot-dogs, pizza, cheese, pasta and sauce are simply food they eat, the weirdest thing left is that handkerchief with a pizza-related map.</p>
<p>&quot;handkerchief with a pizza-related map&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433</a></p>
<hr />
<p>And also this one, we know they were talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaymuras_dialogue_%E2%80%93_Tegucigalpa/San_Jos%C3%A9_accord">San Jose Accord which was a big deal</a> and then they drop this:</p>
<p>&quot;With fingers crossed, the old rabbit\'s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333</a></p>
<p>There\'s a valid reason to have your fingers crossed for the deal to happen but if you mention Moloch and know that what he wants is child sacrifice, is she going to give him a chicken just to piss him off ? It\'s that or we go back on the code-word assumption that chicken = child. I think its the weirdest email but still... I feel it\'s the kind of weird thing I say myself sometimes.</p>
<p>And I know there is still:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>children being abused in the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Podesta having pedophile friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these people having a very &quot;edgy&quot; taste for art</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spirit cooking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media (seemingly everything except voat/gab) actively suppressing all the noise we make.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satanism being popular among lots of those people (especially on the Alefantis instagram side)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alefantis and friends having an openly deviant sexuality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the little boy/girl lover FBI-recognized icons among the nearby businesses</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But Is it still about pizza ? Why doesn\'t Podesta speak out ? Surely someone has told him all the drama that his handkerchief line started.</p>
<p>Also, Kim Noble. Why do we know nothing about her abusers ? Did any of us read her biography ? Let me know what you think I\'ve missed or overlooked.</p>',
