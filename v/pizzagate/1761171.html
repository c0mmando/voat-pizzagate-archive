<p>BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>
<p>A PROCLAMATION</p>
<p>Childhood is precious.  Growing up in a loving home, with a nurturing family, surrounded by a safe community gives our children the best opportunity to realize their full potential.  Sadly, mistreatment by parents, guardians, relatives, or caregivers all too often threatens children\'s ability to flourish.  Abuse or neglect can rob children of their sense of dignity and worth, which are indispensable to the pursuit of happiness and success in the classroom, in the workplace, and in relationships.  Children rightfully impose a moral obligation on adults, who must protect them from harm and preserve their opportunity to reach their full potential and achieve their dreams.  They deserve nothing less.  The dreams of our children are the future of this country.</p>
<p>As we observe National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our commitment to stop child abuse before it begins.  That means preventing destructive conduct from shattering the secure and protective environments in which our children deserve to live, learn, and thrive.  We must all be aware of the signs of child maltreatment and take appropriate steps to safeguard children by reporting concerns and connecting families with the help they may need.</p>
<p>The family is society\'s most important institution, and its impact on human potential is unmatched by any other influence that government, education, or even community can wield.  We must promote strong families.  By respecting and supporting parents, we will reduce risks and increase the safety and protection critical to our children\'s happiness and success.  The best child abuse prevention program is a strong family with well-equipped, mature, and child-focused parents.  We therefore celebrate the many community members who help parents fulfill their moral obligations by providing them a needed shoulder to lean on in troubled times.</p>
<p>We also honor foster and adoptive parents, child protective workers, faith leaders, community mentors, teachers, and law enforcement officials, whose tireless work every day protects children who have been tragically abused or neglected.  Their often thankless service in these difficult and painful situations helps restore the safety and dignity of these wounded children and, in many cases, dramatically improves the course of their precious lives.  As a Nation, we pledge to honor our commitment to protecting the vulnerable among us, not just this month, but every day of the year.</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month.  I call upon all Americans to be alert to the safety and well-being of children and to support efforts that promote their physical, emotional, and developmental health.</p>
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.</p>
<p>DONALD J. TRUMP</p>',

            The problem is we have so much information we forget to compile it. It's like big data except we're fighting the pedophiles. For instance the overview summary at the top of the page hasn't been updated and there's been tons of new information that goes viral one day and disappears. People like me should be compiling the links watering it down and creating a data base for all the info. It would take time which I don't have.

            Hellooooo! Child abuse has nothing to do with Pizzagate! It is not pedophilia or SRA. As bad as child abuse is, its in a different category. This is not a sign that Trump is playing the long game. Jeez haha, some of y'all are just grasping at peanuts....

            A lot of people in this thread are acting like this is Trump giving pizzagate a nod though and it isn't And it isn't the 1st time a "real president" (whatever that means) has declared it. Every year the president mentions it just like they mention black history month etc. That's fine if it gives people hope but let's don't get up in arms about it being something it isn't.

             All im seeing in the news is endless talks about connections to russia. I live in europe. Trumps gotta take serious action and lay some serious undeniable evidence on the table to shut the fuck about russia. Even if it were true who cares about connections to russia if the opposing side is involved in human trade?

              I think the Russian investigation will eventually open up the pedo investigation. Once his accusers have been proved wrong they will in turn be  investigated and their reasons will be exposed, their reasons are to ensure the pedo's are not investigated.

             Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain.

            The vast majority of child abuse perps are FAMILY MEMBERS, RELATIVES, FAMILY FRIENDS, TEACHERS, NEIGHBORS, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            The vast majority of child abuse cases DO NOT involve "elites," the wealthy, or satanism.

             I wouldn't rule out these guys having a connection with an organisation as such and thus a connection to elites. The internet is connecting them all   there is probably some social bookmarking site buried in the dark web somewhere to contra the peoples investigation into them

             I don't think Elites take kids themselves, that's what Humantrafficking Rings are for &amp; they pay for. So I guess it depends on which form of "abuse". I would def say the #'s of kids abused, taken and exploited are through the rings.

             I understand that , but the big global picture definitely has proven to me that the elites benefit financially from child porn and all that goes with it. There isn't a gov't on earth that is not involved --or so it seems

             you need to qualify that, though. Lets say a foster father abuses a 'daughter' - as is statistically more likely with a non biological father. So that would seem to fit your 'vast majority'
            </p>
            <p>
             But what if that girl is only in foster care because of Hillary's legislation giving cash bonuses to CPS workers who ripped her from her otherwise not-so-bad parents who were just temporarily going through a rough patch but now have lost their daughter to the system. And lets say that foster fater exerienced abuse as a boy himself at the hands of the Catholic paedo network, and that perverted his sexual value system?
            </p>
            <p>
             I would argue she is a pizzagate victim, not just a 'vast majority' unrelated incident
