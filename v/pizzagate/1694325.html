            This guy could be right about Flynn but I'm leaning toward the alternative theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flynn was it top intelligence guy for 30 years. I highly doubt that he is going to make some kind of stupid ass mistake, whether it was getting caught talking to the Russians or not telling Pence (or someone who could tell Pence themselves) that his best friend was a pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I believe happened is that Flynn was never supposed to stay in that job. He was put in there for the sole purpose of being a canary in the coal mine. They had to find a way to flush out the leakers and the way to do that was to drop some bullshit and see where it bubbled up. It's my understanding that the FBI made some very quick and pointed visits to a number of people at that time. One of them was the president of NBC, Deborah Turness. If you go back and check out the timing, I think you will find that literally overnight she resigned from her job in New York City and immediately popped up over in Europe at the NBC affiliate there. That was not a coincidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Almost immediately after news of this thing with Flynn broke, he resigned. No fuss no muss, no big deal, down and out.  But that's ridiculous. Trump and his team didn't fight that hard for Flynn, simply to say, "Oh, well. Good-bye." I believe the speculation that he was immediately shadow moved over to the highest intelligence service in the United States, where he has been working in the background ever since.

             Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol.  It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone.  Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down and sometimes into oblivion, and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post on the face of it is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.

             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles.  I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030
            </a>
            .   If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <pre><code> - 1 Also reaching out to the mods 
 - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion 
 - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
</code></pre>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up.  At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all.  If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.

            enabler and cover-upper  =  accomplice.  Also known as  aiding and abetting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under the English common law, an accomplice is a person who actively participates in the commission of a crime, even if they take no part in the actual criminal offense. For example, in a bank robbery, the person who points the gun at the teller and asks for the money is guilty of armed robbery.

            I agree with the "Unconfirmed" and previous Commentator's request for caution.  If Robert Steele becomes an advisor to Sessions or Trump I will reconsider my assessment.  I trust Trump most of all because of all the recent pedophile busts.

            While I believe the title is true, this article is based on Robert Steele's statements.  Steele is disinformation trying to deflect us away from the super satanic CIA side and get us focus on the homo/GOP side.  Podesta is not pedo-lite.   Do you remember the 'torture room' email?

             He's replied to all of my questions on the Reddit AMA so far and he said that the US government is about 95% stupid and 5% Satanic. Isn't that consistent with some of the figures given by people who claim to have been a part of far-reaching Satanic cults?

            Since he is "former CIA" &lt;cough cough&gt; and disseminates alien crapola disinfo, I will never trust that guy.

              I concur. I will NEVER trust when a person tells me they are ex-intelligence. I imagine some are, but it's like someone saying they used to lie but they don't lie anymore. How can you ever simply take them at their word?
