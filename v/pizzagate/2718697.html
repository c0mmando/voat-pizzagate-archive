<p>The Amazon CEO and his wife, MacKenzie, will commit $2 billion to fund existing nonprofits that help homeless families and to create a network of preschools in low-income communities. They call their project the &quot;Bezos Day One Fund.&quot;</p>
<p>Bezos tweeted a statement Thursday that the fund will issue annual leadership awards to organizations &quot;doing compassionate, needle-moving work to provide shelter and hunger support to address the immediate needs of young families.&quot; There will also be full scholarships for Montessori-inspired preschools in &quot;underserved&quot; communities, he said. </p>
<p>Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post and space exploration company Blue Origin, became the world\'s wealthiest person this year, with an estimated net worth of $164 billion, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Helping the homeless has also been a focus for Amazon (AMZN). Earlier this year, the company partnered with the Seattle nonprofit Mary\'s Place to build a permanent homeless shelter in its headquarters. It previously helped the nonprofit temporarily house 200 homeless people.</p>

            Many of whom work for them already...I guess thats a pittance of giving back what he doesnt pay them or give in benefits so very much still a win for him. He looks like a freaking hero when all he is really doing is cutting corners instead of giving families that work for him a living wage. Is the name of the place going to include Amazon of Bezos I wonder?

            I think it is time to cancel subscribe and save. Unplug Alexa. Forget about Prime day. We are literally feeding this monster in mass. They have expendable income of many already and now they want our kids. So many red flags.

            Child Protective Services (CPS) MUST BE "COMPLETELY DISSOLVED." ~Senator Nancy Schaefer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Nancy Schaefer was murdered for exposing the pedophilia and complete corruption of Child Protective Services (CPS).  Watch one of the last interviews given by Senator Schaefer before she was murdered:
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/centum.aught/videos/1623358757730413/">
             https://www.facebook.com/centum.aught/videos/1623358757730413/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Senator Schaefer, family court Judges received over $40,000,000,000.00 in 2002 along (now they are making much more).  She believed that the only solution to stop the crimes being committed against children and families all over this nation by CPS was for CPS to be "completely dissolved."

            Related to Seattle, and a possible ulterior motive for any major suspect / person "helping the homeless."
           </p>
           <p>
            I heard a video on YT from a whistleblower who used to work for a company called SIS that conducts gang stalking under a government contract. He said he was from Seattle, and that they bus people up to Seattle and house them in the downtown emergency homeless shelter and conduct their TI (targeted individual) programs and experiments on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This video popped up after a Michael Barden YouTube video after a Jason Goodman interview with Michael Barden.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found it interesting listening to Michael's story. Incidentally he was handing out some flyers about gang stalking when he filmed one of his videos, and I just this morning happened to find a post about gang stalking flyers in Houston "getting laced with fentanyl" and a "cop getting poisoned when touching them."

            I will find that link as well.
           </p>

            I'll try to find all the links &amp; edit my comment.

              Very common. I've even seen where they will have a psych test done on the deranged low empathy parent to understand how to best game their personality to get access to the kid. I've seen financial kickbacks offered for Medicaid fraud and drug administration to help groom as young as 4yo

               In Michigan the state gov't gets kickbacks from the feds for any child support Michigan charges the man, so MI referees order the max child support in most cases. There was a social worker who spilled the beans on this one but her video was taken off YT.

                Prozac can be especially effective for obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia, and a couple others. It doesnt have to be a last resort choice. Sometimes its the best choice.  Theres two sides to this whole story about medicating kids. A lot of kids are seriously ill. A lot of those actually aren't receiving any therapy or medication

               Seems super crazy that they can get away with that, but we know it's true. I once attended a hearing on this topic in Texas (not the grooming but the drugging) and a shrink admitted to prescribing antipsychotics to infants under 1.

                 Yeah I know that but this was a hearing on Texas Medicaid Fraud against shrinks and some other issues where they were wanting more funding and we brought evidence that foster children and other Medicaid recipients were being medicated as infants. The shrinks will prescribe them to the infants regardless of whether it's off label or not. Any type of use it's not approved for, like a certain age group, or pregnant / nursing women is considered off label. Post Partum Depression is not an approved use of antidepressants or antipsychotics. But the shrinks do off label prescribing because that's not illegal. The woman who said this and admitted to it tried to deflect saying that she "rarely does prescribe to them" meaning the infants. You would not believe the ridiculous brainwashed ideas some people have. They actually think that their 0 year old baby has some kind of mental disorder because they cry all the time. And the shrinks are happy to prescribe.

            low-income being the word for non-white. I doubt they are building preschools in poor small white towns. Some sort of political race division.

             There will be nothing for anyone.  It's all fake.  They will be using it to boost their trafficking.  They set up a do good org. and it's a facade.  Just like the Art Galleries and Museums.  And all the other ones, Save the Children, Oxfam they are all compromised.  They won't spend anything on the poor no matter what color.  Or any of us either.

              I have to drive through some pretty rough parts of town sometimes and the shelters are always full, with people always loitering on the streets. In one area I drive in, the nicest building and parking lot in the whole area is the Planned Parenthood. The parking lot is clean and full of expensive SUVs and Mercedes cars.
             </p>
             <p>
              The second two nicest buildings are the Municipal Court building and the Probation office. The rest of the neighborhood is a complete crap hole.
             </p>
             <p>
              They'll put nice stuff for the cops in those neighborhoods to make them comfortable, and they'll make the abortion clinics seem appealing and upscale. No pregnancy centers in that neighborhood to help poor women.

               Expensive Cars is a Red Flag at at PP.  Who is driving up there, the Black Poor Women they are brainwashing with their lies?  I don't think so. Possibly next time you could take a couple of License Nos. down.  Something highly amiss there.
