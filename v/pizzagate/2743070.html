            , while your overall thesis that the RCC and Dems are joined at the hip is sound, I am going to have to give you the Accuracy in Question flair for claiming Project Rachel promotes abortion and the Church will be sponsoring abortion clinics. That is a total inversion of the truth. Project Rachel helps mothers face the truth about what they have done and repent. Many, many of them do that by standing outside abortion clinics with signs offering to pray with women tempted to abort, signs that clearly delineate the fact they killed their own babies. They are some of the bravest women I've ever met.

             No one will argue that the Church's position on abortion is soft and getting softer. Many people never thought that gay marriages and gay priests would be condoned by the Church but they are now. Murderers in this society go to prison, mothers that commit murder are given Project Rachel. Softening the crime by offering repentance in my opinion is offering a salve to one's conscience. I'm glad that some women realize that it was a terrible mistake but equally there are many women that have repeat abortions. A brave woman is one who accepts her actions of getting pregnant, realizes that it's God's will and moves heaven and earth to protect and cherish the child.

               Softening the crime by offering repentance in my opinion is offering a salve to one's conscience.

              Repentance cannot be "offered" by an external entity, HP. It has to come from within the sinner themselves. Project Rachel was created to move mothers from hardened justification and denial into repentance and responsibility. You dismissing it as "salve" is tantamount to you saying mothers who abort should be damned, which is a position directly contrary to Jesus' command to the apostles to "Go forth and make disciples of all" and to "feed my sheep."

              I so agree.  We have someone in our extended family that protected and cherished the child.  Many  helped her along. Child is a well adjusted adult now.   God sends us all here for a reason.  We all have a purpose.

            The Catholic Church was taken over by a conspiracy, so the only real Catholics left are a group that believes the pre-Vatican II teachings and rejects the hierarchy.

                I believe I am.  I used to reject the position of Traditional Catholics because I believed that the gates of Hell would never prevail against Our Lord's Church, as He promised, but the blatant heresies and insanity peddled by the Vatican II sect which the MHFM have repeatedly exposed has convinced me that the organisation led by Bergolio is not the true Catholic Church.

            Catholic clergy are definitely gay pedos,  but your average Catholic is very anti-abortion, in fact I would say they tend to be the most outspoken against abortion.
