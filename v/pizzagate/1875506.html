            James Alefantis is a pedophile, and the news doesn't show his instagram account because the company that makes the news is owned by satanist jew pedophiles who don't want information about their friends getting out.

            I think because it's private. But the biggest reason is they don't want to get sued. People are innocent until proven guilty. Free Speech doesn't include slander. A good example is the bomber at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it was NBC implied the security guard who found the bomb, Richard Jewel, was the one who put it there. It wasn't. It was anti-abortion activist Eric Rudolph. Richard Jewel ended up suing NBC because they basically had ruined his name by accusing him of being the culprit. Yada yada yada Richard Jewel became a multi-millionaire a year or two later.

             You're going from A to B and proving nothing. If a story is being covered, which is what happened. JOURNALISTS (as if there are any) should ask questions of why he continually refers to eating children, baking them in the oven, and shipping them in crates. It's not ACCUSING him of anything other than making, LEWD, OBSCENE, AND DISGUSTING comments.

              That's true. But humans make mistakes, they fuck things up all the time. This story is so volatile and one false move and some newspaper or tv news outfit is out millions in cash:

               Again, A to B. It's not that dfficult. You just don't accuse him of anything. You simply ask him why he's calling a child a #hotard.

                Great, you're right. That leaves:
               </p>
               <p>
                1) Losing their $1,000,000+ year jobs.
               </p>
               <p>
                2) Running afoul of the Deep State.
               </p>
               <p>
                3) All of the above.
               </p>
               <p>
                If I'm making $1,000,000+ per year I would be as tame as an invisible pet. These people live in a different stratosphere than you and me. I've seen how they live up close and personal. Money can be very persuasive.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think the real drama will be when some of these talking heads in the MSM start taking flak for being part of the system. But until then you can't expect them to stick their necks out for anyone.

                  He got a slap on the wrist. I think it was "up to" 27 months in prison. I'd bet he spends between 6 and 12 months behind bars at some Camp Fed. He'll have 3 hots and a cot and probably spend the time writing his memoirs. And he'll probably have access to more working toilets than I do at the moment.

                   It's still prison. For someone that has led an extremely privileged life, it's a huge deal. He had no choice but to bite the bullet. If he'd gone to trial, this would have led to someone way higher up on the predation food chain and that's not gonna happen.

             Looking at this from a journalist point of view, he's not exactly a private citizen after reaching Forbes top50 list, so he could be handled as any public, living person (comparable to e.g. celebrities). Decent documentation of his areas of interest might include something, not any of his private content w/o permission of course, but content he has already made public should be all right to include (edit: really just include, not to focus on, so that nobody gets a wrong idea).
            </p>
            <p>
             So, to answer: For some reason, they don't. Yet on the journalist point of view, only acceptable reason to leave something unpublished would be that there's no public interest
             <strong>
              over to
             </strong>
             the possible negative impacts on his life. I'd personally be careful on picking related imaginery, but I do think there is enough of public interest. Some biased media's, sure, leave it unpublished for other reasons (against their owners/financiers/partners agenda being the most common reasons in general)

              There's more than just slander. Yes the images are out there but the pink elephant in the middle of the living room for the MSM is they're scared stiff of:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Losing their $1,000,000+ year jobs.
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Running afoul of the Deep State.
             </p>
             <p>
              3) All of the above.
             </p>
             <p>
              What's helped me stay sane in all of this is to realize people are both good and bad. Nobody's pure evil unless they're psychotic and even then it's not evil it's a mental illness. I would bet people like Jake Tapper plead with management to cover more of the seedy details in all of this. And I'd bet the Jake Tappers of the world are probably warning management all the time how this charade can't go on for ever. And I'm just as certain that once this whole fraud comes down the MSM will cover this in spades and we'll never hear the end of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              But for now the MSM is soooooo eerily quiet it's freaking me out. It's just like the calm before a Hurricane. I don't know where you live but I'm up in the New England and I've lived through some bad Hurricanes, most when I was a kid, not many lately. But you can feel the thing coming at you. The Barometer drops to practically 0, all the animals know what's coming so they're quiet as a church mouse. Usually you always will hear birds chirping unless it's Winter so when they cut out it's a little terrifying. It's like when the refrigerator turns off and you sort of freak out for a bit at the silence. Then right before it hits the sky turns sort of very faint yellow and you get this feeling that you're being stalked by a predator who's been watching you the whole time and you didn't realize it. Then wham it's lights out, Katie bar the door. It's fucking terrifying. A tornado has winds over 200 mph but it's only for a little bit and only a tiny swath gets hit by it. But a Hurricane is 100 miles across of 150+ mph wind for around 24 hours straight. It's fucking awful to see that much power at one time, it'd be like riding a freight train with the top down through a thunderstorm. You never forget it too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway that strange silence is what I feel these days in the MSM. They're probably as scared as we are.

               Well, those two reasons are not direct quotes from the ethics of journalism :) Yes, personal reasons plays a role in some medias, but not among serious journalists. They work for the public. But they are a bit too rare nowadays.
              </p>
              <p>
               Agreed on good and bad. Agreed on MSM, but they dropped true journalism a long time ago. And their public trust among that, by the way, currently only 32% of readers trusting them in the U.S. (2016 poll). Few independent medias making great exceptions.

             Am I making myself clear enough? Major News Media In Which America Is Supposed To Believe Unquestioningly, I'm talking to you: why do you not address these images and Alefantis' ties to the Clinton camp? Why do you gloss over that pertinent information? Because to us investigators, not addressing it makes you look like tools and we discuss it with people. Because it's hard not to notice the bias in "reporting" although I suppose it's just script reading at this point, amiright?
            </p>
            <p>
             Either cover all the topic so that the people who have seen what Alefantis and co. posted know you are actually investigating things, or just admit you're puppets who aren't allowed to think for yourselves. So which is it? You lazy or a fucking tool?

             Because they don't make money off the news. The network makes money off of the advertising and shows scripted and written to get people to watch them. You watch the shows, then you're watching the advertising. If the dems (or anyone else) hands them enough money, they'll say whatever they're told. 
Don't blame it all on the networks, is also the fools that keep themselves glued to their TVs! 
Stations expose something like this, that kills other scripted shows' agendas to misinform or desensitize things...viewership goes down, no one to advertise to...etc.etc.  ultimately all of this is about the love of $$$....human,child, adult trafficking, organ harvesting, etc...all for $....
