            New York Times article that Drudge links mentions this particular youtuber as an example. When I went to archive it, it had already been archived by someone else.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The high search ranking of the End Times News Report video claiming there was a second shooter in Las Vegas helped it gain 371,000 views over four hours late Tuesday. On Wednesday, YouTube removed the video.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jake Morphonios, who runs the End Times News Report along with a damaged-inventory-liquidation business in Kernersville, N.C., said the video eventually reached 2.5 million views. “It was a hot topic, of course, and was going to get some views anyway, but it really did get caught in [YouTube’s] algorithm and went viral from there,” he said. “Clearly it got into featured videos or something.” The 43-year-old said he has posted about 800 videos and typically gets about 5,000 views each.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Morphonios said YouTube gave his account its first strike for the video. YouTube terminates accounts that get three strikes within three months.

             Yeah he was saying that he removed it because he worked too hard to get to where he has and it wasn’t worth it. Having a strike, his tires slashed and vehicles tampered with... yikes. I don’t know the details of it all. But, he has 8 kids. Their van has 10 seats. His whole family could have gotten hurt. When his wife and 6 year old were getting towed, his car was already at the shop because it was tampered with earlier. It’s ridiculous!

              Yes, no problem, didn't know if you or others were aware of it or not. You or someone else mentioned he might be a homeschooler. Sounds like he probably is w/ that many kids.

              Great --
             </p>
             <p>
              I took a quick look at the video -- 
Did he indicate any conclusion about Las Vegas?
             </p>
             <p>
              That's a lot of damage and death reported there -- i.e., a big operation
to deal  with if False Flag.
If I wanted to be flip about this, I could suggest that maybe the public 
really isn't paying attention to these things any more so they've upped
the numbers and damage.
             </p>
             <p>
              Was watching baseball last night and it is really sad to see people so
very concerned about Las Vegas.  Yet, I'm not at all sure what it was.

               Oh yeah, him and many other youtuber are finding all kinds of things that lead them to believe it was a false flag attack. Defango on YouTube posted a video tonight that looks like a 2nd shooter. The shooter had room service for 2 or 3 people. He wasn’t alone. There’s a lot more inconsistencies too. I think he was a patsy.

Obviously I need to catch up with YouTube on this tomorrow.
But, what you're saying above seems quite clear he was not alone.

                 He’s a real short clip of one part. It sounds like he was about to say arms dealer and hurried and corrected himself. During the interview, it was like he had an ear piece. He would correct himself and say sorry uhh

                 Wow, I wake up this morning and the mainstream news is saying that he MAY have had help. Of course they are going to start changing their story since so many cell phones captured at least 1 other shooter.  There was another shooter from the 4th floor. People’s testimonies are coming forward, receipts leaked, and much more. So, they are scrambling to try to clean things up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is also a video that’s like a 35 minute interview with the shooters brother. Omg he is like the worse actor ever and it seems he has an ear piece. He would mess up and say oh sorry, uhhh. I’ll find it. Did you see the Defango video that I told you about? Doesn’t it look like another shooter? It makes sense since witnesses say there were shells on the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The more I see, the more angry I am. I am so disgusted by these bastards!

             Did you listen to it? He’s asking for prayers and for his regular subscribers to start donating to his patron account. They have demonetized his videos. Both of his vehicles were sabotaged. I remember a few months ago, he went out of town investigating some pedo ring. He got on video and showed how his computer was being controlled. It was a trip. He fought child trafficking even before Pizzagate. But now they are putting his family in danger. He has 8 kids and they did something to their vans tires. That’s horrible.

He fought child trafficking even before Pizzagate. So he’s been targeted before. But now it’s affecting his family. I’ve always felt he was genuinely a sincerely good person.

              Ha ha ha.. how would anyone on this nutcase site know if someone was "sane" or not?
You're all completely insane. There is no "pizzagate" or any of this crazy shit you idiots wallow in. 
I suppose it's good that all the loons can hang out together here and leave the sane people alone.

               Right, because there isn't a mountain of evidence concerning pedophiles in government going back decades. That just has never happened before, and we're all just 'crazy' lol. GTFO why are you even here?

             Yes. I have noticed that very important video clips disappeared from yesterday. Could everyone here agree to archive them if presented again? After archiving, please spread them around liberally. If you have to run, maybe go to that guy with the tank in his yard in Texas. Sorry for the bad joke, but if i were on the run, I would go to real America quick like.
