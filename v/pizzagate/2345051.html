Does this “prove” anything with 100% certainty? No. But short of DNA evidence not sure much does. After all, even video and photo “proof” can be manipulated.

There seem to be an awful lot of “coincidental” connections just on a surface level that we all know are PG red flags. I suggest digging.</p>',

            No time to dig right now but whenever I see Falls Church is brings up red flags because the connection with the Finders. Looks like the kids were treated similar to the Finders kids, too. Could the parents be kids of the Finders???

            This. Also my humble opinion is that the children were starved to keep them from growing and developing. The only time they were taken outside or at 1am in the morning. PG related for sure. Time will tell, but there is a thread here that will lead to bigger fish

            His work with in the aero-space industry is interesting- he worked at a coupla places, lived in Murrieta for a second- filled with military industrial complex kooks, then he left in 2010, that was years ago- how do they afford those Disney tickets and all that matching clothing for the photo ops? And seriously, I am no Mrs Kravitz, but if I saw that weirdness- I woulda called on them eons ago. Close to 15 kids, that are emaciated and frightfully pale-going in and out of a van- I woulda called or at least asked, what the deal was.

            Holy shit... Good work, it got me thinking. Do you remember the Piggy's Palace Good Times Society? It's a very informative criminal case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Abel Danger believes that Canadian Privy councilor Maurice Strong hired Crown Agents Sister Lena Trudeau in 1996 to set up Piggy’s Palace Good Times Society as a federally-registered charity, to procure film for use in the extortion of witnesses to (or participants in) pedophile oath-taking ceremonies at a B.C. pig farm mortgaged by Linda Pickton.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was given the go ahead by David Johnston, Governor General of Canada, at the Pickton Family pig farm, Port Coquitlam, in British Columbia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Piggy Palace was the name of a notorious nightclub on Robert Picton's farm that attracted more than 2000 party goers including off duty police officers, city officials and was considerable association between Dave Pickton and the Hells Angels, the CIA drug smugglers sect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dave Pickton claimed he used Tony from White Knight Security for all his parties. "He's an Angel. A Hells Angel."
           </p>
           <p>
            By the end of 1996 the neighbourhood became known in criminal circles as a biker area, one controlled by the Hells Angels.
           </p>
           <p>
            His brother Robert Picton was suspected of murdering over 100 women (&amp;children), and was dubbed Canada's biggest ever serial killer by the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was only charged with killing 6 women though.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Diane Rock claimed she was repeatedly raped by several men on the Pickton farm.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the entire city of Port Coquitlam (pop. 53,000), it seemed, was feeding on pigs ( murder victims) that had been fed by the suspected serial killer Robert Pickton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even worse for us ALL...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It wasn't just the guests of Piggy's Palace who consumed Pickton's pigs. The unusable remains of the pigs Robert slaughtered and served to his friends and neighbors--pig entrails, brains, bones, nerve tissue, and gore--were taken by truck to a rendering plant near the DES called West Coast Reduction Ltd. Many are certain that the partial remains of the murdered sex workers were also trucked to West Coast Reduction Ltd.

             Located on 105 North Com- mercial Drive, West Coast Reduction's facility is impressive. It's a complex of huge cylindrical cookers, storage tanks, office buildings, industrial stacks, and railroad tracks. Underground pipelines connect it with one of the biggest ports on the Pacific Rim; huge orange cranes loom just behind it, and the surrounding air is relatively clean, although once in a while the smell of something awful wafts from an unidentifiable source. The plant turns animal bones, guts, fish, blood, pig entrails, used restaurant grease, and, now many believe, the remains of sex workers into a number of consumer products, like lipstick base, soaps, shampoos, and perfumes. These commodities that improve human appearance are shipped all over the world.

            <p>
             Six blocks up from the rendering plant, the most fashionable part of Vancouver begins. Commercial Drive is lined with restaurants that serve Cuban finger foods, theaters that screen Bollywood films, and stores that sell Italian shoes. Here hipsters visit a wild variety of trendy cafes, tapas bars, spas, heath-food groceries, and cosmetic shops. All of these urban pleasures are walking distance from the rendering plant, the place where Robert Pickton brought the intestines of his slaughtered hogs for more than 20 years, according West Coast Reduction's records. After emptying his truck, he is believed to have picked up sex workers, sometimes within a block of the plant.

             "Vancouver residents have recently learned... that fragments of some of these dead women's bodies may have entered the food chain through the rendering plant," writes cultural historian Denise Blake Oleksijczuk in an essay titled "Haunted Spaces." (As well as beauty products, rendering plants also make food for farm animals that humans consume.) Oleksijczuk cites a statement made by the regional director of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Sheila Fagnan, to the Vancouver Sun: "[We] made inquiries after learning that Robert Pickton had met the women he is accused of killing on his trips to the rendering plant.... Any testing that would have been done [at the plant] would be around surveillance for chemical residues. I can't imagine any testing that would distinguish, um, you know--[one] animal matter... from another."

I think there will be more, but we will have to pay close attention and read everything. TY.  Upvoat.  There will be connections w/these places I believe.  Lockheed.  We must also remember that James Comey worked at Lockheed as well. Wonder if the years coincide.

                Seriously, read the story of the Comey kidnapping.  It makes ZERO sense.  And it is one of those WHUT moments when you compare it with Pizzagate.  Something is way, way off with Comey.

                 Comey has been linked to the Clintons for years. HSBC, Lockheed Martin, FBI. Always turns up when a scandal breaks to tidy things up. Maybe he was a victim of a paedophile ring and groomed for this role.

                  That's what I've been thinking.  Exceptional people.  There are some stats about very tall people being generally more successful than others (ever see a 6'7" homeless person?).  Maybe he was noted for being exceptional at a young age.  Stage some "incident" and rape them - eye of horus stuff - and then groomed by someone else in the "coven".  I know it sounds like TV fantasy shit, but if you think on it, it makes sense.

                 <p>
                  Just as smart people are attracted to smart people, smart pedos are attracted to smart children.  The bulk of child sexual assaults start with someone they know.  We know they groom.  Could have been a teacher? A track coach?  Howdy Doody?

               Oh, I think they were raped alright.  I think their parents or one of them allegedly let someone have their way with the boys for a price.  That was the beginning or who knows, maybe it was already going on before that.  I wonder if Comey is a member of Club 33.

                So allegedly the perp is so good at what he does, he is able to target homes who happen to have a teenage babysitter in them at the time so he can rape her.  That takes either some insider knowledge or good stalker skills. So his MO is targeting homes with female teen babysitters to rape.
               </p>
               <p>
                But then we're supposed to believe he somehow screwed up and targeted a home with two teenage boys in it? And when he gets inside the house he begins to burglarize it? He's a rapist not a thief. These serial criminals don't often go this far off course. The story is fishy as hell, and the fact that it's hard to find is odd as well.

                 My exact feelings.  I have never believed their accounting of that night.  So very telling as well considering how screwed up that he and his brother are.  What a Movie Night Classics that would make.  Not.
