               Thanks, i understood that...can you summarize your conclusions of her findings?  I am interested because she sounds both legitimate and encouraged/excited with her findings.  I have been rather discouraged and I'm looking for a better outlook.

            Don't know if anyone saw it, made a post last night about the trigger being escalating to war to with russia and china because that would be checkmate for the deep state. NATO with US approval is right on russia's borders so i was thinking this is happening now. But tillerson is skipping his first NATO mtg in favor of meeting with Russia and china next month, he just returned from China too. They know. I also saw an article today about Trumps body double, he is effectively spreading the risk. I think something will happen soon, the C/US/R mtgs are scheduled for Apr 5th but i bet that was for the other sides benefit, things are going on right now.

            The fact that the FBI is investigating Roger Stone (a freaking tabloid owner) for collusion with Russia, rather than all of these "charitable foundations" like the McCain Institute or Clinton Foundation says all you need to know about how dirty that organization is.

            James Comey's profound level of corruption is now infamous thanks to George Webb. Apparently old James is a high-priest in the Military-Industrial Complex, served on the board of Lockheed which gave us such epic fails as the F-35 Stealth Flatulater. Then there's his work on the board of HSBC, the bank that makes Panama Cities Laundrettes pale in comparison. What's next James a seat on the board of Tide?

            Comey's latest white washing is proof he's been bought off or black-mailed long ago. I honestly don't understand how the man could look in the mirror every morning.

           <p>
            That's ok James, when the truth comes out about what happened down in Haiti on how you and Andrew McCabe "slow walked" the investigation you'll have more than God to answer to. Just sayin'. Historians can be very mean sometimes. They look like such wall-flowers, nothing could be further from the Truth.

             So i just read on an anon page that Comey handed off the evidence to Sessions that will enable arrests of Obama and Bush for their involvement in the CIA Mexico drug cartel. A boat that Obama is the listed captain of, the lady michelle was caught off the coast with 125M in drugs. Will be interesting to see if Obama disappears or stays on vacation indefinitely. Also trying to see if the bushes left on vacation but haven't looked to far yet. Just stating to see of anyone else has heard about this i just got the one source so far

               I linked it below for darkmath, anonofficial page. They are playing the underestimation game. That's why trump purposefully says stupid stuff. He is giving the other side a fake exit strategy so they think they can down him with public opinion, he spoon feeds them that narrative on purpose
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: comey could be playing both sides though too, not sure since he's been corrupted for a long time. But in the end if he help upend this deep state control than who cares, ends justifies the means when billions of people are at stake, go ahead and hate me kind of thing

                We'll see. God wouldn't that be a kick. Sadly I've had my hopes dashed so many times I can't remember. I would highly doubt anyone in government is going to seek justice.

                 I hear ya, not trying to distract because Comey has clearly been compromised in the years with many issues. The only thing that makes me question that narrative is how he did screw Hillary right before the election and they were going after him too, he's playing both sides it seems. I guess the end results will clarify where he really stands.

             Dark Math....so right on the mark. Webb has exposed these hypocritical choirboys who along with their CIA buddies answer to the Vatican as in Jesuits. Disgusting to watch him yesterday sitting and taking questions from Spearman &amp; Schiff who actually helped get top secret clearance, visas, fro whitehouse. Much less safe houses, drug running, "mangos" full of heroin shipped from Pakistan to Chicago.
            </p>
            <p>
             How does any of them look in the mirror? Child trafficking, organ harvesting, heroin rat lines from Pakistan through Bangledash to Chicago.
            </p>
            <p>
             22 navy seals involved in Osama raid shot down in 2011...all eyewitnesses dead.
            </p>
            <p>
             No wonder everyone has let Chicago go to hell in murders and gang warfare. Obama not Hillary nor anyone said a damn thing as heroin was running in on planes in mangos. Rat lines paving way for sex trafficking, dead bodies for organ harvesting.

              In light of the "22 navy seals involved in Osama raid shot down" Comey and McCabe will have to answer to more than God.
             </p>
             <p>
              If they're not tried for treason and hung by the neck until dead they'll be shot by a Navy Seal.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know that sounds harsh but this cluster fuck rose to that level quite a while ago. Don't fuck with Navy Seals or any combat vet who's lived through the past 15 years and seen countless buddies pay the ultimate price.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do ya hear that James and Andrew?
             </p>
             <p>
              You two done fucked with the wrong hombres. Holy fuck do you have another thing coming.
             </p>
             <p>
              And no I'm not a Seal nor do I know any Navy Seals. I'm just letting you cowards know American History just "went there".
             </p>
             <p>
              You're going to have to answer to some extremely irate and possibly Psychotic Alpha Males.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not joking. I dropped out of the Marine Corp Officer Candidate School after two weeks because I didn't want to kill anyone. You have nothing to fear from me. But I was in there long enough to learn how those guys think.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would invest in some body armor and consider giving your car a "Security Makeover" if you know what I mean.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can feel the psychotic heat coming off these guys from Massachusetts and that's a blue state 500 miles north of the Mason Dixon line as if that even matters. In fact go read about a Navy Seal officer by the last name of Murphy. He was from Long Island. He was an American Hero who would find your corruption nauseating.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd consider leaving the country or joining a Monastery or something. Just sayin'.
             </p>
             <p>
              How do you feel about the Greek Orthodox church? You'd probably be safe in place like the Greek Orthodox Monastery at Mount Athos. Here it is at sunset no pun intended:
             </p>

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, just sayin'. It's been done before. Ever read any European History? Before my two weeks in OCS where I discovered sometimes a soldier doesn't want to kill as much as he does which was a total mind fuck bee tee dubs.....before all that I was a History major at an Ivy League college in the North East. I read a lot of European History. Fascinating stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              Two words for you two spineless cowards: Mount Athos.

                I don't drink anymore. That's one of the reason I'm so pissed off.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think between booze and modern anti-depressants the American public has been numb to what's been happening for years. That's most likely how it got this bad. Unfortunately booze and anti-depressants just delay the inevitable and most likely they'll be the reason what's about to happen in this country will be far worse that it need to be.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not kidding. I finally understand why the hell I majored in History all those years ago. History is made occasionally and this time around will be as good as it gets. What we'll soon see will turn people's shit white.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reason I know it'll be bad is the deals being made in private aren't keeping up with the story. Comey's playing both sides and maybe has even switched to the forces of Goodness and Light. The problem is the psychotic ex Navy Seal, Marine, Delta Force or Army Ranger who HAS been drinking booze to kill the pain didn't get the memo.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would be very surprised if Andrew McCabe lives to see 2018. And given the poor telegraphing of plays from the likes of Donald Trump who is in waaaaay over his head I woudn't want to be anywhere near James Comey for the next 6 months to 2 years. I'm either clairvoyant or just good at history but that shitbird has got a few rounds with his name on it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yeah, clairvoyant probably, I remember getting shit from my family for my extreme reluctance to go to Thanksgiving at my sister's house in New York City from ~1994 until 2000. They had it there almost every year. My sister was in medical school down there. I went to maybe one and finally said I couldn't be in that city because it was going to get attacked by terrorists. My sister thought I was crazy, a paranoid schizophrenic as I recall. Yeah.............I wasn't one. But I did turn into a raging alcoholic after 9/11. I don't want to go into it. Long story.

                 Why do you suppose Comey announced his investigation of Clinton during the election?  That was the only glimmer of hope for Comey.  Now I'm inclined to believe the Comey Epstein Howdy Doody Pedo rumores...where have all the good authorities gone?  Sessions, Flynn, Pompeo...heck I haven't even seen any pedogate posts from Roseanne, J. Woods, Rohan or Jones lately...There was a rumor months ago that Comey was as playing some kind of long game on the side of justice in all this.  Idk...I've just been praying for Gods intervention for the sake of justice and honor at this point.  It's all so discouraging.

                  He had to have done that or else he would have been skewered by the likes of Trey Gowdy and company for years and possibly impeached.

                  Also I think Comey has been turned and is now just a millimeter in the Trump camp to see how it goes. It's obvious he's trying desperately not to pick sides. He's a coward or they've got good dirt on him. Either way it's not enough. He needs to start pleading his case to the 1,000 or so ex combat vets who are now suiting up to kill him. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind. I know how those guys think. It's too late. The emotions are too powerful and the crimes are too great. It's going to get bloody very soon.

               Seals or any soldier, honorable law enforcement, wh FBI, etc. who have had to endure being witnesses who have been silenced by these corrupt, sickening excuses for humanity are enraged. These are not people you want as enemies.

             Trump went out of his way to retain him. There is no PG investigation. This is all a show. Trump seems to be in on it.

              "Trump went out of his way to retain him.".......I think he can only be removed through impeachment or his resignation. Trump can't fire him.

              It's no accident the Bush and Clinton Crime Families have survived this long. Unfortunately for them this country is going to enter "The Hurt Locker" directly.
