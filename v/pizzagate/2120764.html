            FYI, YHWH gave the rainbow as a covenant between Him and humans. It stands for the PROMISE that YHWH will never flood the earth again. YHWH did not give it to the LGBT community. The next time you see a rainbow think of that promise being displayed for all earth to see.

            The Nephilim died in the flood in the bible. Where are you getting your information? All the info about the Nephlim  burned up in Jeruselums library  in 607 B.C.E. Search the Nephilim in Bible Hub and the history pops up. Its the ONLY place you can find the real story. Becareful about teaching others about the bible because YHWH recorded that He will curse the human with the curses in the bible if they twist any teachings therein.

             I agree to your interpretation of scripture regarding twisting the meaning but would advise their is many that have posted on these topics that have twisted the meanings. The Nephelim scriptures were not all burned although TPTB would love for you to believe this and further love you to believe if you research these topics you will be smitten by God almighty. He leads his children to the truth and it will come out so be prepared. Scare tactics will not work. The almighty God who sent his son Jesus will reveal all things and is doing that. Anyone standing in opposition to the truth will be smitten so everyone might want to check their heart at the throne of the Living God!

              THX Jem :)  Please send the info. Jesus linage burned up that traced his royal line to king David. I love biblical research. When I found out that YHWH is allowing satan to rule over the earth only to let us suffer war, sickness, and death I had to find out why would a loving God who claims to love us allow that to happen? Is he a liar? Why didnt Jesus stay on earth and become king, he knew how to cure the sick and raise the dead. Did you know about that?

               Yes sorry it has taken so long to reply. I have what I believe to be facts and scriptures that support what you allege. At the same time my belief is God's love for his children as expressed through his son Jesus Christ is perfect love. It is offered to all of us but only through surrender and acceptance of Jesus Christ as your lord and savior. In that moment the Holy Spirit enters your being and takes evidence testifying to all things true that are of God. It is a surrender to Grace. You and I nor anyone can do anough to earn grace we are Galen men )women) but through the ultimate and final blood sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ you and I and all can be brought into the new convenenet with God by asking for forgiveness and accepting new life in Christ. God promises to bring you to judgement wearing clothes washing bright as the morning sun )unsullied) before him. Jesus cleaned all unrighteousness if we ask with a sincere heart and establishes a new covenanant with us his children.

                You put things so nicely. :) Romans 11:6 is true YHWH wisdom. Grace has to come before works because Grace is a present from YHWH to us, without grace there would be no works to be done because it wouldnt mean anything to YHWH. Your right when you say NOBODY can EARN grace, ;, also James 2:20 faith without works is dead: which leads me to believe that a person cant rely on faith alone because this scripture tells me that faith can be killed off without works rendering it useless. Also 2 peter 1:5-11 instructs Jesus followers to "practice these things. There are alot of things here that we must practice in order to please YHWH. we cant do it perfectly but YHWH knows a sincere trying heart.  It says there at the end that ones who DONT practice these things will not be allowed to live in the kingdom that Jesus taught is followers to pray for. Christians have been disagreeing with this subject for decades unfortunately.  All else aside YHWHs love towards us is not deserved by humans, its a free gift from our creator. The bible says in Romans 6:3 that the wage, or payment, of sin is death. Why are people dying right now? Because we are cursed with sin all the way back to Adam and Eve. They were perfect but BECAME sinners through disobedience of YHWHs laws in the garden. Thats why they died because they did not look to YHWH for council after the snake lied to Eve. They believed the snake. I tend to ramble alot and can be very wordy, so sorry, I try to help it but sometimes I just get the best of myself, and I get so excited about the bible. hahahaha. You may know some of this info already, I dont know, I'm just chatting along! hehe I have to go now but am loving our convo. I love the bible so much. I veiw it as my personal letter from YHWH. And people who love Gods word, He notices that. Thx for replying Jem your a nice person to talk to. Lets visit again, write me back.
