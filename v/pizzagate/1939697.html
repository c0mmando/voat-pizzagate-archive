British Army Psychiatric Unit. He began experimenting with LSD in 1960, and then in 1962
when he became a family therapist at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, he also
met Gregory Bateson while visiting the U.S. Bateson had been with the Office of Strategic
Services (forerunner of the CIA), and then led the MK-Ultra hallucinogen (LSD) project.
Bateson\'s and Margaret Mead\'s daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson, along with New Ager Jean

<pre><code>White rented an apartment in Greenwich Village equipped with one-way mirrors, surveillance
gadgets and disguised himself as a seaman. White drugged his acquaintances with LSD and
brought them back to his apartment. In 1955, the operation shifted to San Francisco. In
San Francisco, &quot;safehouses&quot; were established under the code name Operation Midnight
Climax. Midnight Climax hired prostitute addicts who lured men from bars back to the 
safehouses after their drinks had been spiked with LSD. White filmed the events in the
safehouses. The purpose of these &quot;national security brothels&quot; was to enable the CIA to
experiment with the act of lovemaking for extracting information from men. The safehouse
experiments continued until 1963 until CIA Inspector General John Earman criticized
Richard Helms, the director of the CIA and father of the M.K.-Ultra project. Earman charged
the new director John McCone had not been fully briefed on the M.K.-Ultra Project when he
took office and that &quot;the concepts involved in manipulating human behaviour are found by
many people within and outside the Agency to be distasteful and unethical.&quot; He stated that
&quot;the rights and interest of U.S. citizens are placed in jeopardy&quot;. The Inspector General stated
that LSD had been tested on individuals at all social levels, high and low, native American
and foreign.&quot;

The U.S. government has conducted three types of mind-control experiments:

1. Real life experiences, such as those used on Little Augie and the LSD experiments in
the safehouses of San Francisco and Greenwich Village.

2. Experiments on prisoners, such as in the California Medical Facility at Vacaville.

3. Experiments conducted in both mental hospitals and the Veterans Administration
hospitals.

Such experimentation requires money, and the United States government has funnelled
funds for drug experiments through different agencies, both overtly and covertly.
One of the funding agencies to contribute to the experimentation is the Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (LEAA), a unit of the U.S. Justice Department and one of President
Richard Nixon\'s favourite pet agencies. The Nixon Administration was, at one time, putting
together a program for detaining youngsters who showed a tendency toward violence in
&quot;concentration&quot; camps. According to the Washington Post, the plan was authored by Dr.
Arnold Hutschnecker. Health, Education and Welfare Secretary Robert Finch was told by
John Erlichman, Chief of Staff for the Nixon White House, to implement the program. He
proposed the screening of children of six years of age for tendencies toward criminality.
Those who failed these tests were to be destined to be sent to the camps. The program was
never implemented.

<pre><code>“It’s hard for me to believe that a human being could have done what I’ve done, but I know
that I did it.” —Jeffrey Dahmer

With the possible exception of school and workplace shootings, nothing better serves to
facilitate the promotion of a ‘law-and-order’ agenda than the palpable fear aroused by the
sociopathic killer—a fear that propels the population into an every-man-for-himself
mentality. Anyone, after all, could be a serial killer, hiding behind a mask of civility: a coworker,
a friend, a neighbour…even a family member.

The Phoenix Program has been referenced a number of times in past chapters, and its
relevance to this discussion cannot be overstated. Phoenix was, by design, a psychological
warfare operation. Its goal was, quite literally, to scare the hell out of the Vietnamese
people—to such an extent that their will would be broken and they would accede to the
demands of their would-be oppressors. The techniques employed were barbaric. Victims of
the program were not merely assassinated; they were frequently raped, tortured, mutilated,
dismembered and left posed in grotesque displays for their fellow villagers and family
members to find. The crime scenes of the Phoenix Program were, in other words,
indistinguishable from the crime scenes of America’s serial killers.

<pre><code>After all, the killing of a child in this country is certainly not an uncommon occurrence, nor
is it normally an event deemed worthy of national media attention. As the Village Voice
reported in 1997, the United States has, per capita, the highest rate of child homicide in
the world. None of the world’s people slaughter their children more frequently, or
more cavalierly, than do Americans.

            I am going to research into info regarding deprogramming. There's got to be some materials out there we could study and evaluate to try and under the psychological process behind all of this. Must be some info which could shed light on ways or methods to deprogram and undo the mind control. maybe not a fast method, I doubt it can be done in a snap of a finger. but perhaps methods which could work incrementally and progressively, sort of like tapering methods used in detox rehab programs which slowly taper a person off the drug which they are addicted to. Addiction, in my opinion, is another form of enslavement. The person becomes enslaved to the drug and it begins to dominate every aspect of their life.... Mk Ultra mind control programming surely works likewise. Well the literature does say the programming is accompanied by dosages of drugs, such as LSD, METH, other Opioids etc.

            My God this is making me cry. This is so cruel. I wish we could help them. Break them out of the ritualistic mind control. There's got to be a way to break them out of this cultic enslavement.

            Do you know where Global Education models are being created?
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at Higher Expectations, Strive Together, Collaborative for Children's Mental Health, School Readiness Coalition, Wingspread Conferences on Education, 21st Century Prep, Career Discovery Solutions, and the National Summit on Higher Education for the Public Good. Those are just a few of the initiatives that began in Racine as global education reform models.
           </p>
           <p>
            Education, Mental Health, Technology and Sustainability are interconnected programs, along with media control and Community Policing to keep everyone in line.

             This is good information. I am interested in learning more about this. This really is the driving force behind everything that is wrong in our nation today. The mind control enslavement and exploitation of the youth, no wonder the country is in shambles. These sick institutions are the culprits. People entrust their children to these institutions, hoping for their children to get a good education and succeed, but instead, they are exploiting the children. These institutions are cult factories, manufacturing everything that is abominable.

            Just to go along with this research...was reading the newly released FOIA on trafficking from late 70's early 80's..they were speculating about all of the underage and teenage boy prostitutes in DC, NY, etc.  These boys were numerous and would hang out in clubs doing drugs and turning tricks (while club owners were filming the johns for the mossad nd other IC's BTW).  These boys were 11-17, homeless, and would get sucked into this lifestyle.  They asked the question..What happens to the boys when the get older?  They were explaining that most of these boys had grown up with a proclivity for pedophilia...but violent and young pedophilia.  We may now be seeing a DC RUN by these lost boys...

             Yes. It is a cycle of abuse. The victims grow up and are groomed and controlled to turn into the Protectors of the vicious system. It is the perfect way to keep the system going and keep it controlled and out of the public's eye.
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean just take Newsham the DC cop for example. One of the fbianon said Newsham is a pedo. He has covered up so many egregious crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wonder how many in our law enforcement agencies are covering this up and worse yet are in on the abuse and the monetary profits.

             As the saying goes, power has a way of corrupting people and making them do unthinkable things. Authority and POWER are two most abused things.

            This may explain why serial murders wherein the perpetrators are almost always white males occur only in America. I can recall only  one black male, one white female and one Spanish male that were serial killers. Otherwise always the while male single lone  nut. Think about it,  what other country has such occurrences?

            Once the MK programs have been studied,believed, and practiced, with millions of kids missing, one wonders how many could have been programmed? manchurianized?
Easy to shoot up schools, do some domestic terrorism, pretty much anything. None would be the wiser. 
Those who commit the crimes,end up dead, can never talk or be studied by the wrong hands, or they end up in a mental psychiatric jail since they are 'crazy' and incoherent.

             Exactly. What better way to keep this entire thing under control and out of the public's eye. The state is so quick to take CUSTODY of these poor children. Just look at what CPS is doing. Mental and rehab and so called "research and educational training" institutions are State owned and heavily rely upon State Tax payer  DOLLARS via research grants etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             God only knows the horrific experiments being conducted on these precious children.
            </p>
            <p>
             These monsters destroy the child's innocence and mind.

             This is sick.

             Society is a giant controlled experiment and we are all lab rats.

              I imagine today, the methods used are probably less experimental and more direct. They've have decades to perfect the minds splinter. Programming is probably way more simplistic than say using cow prods. I suspect some, satanic, maybe old schoolers, still do it for the sheer pleasure, but the real programmers that are all business, those that want something done usefully, don't waste any time.

              A lot of them were schooled at the studio.  They had tutors that conformed to their work hours.  There was also a little Red School House I think that Elizabeth Taylor went to and a couple other stars. That was many years ago.  This is all too much to process.  I say at this point we should start to research the info that

              has given us.  His is valuable information that we should listen to, imo. I have started some, but hope to look into their Schooling Programs that have very bad intentions for our children.
