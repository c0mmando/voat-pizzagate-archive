            In 1996, Belgium was shaken by tragedy. A man named Marc Dutroux, an unemployed electrician and father of three, had over the course of many years committed a series of kidnappings, rapes, and killings of a still-unknown number of teenage girls. Called the “Dutroux Affair,” the episode galvanized Belgium, and more than 300,000 Belgian citizens came together to express their anger and frustration in the handling of the case in the now-famous “White March.”
Belgian Prime Minster Dehaene turned to the U.S. National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) for help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in the mid 1990s, Belgium reached out to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, in request for assistance with their missing children issues. The NCMEC’s Board of Directors authorized the creation of a new organization that would devote itself to doing globally what NCMEC was committed to doing in the United States. In 1998, members of the Board of the newly created International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) held their first meeting, and in April 1999 it was launched by then First Lady Hillary Clinton, Lady Catherine Meyer, and Cherie Booth Blair, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Richard Branson’s mother, Eve Branson, was a founding board member of ICMEC in 1999 and served on the Board of Directors until 2005. Richard Branson was ICMEC’s founding sponsor. ICMEC is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity supported entirely by private funds and resources, and is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia. It is a non- government agency. It also has an Asia-Pacific office and Latin America &amp; The Caribbean office.
Bill and Hillary Clinton’s ties with Richard Branson go way back,(
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/22639">

            ) as well as forward. They are all currently working together on The Ten Island Challenge pilot program, which launched in 2012 and began with ten islands, and quickly evolved to over twenty islands, all throughout the drug and child trafficking transits in the Caribbean. Since their inception, they have now branched out to form alarming new partnerships and focus on the tourism and hotel industry. This Ten Island Challenge program, funded by GEF, an arm of the World Bank, OPIC, the Dutch postal code lottery, and the Norwegian government, has allegedly set out to setup islands with solar farms and renewable energy.
Most of these Caribbean islands have been deemed tier 2 &amp; 3 and are subject to U.S. aid restrictions due to their level of human trafficking and subjecting large populations to modern slavery – as the documentation reveals in this report. Based on Hillary’s portrayed background in fighting for children’s rights, why then would she wish to focus her energy on setting up a small solar farm to feed a block of homes on each of these islands – all of which include free solar systems to the government buildings – rather than fighting for the suffering children that reside on these islands?

            ICMEC and NCMEC have an obvious bond and through the NCMEC we have connections to Laura Silsby (arrested by Haitian police trying to extract 33 children at the border of the Dominican Republic). Perhaps these connections explain the intense interest displayed by Clinton and the State department regarding Silsby’s arrest.

            quote :" Who knew that the Clintons and Richard Branson were spearheading a renewable energy project across the entire Caribbean known as the ‘Ten Island Challenge’, locking in every island, forming a perimeter around all their favorite places, such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Aruba, Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Kenya, and Tanzania? If one didn’t know better, isn’t that the route drug traffickers and child traffickers utilize? It could just be a coincidence, but it sure is an interesting pattern."
"One island that seldom sees hurricane damage is Aruba. Interestingly, Aruba has always been known to be a major cocaine hub for trans-shipment to the United States. Despite this, in 1999, when Bill Clinton was president, Aruba was removed from the U.S. State Department’s list of major drug producing and transit countries. According to the case study posted on the World Bank’s website, the reason for the decline is “unclear”. Curious."
"Back in 1995 former President Bill Clinton put the “black list” into law, known as the Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNT). It is a database of all known people and companies across the world that have ties to drug traffickers, have been drug dealers or are involved in asset laundering. Locals in various countries refer to it as “The Clinton List”. Most people are familiar with this list, but many are not aware that Bill Clinton is the one who put this law in place. It’s a hell of a database containing names, addresses, known connections, and unique registry or taxpayer ID. Those working ports must cross-reference the list when allowing cargo through. In the right hands, that database would be highly beneficial – in the wrong hands, it could be detrimental by controlling and monopolizing the drug industry."
"As reported over the past five years, Aruba is a transit and destination country for women, men, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Venezuelan women are subjected to sex trafficking in Aruba, and foreign men and women are vulnerable to forced labor in the service and construction industries"

            In 2005, six years after the launch of ICMEC, it was estimated that 600,000 to 800,000 humans were trafficked across international borders each year, with 50% being minors, according to the U.S. Department of State, and according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), “global profits made from forced laborers exploited by private enterprises or agents reach $43 billion every year, of which $31.6 billion was from trafficked victims.” Nine years later, in 2014, the (ILO) reported “forced labor in the private economy generates $150 billion in illegal profits per year, three times more than previously estimated.”

             Quote : "À l'origine de l'affaire, l'arrestation d'un chauffeur de la Casa Pia, une célèbre institution publique chargée d'accueillir des enfants en situation de détresse. L'homme, connu dans les médias sous le surnom de " Bibi ", se serait rendu coupable d'une trentaine d'actes de violence sexuelle sur des mineurs. Il aurait aussi livré des enfants à de riches clients - une pratique qui remonte à plus de trente ans selon certaines victimes."

             Quote : "The Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal was a case of child sexual abuses involving a number of children and employees at Casa Pia, a Portuguese state-run institution for the education and support of poor children and under-age orphans"
"The scandal involved several prominent men, including TV presenter Carlos Cruz, former Casa Pia governor Manuel Abrantes, and former UNESCO ambassador Jorge Ritto"
"The Prime Minister at the time, José Manuel Durão Barroso, whose Social Democratic Party ousted the Socialists in March 2002, promised to bring life and honor back into the Casa Pia children's homes and allow new director Catalina Pestana to reform the institution. As a result, several senior staff of Casa Pia were fired after the 2002 revelations. However, Pestana told parliament and the media, as late as 2007, that there may still be paedophiles in the Casa Pia system. She also criticised the legal changes made after the start of the trial, which she claims were made in order to help those who were present to court."

             Suzanne Mubarak, First Lady of Egypt.

             </a>
             "To spend time with a supporter of Suzanne Mubarak is to get the tiniest glimpse of what it must have been like to be the Egyptian first lady before the Arab Spring: arrogant, deluded, out of touch. The revolution, her friends say, took the 70-year-old by surprise. Especially in her later years, Suzanne observed Cairo’s garbage-strewn streets through a gilded peephole. For her, walls were scrubbed, flowers planted, grass grown, Egyptians bribed to smile. If you were part of the royal convoy, Cairo was clean and Egyptians were happy."
"With her husband on trial for his life, Egypt’s former first lady has all but vanished. She reportedly suffered a panic attack in May, after being detained and questioned over illegal acquisition of wealth. She was released quickly after forfeiting $3.4 million and a Cairo villa—though some estimates place the family wealth in the billions."

              Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol - is a Thai royal diplomat and princess of Thailand, the first grandchild of King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit of Thailand, and the only one of the seven children of King Maha Vajralongkorn born to his first wife Princess Soamsavali.
The Thai royal family is one of the richest dynasties in the world. Forget the luxurious European villas or the fancy sports cars; it comes a dime a dozen when your net worth is $30 billion.
Well, that was the estimated worth of his late father, King Bhumibol — and as the heir apparent, it looks like Prince Vajiralongkorn won’t be short of a dollar any time soon.$

              .. on a side note.. Queen Silvia of Sweden (born Silvia Renate Sommerlath on 23 December 1943, in Heidelberg) is the spouse of King Carl XVI Gustaf and mother of the heir apparent to the throne.
Queen Silvia is involved in numerous charity organizations, especially in the area of disadvantaged children, and has made several public statements about human rights and the sexual exploitation of children. On her own initiative, she alone watched videos confiscated by the police, of sexually abused children in an early pedophile tangle. The statement she made to the press became an eye opener for many people that the problem exists.

              Jolanta Kwasniewska  is married to Aleksander Zdzislaw Kwasniewski

              "it was revealed that Kwasniewski had falsified his tax return. He "forgot" to mention that his wife, Jolanta, held stock in a publicly traded insurance company and made about $15,000 per year on it"
"October and November 1995), Kwasniewski perjured himself while filing an affidavit with the federal electoral commission. In addition to denying his involvement with the Communist secret police, he also falsely claimed that he had graduated from the University of Gdansk with a master's degree."
"Kwasniewski loaned his own apartment to a friend, Wladyslaw Wapinski, who was a convicted drug dealer. Wapinski, who had also been convicted on illegal weapon's possession and traveling on a false passport, later, in 2003, was implicated in an embezzlement case involving the procurement of state funds ($30 million) -- secured through Kwasniewski -- for a phony "blood deposit laboratory" that was never built. The president was also friendly with a number of other unsavory characters, including Marek Dochnal. Their mutual dealings would surface in October 2004 when the Orlen gasoline company scandal broke out and Dochnal was arrested. Kwasniewski disavowed knowing the man, but after the media produced a picture of the two together in 1997, the President fell silent."
"In March 1996, in the Bialowieza Forest, Kwasniewski met Aleksandr Lukashenka of Belorussia, where the former allegedly became so intoxicated that, following the meeting, he attempted, in full view of the cameras, to enter his limo through the trunk. In September 1996, Kwasniewski was photographed at the United Nations wrapping himself in a Polish flag. He was allegedly drunk again. Last but not least, in September 1999, while attending the solemn ceremony to commemorate the Polish officers shot by the NKVD in the Katyn Forest, Kwasniewski got drunk, staggered, mumbled, and was unable to walk by himself"
" Kwasniewski encouraged his own chief of staff, post-Communist Marek Siwiec, to mock John Paul II. To the president's great amusement, Siwiec descended from the presidential helicopter, "blessed" everyone with a sign of the cross, prostrated himself, and kissed the ground."
" Kwasniewski was among several high-ranking post-Communist officials who acquired luxurious, municipally owned apartments and homes for peanuts. "
" he awarded Poland's equivalent of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to one Stanislaw Suproniuk, a prominent torturer from the Stalinist era. This secret policeman's claim to fame is that he kidnapped a pregnant wife of a pro-Western underground commander and shot her dead. She was eight months pregnant at the time of her death."
"Kwasniewski pardoned the post-Communist deputy minister of Justice Zbigniew Sobotka, who had warned gangsters about a planned police operation against them"

               Tony Podesta,  longtime lobbyist in DC, and founder of the Podesta Group, was indicted in 2017 for violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Shortly thereafter, the Podesta Group closed up shop. 
John and Tony are very close with the Clintons, have worked together for decades, and even grew up in the Chicago area just 14-minutes away from each other – the Podesta’s in Jefferson Park, and Hillary Rodham Clinton in Park Ridge, IL.
Then, in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller offered Tony Podesta immunity to testify against Paul Manafort, who had worked with the Podesta Group in a public relations campaign for the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, founded by three senior members of the pro-Russia Party of Regions – and who had been indicted on bank and tax fraud charges. Paul Manafort was sentenced to 7-1/2 years in prison. Meanwhile, Tony seems to have skated into the wind.
In addition to Tony’s own collection of disturbing art surrounding children, his manager, as well as artists they bring into their exhibits, are equally disturbing. One such exhibit included artwork by ArtAngel, founded by Roger Took, a convicted pedophile in the worst degree imaginable.

               The Podesta brothers are close friends with Marina Ambramovic, a Siberian performance artist and film producer who is best known for her provocative, and to some – disturbing, art exhibitions and spirit cooking parties. Ambramovic’s book “Spirit Cooking with Essential Aphrodisiac Recipes” was released in 1996, utilizing ingredients such as fresh sperm milk, breast milk, and fresh morning urine. The spirit cooking festivities typically include feasting on replicas of full-size bodies with edible ingredients that give the effects of oozing blood and tissue.

                One correction - Marina Abramovic is not "Siberian", she is a Serbian Jew. (as her Wikipedia page said before Pizzagate). Now she is portrayed simply as Serbian, rather than Jewish, since the ritual cannibalism and witchcraft scandal. There are various threads on here that go into her background, with some very powerful ancestors.

                On January 29, 2010, Laura Silsby was arrested at the Haitian border for trying to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti, allegedly into an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, without documentation.https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10BUENOSAIRES166_a.html
"Media continued to focus on the fate of the U.S. missionaries being held on trafficking charges, with one headline referring to them as "appropriators.""

               <p>
                Charity involvement in child and organ trafficking is a concerning issue; these concerns were repeated in 2010, this time in Haiti with the Laura Silsby child debacle.
The accusations mirrored similar comments made by the Prime Minister of Haiti in an interview with CNN where he accused American NGOs of removing children for the express purpose of selling them to pedophilia and organ trafficking rings.

This is not the first time that a member of Oxfam would be swept up in a highly publicized sex abuse scandal. British press reports indicate that Caroline Thomas, who became Chair of Oxfam in 2016, previously served as an executive at BBC during the emergence of the Jimmy Saville pedophile revelations.]

                Jorge Torres, the lawyer Silsby retained after her arrest, was arrested in connection with an international smuggling ring that trafficked children and women from Central American and Haiti into the United States. He was a fugitive from justice when he was indicted in 2003 on charges of conspiring to smuggle aliens from Central America into the United States through Canada in 2002. He was hiding out in Canada under the name “George Simard” after a 1999 bank fraud conviction. The U.S. government was unable to locate him in 2003, but they tracked him once he showed up in the media, representing the Laura Silsby case, and going under the assumed name “Jorge Torres Puello.” He was extradited, plead guilty, and was sentenced on alien smuggling charges, to serve 3-years and 1-month in prison.
At that time, Jorge Torres was wanted by four countries in connection with charges including sex trafficking of girls and women, and making counterfeit documents and violating parole. He was wanted in El Salvador for bringing women and girls from Central America and the Caribbean into El Salvador and luring them into prostitution. Jorge’s wife was arrested for holding girls captive in a Nicaraguan house, and they had documentation indicating that they may have had protection from government officials.
All of the Americans were released with exception of the leader Laura Silsby, who they wanted to further question about the children, as well as her connection to Jorge Torres Puello.

                On February 7, 2010, Bill Clinton, then-special envoy for the United Nations, suddenly took up an interest in this case, intervened and struck a diplomatic deal for the release of the 9 American missionaries that were in a jail on child abduction charges, except Laura Silsby who the judge still had questions for.  (It was one of his first official acts after arriving in the country.
Just two days after Bill’s intervention, Hillary Clinton, Cheryl Mills, and several others were communicating in an email thread about USG’s options regarding the 10 Amcits, only the page containing the “options” is “denied” from being seen. In a cryptic message at the bottom, it states, “Cheryl asked for a memo from L for S BY TOMW AM outlining S’s options re the Amcits. Her questions:”

                Laura Silsby’s charges were miraculously reduced to “arranging irregular travel,” which got her a 6-month prison sentence in Haiti. On May 17, she was found guilty and sentenced to the time served in jail prior to the trial.
Silsby returned to Idaho where she married in 2015, and took the last name Gayler. She became the Vice President of Marketing for AlertSense who works with the federal government on FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System (IPAWS), including the Amber Alerts when kidnappings occur.

                 “    Hasty deportations of unaccompanied Central American minors violate international children’s rights.The United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of the Child outlines these child-specific rights and legal protections for anyone under the age of eighteen. Further, the current position of Congress and the Obama administration – to overhaul the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and deny fair trials that recognize refugee, asylee and trafficking victim statuses – is unacceptable for a nation claiming to lead the global fight against trafficking in persons.

                 one of Monica's last messages that she sent to a friend..
"I can’t say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton’s Caraol Complex. And mining has always been historically linked to trafficking, slavery, and labor exploitation. I’d like to go see for myself who’s laboring at Morne Bossa, but I would hypothesize that the Dominicans are doing the contractual oversight of the mining, while marginalized Haitians are being exploited for low or no cost labor in dangerous mining conditions.   That’s two huge human trafficking scandals, an environmental degradation scandal, a social displacement scandal, a Presidential election scandal, a scandal  with billions in unaccounted for earthquake aid… all leading directly back to the Clintons racist cronyism in Haiti.”

                 (as a side note... Anyone remember Sarkozy and Hillary getting in on in Libya.. we came, we saw, he died, cackle cackle cackle...)
(Clinton went to Paris in March 2011 to meet with Mahmoud Jibril the Libyan Rebel Leader.  1 month after Gaddafi had massacred 1000 civils in an uprising earlier that year, she also met with Sarkozy as well.  Where they probably planned the overthrow and assassination of Gaddafi.. (Gaddafi may probably escaped if his convoy hadnt been explosed by Drones and French Rafale Jetplanes..)

                 "According to sensitive information available to this these individuals, Qaddafi's government holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver. During late March, 2011 these stocks were moved to SABHA (south west in the direction of the Libyan border with Niger and Chad); taken from the vaults of the Libyan Central Bank in Tripoli.....valued at more than $7 billion. French intelligence officers discovered this plan shortly after the current rebellion began, and this was one of the factors that influenced President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to commit France to the attack on Libya."

                 Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, was a board member of a North Carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to Haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president Bill Clinton through the Clinton Foundation.
Another board member of the firm, VCS Mining, was former Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, who co-chaired the charitable Interim Haiti Recovery Commission with Mr. Clinton.

             Comet should still be included in articles like this one. With analysis of who build Comet, their activity, connections and stuff, what is Comet about and what symbol it used and what symbols were used by businesses around Comet and who are the owners and what's their activity as well. Clintons money was running heavily throughout all those locals and they've established connections there.

            Hillary Clinton has spent almost all her career educating her self in areas of child right law and child care. At the same time she fraternize with a wide variety of known child sex offenders, handlers and kidnappers involved with child trafficking. Could it be a coincident or does it have to be a pattern. The conclusions above are Corey Lynns own.

             Council of Europe :
The Council of Europe (CoE; French: Conseil de l'Europe) is an international organisation whose stated aim is to uphold human rights, democracy, 
rule of law in Europe and promote European culture.  Founded in 1949, it has 47 member states, covers approximately 820 million people 
and operates with an annual budget of approximately half a billion euros. 
Unlike the EU, the Council of Europe cannot make binding laws, but it does have the power to enforce select international agreements reached by 
European states on various topics. The best known body of the Council of Europe is the European Court of Human Rights, 
which enforces the European Convention on Human Rights.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Statutute of the Council of Europe as of 2013, has been ratified or acceded to by 47 European states. 
All European states have ratified the Statute with the exception of Belarus and Vatican City. (HUMAN RIGHTS?? THE VATICAN CITY??

             oops.. there she is again with Alefantis.. doesnt look like the same 'date'....
            </p>
            <p>
             She is also member of the Club of Budapest, which was put into place by Ervin László.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1993, in response to his experience with the Club of Rome, he founded the Club of Budapest to, in his words, "centre attention on the evolution 
of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors in changing course — from a race towards degradation, polarization and disaster 
to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics and global sustainability"
            </p>
            <p>
             László's 2004 book, Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything posits a field of information as the substance of the cosmos. 
Using the Sanskrit and Vedic term for "space", Akasha, he calls this information field the "Akashic field" or "A-field". 
He posits that the "quantum vacuum" (see Vacuum state) is the fundamental energy and information-carrying field that informs not just the 
current universe, but all universes past and present (collectively, the "Metaverse").
László believes that such an informational field can explain why our universe appears to be fine-tuned so as to form galaxies and conscious lifeforms; 
and why evolution is an informed, not random, process. He believes that the hypothesis solves several problems that emerge from 
quantum physics, especially nonlocality and quantum entanglement
