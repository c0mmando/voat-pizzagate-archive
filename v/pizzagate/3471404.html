<p>&quot;James Kohut, 59, had been in custody since May 2017 when authorities accused him and two women of running a child-sex ring.</p>
<p>The cause and manner of his death have not been determined, but the Santa Cruz Sheriff’s Office said he was alone and appears to have killed himself. Kohut, who was in a protective housing unit at the Santa Cruz County main jail, was found dead when breakfast service began at 5:45 a.m., according to a news release.</p>
<p>Police arrested Kohut after they obtained a video that allegedly showed him sexually assaulting children. Nurses Rashel Brandon and Emily Stephens were also implicated.</p>
<p>Shortly after his arrest, prosecutors said he had written a suicide note, but his lawyer said Kohut was just experiencing a “dark night of the soul” and he was later deemed not be a suicide risk.</p>

            Bingo. My first thought was Epstein as we’ll. This guy was a procurer for higher ups imo. He was in Protective Custody? WTH?  There is much cover up in Cal. regarding these cases. Cops judges lawyers etc. are all covering up. Those two women are next?  I would be scared. But they really deserved what they got. Too bad he didn’t get to serve his time in jail. He also escaped what the prisoners do to Child molesters.

            Notice how prosecutors slow rolled his court case for over 2.5 years until the opportunity arose where they could take him out.

            When this story first appeared, it had all the markings of a wider network.

              Read Tranceformation/Kathy Obrien again recently.  Pretty scary and you are right this guy was very involved.  I bet he is in witness protection and spilling.

               Torture, hardcore sexual abuse from young age, electric shock therapy, combined with Words, colors etc.  UCLA, Stanford on the west coast have all the tools.  But if you believe Tranceformation/Obrien to be true there are a lot of trained handlers out there and some are in Congress.
