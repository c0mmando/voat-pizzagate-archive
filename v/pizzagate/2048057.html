<p><em>The head of the Salvadoran border police, Commissioner Jorge Callejas, said in a telephone interview that he was investigating accusations that a man with a Dominican passport that identified him as Jorge Anibal Torres Puello led a human trafficking ring that recruited Dominican women and under-age Nicaraguan girls by offering them jobs and then putting them to work as prostitutes in El Salvador.</em></p>

            No. I should have made that clearer. The real evidence will never be released ever. That's what a limited hang out is. They give you just enough to keep you occupied. Like the Laura Silsby and Jorge Puello story. You're right people dug that up on their own but they conceded that. Did anyone go to jail based on that info? God no. In fact The Laura Silsby story was ambiguous enough to make Hillary look like a humanitarian for helping get a poor tortured Christian missionary out of jail just for trying to save children. It was all a pile of bull shit, Silsby is guilty as sin but it worked. Hillary didn't go to jail she just lost the election.

            "James Alefantis at Comet Ping Pong was a psy-op....Ridiculous"

           <p>
            JA and CPP were a psy-op. JA at Pegasus was NOT a psy-op. No one knows about Pegasus but everyone knows about CPP. I'm not trying to spin anything I'm just telling it like it is. We lost and they won. We fell in their trap. Don't get mad at me for stating the obvious. The worst thing that could happen right now is if we keep thinking we have any chance of winning on our current course.

             This is gonna hurt a bit, but bear w/ me. You may perceive value. Once upon a time we had a great lead guitarist. Relatively. You see, he was good, but only AFTER he could jump in w/ his cool solo AFTER the song was already going, after the song was already started. But, not being able to start the song, cause he was unfit for that, and would screw it up and fumble the strings, made him, actually, NOT a great lead guitarist. He could not cut it in the REAL World. So he became useless to us. The RHYTHM guitarist became more valuable to us because at least he could begin the tune. So someone may be a great talent, or intellectually capable, but fail in real life, cause they can't BEGIN correctly. And like this guitarist, they have to hide and become heroes only after someone else got the ball rolling.

              They wouldnt lift a FINGER to do anything real, theyre spectators bro!  And the slower they are the more damning it will eventually be and we can rescind womens right to vote as a bad idea.

               Well this is gonna get me in trouble but that first statement, yeah, I would take it all the way back to only property owners, if that were possible.
              </p>
              <p>
               And the second statement, that's neat that you can relate. It's true. I was so bad on guitar I had to switch to bass. But I could sing pretty decently. Anyway, we just all around sucked as a band anyway. You don't see me on any marquee's does ya :)

                Wtf are you talkinf about dude? We cant rescind a privilege we afforded them at 11:59:59 PM of our existence? Every single morsel they put into their mouths is because a man provided it. What are you even doing here then, why solve a murder on the titanic when we will all go down soon?  Shame on you for that attitude. Women even initiate more divorces than men knowing theyre entitled to supplementary income thru the state or the ex himself. Men and women dont exist in competition, that is a Jewish lie and you know it.  Jews are OPENLY PROUD OF THEIR ROLE IN THINGS LIKE FEMINISM AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC DECLINE OF WHITES!

                 I'm not disagreeing with you, maybe you misunderstand. I'm old school and biblical on these things, gets me in a lot of trouble. I've got plenty of guy friends whose clock has been cleaned and they're pretty bitter.

                 Yes, I know, I agree! Whether you like Trump or not you'd certainly like many aspects of his (mum's) church in this regard. I'm a white civil rights proponent bigly.

              You are exactly right. If everyone would just research what and who Ashekenazi is and who they became problem solved. Was saying that 8 months ago.

                 I found this as well. How many here know? I'm kind of new and came over from pol when the Rothschild news hit cause I thought everyone should know this here. From the looks of the Rothschild news not many understand. Do you know about Napa Valley?

                  Yes. I know. Very few here do eventhough I have explained this too them. They are set in their ways. I have a lot of evidence to back this up been posted but attacked by shills. Hoping you are an intellect and over all good guy/girl who could team up with me to possibly start our own sub on this topic. I know many who would contribute. Intellectuals but that also believe in the historic knowledge of the Bible. Would you be interesting. Your identity is completely confidentisl as it is now but I need some super smart and intuitive people to join forces who have knowledge in history, science, some scripture (possibly) religion of different types, etc. you would not need to be an expert in anything but just have things to add. Let me know if your interested. Your confidentiality is always safe with me. Thanks Jem ;)

                   I'm with you 100%. Just let me know. Religion has always been my strong point and I'm always looking for the truth through research another strong point but I'm normally on my own cause at this point I don't know who to trust with all the information. I also don't know all the information yet so it would be really nice to compare and I don't think this is the place. It's already being hit hard. Thank you.

                   Very few people have used the term Non Sequitur. But you and your alt equineluvr do. There are so many things I've seen that give you away. You're not good at this. So many people have called you out. Keep screwing up. The more you post, the more obvious it becomes you dumb fuck.

                On the surface, yes - your right. However, remember this quote from Pope Francis..
               </p>
               <p>
                '‘Inside Every Christian Is A Jew''
               </p>
               <p>
                Christianity is Jewish.
               </p>
               <p>
                Note the Pope is crying over Holocaust truth. See the Jews have always run the Catholic Church. They even created it. Unlike the false claims the Vatican did everything possible to destroy the National Socialist Government from inside Germany. The Pope admits the Vatican protected the Jews the whole time. Just like in the past when the Jews got kicked out they would always flee to Papal sanctuary. And be given the utmost protection by the Church. Which was noted by many Europeans of the time. Part of the anti-Catholic movement in Europe was due to the total Jewishness of the Church and its controllers. From the Jewish Popes to the Jewish Jesuits. And down. This is why known crypto Jew.
                <strong>
                 Martin Luther
                </strong>
                had to play the anti=Jewish card so strongly to appear as a convincing leader. To keep this program going and as European's where leaving xianity as Jewish all together and moving back towards the Pagan metaphysical culture. The Church was not powerful till the late 15th century. There was still Pagan regions of Europe into the 18th century.
               </p>
               <p>
                Is there any Pope which was not a Jew?

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               REVOLUTION
              </p>
              <p>
               "We are the Fathers of all Revolutions - even of those which sometimes happen to turn against us.  We are the supreme Masters of Peace and War.  We can boast of being the Creators of the REFORMATION!  Calvin was one of our Children; he was of Jewish descent, and was entrusted by Jewish authority and encouraged with Jewish finance to draft his scheme in the Reformation.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Martin Luther yielded to the influence of his Jewish friends, and again, by Jewish authority and with Jewish finance, his plot against the Catholic Church met with success...
              </p>
              <p>
               "Thanks to our propaganda, to our theories of Liberalism and to our misrepresentations of Freedom, the minds of many among the Gentiles were ready to welcome the Reformation.  They separated from the Church to fall into our snare.  And thus the Catholic Church has been very sensibly weakened, and her authority over the Kings of the Gentiles has been reduced almost to naught..
.
"We are grateful to Protestants for their loyalty to our wishes - although most of them are, in the sincerity of their faith, unaware of their loyalty to us. We are grateful to them for the wonderful help they are giving us in our fight against the stronghold of Christian Civilization, and in our preparations for the advent of our supremacy over the whole world and over the Kingdoms of the Gentiles.
              </p>
              <p>
               "So far we have succeeded in overthrowing most of the Thrones of Europe.  The rest will follow in the near future.  Russia has already worshiped our rule, France, with her Masonic Government, is under our thumb.  England, in her dependence upon our finance is under our heel; and in her Protestantism is our hope for the destruction of the Catholic Church.  Spain and Mexico are but toys in our hands.  And many other countries, including the U.S.A., have already fallen before our scheming.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Not to mention Protestantism's LONG history of collaboration with the ZIONIST movement and pro-Jewish dispensation in general.

               Lol. Nice revisionist history. Well, I guess this statement proves it. Masters of the Universe. Craftier than Almighty God. Tell me, how did these evil Jews get so evil and monolithic? (And I don't disagree on this point.) Was it just an organic, natural phenomenon, or was it supernatural? Is there no hope? Is there no stopping them? You should dig a little more into Martin Luther. Are you an atheist? Just curious. The hell w/ "protestants" long history ... they've been apostate for several hundred years now, very few real Christians exist today. Hagee is a false prophet Zionist. You'll have to do better w/ me, it's not that simple. Also ... call no man on earth "father," not even Henry Makow, nor the Elders of the Protocols, nor Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Knox. Etc.

                 Wow, that's quite a combo, the theology is a little hodge-podge? I'm from a Scottish Reformed Church that dates back to the martyrs who were persecuted and burned by Papists, so there's still a lot of bitterness. Just like here in the south USA people are still bitter, and Lincoln is no hero. Thanks for explaining appreciate that. Yeah it's these big US churches and others that are in bed w/ Israel, their theology is off, dispensationalists, who imbibed the Hal Lindsey nonsense about the physical restoration of the Jewish temple and animal sacrifices. The older writers are the most trustworthy, 1600's.

               Stop the Jew garbage! This is greatly involved with the gentile Christians, probably more so than Jews. God is always planting nations and plucking them up! The English people being able to move into this land had nothing to do whether Columbus was a Jew. It had everything to do with the Native Americans.

               Thanks. You would be surprised possibly what you and I would agree on. I appreciate the link. But there are some people on here who do much more harm than good when it comes to redpilling on the JQ. I appreciate your tact.

             Who was Laura Silsby and the missionaries and Pastor Clint Henry working for or gathering the children for?  And why was president of the Sephardic Jewish community Jorge Puello so quick to defend them for FREE.

            Whether or not there are jews who are involved in the sick level of child trafficking we see around the world, the problem is disgusting people in general. Is there a statistical skew in the number of the people involved per religion or race or anything else? Maybe? Not that it's easy at all to do any kind of statistical analysis. The shamed Catholic priests are certainly not Jewish.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are better off distinguishing between disgusting/not disgusting people. That's the line we need to care about. Focusing anywhere else creates division both within the community resisting this evil and also among people who refuse to be receptive to the message due to perceived bigoted overtones.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep doing research and keep connecting the dots to disgusting people. If there are clusters of churches, lodges, politicians, or other groups associated with these crimes, point them out specifically and talk about the networking. But that's different from painting such broad strokes.

              Yes, there are temples and synagogues that are suspect. We should pay attention to them. But the idea that every single one of them is suspect seems absurd to me and to most people and that will turn people's attention away from the problem.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look, we are or should be on the same side of the whole issue of the horrors of child trafficking. The point I'm making is that overly broad accusations are unfair and that unfairness will turn people away from paying proper attention to the real issues.

              No, most churches nowadays are phony washed out hypocritical institutions, why would anyone think any different of them supporting this faggot than a synagogue? Maybe Baptists. But United Methodist w/ their fag preachers wouldn't support Jimmy Boy? And you would think I'm disagreeing w/ you. Could it not also have to do with "location, location, location"? And circumstance? Possibly Almighty God, who has indeed cursed the Jews, decreed this support? But again, that would be a problematic proposition for you atheists (I actually like you tho RedditSucks), it's just other FAGS on here that run around puking on every thread about the Jews but give no info cause they're so damned privileged and wise themselves that they just CANNOT share it. It's of such intellectual VALUE!!

             Why does it matter to you since you think pizzagate is a psyop?  I mean here we have Laura Silsby who was caught trying to take around ~40 kids across the border twice and in an email asking for donations and funds from Hilary Clinton;

              The crimes are real it's how the evidence was released that was the psy-op. Silsby and Jorge Puello are real but we weren't fed that in the beginning. We got get Comet Ping Pong in the beginning and that was fake as fuck.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you see the difference? Pizzagate is a limited hangout. There is real evidence there but the worst shit is hidden. I guarantee you there are emails and images that would get Bill and Hillary arrested by tomorrow morning but we aren't fed that evidence. We're fed just enough to make it interesting without getting anyone arrested.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have we not been at this for 9 months without a single high level arrest?

               Are you forgetting about the last 6 months of evidence? Holy cow. How can you say James Alefantis is not complicit in this. Have you forgotten of the clear as day Pedo symbolism that just about %80 of the Comet Pizza performing bands use in their music videos? You must have forgotten that Comet Pizza was never claimed (by the people) to have an underground sex ring. That is the bull shit... What's true is this fucker Alefantis is %100 complicit and in partnership with Podesta brothers, David Brock, and the Clintons..... Stay awake my friend.

                I didn't say that. James Alefantis at Comet Ping Pong was a psy-op. But James Alefantis at Pegasus needs more research.

                But you're missing my point which is FBIAnon, George Webb, the Podesta email dump, Wikileaks, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden are all limited hangouts. Trump won the election because the Deep State wanted him to win the election.
               </p>
               <p>
                Trump is in on it. Drain the Swamp is just another bull shit psy-op to keep people occupied and thinking they have Trump on their side. He's not on their side.

               There are reasons unknown as to why the information was leaked the way it was.  It was a controlled leak but this happens for a few reasons...It could be a preemptive attack to control the narrative of the leaks and try to control the investigation and they had to make it juicy and entertaining enough to distract the public from something.  But to distract them from what?...was it to distract the public that these emails were coming out and already being investigated?  Was it to distract them from the

               released by the State Department because of the FOIA requests.  THAT is when the "pizzagate" investigation really started.  That was the "WTF is going on" moment for me at least.

                I wasn't a distraction. The Podesta emails were released to get Trump elected. Some part of the Deep State gave up on Hillary Clinton and decided she had to go.
               </p>
               <p>
                That's the only explanation that fits Wikileaks publishing those emails. Wikileaks is a CIA/Mossad limited hangout. There is no question anymore. So why on Earth would they have released those explosive Podesta emails unless they wanted to sink Hillary Clinton?

                 If the plan was to not get Hillary elected then they would have crucified her in the Media...the Media makes or breaks candidates and her emails were still coming out from the State Dept....although very quietly with zero media coverage.

                 <p>
                  That's easily explained if the people bring her down within the Deep State were a tiny few at the top. It was probably only a few people like Kissinger, Pieczenik and a few others. All I know is the CIA runs Wikileaks and if they wanted to protect Hillary they would have sat on the Podesta emails but they didn't. The CIA released the Podesta emails a month before the election and it was obviously devastating.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Maybe there's a civil war within the CIA as well. Whatever the case the order to dump Hillary came from the very top. It wasn't an organic decision by some low level FBI staffer like FBIAnon. I never bought his story about not being high enough within the FBI to be noticed. He made the Trump/Tesla document the first in a big release of documents. How hard would that have been to track down? It would have been easy. Just find out who in the FBI chose the order of the documents released. Done. End of story.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It was a set up from the very beginning.

              Kings of the earth are committing fornication with the whore church. Laura Silsby, the Baptist missionaries are the whore church, Hillary and Bill are the kings in this case. Hard to explain! Our churches got demon possessed over the years. No one in them is a real Christian. Hard to believe but very true. I really do think God brought   Pizzagate so some people would finally see this and to set the kids free. They were prayed for, so they would get free. That is the power of prayer!!!
