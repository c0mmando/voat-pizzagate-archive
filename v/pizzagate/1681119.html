            Delusions of grandeur
           </h1>
           <p>
            Grandiose delusions (GD), delusions of grandeur, expansive delusions or megalomania are a subtype of delusion that occur in patients suffering from a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including two-thirds of patients in manic state of bipolar disorder, half of those with schizophrenia, patients with the grandiose subtype of delusional disorder, and a substantial portion of those with substance abuse disorders. GDs are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, omnipotent, wealthy, or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic and typically have a religious, science fictional, or supernatural theme.

             <h1>
              Manic Phase
             </h1>
             <p>
              During this phase, people have an elevated mood, or “high,” which includes feelings of increased self-esteem and uniqueness. They often overestimate how much they can do and the quality of their ideas. Judgment becomes impaired and patients feel powerful over painful consequences. They feel “bulletproof” and have little regret or concern for their actions. They may have many ideas and lots of energy to carry them out.
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               The abundance of thoughts may be difficult to follow;
              </em>
              such thoughts are called racing thoughts or pressured speech.
              <em>
               People in manic episode may feel such an extreme pressure to keep talking
              </em>
              that others do not have the opportunity to interrupt them. Manic patients’ minds are working so fast that they come up with rhymes or sing-song phrases, burst out in song or start dancing spontaneously. Their daily behavior can become disorganized or even dangerous to the point that they require hospitalization.
             </p>
             <p>
              Manic episodes can also have psychotic symptoms present. Psychosis is a state in which a person is unable to tell the difference from reality and unreality. Psychosis symptoms include hallucinations, false beliefs about having special powers or identity (such as superhuman strength or X-ray vision). Psychotic symptoms indicate a severe mood episode that requires immediate medical attention and treatment.
             </p>
             <p>
              People experiencing mania might begin several activities at once, never doubting that they can complete all of them. They may have so much energy that they operate on two or three hours of sleep each day. All of this energy can exhaust the family, friends and co-workers of a person with bipolar

            I'm fairly positive my kidnapping and trafficking was related since those involved worked at a pizza restaurant, were all Satanists, and my transporter was a victim of Satanic Ritualistic Abuse among other oddities.

            I got away though. Can't catch me, fuckers. I'm still alive and breathing. You're all slipping and getting rather sloppy. 😏😊❤

            Oh honey if there is a list I've been on it a long time ago.  I'm mouthy about the truth.  In fact I've been through a lawsuit before when I said boo to a rich and powerful person.  Meh. They have to Prove it!   I just hired a fight fire with fire lawyer and it all went away. Don't be afraid.  Look at pictures of goats standing on nearly vertical walls. That is US.

             Paradoxically, our strength and safety increases exponentially when we become braver individually, there are just too many of us now for them to silence us all. Lies are usually whispered, but Truth can and must be spoken loudly and freely in the open, or society fails. The unfortunate circumstances that led to the press being co-opted through perversion, greed, blackmail and incompetence has allowed the lies to be churned out by the corrupt to the core MSM propaganda machine 24/7/365 for far too long. Freedom of the press does not mean freedom to engage in cover-ups, deception and political favoritism.  Trump is on it, but he needs to rout out the traitors in his immediate entourage. We must all focus our intent on that to happen and I firmly believe that it will.

            Well, that list must be big and its growing fast. For example PIZZAGATE Angela has already almost 16 k followers in Twitter. I got a feeling this train isn't going to stop anymore.
