            I think they are trying to ease people into believing that all kinds of people are after him so that they can kill him and can easily blame some random Trump hater. I've thought this for a while now.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have the fence hopper st the White House that bypassed alarms and security and made it within 15 feet of the door. He was there for 15 minutes before being caught. Are you kidding me?!
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there was the one in the car at the White House that had a bomb in the car.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is an FBI car that was parked in a driveway that was broken into. Supposedly, a laptop was stolen with The Trump Hotels floor plans and all escape routes. They also got away with an official FBI Lapel which could make security let someone pass without clearance.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's even more and the more they show these stories, the easier it will be to fool the libtards that the murder of Trump was a disgruntled citizen. It's all lead up to a false flag operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our president is in real danger.  Not only did he screw up these psycho's New World Order Agenda, but now he's cracking the whip and going after the corrupt. They are scared and desperate. If they can't impeach him, then what's the next best thing? Murder. I don't know how he even trusts what they feed him. I wouldn't touch a bite that the White House staff serves him!

               I did not vote for him.  I am willing to give him a chance.  I remember when Kennedy was assassinated and even many who did not vote for him stood crying.  It would be a sad thing for this country.  And a very dangerous one as well.

                 No.  I was in school.  But I remember during the funeral and up to that time.  It lasted for days.  People did not go to work unless they had to.  The country almost stood still.  At least, that is how it seemed to me.  But on tv and in church and everywhere we went some people would say I did not vote for him but it is so horrible.  I remember finally taking the bus and going to school and two people were discussing it.  The tears came down and others cried as well.  It was one of the most moving things in my life. The funeral was televised and we all stayed home to watch it.  I did see the actual assassination of Bobby Kennedy live and it has stayed with me until this day.  That's why they killed John John too.  Any of them would have made a wonderful President.

                   Yes, somewhat similar.  I think a lot of people were very afraid.  It was a shocking event and made people realize that any President, even the one they voted for could be a victim as well.  I only wish we had the internet, then we would not be going through what we have today.  It scares me what May just announced, that we need to have countries come together and clamp down on the internet.  They must be stopped.

                     One thing we can feel positive about is that we have been woken up.  So woken up and shaken, that we are ready for the truth no matter what it is.  I believe that those of us that have been awakened are ready to push forward.  And push really hard.

                       I have two friends.  One is pretty red pilled but not scarlet red.  The other is probably a light pink.  The red one has suggested we go to DC when all this is over (if safe) and the other one said. Why?  We said to take back our country.  To take it back from the Oligarchs!  I am SSSSOOOOOO   Ready!  And I know you are too:-)

                        You're lucky. I live surrounded by hard core liberals. I only have 1 friend that is redpilled! I'm a huge Trump supporter but wouldn't feel safe wearing a Make America Great Again shirt here. That would be fun to go to DC!

                         Well, we the three of us are Progressives and we are sick of some others that are drinking that Fool-Aid, and wearing those kitty hats and screaming Resistance.  We keep yelling, Hello, remember what you said about leaving the party when we came back from Philly?  They are dazed and confused, so I will forgive them, for when it hits them they will have a breakdown.

                           Well, with this election it was so crazy, at least here, there were friends of mine that voted for Hillary and Bernie AND Trump. I also know my son voted for Hillary because he has Hispanics on his wife's side and was so angered by many of the things he heard about Mexicans.   A lifelong Dem that I know said, I just had to vote for Trump.  I said i know, I know. I think that happened all over the country though.  I never want that to happen again in this country.  I will never again stand by a President so much again.  We both voted and worked for Obama and now I cannot stand the sight of him.  Traitor.

            The first article is so full of holes I don't know where to start.  They think he is not a danger to the people like the president but they seized his guns?  Newsham the Pedo says he did not know if he had gun  license in Penn.?  Well, as my father in law use to say "Have you got hooks in your arse?".  Does he not have the power to call another town in another state on such an important matter?  This reeks like 3 day old fish. Hmm.  In the second article seems like the Penn. police would have been glad to give Newsham that info since they were the ones that warned him this guy was on the way.  Something certainly is up.  I also don't trust the DC police dept.  They are beholding to the Deep State.
