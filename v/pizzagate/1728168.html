<p>As we all know, MK-ultra/ monarch mind control, plays a big role in what we are dealing with here on pizzagate/ pedogate and she gives us very detailed insight into those topics and what it does to people. </p>
<p>Her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCA9OSLIKXihDMwvfzSronQ">channel</a> doesn\'t seem to be very popular around pg- researchers or in general, so it\'s worth a post for sure.</p>
<p>Below I will post few of her videos to give you a little overview and a good point to start, because for people new to her channel it can be a little confusing, since there are videos about many different topics, taken by her different alters and also videos recorded before she was even aware she has dissociative identity disorder and that she is a victim of monarch mind control.</p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mfo9r_UAFk"><em>TRIGGER</em> (re-upload Oct. 18, 2016) Monarch Programming Trauma &amp; Torture </a> Here Serenity goes into detail about the horrors of monarch mind control she experienced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this video I list off some of the monarch traumas I went through that had come up so far at the time. I know a lot more now than I did then, and I also didn\'t share all of what I had written down on that list. This was probably the most numb I\'ve ever been in my entire life besides that last video I just posted where I talk about the traumas that involved Bailey (one of my child alters)....I\'m still pretty numb to a lot of this, but I can at least cry now more often. The integration I thought was going on obviously wasn\'t...that might be part of why I felt even more fucked up, because my alters were the ones that were actually experiencing a lot of this in first person...so I couldn\'t really get much of a release from it all at the time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH9hPtw3vY8">Get To Know Us (7/100+) (Dissociative Identity Disorder/Multiplicity) </a> Here she shows us some of her different alters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this video I decided to do a &quot;get to know us&quot; type of thing where I have some of our people that front the most answer questions about themselves.
Serenity, Violet, Angel, Kristin, Ashley, Bailey, Sarah</p>

<p>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHPsIe542D0"><em>TRIGGER</em> Crazy Switching/Rapid Cycling (Project Monarch/DID/Beta Programming) </a> Serenity uncontroled cycling through her alters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbRVVVV-8Kc">The Mask Falls Off (Autistic/Communication/Authenticity) </a> In her more recent videos she is stuttering and here she explains why this is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I\'m finally letting go of the mask I was forced to put on most of my life. I started out just trying to move my body more naturally again only to discover that I wasn\'t communicating naturally all this time. I went to speech therapy as a kid and they forced me to talk like a &quot;normal&quot; person which in my case actually caused me a lot of pain and agony throughout my life whenever I\'d speak. I always felt like I was trying so hard to talk and it really hurt, now I know why. I\'m starting to be a little more comfortable with how I\'m talking since taking this video. I took another video that\'s uploading after this one that will explain more of some realizations I came to about all of this. The speech is also impacting my alters, so far I know it did with Ashley and Bailey. Sarah already had a stutter. She was the only one who was truly showing our more authentic self. It\'s not just stimming they made me stop doing and the forced eye contact. They also put me into fear and made me feel ashamed of the way I talk. Fuck that. This is who I am and you can take it or leave it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH88fmP8J6E">(re-upload Sept. 26, 2016) Violet : Create A New Reality </a> This is her alter Violet talking. I\'m sharing this here so you see how much of a strong, brave and awesome person/ &quot;system&quot; she actually is.
She describes which methods she uses to heal from all the trauma and horror she has been through and how it works.</p>
<p>Recently her abusive mother stoped providing her with financial support. I have seen pretty much all of her videos and also talked to her a little bit via E-mail and I have absolutely no doubt she is legit. 
Now, as you can imagine, she can\'t go to work like this and she is in real trouble paying her rent and stuff.
So for me personally the most important reason to share this here, is to maybe get some of you to donate on her gofundme page.
I already donated half of the money I had for the month at that point, which sadly enough wasn\'t much at all.</p>
<p>I know you guys here have a heart, otherwise you wouldn\'t be here. I also know this will ring an alarm bell in all of you who have a healthy amount of scepticism, but spend enough time watching her videos and you will realise she doesn\'t make anything up and she truly needs help, so please, if you can afford to donate even just 5$, do it!</p>
<p>She has no rl friends or family who do support her and she barely can leave her home and I just can\'t stand the idea she could end up homeless because she can\'t pay for her rent. She deserves all the help she needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/serenity-raynes-recovery/donate">https://www.gofundme.com/serenity-raynes-recovery/donate</a></p>
<p>E-mail her if you want to use other methods to donate. serenityrayne420@gmail.com</p>
<p>But please resist the temptation to ask her for further information that could lead to pg related arrests or something. Like asking for names of her abusers and stuff. She doesn\'t seem to know about what is currently going on here and she really should concentrate about her own recovery and doesn\'t need even more stress. She is already giving enough...</p>
<p>Sorry if london bad.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>',
