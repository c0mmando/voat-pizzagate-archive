Multiple agencies were involved in the bust, which officials had been investigating for four months.</p>

<p>Daimien Garcia, 27, of San Antonio, is accused of trafficking a child, trafficking a person and the sexual assault of a child, according to a news release from DPS.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Martinez, 31, of San Antonio, faces a count of compelling prostitution of a minor. Arrest records said Martinez met two victims. One of them was a minor who had just run away from home. Martinez befriended them and posted their pictures on Backpage.com, a website allegedly used by men to pay to have sex with women.</p>
<p>Four suspects were charged with prostitution: Jose Gonzales, 35; Cody Flores, 24; Christopher Ramon, 23; and Lee Atherton, 39. All of them are from San Antonio, police said.</p>
<p>Miles Montgomery, 47, of Portland, Texas, is accused of the prostitution of a minor, and Keego Hullaby, 24, of San Antonio, was arrested on the trafficking of a child.</p>
<p>Mugshots for only six of the suspects have been released by authorities. </p>
<p>Police issued an arrest warrant for a ninth suspect, Gabriel De La O, 33, of San Antonio, for the trafficking of a child and trafficking of a person. Officers are actively seeking him.</p>
<p>Since January 2017, special agents with DPS’ criminal investigations division have been investigating human trafficking and prostitution taking place in Bexar County.</p>
<p>As is evident from the charges, some of the alleged victims are juveniles.</p>
<p>The DPS Highway Patrol, University of Texas Health Science Center Police Department, San Antonio Police Department and the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office all assisted.</p>
