<p>&quot;They got that in this northern Arizona town too. What they also got though are three things they treasure most of all. Number one was the built in security from the other very secretive religion in the area throughout the town, which was very open to the idea when they saw the very large check. Number two they had the ability to integrate hundreds of children into a community that seemingly has nothing but endless supplies of children. Finally, they were coming to a community where no one looks down on anyone who has sex with teens and tweens.</p>
<p>The people who founded the church like to say it is their version of the Trinity. A pretty sick one. Originally when they tried to do this in the northern part of the country, it didn\'t work out very well. There were too many competing interests. You had one group of people who were trafficking kids, but another group who was interested in trafficking women for prostitution. You also had a group who was trying to do good and everything intersected and it was a horrible mess.</p>
<p>They learned their lessons and waited until everything was in place. The church is a non profit and their biggest donor is a shell company which is part of another shell company which is owned by the same A+ list mogul we have seen time and time again in all of these stories. This is where things get a little interesting. Because of the racial makeup in the community, and wanting to make sure everyone blends in, they had to get the tweens and teens from Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>He says this on the Rehab brainwashing center.</p>
<p>&quot;You might wonder what all of this has in connection to Hollywood. Well, first of all, the financing of course all comes from our A+ list mogul. There is one very important other thing. Have you wondered why every male celebrity over the past couple of years goes to a rehab facility in Arizona, but you never see any photos of the rehab facility or them in the rehab facility? Have you wondered why no female celebrity has ever gone to this facility? Have you ever wondered why the men who go to this facility seemingly always stay longer than a normal 30 day rehab and often seem to go back every few months for followup treatment? Have you ever wondered why all of these male celebrities seem to be the ones with the longest histories of sexual indiscretions? When they don\'t mention Arizona, they will say an undisclosed location. Well, apparently all these guys like going to the same location and the flow never stops. It is not just celebrities, there has been a surge of high paid executives and others that have suddenly decided this rehab place is the one that they need to go to.</p>
<p>They have figured out a way for them to go to &quot;rehab,&quot; and get &quot;better,&quot; so the world will forgive them and let them get back to making a lot of money.&quot;</p>
<p>We hear about all of these elite pedo places. Restaurants disguised, shops disguised, normal everyday places that are really fronts. However if what Enty is saying is true is it actually possible a whole town in Arizona that was basically built for child sex slavery and pedophilia accepted or at least looked the other way? He spoke about the town having a religious order known throughout.</p>',

              Corrupt DAs and cops everywhere. Remember hearing about Daniel Shaver? If not, horrific. Look it up. The jury let the cop off for a blatant murder / excessive force. All I can say is FBI must love it there, with the number of drug traffickers they are protecting vs. the number of innocent actual citizens that they harm.

            Kevin Spacey was seen jogging twice at a trail while he's receiving treatment at The Meadows sex rehab clinic in Arizona over the weekend
The 58-year-old attempted to hide his face on his runs on Friday and Sunday by wearing dark sunglasses, a hat and a large dark hoodie
           </p>
           <p>
            •The disgraced actor checked into the $36,000-a-month facility earlier this month - as first revealed by DailyMail.com - where he is believed to be receiving treatment for sex addiction
           </p>
           <p>
            •Spacey is 'taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment' after an outpouring of sexual abuse and harassment claims were made against him, causing Netflix, his publicist and films to cut ties with him
           </p>
           <p>
            •Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is also reportedly seeking treatment at the same luxury clinic

            Satanists hide their activity using SJW concepts. Just look for SJW terms and you'll find the place. Civano is a good starting point.

                What was the comment?  I missed it.  I just read my old thread on this all over again   We need to do more research  on the Meadows and Gentle Path.  There is way too much money they are making.  We know there is more than rehab going on there. Who has the power to delete. Didn't know we could do that even.

                  Senator McCain originally introduced these measures in the Senate with the Sonoran Corridor Interstate Development Act of 2015 and the Intermountain West Corridor Development Act of 2015, which were ultimately included as part of the FAST Act. These provisions will designate the Sonoran Corridor as a future interstate to connect I-19 to I-10 south of the Tucson International Airport, and the future I-11 from Phoenix north to Las Vegas and I-80, and south to Arizona’s southern border. Congresswoman Martha McSally (R-AZ) also sponsored these measures in the House of Representatives.

                 <p>
                  “I'm very pleased this project has made it past this hurdle,” said Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild. “The Sonoran Corridor is important to our airport, our major employers, and our regional economy.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “The Tucson Hispanic Chamber and our affiliated chambers in Nogales, Douglas and Sierra Vista applaud Senator McCain and Congresswoman McSally for their leadership in advancing these major trade route designations for the state of Arizona,” said Lea Márquez Peterson, president of Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. “The passage of these measures will enhance the importance of a key trading route from Mexico to the United States.”

                    Oh yes, I do too.  I don't think he is on an island somewhere.  He was lying in state.  Yep, they told him he had to go and so his family knowing their place, had to deal with it.  Oh yes, they know all of it.  I heard something about No Name being outed in a Fisa Report.  Don't know if there is any truth in that.

                  Marana where Vanderbilt Farms is, well is only about 22 mo. from Tucson.  I don't know if it means anything but there could have been trafficking of kids to that area with all the Farms
                 </p>

                  In one of those posts I found this comment
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I have a question for you - in this video you show a migrant camp with a nearby shack which contains some children's items. This same shack is seen in a Facebook video, and in that video Arthur picks out a flyer from amongst the debris which looks to be from Marana Elementary School. Can you offer any explanation of how that flyer might have got to that location? Was that site south of Tucson? If the camp is being used by migrants coming north from Mexico, how would an item from a children's school north of Tucson make its way to that site? Any ideas?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I looked up Marana School and here is the map Look what is right near there.  Vanderbilt Farms and Actually a lot of Farms.  Don't know, but this really stood out for me.

            Btw, did you hear that the woman that was arrested along with the man that supposedly kidnapped Elizabeth Smart, well she was released.  Just like that.  I have never believed that story.  Maybe she just played a part. They man I believe is in solitary.  Shut him up.  I believe the father and the brother were involved and sold her off for some business deal or just out and out Huge Cash.  Like Jon Benet without the snuff.  Ugh.  I have to stop this.  It's making me sick.

             Wow u really think the dad and brother played a part? I’m interested in this case but could never figure it out as it’s all so odd. Elizabeth was made spokesperson for the Missing Children network which is a huge red flag. Where do u think she went when she was taken for those months? What about the photos of her in the white garb? Do u think Elizabeth is lying about her captors? So many questions.....

              He left the window open.  No one heard anything.  I can't remember all the particulars of the case now, but remember that after a while I had feelings about him and his brother because of certain things.  Also I read something about it being a possibility.  Can't remember where I read it.  There was something about it when she was interviewed on tv just recently.   She could possibly be lying.  Look what happened to her.  She now knows she has to be a good girl or else. Her father and uncle are powerful and in the position to facilitate this.  I have never looked into their business dealings and connections.  Would be an interesting prospect.  The old adage of so many men and so little time.  I saw a picture of her with her new husband and baby and she reminded me of a Good Little Wife, a Stepford Wife.

              Startling details of Smart’s captivity emerged following her rescue in early 2003. She testified in 2009 to how she was drugged, tied to a tree and raped as often as four times a day.
             </p>
             <p>
              She may not be lying about that part.  I remember finding this during my months researching St. Louis and area.  The case of Angie Houseman and Unsolved Mystery still.

              </a>
              After 9 days her frail body was found tied to a tree.   Her abductor had kept her alive for a full week torturing and raping her and then tying her to a tree.  I propose that she may have also been raped tied to the tree.  I have heard of this before.  He could even have made CP for distribution.  That would have been a Snuff Video.  There could also very well be CP created for High Levels of Elizabeth Smart.  Anything is possible with these Sickos.

              Colorado City.  Yes, they appoint Churchmen that go as Religious Pastors to Slavic countries and they bring back the children.  The average age of the town is 15.  I have never forgotten that.  Shudder.

               Horrific world we live in. I saw in the comments many good comments that were buried so I hope the conversation can restart here and we get new looks into it. A whole town meant for child sex slavery...it needs to be raided and burned to ashes.

             The 1st pic is really off 
Large-scale sustainable neighbourhood development,  what does that even mean sounds really off and wierd, like boasting how big this is to the people that know.
Is this a gated community  or could anyone go a drive down there?

             This could be it. I just looked up a video of it. Doesn't this place give you very disturbing vibes?

              I watched the video, where are all the people? And that's a bold pedophile logo right in the town's name. Also, we should look into any drug treatment programs that are close to this, or also any celebrities that go to rehab in Arizona, I remember that's what the original "crazy days and nights " post talked about.

              Well, the pedo symbol hidden in the logo seems a bit suspicious.
