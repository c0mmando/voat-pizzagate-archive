            I watch PizzaGate unfold and hear 100's of lies daily, and notice that nobody questions the insanity of this witch hunt.
           </p>
           <p>
            1.) James Allefantis says he has NO BASEMENT in his interview, I would agree modern strip-malls don't have basements they just sit on a slab of cement. The photos of the cold-storage room, there is no proof those photos are from comet-pizza, The photos of the digging, there is no proof that those photos are from comet-piazza.
           </p>
           <p>
            2.) Allefantis said in his interview he never met Hillary Clinton. Who is lying? Him or the people that seeded the wikileak emails??
           </p>
           <p>
            3.) There is a photo of Elefantis in the whitehouse with Obama, and Elefantis is leaning against the wall and Obama is playing ping-pong witih a child. Who has proven these photos are not fake, who has proven they are real. Alefantis says he has never been to the white house.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.) Alex Jones say's that there are 1,000's of reference to code-word pizza in the Podesta wikileak emails, I have read and grep'd these emails, I count about 18 references to pizza in 55,000 emails. Gourmet cooks like Podesta frequently bake pizza in their homes, its fun and everybody enjoy building their own custom pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            5.) PizzaGate is on record saying that Alefantis is the #48 most powerful person in DC and quote a faux GQ article as the source, if you read the article you will see that krusty-the-clown is #1, and Hillary Cllinton is #10. James Elifant is a fuck-bitch of Brock ( a powerful man ), I don't even think Brock made it to the list why would that be unless the makers of the list were retarded. Elefantis has records that he didn't pay his payroll taxes and he has judgements against him for $25k that he didn't pay his janitorial services. So Pizzagate is saying that a guy facing bankruptcy during the past two years is the #48 most powerful person in DC? This is insanity, the meme is that he is supplying baby's to the richest ppl in DC, if that were true they would be paying all his bills and debt and keep him out of the courts. I could go on, but PizzaGate is deep in lies. I also note that the pro-trump people running pizzagate have quit defending their arguments now they just do personal attacks on anybody that questions the PizzaGate witch-hunt

             1) He's said he has a basement.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) There's plenty of proof he met Hillary. Didn't she thank him directly in an email somehwere?
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Alefantis is on the WH visitation logs multiple times.
            </p>
            <p>
             4) The references to pizza (some of them) are not in normal conversations.

             Lol, I think we just found the CTR shill.   There is a shit-ton of circumstantial evidence.   It is really hard to show to people, because there is so much there but it is spread so thin.   For the same reason, you can't debunk it in five sentences.   You are wasting your time posting here.  Almost everybody who reads/contributes here already knows that that there is something creepy going on with Comet Ping Pong, Buck's, Besta Pizza and the Podestas.

             Here is what is so great about #PIzzaGate:  it is self-implicating.  Anyone who tries to discredit the story only comes out looking like a defender of pedophilia.  There is just too much TRUTH that has already entered the minds on a global scale.  And too much TRUTH to still be uncovered.  It just gets bigger by the day.  So my advice for all you shills, paid or not, trying to defend it, you are wasting your time and only risking your reputation . It can not be stopped, it is already too late.

             Oh come on. You must be someone helping THEM. You can't possibly know all of that and then defend that that this is fake. You need to go back to the drawing board. Read thru ALL the evidence gathered so far. Then come back with a good defense. Even better, PROVE it's fake. New evidence is coming forward daily.

             What about his blatant pedo instagram comments?
What about his close relation to the Podestas?
What about the fact Tony Podesta travelled with Dennis Hastert to Japan?
What about the Besta logo?
What about the spirit cooking email?
What about the fact Wikileaks has a 100% record of never having false info?
This is so much bigger than the little fuck bitch. 
You cherry picked and ignored so much.  Not even a decent attempt.
