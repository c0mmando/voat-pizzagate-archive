<p>&quot;In recent months, the suit attracted the attention of pro-Trump blogger Mike Cernovich, who intervened in the case in an unsuccessful push to release a large volume of blacked-out court filings.</p>
<p>“I want to know what’s really going on and we can’t get it,” Cernovich told POLITICO. “This is a big story. My people care.”</p>
<p>Epstein pleaded guilty to two charges: solicitation of prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution. He served 13 months in a county jail and paid financial settlements to many of the roughly 40 women the FBI deemed to be his victims, including Giuffre.</p>
<p>Giuffre asserts in her complaint that Maxwell, the sole defendant in the suit and the daughter of late publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, routinely recruited underaged girls for Epstein and was doing so when she approached the $9-an-hour locker room attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 1999 about giving massages to the wealthy investment banker.</p>
<p>Giuffre alleges that Maxwell ultimately trained her in how to give “massages” to Epstein that involved sex acts and, essentially, prostitution. When Maxwell publicly denied the allegations and called Giuffre a liar in 2015, that gave her the opening to head to federal court and file the defamation suit now headed for trial.</p>
<p>An attorney for Giuffre, Brad Edwards, indicated her lawyers plan to keep the focus on the central allegation in the case.</p>
<p>“We are trying to vindicate Virginia. What she said all along is she was recruited by Maxwell and abused by Epstein,” Edwards said. “That’s what this trial is going to be about and that’s what is going to be proven beyond any doubt. We’re looking forward to proving that.”</p>

            In life you got to make some choices who to trust.  I'm with Mike.

           <p>
            The video that came up after his, by a "debunker of Mike" who rambles more than an hour, is a good example of how hatred of anything can distort a young mind.  It's a contagious mental infection.   I watched an uncle from Detroit, who hated black people openly, get to where he could speak of nothing else.  Jewish hatred, Nazi hatred, Black hatred, White hatred, it's all the same.

            Victory? Zero arrest. Sheeple still unaware and think PG is fake news. Tell the sheeple about Epstein and they will give you a funny look. Dude, what are you on about? Yay, we just keep winning. And don't forget to send your evidence with the FBI criminal complaint form. Pop the champaign like David Seaman!

            While I'm happy they prevailed, I now have grave doubts about Cernovich being anything more than a self-promoter using a cause to get a name for himself, attention, fame, power, and money.

            As stated before, his sympathy for Scarfy Skankles makes my stomach turn. All I have to do is think of those Haitian children and I'm all for convicting and sending her to Gitmo. But there were other times doubt arose. There were a few times he actually offered his services to the OPPOSITION! Yup, he did do that. Then there are his old tweets. Misogynist rants wen he was partying with transgenders and snorting coke. Troubling. If he'd just been partying and dating who he liked -- not troubling. He can do as he likes, but the misogynist part? Yea, the language was very coarse. I mean, COARSE coarse.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't like to throw someone under the bus just because I don't like a position they have or because they disagree, but I am skeptical and waiting to see what happens with that movie of his. While the trailer is slick, it just seems an opportunity for self-promotion. This is supposed to be an investigative report on faux news not a platform for himself to look good. A great investigative reporter proves his worth by what he produces, he doesn't produce propaganda to give himself worth.

             The amicus brief argues, among other things, that the district court's order permitting the sealing is contrary to the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access, and there are no compelling or countervailing interests justifying sealing in this case.

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             While the Code of Hammurabi was trying to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim. The Code issues justice following the three classes of Babylonian society: property owners, freed men, and slaves. Punishments for someone assaulting someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status.[18] For example, if a doctor killed a rich patient, he would have his hands cut off, but if he killed a slave, only financial restitution was required.[19]Women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not, as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery.[18]

            Basically ... "The amount of justice one receives is proportional to the amount of property he owns."

            Epstein is a billionaire ... and his victims are untermench.  There will be no justice for the victims.

             He's out for himself. And that sympathy he's showing for Scarfy Skankles is problematic.

              He may be out for the bad guys (seriously)  Been suspicious
of him  for years.  Anyone who identifies themselve
with Alex Jones I am suspicious of anyway. Thank You for your comment.❕

             By releasing files that were sealed in order to keep from public view.  Those files can consist of depositions, trial transcripts, documents and other evidence relied upon by  the parties to a civil lawsuit or criminal case. Not all evidence makes it into  a trial due to objections but it can nevertheless be disclosed to the public after the case is resolved. I believe there are efforts being made to also get to the records that caused the prosecutor to enter into a plea bargain that resulted in a very, very light sentence for Epstein. No doubt there was a great deal of opposition research that placed the prosecutor and/or the state's witnesses in a compromised position. I have no familiarity  with the progress  of this case,  I'm only talking generalities. Hope this helped.
