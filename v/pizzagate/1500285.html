<p>So as the link showed, there are many disturbing connections between Hillary and Haiti, and Laura Silsby. Silsby may merely be a detail in all the scandal that has surrounded HRC and CF and Haiti. </p>
<p>So what I would really like to see is a follow up on the Laura Silsby connection. When Silsby was caught illegally trying to traffic 33 kids out of Haiti, she had a whole team with her. It was a team of 10 missionaries. We need to interview these people. We need to think of really good questions to ask them first. Such as: Did you really think an orphanage was going to be built in DR? etc....</p>
<p>Anyhow here is a list of the missionaries that accompanied Silsby in this incident. (From: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8490843.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8490843.stm)</a>)</p>

<p>Obviously, I am not saying that these people should be harassed. I would like to see a professional journalist (maybe David Seaman) try and contact these people for an interview. But again, we need highly thought out questions before we would even try. </p>
<p>Thanks for hearing me out. Hopefully this list can come of some use to use.</p>',

            Ok, I missed that, you are right.   And yes, it is very significant.  But I still don't think talking to Silsby would be fruitful.  We need Haitians on the ground IMO.  Anybody know any Haitians?

            I watch the Youtube channel Sailing Uma, Keka is Haitian...not helpful I know, but hey, I enjoy the vids.

            Not to burst your bubble, because I do think some insider interviews could be very helpful, provided that we found the right insider....however, don't forget that Silsby has Haiti connections going back ten years.  So, she (and those close to her) is either an innocent crusader for children, or she is a hardened child trafficker...which means the interview would probably not yield anything useful either way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Check out this email from 2001 about the New Life Refuge and remember she wasn't jailed until 2010...and this also begs the question that has been asked before...Where are all the saved children?

           <p>
            IMO, it might be more fruitful to see if we could find somebody (Haitian) who maybe lived near Caracol or has knowledge of the Clinton's operations.  The Haitians have a hate-on for the Clinton's...gotta be a reason.
