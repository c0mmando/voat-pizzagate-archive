            I have no idea what this post is about nor am I going to spend brain power trying. I will say this much regarding the Podesta card party. That is not Herb Sandler next to Mary Podesta per many photos on Internet.. Both of Podestas sons are there and the young girl is  Podestas granddaughter. I thought this was resolved months ago. I don't have names at my disposal, I would have to dig through some handwritten notes to supply names if there is renewed interest.

             I  remember someone posting a pic of her (the granddaughter) I think with podesta's daughter and that pic did look like the girl in this photo. I remember this because I was convinced for months that it was Madeline M  in the pic, and that she was alive, only to be discouraged at seeing the pic of  daughter and granddaughter. Not sure that it was even real though and never put 100% faith in any picture these days with photoshop and all. I searched for it on here and cannot find it. 😡 does anyone else remember it?

             You're absolutely wrong on who is in the photo. I can understand why you dont understand my post cause the mods keep deleting them
 even when I follow the rules. Can you give me proof that thats Podesta granddaughter other than your word? Cause you clearly blew your credibility with who is in that photo.

              How does one blow credibility with one comment on a complicated matter? What proof do you have as to this girls identity. She looks like I would imagine Madelaine to look 10 years later but that is not proof, its a lead. Follow up please and I in the meantime will search my old info to get you the names, deal?

               Blow credibility,  the sites I used were better then wikileaks, even though Podesta has quite a few kids hidden in there to, I can run down some of those files -wikileaks/search mail2000  24 emails show up half have kids. Have you took the time to go through my comments or past post at all? The answers are already laid out. I will gladly make a full post of my findings, but I am pretty sure after the effort, it will be deleted, and to be fair the mods probably don't want to see it anymore I have posted it so much. If you have specific questions I will gladly answer them.

            <p>
             gothamgirl - Yes its only a part of much bigger things. I am afraid to keep digging what I have seen scares me.
            </p>
            <p>
             synt.us - LHOHQ and synt.us go into great detail on esoteric texts which seem "primordial" or "ominous" to first glance but is a gateway to truth
            </p>
            <p>
             gothamgirl - Yes I felt that reading your site and myself after digging into pizzagate. its clear its quite dark.

             synt.us - LHOHQ and synt.us go into great detail on esoteric texts which seem "primordial" or "ominous" to first glance but is a gateway to truth. I think that this is related to what you call "Pizzagate" because the government uses it everywhere Small frequency changes
            </p>
            <p>
             beevee - you mean trauma based mind control

            <p>
             synt.us -Yeah, but it doesn't have to be trauma-based. Trauma-based can be more powerful though

            </p>
            <p>
             beevee - Last Sunday at 4:55 PM suggestive imagery at a young age can suggest to the mind different forms of reality to which the mind further reinforces through further conditioning. Thought has a power and can be used.
            </p>

            <p>
             synt.us - I have been exploring content in Bloodborne as it has something to do with this red floor in this specific area in the game which can only be found through a glitch. I think getting there is vital to a mystery because From Software is possibly connected to production of brainwashing material, game has esoteric mentions of "great ones" which can be interpreted as the government, i.e someone above you, with greater insight on things than you. There's something really off about that game and the only word I can explain it with is "primordial". As for Worldcorp, the subject was thrown into an acid bath a few days after that was filmed. Worldcorp is a meme website but that video is real They have no idea what they're messing with
            </p>
            <p>
             gothamgirl - Another human doesn't do these things to another human. Its dark stuff

Im pretty sure shes a victim of Abuse based mind control She of course is part of the same machine that she lived through as many in these cults are.And many "esoteric" groups aren't like Clinton's kin There are as many groups involved with the "acendency" of humanity

            Is there a reason why you frequently post Quora articles featuring Kim Holleman of MIT Media Lab?
           </p>
           <p>
            Has Kim added any unique insights or research because right now all I can find is just copy-pasta information from her.
           </p>
           <p>
            It says that she works in Social Computing Group at MIT Media Lab. It sounds very fishy.

MIT Media Lab has come up in various posts including this one -

            There are too many suspicious things that have happened involving MIT, MIT Media Lab to be specific, for me to trust anything they say about pizzagate. It has signs that it could be controlled opposition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please everyone remember that just because someone is speaking out against pizzagate, it does not mean they are friend. This thing is so huge that you MUST expect there to be controlled opposition meaning people who will speak out against it while harboring nefarious plans related to the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please be wary when trusting MIT.

             Hmmm...I just spent some time studying Psychanaut's submission and posting history, diving into perhaps a third of the submissions for a closer look. While this particular submission is quite oblique, past material has at times been stellar. Further, I think there's an opportunity being missed here. I'm not sure what checking you've done on this Kim Holleman, but by my reckoning, there are few academics remotely discussing PG, especially those affiliated with an institution like MIT. I'm inclined to take her opinions at face value. Here's a specific quote from one of her Quora articles:
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              I would love to be wrong about this. But no one who sees all of the material believes it’s not happening. I believe Wikileaks revealed that John Podesta is involved with violent child abuse and pedophilia, along with many of his associates.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             That's an unmistakable endorsement of what's been hypothesized at Voat/pizzagate, and dismissing any strong supporting voice like this merely because it comes from someone who is a research affiliate at MIT is erroneous. She has an impressive CV, and it's very unlikely that someone like this is going to dump their career down the drain by signing on to a plan to somehow discredit PG by saying it's real. And keep in mind, a research affiliate is something completely different from being a full fledged professor or faculty member. We've pushed back against those attacking people like Jones, so it would be in keeping with our better angels to grant the benefit of doubt from time to time.

              One other thing to note is that Aaron Schwartz was stealing their documents from MIT and trying to make them public. When he was suicided before his court date it was most likely because he also stumbled upon the fact that a lot of professors and acedemia were torturing and raping babies abd filming it.

             MIT is/was involved in mkultra. Light &amp; sound on infants or young children in and of itself is traumatic They obviously still use this or it would not still be happening.

              Not saying illuminati cards. There are several meanings behind "cards" including "these 7's" that have been shown. J.Podesta pictured playing cards with young girl.

                Do you make up stuff as you go? I never said illuminati cards. I have been told tonight the sites were created by cicada3301, whoever that is.  I just know after almost digging and following for 3 months and many sites. I hadn't come across one lie, not one and I verified and googled every single word. It was just as reliable as wikileaks. So please if you have proof that I am wrong I would really like to see it. Honestly I don't want to be right.

              Your conclusion is utterly ridiculous.  The only way to debunk what I stated is to obtain a photo of Podesta's granddaughter,
with her parents or him before the age of 2 or a dna test.
