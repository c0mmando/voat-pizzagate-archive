            You're asking for proof of a negative. There simply isn't enough information. WorldCorp are mysterious, further limiting available information. We've found nothing there tying them to high-levels of government/politicians/elites, nor of them working with trafficking rings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Without better evidence than some guy blowing himself with a vacuum, we can't keep bashing away at the same shitty site hoping someday it nets something useful. There is nothing there that we can locate. It's like trying to disprove there isn't a unicorn frozen inside of Pluto--our understanding of the world suggests this is virtually impossible, but we can't fully disprove it until we are able to check every tangible detail for ourselves.

             There is not enough information, and will never be, since the subject is effectively being banned; Unless you post something innocuous, then it's okay to talk about worldcorp...
Be suspicious when someone shuts you down with no argument. Be more suspicious when others shut you down with the same non-argument and literally the same phrases.

             If you were to try and prove that there is in fact no frozen unicorns in Pluto, I would support you, definitely would not put a potato in your spaceship's exhaust pipe or try to ridicule you or outsmart you; Being in this planet long enough makes you know better.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you actually took a trip to Pluto, you'd possibly find there are no unicorns, but you would come back a much more knowledgeable person, and bring back valuable information, samples, etc that humanity would benefit from.

             VOAT is a censoring machine and it is obvious a lawsuit will never be put together from the info that is allowed to live here. Mods are deliberately deleting what the don't like, and they will be the end of this site, like many others.
            </p>
            <p>
             First kick them anti-pedos out of Reddit. When they are all in one place (VOAT), let them eat each other alive. Problem solved, let's go get a slice to celebrate!
