<p>&quot;This horrific religious doctrine and religious rituals as performed on Plaintiff consisted of Plaintiff, beginning at the age of 8, having a bag placed over her head, led out of her house by representatives of the Defendants, placed in a vehicle, and being driven to an unknown location,\' court documents said.</p>
<p>The victim was given a number she was known as during these &quot;rituals&quot;. Court documents say she was called by number only. Once she arrived to the secret location the victim claimed she was required to engage in sexual acts with the leaders. She was told if she said anything about it &quot;God would destroy her and her family immediately&quot;.
Court documents later say Warren Jeffs told the victim if she was suffering pain &quot;it was because God was unhappy with her and that if [she] cried during these encounters, God would punish her.&quot;</p>
<p>The victim said once she turned 14 she was required to become a witness and scribe for these &quot;rituals&quot;. </p>
<p>Photo evidence for these acts was found in the FLDS church\'s temple in Eldorado, Texas, according to charging documents.
At the age of 16, the victim said she was required to go to &quot;Ladies Class&quot; to &quot;learn how to be a good wife.&quot; During class, the victim said Lyle Jeffs would take her from class into a sound proof office and sexually abuse her &quot;under the guise of further teachings in the \'Ladies Class\',&quot; documents say.</p>
<p>Members believed if they disobeyed orders, especially one that involved sex with leaders, they stood at significant risk of losing his or her family or home, charging documents explain.</p>
<p>Every president since the formation of the church have been involved with sexual relations with underage girls, the court documents say. </p>
<p>Photo Caption:  Members were taught that the underage girls should engage in sexual intercourse to accomplish the doctrinal goal of the FLDS Church to raise up good priesthood children.</p>
<p>The victim is asking the court for a trial by jury. These claims have been filed against Warren Jeffs, Lyle Jeffs, Seth Jeffs, Wendell LeRoy Nielsen, the FLDS Church, the Corporation of the President of the FLDS Church, the Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the FLDS Church, and the United Effort Plan Trust.&quot;</p>',

             The post modern movement is in the US is godless. Who pushes the post modern movement? God is dead and we have killed him. Who said this? Now put those godless people in positions of power and influence. Even better, put godless people in a capitalistic society and you have what the USA is today. Godless, nihilistic, self-centered. The good thing is, when you are this down, any effort to make things better will have an impact.

            What I mean is Christianity is from the middle east.    jews are from the middle east.  Mud slime is from the middle east 
 Mormons are a split from Christianity.... Which is from the Middle East.   When someone talks to me about a religion that was a religion from my ancestors, which are Irish and German...  I will start to listen.

            All I have ever found is Astrayu which seems to not venture far from California... Which means it is probably more a result of the culture of that place than than the culture of my ancestors.

            Idk.  I sit here waiting.  All I ever see is sand nigger idiocy and horse shit rehashed and repeated as whites die out.

             Christians are Jews, who aren't required to be circumcized or eat kosher. They follow a Jewish leader, who preached about being a good Jew, and then they think they are different because they edited the Torah. Fucking retards don't know their own history.

               If you continued through my history rather than briefly glossing over it, you would noticed I said i was bringing over all content from reddit. Not that I liked each one I was bring over. I didn't read everything I brought that would've taken to long.

                Wasn't the answer I was expecting from someone who was just accused of lusting after kids I must say .. I didn't need to look past the first one showing a teen boy with an erection in his pants to know it was sick ! Your excuse about bringing this over from Reddit is pure BS .

                 How exactly am I supposed to answer when accused of being a pedophile? Plus I don't answer to you, I have no reason to justify anything. I said I didn't read all the content, which would be the "child porn" your specifying. I said I was bringing over all content regardless of what it was, because I didn't take the time to read it. It was just a data dump, because I thought the sub was going to be deleted. What your saying is that I should have read everything before I transferred it so I could filter it. This would've taken to much time, so I didn't do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is basically like if I was taking all of pornhub and transferring here and there just so happened to be child porn in their database so you accuse me of being a pedophile. It would only be true if that was the only content, but it wasnt it was all content.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also I don't feel the need to censor it, for you the idea of a pedophile existing is a crime. I don't believe it is as long as they commit no crime. This means I don't believe that if we knew the gene for pedophilia that should give you the right to kill that baby. Hentai, that has children depicted in a sexualized manner while disgusting by me, is not illegal only offensive so I feel no need to censor it, much like the white supremacists on here who I find offensive but feel no need to censor. That is why we are here for the freedom to offend.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The whole basis for this is that you consider it child porn, which is simply your opinion. Whether it is or not is not up to you, and I didn't feel it was up to me to determine that. I will not become a moral authority simply because you feel offended.

                  Your credibility went out the window with me ! It's not a crime to be a pedofile huh ? When it comes to the exploitation and abuse of children , wether it be in the form of art or in real life , I will take on the role of MORAL AUTHORITY!  And if YOU don't like it , too bad! Your rambling on about why you posted such filth is very telling .

                   The exploitation is a crime, being a pedophile is not. All you heard is one fucking thing... If they watch child porn they are criminals, if they are attracted to children but never act on it, that isn't fucking illegal. It is probably a mental illness you higher than thou prick. You criminalize them for simply being, much like if I was to say all sociopaths are criminals! Do all sociopaths commit murder? No, but you logic just says imprison them all, regardless of if they have committed a crime.

                     Just because you don't see them doesnt mean they aren't pedophiles... That is like saying a sociopath isn't a sociopath until they commit murder, when we can actually diagnose if you are a sociopath. Pedophiles only means that you are primarily attracted to children. If your primary source of arousal is when you look at children then your a pedophile. Its still creepy as fuck, however not all circumstances surrounding this are illegal simply offensive at most. For instance the pedophile passes a kid in a superstore and gets an erection. This is not illegal but it is sick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Being convicted as a pedophile simply means the law officially identifies you for what you are and only because you commuted a crime for the law to come into play. It is not actually uncommon for pedophiles to realize they are I'll and too see psychological treatment, they realize they are not right and seek to correct course before they do something they know is wrong. Ive heard of them being volunteering for chemical castration.

                      Don't patronize me with your BS ! Of course I see a difference and yes they all should seek help ! If they haven't committed crimes then NO , they shouldn't go to jail . What does any of this have to do with the fact that you posted disgusting pictures that look like CP? Over 2.5 years ago ! Before pizzagate was pizzagate . You say you were transferring data from Reddit ?  Why? Why would yo even want to preserve such filth if you didn't have an agenda? Remember how this subject started will you ?

                       I didn't post anything that looks like childporn. I put drawn images called doujinshi. Hentai. Those don't fit the description of CP. You want me to feel guilty, for something that I have no reason to be guilty over.

              Are you kidding with this nonsense?!? Or do you really believe what you spew? Jesus was a Jew by his lineage from Mary, not because of his "religion". He is the Christ and the start of the church- that would be the Christian church! Just stop with your garbage, it's embarrassing.

               He was a Jew by his own practices, heritage and religion. You can argue that he later revolted and started his own religion, however the bible even states that he wanted people to live by the teaching of the Torah. He taught in the temple only allowed to Jews... Because he was a Jew. He went to synagogue, because he was a Jew Luke 4:16. He says he is a Jew, john 4:22 because he is a Jew.
              </p>
              <p>
               Christianity is an invention of Paul. Jesus is not christian unless you consider yourself a Jew like Jesus. Jesus was protesting the practices of what Judaism had become. He was fucking martin Luther and you are a Lutheran, while he could probably be characterized as Protestant, because he was protesting the practices of that time.

             Asatru*

            <p>
             Yeah, that's ancient paganism revamped. Alongside really understanding asatru, I suggest learning permaculture. You will learn to think how our ancestors did.

             Jews see a goal and when problems arise, they see those problems as something to be battled, quenched, suppressed, and removed from the system.
            </p>
            <p>
             Europeans see a goal and when problems arise, they redirect those problems to their advantage. Negotiation, compromise, acceptance of reality rather than creating a fantasy that'll "make everything better".

              :)  yeah been doing permaculture for years.  It doesn't work for gophers though ha ha.  They get the gas.  That said Jesus can't defeat them either.  Though the Muslims would just strap on a suicide vest on their child and blow the gophers up.

               Haha yeah I love organic and permaculture, but strychnine is the shit for killing gophers. Or running water through their tunnels for a day or so and drowning them out. Or popping them with a 22.

           <p>
            There was a town, inhabited by FLDS people, where the average age was 15 (!) - they had lots of people who had adopted a large number of kids.

            Dont be fooled. The mormons have spent 100 years putting their people in positons of power in politics, the military, and the media. When the time is right they will declare a new revelation and reinstate polygamy to mainstream mormonism. If we could just spark a holy war between these cult members and scientology. Although scientology is smaller and mormons are well armed scientology is absolutely ruthless. It would be interesting to watch.

             I don't need any entity telling me how many husbands or wives I can have. Not the government, not the Mormons. I should be able to marry as many consenting adults as I please. You're still stuck in a dichotomy that infringes on my personal life. Whether the Mormons want to push polygamy or not is nil. The government and tax law should not be involved in marriage.

             I was raised mainstream Mormon, and while I don't doubt there are efforts to get members in positions of power, putting mainstream Mormonism in the same class as Scientology is just retardedly foolhardy. TBH, I don't go or believe the dogma, but the wife and I have discussed going back, simply because they create such an amazing and strong community of genuinely good (sometimes a little christcucked) people. Mormonism has a growing almost reformation movement where they aren't as fundamentalist. As I get older and have a kid on the way, I find myself really liking the effect the Mormon church has in instilling strong Christian values, and I value what I was taught and learned their as a child. Joseph Smith was a con artist, like all founders of a religion(even Christ), but look at the good works of the Mormons. They are a pretty fucking great people(minus the whole Chosenites bullshit of believing they are basically cousins of the Jews), and I wish my neighborhood had even more of them in it.

                 Yes. Technically I think anything that can illicit blind faith is cult-like. Plus this news story is nothing knew among religions. If there are people in power you can usually find corrupt individuals, and especially pedophiles. I don't know what it is with pedophiles seeking powerful positions but that is usually where you'll find them.

                They believe in the Book of Mormon and only use the Bible to lure good hearted ones in . I remember as a teen I had a friend who was Mormon . She told me that before a woman marries in the church they have to have sex with the " most high " in the church . Also she had to wear white undergarments underneath her clothes at all times in order to keep evil spirits away .

                 Do you often believe people at face value? Isn't that the definition of gullibility, when you believe something at face value and don't verify the truth for yourself?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm fairly sure you or her made that up. I'm not gonna say it isn't possible but it would go against the norm, much like catholic priests raping little children isn't normal. Then again is it normal for Catholics to rape little children? Might be your always hearing stories about it, must be the parent acknowledge, and support it and even send up their children to be molested as a right of passage into adulthood. If Catholicism is the original Christian religion, and it is also the most followed does that mean pedophilia is just a Christian value since it is so rampant among its leaders?

                  Who said I didn't do my research and verify things for myself?  I have been researching since 911 nonstop and yes there is corruption in all religions ..BUT the BIBLE is TRUTH and if you read it , it can set you free but not if you don't want to do the work and dig for the truth like you would if you were looking for gold ...then you'll never know . That's my belief your entitled to yours , but blatant disregard for Gods word isn't something I'm willing to compromise on . The people in charge of peddling the word in this messed up world will be wishing they had pure motives when they set out to open a church but they will soon realize they were the ones the Bible warns us about  .

                   Jesus taught that you have to be a good Jew to be saved. He taught the Torah, because Jesus was a Jew not a christian.  If you want to talk about "god's word" you would be reading the Torah, and not the edited version of its teachings called the bible since "Gods words" don't need to be edited right? Because they are gods words and not human words right?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I don't deny the existence of god, I deny that the bible, torah, quran is gods words and not a humans words. Why is your God the true god? Why not some other assholes god? You can't say Mormons are wrong because you cant even prove YOUR not wrong. That is what faith is, belief without the ability to prove what you believe. Even if I have faith in god I have no faith in man, because man lies and manipulates so I would never trust the bible is gods words BECAUSE it passed through human hands.

                   Historically Christians always hate different sect of thier religion, for no other reason than they believe something other than them. Hell there was fighting about whether or not Christ had a belly button or not, and Christians killed each other over that. Mormon is just the new iteration of the same old thing because they believe in a new gospel that you don't. They are Christians, they believe the same things you do because they read the same book, they just happen to have more to believe.

                      Quoting one bible verse out of context isn't going to do anything. If you're an unbeliever you're going to get it wrong anyway since your eyes are darkened. Believe whatever you want; there's no point in arguing with someone like you when there's too much hate in the way.

                       There are many verses about judging others. All of which say dont do it, because your not the authority to do so. Or do you presume to speak for god? Fucking Sunday Christians are why I left organized religion in the first place.

                 Dude yes they do... They only added another book that they believe in. They still read the Saint James version of the bible. They recite passages out of it during mass every Sunday. They are Christians...they believe in Christ. They perform sacrament  honoring the sacrifice of Christ where the blood and flesh are consumed via bits of bread and sips of water, because they believe he died for their sins. They believe they are saved because of that. The only difference is they think Joseph Smith is a prophet like John, Luke or Paul.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They are a cult because they are Christians.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If your saying otherwise it is obvious that you have had no interaction with them, and know very little about them.

                     Yeah I'm talking to like 13 people on here, I'm bound to make grammatical errors and miswording things. Either the argument is sound or it isn't. If not disprove it. Using saint instead of king is not an ah ha moment. It just means you'd rather not continue the discussion and are looking for a way out.

                    If they followed Bible teachings , they would NEVER be involved in politics! They wouldn't go to war , and they wouldn't have believed in a man named Joseph Smith because Joseph smith used magic to read the golden stones and God Hates magic or anyone who inquires of such darkness .

                         They are baptized when they are 8, and they teach the teachings of Jesus Christ. They are Christian by definition. Youre prejudice against them because they practice blasphemy, because they believe in an addition gospel you don't. They are still Christians.

                          they follow a false prophet. I would ally with them over skunkology or islam but only until those two evils were defeated.

                           See blasphemy. No other reason. Your religion is blasphemy but what do you care, because it is the one you believe in, so for you it is the one true religion. Now you know why the some jews don't recognize your religion, and why they don't like you. You "believe in a false prophet" of Jesus christ. As you refuse to acknowledge another's prophet so to do other refuse to acknowledge yours.

            Anyone left still supporting organized patriarchal religions/"Christianity" is involved in
perpetuating its madness -- i.e., that if you are spiritual that your require "middle men"
to intercede for you with their "one-all male god."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is simply how male-supremacists fool and confuse the public in order 
to bilk them for money.

                 Freedom of speech is the greatest freedom we have.  That is all voat is.  When we call you a faggot or a nigger or a kike it is to illicit a response.  If you respond inappropriately then we know you are not one of us.  It's that simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Your ideas are welcome here.  Really they are.  You may get fucked with BUT YOU WILL NOT GET CENSORED.  If you are, tell me and I will rail against your enemy right along side you calling you a faggot the whole time. Expect stuff like "how dare you censor this limp-wristed faggot!  :) votescam should be able to speak about its incorrect and obviously degenerate ideas freely!"   ha ha
                </p>
                <p>
                 You are paid to come here and threaten my freedom of speech.  Did you know... TONS of you paid shills have been red pilled here and joined us? I have personally been Thanked in private for turning a paid shill to our side.  It was funny because she said she had to keep it up because she needed the money.  Says a lot about the system you are defending right?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Have you been following qanon?  Have you read the tax bill?  Have you been exploring pizza gate?   Have you dug into adrenochrome yet?  Have you gone to duckduckgo yet and searched for "John and Tony podesta art?"  have you looked up "Maria abromavitch (sp?)?"  and her fucking spirit cooking.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It appears these people actually terrorize then kill then eat children.  Let that sink in a minute...  Imagine doing that to a little child!
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is evil in the world.  It is real.  It is dark it is dangerous.  We have all been taught that it does not exist.  We flat-out MUST WAKE UP.   I woke up.  the Federal Reserve being a private company...  Like Wallmart is what did it to me.  They are a registered C corporation in Delaware.  I SHIT YOU  NOT.  look it up.  Go to the Delaware secretary of state corporation division and search for the federal reserve.  IT'S A FUCKING COMPANY.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They literally made up fake money then loaned it to us AT INTEREST.  We are all to busy fighting about fake gods and TV shows and fake blackmailed politicians who are owned by this monster.  It's all fake.  Amazingly we are on the same side.  Our efforts and ideas have been corrupted and turned against us.  Remember, the "useful idiots" get sent to the gas chamber right after the  "bad guys" .
                </p>
                <p>
                 At the very least let's agree that it is fucking wrong to rape traffic harvest terrorize murder and eat children and go from there... You know...  Since we have a free speech platform called voat that we can talk on without being banned.  What do you say?

                  Free speech is NOT hate speech which is what you're selling.
Hate speech has a lot of consequences, not only for those who push it, but for those
who are hurt by it.

                 <p>
                  VOAT is about adult and child trafficking --
It is NOT about hate speech.

                  You're also discussing things you've just found out about while most of us 
have long known about the pizzagate issue and long before that about 
MKULTRA and sexual abuse of children and torture of children.

            Mormons think they're each a member of a lost tribe of Israel. So, there you go. Do as the jew do.

             And shit tons of freemasonry symbolism. Joseph Smith basically combined what he liked from all the prolific cults of the time, and the "chosenites" identity is a pretty powerful ingredient in that recipe. I don't genuinely believe Mormonism was founded by Crypto-jews, but he definitely saw how effective telling members "God prefers you", like the Jews was, and it edifies their convictions into willingly dying for them.
