<p>Their Share the Love facebook event looks somewhat interesting. Going on 2/12/17 : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1669360910029411/">https://www.facebook.com/events/1669360910029411/</a>

<p>What\'s interesting to me is that this is a place that people also take their kids... What a surprise. Most of the reviews on it seem innocent although they also seem naive (my gut instinct). </p>
<p>Here is an archive of their 1st page on flickr: <a href="http://archive.is/L8pt4">http://archive.is/L8pt4</a></p>
<p>If you click on the flickr page, they follow four users, one of which is called frankcheez, this user has favorited several images with pedo logos in them as well has has many interesting photos of dolls. Also, if you click on those who frankcheez follows and those who follow frankcheez, there are many suspicious folks on there. It just keeps going on and on, please send to others who can research, document archive etc...</p>
<p>I don\'t have much time to go through this all but I wanted to get this out there.</p>
<p>EDIT: Looking up the Apalachee their logo comes up. I still think it might be something to look into.</p>',
