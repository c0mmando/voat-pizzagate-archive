             Great point.

            <p>
             Reminds me of slight of hand. Watch the right hand and don't watch what the other is doing. In stating you're pro-women's rights, you give the expectancy of protection for those rights so when they're abridged? Well, they can't be because they're protecting those rights.

            This is pizzagate related, and this may be storm related.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it: Me too broke out, first high powered hollywood people, then senators. People kept asking, "Who is next". Why were people asking? Because it was seeded into the discussion. Now, before the year is out, as Mueller and comey are extremely unpopular, it looks like "Me too" is hitting the FBI, and gives Trump a further excuse to get rid of the FBI directors and bring someone new in.
           </p>
           <p>
            I predict that the person Trump will put in will be a Conservative woman with law enforcement background. Once that happens there will be a mass culling in the FBI followed by re-opened investigations.

              Why is the infiltration of sex predators in federal law enforcement unrelated? Don't the female FBI agents who could be out stopping the child molestors matter to you? Can't you see how this all plays in to create a dangerous and corrupt society where it is unsafe to even report sex abuse crimes or crimes against children or women. I really think you need to reconsider what you call abuse of power and why.

               Are pizzagaters "abuse of power" fighters now or are we trying to expose the pedophilia blackmail system? I think you need to reconsider what will happen to pizzagate if people get lured into playing zionist blame games. Pizzagate will get lost in the swamp of everything but pedophilia.

               We are the ONLY people in America talking about pedophilia. Nobody else is. A lot of people want to drop pedophilia and play a game of ass grab about who talked to Russia, where is Obama is he hiding?, look at those boots Hillary and McCain are wearing those are monitors, and on and on and on and on.
              </p>

               The mainstream media is already running this FBI script and nobody is getting redpilled about the true problem from it. Nobody.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are the only script running about pedophilia, the true heart of the beast, and if we get sucked into the NEVER ENDING swamp of playing along with Washington's never ending theatre of accusing each other of stuff pizzagate will die.
              </p>
              <p>
               I say let the swamp monsters play their distraction games so they can keep pedophilia off the radar, and pizzagate should focus on pedophilia because OBVIOUSLY nobody else will.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not to mention that trusting the Republican party to do it is asinine.

             I so agree and, yes, this is storm related -- BIG TIME storm related. It's outrageous that these two men were in charge of law enforcement when they didn't even listen or care what was happening within the ranks. Well, they did care. They were purposeful appointments and they did exactly what they were supposed to. Now, as you said, a mass culling needs to occur. Think about a whole lawn being reseeded. That's what'll happen.
