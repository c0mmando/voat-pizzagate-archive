Sent: Monday, July 27, 2009 2:50 PM

Subject: Cheryl, here is a quick backgrounder on child slavery in Haiti

            Hi Cheryl,
           </p>
           <p>
            The Secretary asked me to send her, through you, an informal paper that she could share with President Clinton on the
restavek problem. "
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, so it's an "informal paper" you couldn't directly send Hillary. Riiight...
           </p>
           <p>
            "322"
           </p>
           <p>
            ARE YOU @#$&amp; KIDDING ME!?
           </p>
           <p>
            (Ok, it's probably just a signature block, but the Skull and Bones reference is still interesting.)

            That is important. I will work on it--there's a very long and sobering list. Does Jillian have specific ideas?

            This is a good suggestion from Jillian Burns in S/P....to make sure that children (and wonen) don't become targets of
traffickers, as happened in Pakistan.

           <p>
            ATLANTA -- UNICEF and international adoption agencies said getting children into safe zones is a top priority after the
devastating earthquake in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            The massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit the island of Hispaniola has left thousands of children without parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before the quake even hit UNICEF statistics from 2007 show there were 380,000 orphans already in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            "There are so many children that are in desperate need of help that's what we are here to do to keep them alive and get
           </p>
           <p>
            them the nutrients they need and clean water. It becomes the one place of stability for the kids where they have people
UNICEF workers they can relate to they have educational material so they can start back with school," said Alissa

            Silverman, deputy director for UNICEF in the southeast region. "UNICEF is tracing family members and caring for
           </p>
           <p>
            children orphaned by the disaster to protect them from harm or exploitation."
           </p>
           <p>
            The number of children on the island is staggering. Forty-six percent of Haiti's population (nearly 10 million) is under the
age of 18, more than half of the population is under 21. Prior to the earthquake, four of every 10 children lived in homes
           </p>
           <p>
            with mud floors or severely overcrowded conditions.
           </p>
           <p>
            "My first concern is who is with the kids how many of our nannies our ok and who is watching the kids and then all the
kids on the streets," said Chareyl Moyes, the program manager for Wasatch International Adoption. Moyes works with a
           </p>
           <p>
            number of different agencies and orphanages in Haiti. She said early reports about how much damage they suffered are
good.
           </p>
           <p>
            "But, there is going to be a concern about child trafficking so both Haitian and the United States governments are going
           </p>
           <p>
            to be careful about forging ahead with new adoptions. The need is going to be great," Moyes said.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of families in the U.S. according to a number of international adoption agencies across the country said some
people were at the very end of the process to adopt a child from Haiti. "Now, it will set everyone back," Moyes said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though child trafficking is a major concern for Moyes she worries about the immediate help children need trapped
           </p>
           <p>
            in the rubble from a country in ruins. "How long will that child survive without somebody rescuing them," Moyes said.

           <p>
            An emergency response team from Westport's Save the Children successfully reached Haiti today and worked quickly
           </p>
           <p>
            with staff already on the ground to organize the distribution of tents, medicine, and toiletries to children and families in
desperate need, the charity said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Save the Children is extremely concerned about the well-being of children in Haiti at this critical moment and we are
doing everything we can to quickly get relief supplies to those who need it most," said Charles MacCormack, president
           </p>
           <p>
            and CEO of Save the Children, in a news release.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Our staff on the ground is pulling out all the stops to overcome hurdles like blocked roads and unreliable access to the
airport."
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is just the beginning of what will be a comprehensive five-year effort to build back better in Haiti. We are
           </p>
           <p>
            dedicated to not only addressing the immediate needs of children and families, but to making sure they have a brighter
future ahead."

            As someone in the anti-trafficking news of the disaster in Haiti has my mind rushing to worrying thoughts on how the
disaster will increase human trafficking in the country. Such a large scale disaster will undoubtedly leave thousands and
thousands of children, and their families, at an increased to be victimized by modern slavery.
           </p>
           <p>
            Haiti's Restavek system still has a tight grip on the community, leaving some 300,000 children in the country enslaved as
           </p>
           <p>
            domestic workers according to the UN. It is these children who will continue to anguish and suffer the most in the
shadows of the earthquake.
