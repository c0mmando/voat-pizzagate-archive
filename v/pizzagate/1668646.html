<p>This girl was found in the basement of an abandoned building in University City, St. Louis, who had been raped, suffocated, and then beheaded. She was between 8 and 11. She was found by two men who just happened to go into the basement of the abandoned building looking for a piece of pipe to fix something on their car. She was believed to have been murdered three to five days before being found. If you know St. Louis, there are many abandoned buildings. The odds of her being found like this are... interesting. Reads like horror story or mystery novel; it reads like a constructed narrative.</p>
<p>&quot;Her remains were found by two looters after one lit a cigarette that created enough light to expose the body. Her body was naked save for a yellow sweater, and was left on her stomach, with her hands bound behind her back with red and white nylon rope.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is where things get &quot;interesting.&quot; After many attempts to find more information on her including bone analysis that determined she was from somewhere in either the Midwest or North East such as Virginia (though there are conflicting reports on this that suggest she was raised in the South due to a lack of fluoride ingestion), they sent her sweater to a psychic...</p>
<p>&quot;Her sweater had previously been sent to a psychic in Florida but was never returned, presumably lost in the mail.&quot;</p>
<p>Some more information that conflicts with the Wikipedia article/isn\'t mentioned, is that one psychic who was consulted suggested they contact the coast guard... This suggests not only child trafficking, but also that the psychic may have had information about where a girl like this would\'ve come from, as I don\'t subscribe to the notion of psychics being magical or whatever.</p>

<p>&quot;The psychics put their hands on the fingerprints and would shoot straight up in their chairs like they got a jolt or something,&quot; remembers Burgoon. &quot;At the end of the meeting they told me to call the Coast Guard. The head is on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico.&quot; </p>
<p>I would like to reiterate there were conflicting reports on the bone analysis. There are likely some solid websluths threads on this as well...</p>
<p>There was also mention of a public hair found on the girl, however the police reported that it likely came from one of the officers. Convenient.</p>
<p>A tiny bit more information I would like to put out there about St. Louis:</p>

<p>Feel free to look through any of my old threads as most deal with St. Louis. You may reach out to me and I will respond.</p>
<p>I would also like to mention that I spoke with the FBI and passed some information along about a week or more ago and have seen what I believe to be surveillance on the establishments. I haven\'t posted this (the information passed to the FBI) on here or anywhere yet, but I have certainly seen movement on it. I can\'t prove it, and wouldn\'t want to if I could, but know that these threads are monitored by the good guys too. Please, trust me on that.</p>

            Spins biffada occulta seems to have genetic traits to possible certain bloodtypes? This might help lead to understanding connections with RH factors. This is also related to Madeline McCann. Coloboma has some connections to RH factors. Outward sign in the eye of a genetic component. These children/adults are kept on international donor list named C. A. R. I. S.

           <p>
            Also, the info I spoke with the FBI with was not anything I've posted before. I'm holding it private unless I believe no action has been taken, then their hand can be forced. I do trust the FBI, to be clear, to do the right thing, and I think giving them time to collect data is the proper way to build a case. I will not rush them, but what I do want is for them to listen to me and I want to see/hear some confirmation that they have followed up. I trust they will give me this confirmation in time.

             Or may you come back reincarnated as a bastion of justice who not only gets to live a full life, but also has the satisfaction of destroying the scumbags who did that to you. Either way, God has you.

            Thank you for posting this, and your previous post. I went to college in St Louis, and still love the city. Had never seen this story before but I have no doubt it's part of the interconnected web of PG.

            This is so sad. Hope it is not deleted needs exposure to stop this madness. The fluoride testing information alone telling all of us they can determine location and history of child from North to South. Fluoride is placed in drinking water intentionally for there to be testing in the US based on these bio markers should alarm everyone.

            Wolftrail When you first posted about her I could not read it.  It is horrible.  I know how it corresponds with the rest of the story.  Snuff and Child Pornography in St. Louis.

             I don't feel like linking the "artwork" of Podesta's with children in only sweaters in tiled rooms, but I'm certain you've seen it. The MO is consistent. If you think it is isolated to a pizza place in DC, I suggest you crack open a beer and read a great deal more. Not tryin to be a dick, just sayin that if this thread was going to be deleted, it would have by now. I have talked with mods a few times about St. Louis. I have also "worked" with the FBI. I'm holding on to a lot more than I've released so far and don't want to dox myself, as I'm one of the only people releasing info on this city. There was a country club that recently burned down in St. Charles, and I can tell you, there is a reason the ATF is involved. I can't say more about that, but there will be more fires in this city.

              Absolutely bro. And I know how big this is, and have known about pizzagate and was trying to open people eyes to it 15 years ago. Keep up the fight bro.

             Suspiciously, in both the Ricky McCormick case as well as this Jane Doe case, both individuals are found very soon after their deaths. With McCormick he was found 3 days after his death, and with Jane Doe it was 3 to 5. Both were in very out of the way places in the sense that it is statistically unlikely that people would just "come across them."

             Not only these two, but the case of Angie Housman, who was found tied to a tree at Busch Wildlife, had died only hours before some hunters came across her, naked and frozen with gaffers tape (kind used in film) over her eyes and mouth. Make no mistake, these are not coincidences. The police (major case squad) and FBI know a great deal more than they let the public in on.
