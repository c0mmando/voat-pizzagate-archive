            Also, NASA could be fake and Earth could be a globe; Just because NASA is fake doesn't mean the Earth is flat.

            Most people working there might in the dark about how fake it is. And some folks are just really good actors.

            Interesting theory, but I think Sandy Hook was more about trying to generate a grassroots movement to ban assault rifles than anything to do with pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            And mind you I didn't even believe Sandy Hook was a hoax until yesterday if you can believe it. I finally decided to look into it. Since I discovered Hillary and Co are psychotic spawns of Satan I've been reexamining all these old conspiracy theory trying to separate fact from fiction. And sure enough the truth behind almost everyone single one of these conspiracies is far different than the story we were told. The only conspiracy left standing is the flat Earth bull shit which is intentional disinfo to discredit conspiracy theorists.
           </p>
           <p>
            In case anyone's interested this is the video that convinced me the official story behind Sandy Hook needs to be changed because what the government sold us is utter and complete horse shit.

            NASA has only been around for like 60 years.  The notion of a globe earth only for about 500 years.  Controlled education and the media programming teach the globe was established as factual a long time ago......yet am still waiting for any conclusive evidence of that.  The theory the earth is globe was introduced many years ago and widely taught in the most highly funded, prestigious Universities.  No real proof came until NASA.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is a lie that when Columbus set sail, he proved the earth was a sphere....that people before thought you would fall off the edge.  That's not what people thought at all.  What people did think is kept almost completely hidden; even the most highly educated have never seen what people thought before....because its accurate and the globe a deception, albeit a massive one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Charles Davies who wrote academic mathematics books through the 1800's was still under the impression the earth was a flat disk with the sun, moon, stars and planets rovolvign above us.....just as was thought before all these guys claiming to worship some guy the call "lucifer" decided to preach it was a globe, complete with "scientific data", fake images and acting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways...that's a deep subject, but I've gone down that rabbit hole and seen what's there. :/   We're dealing with big time liars, with very intricate systems of promoting their deceptions.   Mind blowing to say the least.....but after a few generations of heavy indoctrination..... to quote Dresden James "When a well packaged web of lies has been sold to the public for generations, the truth will seem preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic".....or Mark Twain "fooling people is easy, what's difficult is convincing them they've been fooled"....or "its not so much that people are ignorant, its more they're filled with things that just ain't so".

            Glad to see people on here awake about Sandy Hook...realizing it was all a big ruse, and then realizing the extent of organization behind such a thing as creating a fake news story like that one....and starting to see the nature of those behind it.  JZ wearing shirts that say "Do as Thou Wilt", Alister Crowley's motto and eating at the white house.....Obama photographed wearing a Crowley 2012 T-shirt....Disney and his "Uplifters" club with their play "the uplift of lucifer"...Saul Alinski's book dedicated to some guy he called "lucifer", Jack Parson's association with Crowley and admission of worshiping some guy he called "lucifer".....really glad to see people catching on and not being deceived by those magicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the subject of Jack Parson's of Jet Propulsion Laboratories......or Disney working so closely with Von Braun in the space program, or Albert Pike the former grandmaster of the masonic society and his book morals and dogma.......everyone might take a look again at some of the things from outer space and see if they can detect any of the deception that those people involved are known to practice....

            This guy here living up in outer space or an actor on a studio set?

            And so on.....tricky lying bassturds.....but as with many of their lies....lies so big nobody can believe its a lie.  Antarctica is not off limits because of the weather.....its off limits for the same reason there's no GPS tracking on aircraft South of the equator.

               I did. I've been through all the conspiracies and they all fell like dominoes, no pun intended. In the past 2 months these all got re-filed in my mind under "Evidence the U.S. government is run by psychopaths":

               <p>
                Start with the photos.  Photos are not allowed on here, but that last one taken on that 30 million mile journey to Mars....fake....not only fake, but it says "SEX" in the clouds...the same slight of hand that can be seen in Disney's programming.   Seems there are no real photos or video from outer space.....its all fake.  Sure that doesn't mean the earth is not the ball in those fake photos.
               </p>
               <p>
                Further investigation shows the history of the ball earth is a tad bit different than professed.  The argument was never settled...or settled in the same way as evolution...a theory that was made fact.  NASA really is the only concrete proof the earth is the ball in those photos....and everything from them is fake.  The media influence has been used heavily to create the belief the earth is a the sphere we are taught.  Education most certainly teaches us that.  But again, based on what proof?  The few experiments done to prove it are not conclusive, the results can also be congruent with a flat plane.
               </p>
               <p>
                One big kicker is that although well versed (and believed it) about the ball earth and all the science around it.....I had never seen or heard of the previous conception of our earth.  Come to find out, it was commonly known among many societies...evidently they all came up with the same conception separately through actual exploration.  That conception worked fine to create the clock and the calendar, and to this day can be used to navigate accurately by.  Before, when someone said "flat earth" I pictured a ship going over the edge, as was illustrated when teaching us about Columbus and what people at the time thought....which by the way is a lie, that's not what they thought.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, basically, The only actual proofs I have found that the earth is a ball......are not proofs at all.  The proofs from NASA are fraud.  There are many errors in ball earth model we are taught, which mean its not even valid.  The previous model seems to work without error and more likely accurate.  Only two ways to know for sure.....for the public to be allowed into outer space to see it for themselves, or for the public to be allowed freely to Antarctica to see it for themselves.  Neither are allowed.
               </p>
               <p>
                But to name just one anomaly.....the sun being taught as 93 million miles away.  That's a long ways, wonder how they measured it?  At any rate, how can we determine if it is that far or not?  Well, they use the laws of perspective to explain the sun and moon appearing the same size.  They say the sun is exactly 400 times larger and 400 times further away.  Perspective remains constant....where if you move twice as far from something, it appears half its size, if you get twice as close to something it will appear twice its size.  According to science, the if the sun was only 200 times further than the moon, then it would appear twice the size of the moon.  Well.....if observed, when the sun rises, its less than half its size as when its directly overhead at noon.  Did the sun get 46 million miles closer?  Or as it goes to set.......it shrinks about half its size from what was seen at noon.   In the previous conception, the sun's is said to be moving over us and this observation matches that exactly.  Here is a timelapse video of a flight going away from the sun which shows the sun shrinking more than half its size in appearance.....did the plane fly 93 million miles away from the sun?
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pliyY5S11w">
                 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pliyY5S11w
                </a>
                Because even moving 8,000 miles away from the sun (earth's said diameter)....the sun would only change a tiny, tiny, un perceivable amount in apparent size....if it were 93 million miles away.  Not to mention, the heat from it, that slight tilt putting the earth a small distance further away in the winter is said to account for seasons...  Oh there's lots more that doesn't add up.
               </p>
               <p>
                I could really go on.  Check flight trackers they show all flights in the air.....but none over the oceans South of the Equator.  Examine those flight paths adn they match the previous conception but do not make sense on the ball pictured in Google earth.  It seems to me that with GPS they've transformed a flat disk into a sphere, which would not be hard in the top half or the inner part of a circle, but on the bottom continents would get closer to together the further South you went, on a disk they'd get further apart.  I know they list distances and there's even on flight (only one, which I have not found confirmation really exists) that flies direct between Southern continents...the other 99.9% of intercontinental flights down there match a flat disk not a globe.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I said, I could go on.  There are many anomalies with the globe model.  Many involved with its inception and propagation are those admitted "satanist" guys...dating way back.  And that appears to have much to do with the why of it.  The message of all that science is "There is no God"......where for guys worshiping that proverbial devil figure from the bible would be motive.  That message is obvious...in fact was the title of a recent Hawking Documentary "There is No God"....but that's if you want to believe a paraplegic writes books on astrophysics and speaks fluently by wiggling his cheek.  Or Lawrence Krauss can be seen doing his travelling act at universities worldwide....after he explains the universe began with a star exploding, he uses his punchline "Forget Jesus!  Thank a star for dying so you could be here!".  Bill Nye....not a scientist at all....a performer turned TV scientist, who was seen in person at the opening of a Noah's ark exhibit protesting "its child abuse to teach the bible".

                 You've got that backwards. The Sun at sunrise/sunset is LARGER that it is at noon. That's because the light from the Sun at sunrise and sunset travels through more atmosphere which acts to magnify the Sun.

                   On a flight from Moscow to New York there are many things effecting the size of the Sun. The plane is going to be flying North then South. At the same time the Sun is rising and falling and light going through more then less atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'd love to do the math to figure out all the variables involved. It would be fun. Don't worry. The Earth isn't flat. However regarding 9/11, THAT is a total fabrication covering up the fact officials in the United States government are straight up demonic psychopaths.

                    And how is it that NAVY missile guidance can use a 2 inch pencil beam radar to target ships over 60 miles away?  Ships that should be over 2,000 feet over the horizon and out of line of sight?  Does the radar beam follow the curve?  Then bounce off and follow the curve back?  Chicago from across lake Michigan?  Must be an illusion....but those photos from NASA and the accompanying science are REAL.

                     Nope. Something as tall as a Navy ship can see much farther than the horizon you and I see. As altitude increase so does the distance to the horizon.

                       Whether the Earth is flat or not has no impact on where Earth is relative to stars. Yes Earth's view of the stars changes as it circles the sun. But were Earth flat or round the star positions don't ever change. That's why an astrolabe still works today.

                        Ok, so maybe an astrolabe would work with either.  But considering the globe model, then we are a planet spinning at over 1,000 mph, while orbiting the sun at over 60,000 mph, the sun with all the planets in tow is orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy at over half a million miles per hour and the Milky Way galaxy is hurling through space at over 3 million miles per hour....and you believe this why?  No experiment was done to prove any of that....its just a fancy way of explaining what we see mainly in regards to the sun.  Much like the notion that vaccines are safe has been proven is put out, but back in reality no test has ever proven that....most if not all tests have proven otherwise.  In the case of the earth moving, several experiments were done, and they all returned the result the earth was still and it was the bodies in the sky that were moving.    According to the globe model we are taught, each star we see is a sun in its own galaxy sometimes billions of light years away, so many miles that the number can only be handled with scientific notation....incomprehensible numbers to most.   But they, like us are said to be moving tens of millions of miles everyday in all sorts of directions....but the North Star has not moved since recording began it stays fixed above the North Pole....and all the other stars rotate perfectly around it.....all of them maintaining perfect parallax with one another...never changing position despite the billsions of miles they've moved.  Science explains this away as they are just so far away that we can't detect they move.

                         You're conflating potential with kinetic energy. Yes at this very moment my potential energy is massive. I'm going like 1,000 mph relative to the Sun. But that would only effect me if the Earth suddenly stopped moving.

                      As altitude increases so does range of vision....what we see can be explained as either perspective or going over a curve.   Altitude will give similar results whether on a flat plane or on a curved surface.....draw that up in a CAD program and check for yourself.  Zoom on the other hand if the object had gone over the curvature...it would therefore be out of line of sight......and no amount of zoom would bring it back into line of sight.  With perspective, it has gone past the limit of our vision....with zoom that limit is increased and the object is again above the horizon.   You can check this yourself.

                       On a flat plane the object never went "below the horizon" it just got smaller and smaller until you couldn't see it.

                        At the limit of our vision all sides converge and disappear.  Like looking down a long hallway...if the hallway is long enough and all sides (walls, ceiling, floor) even dimensions.....then it will look like you are looking down on a pyramid or looking up from inside one.  Not sure if that has any significance.....but there is a row of pillars constructed a long, long time ago that was built to the length of the average person's vision...so when looking down the hallway of pillars, it looked just like a pyramid.....but if you get a zoom lens then the end no long meets but instead the hallway continues on....or a square at the end.   The floor rises up equally with the cieling's drop...that's due to perspective, not curvature.

                         It doesn't. That converging lines effect of say railroad tracks going off into the distance is an optical illusion sort of. It appears as if everything converges but you need to factor in the farther away you see the more space there is.

                         For example if I hold up my hand in front of my eyes while I look at the horizon my hand will represent some fraction of the entire horizon I can see at sea level. If I did the same thing but looked straight up my hand would cover far more "space".

                          And yeah, the sides converge in....as well as the ceiling comes down and the floor goes up......in a straight and level hallway.....you get the same effect as is seen on the surface of the earth.  With a dome full of stars above us....it matches perfectly.  The globe earth...fraud.

                          As I said, research it yourself.  I tried to explain.  A little complicated yeah, add to that cognitive dissidence.....it might be tough for some.  Don't worry, there are enough people out there who see the fraud and they're pretty adamant about open debate on the subject.....that will come in time.  First and far more easy, is to prove NASA is pure fraud.   Anyways, was nice chatting, good luck on things and take care.

                             With perspective, things above come down, things below go up, things on the sides come in....to a convergence point....that's at the limit of our vision...after that, they are effectively invisible to us.  This can explain the sun or anything else "going over the horizon".   The other explanation could be a curved surface and those objects are going out of line of sight...."over the curve"...out of view.  Two things prove its the former and not the latter that we see........the convergence point is always at eye level....meaning the ground has risen to meet eye level...this remains the same at any altitude.  Even out the window of an airplane...the convergence point is still eye level.  If it were going over the horizon then it would be only the above or in the case of a long hallway...the ceiling that comes down.  At altitude you would have to look down at the horizon.   The other proof is a zoom lens, if objects had gone over the horizon and disappeared due to loss of line of sight.....then a zoom lens would not bring them back into view.  If they were invisible due to limit of vision, then the zoom lens would bring them back into view.   On this subject, if you argue you are doing so for the sake of arguing.

                       It would really help if you studied the mechanics of how people long ago had the earth figured...how they had the sun, moon, stars and planets figured.....then check and see which model better fits what can be observed.   Might ask why all that old info is so hidden?  If nothing else it was ingenious how they had it figured...even if it was wrong.  But instead a lie is told instead that they thought you would fall off the edge.   No, on either model you can circumnavigate East to West or West to East......if you started in NY on the flat earth model, and headed due east....you'd wind up right back in NY.  You would have gone around the circle, with the North Pole being the center of that circle.  The sun and moon rising and setting are a matter of perspective......same as the tops of light poles get closer to the ground as they head toward the horizon......until they reach the limit of vision....when they're effective "gone over the horizon"....but according to the globe model, they went over a curve and out of line of sight......get a zoom lens and check that.

                    If you believe that, please show me a proof that the earth is a globe...just one experiment that's repeatable and demonstrable...not tall tales that someone went around the bottom of it.  Outside of fake imagery.  Does it not bother you the images from NASA are fake?  What experiment has shown the earth's surface to have curvature.....where is it measured?  Speaking of math....on a sphere 24,901 miles in circumference, how high would a plane be in just an hour if it flew straight and level from take off at 600 mile per hour?  Or do planes automatically follow the curvature?  Because in just over an hour, they'd be 50 miles up if they flew straight and level from the runway.....or conversely, they would have to nose down 50 miles every hour to stay level with the earth beneath.  Come to think of it, on a ball, no matter how big the ball....the horizon would drop at elevation.  How come all flight simulators arep programmed on a flat map of earth?   There's google earth's model already built, wouldn't it be easy to just make software to fly above that model?  But then the horizon would drop as it should on a sphere and there would be noticable curvature at atlitude.....aka...it wouldn't match the reality of what a pilot sees.

                 Also with the sun...when it sets...zoom in and it rises again...same thing with boats or anything else that has "gone over the horizon".   Which means they did not go over the horizon, they just went beyond your sight.  With a zoom, the limit of vision is raised and objects can be seen above the horizon again....congruent with perspective....and how it was explained for thousands of years before a bunch of self proclaimed "satanists" started saying the rising and setting were because we're spinning over 1,000 mph while orbiting a sun 93 million miles away.  Sure, it does work out mathematically, but its an illusion.   To quote Tesla...."Today's scientists have replaced experiments with mathematics, they wander off through equation after equation until eventually they build a structure that has no relation to reality".

            Sandy hook was an obvious psyop hoax, Gene Rosen has become a cult crisis actor hero. In a bad way of course.  I have never thought of going past it's obvious use as a pretense for demonizing assault rifles.  Wanna see a crisis actor even worse than Rosen? Some brutal fake news from CNN about an event that never happened? Be prepared to laugh, it is terrible.
