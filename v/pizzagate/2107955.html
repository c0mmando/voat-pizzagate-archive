<p>Nothing has changed since 2008.</p>
<p>Enter Peter H. Diamandis, named by Fortune Magazine in 2014 as one of &quot;The World\'s 50 Greatest Leaders.&quot;  He is chairman and CEO of the X Prize Foundation, best known for its $10 million Ansari X PRIZE for private spaceflights.  He is also co-founder and vice-chairman of Human Longevity, Inc., (HCI), a genomics and cell therapy-based diagnostic and therapeutic company focused on extending the human life span.  Its headquarters is San Diego, CA along with a Mountain View, CA location.  Mr. Diamandis wants to live to age 700.</p>
<p>HLI received $80 million in investments in its Series A offering in summer 2014 and announced a further $220 million Series B investment offering in April 2016.  It has made deals with drug companies Celgene and AstraZeneca to collaborate in its research.  
</p>
<p>HLI purchased Lifebank USA in 2016, &quot;a leader in placental and cord blood banking along with its high-yield method for extracting placental stem cells.&quot;  Cord and placental blood tissue provide high quality DNA from mother and newborn for genome sequencing.  HLI plans to start offering its newborn genome sequencing product along with stem cell banking.  It may already be doing so.  HLI also launched Health Nucleus (based at its San Diego location), a genomic powered clinical reserach center which uses whole genome sequence analysis and advanced clinical imaging to deliver the most complete picture of individual health for the consumer.</p>

<p>Mr. Diamandis wears many hats.  Here is his list:</p>
<ol>
<li>
1987 - in his 3rd year of medical school, co-founded International Space University (a $30 million university campus in 
  Strasbourg, France) 
</li>
<li>1989 - co-founded Microsoft Launch Systems (MIcrospace, Inc.)</li>
<li>1991 - founded Constellation Communications which was sold to E-Systems and Orbital</li>
<li>
1994 - founded X PRIZE Foundation after the failure of International Microspace and after he finished reading, &quot;The 
  Spirit of St. Louis.&quot; (Thus began a new generation of private passenger-carrying spaceships.  X PRIZE was created to 
  fund and operate a $10 million incentive.  The PRIZE was announced on 05/18/1996 without any purse or teams,  It was 
   funded through an insurance policy underwritten by the Anousheh and Hamid Ansari family)
</li>
<li>1994 - founded Zero Gravity Corporation</li>
<li>1995-1999 - president of Angel Technologies Corp.</li>
<li>
1998 - co-founder and vice-chairman of Space Adventures, Ltd) a space tourism company that has flown 8 private 
  customers to the Internet Space Station since 2001)
</li>
<li>2005 - co-founder and chairman of Rocket Racing League.  (a motor sport cross between Indy car racing and rockets)</li>
<li>
2008 - cofounder and executive chairman of Singularity University (a university that addresses humanity\'s grand 
challenges, based at NASA Ames campus in Silicon Valley; supported by Google, Autodesk, Cisco, Nokia, Kauffman 
Foundation, and e Planet Ventures)
</li>
<li>2012 - founder of Human Longevity, Inc. (HLI)  
</li>

<p>Peter Diamandis\' business, HLI, raises several huge questions.  First of all, he is extremely wealthy and is more than likely connected with the Deep State.  The Deep State is interested in longevity and will seek any method to obtain it.  The genome sequencing field has corruption written all over it.  It is frightening to think about the possibilities, and speaking of possibilities... </p>
<p>The possibility exists that there is a heritability facor or familial transmission of pedophilia based on a 2012 study published in The Library of Congress NIH, &quot;Potential Implications of Research on Genetic or Heritable Contributions to Pedophilia for the Objectives of Criminal Law.&quot;  This study involved the construction of genograms over multiple generations of 5 different families and supported the familial transmissions of homosexual and heterosexual pedophilia.</p>
<p>A 2013 Finnish study presented evidence that genetic influences may contribute to sexual interest towards children, at least among adult men.  It was one of the 1st studies of its kind to empiracally demonstrate heritable factors in the development of pedophilia.  Recent research has also explored pedophilia\'s association to specific genes.</p>

<p>The area of genetic testing and genome sequencing is a hot issue.  Independent companies are popping up around the world offering it.  Sad but true, genetic tests are not regulated in the U.S., meaning they go to market without any independent analysis to verify the claims of the seller.  Since the 1990\'s, expert panels and members of Congress have expressed concern about this regulatory gap and the need for FDA to address it.  The FDA has the authority to regulate genetic tests, but it has to date only regulated the relatively small number of genetic tests sold to labs as kits.  In response, in 2010 the FDA announced plans to expand its regulation to all genetic tests.</p>
<p>This expansion has yet to take place.</p>',

            I very much agree. They are working feverishly to accomplish their goals behind the scenes while people have no clue. They don't care how they get their as long as they get there.

             Like drinking children's blood mixed with adrenaline to stay young. Perhaps the pedophile elites are getting ready to grow their own supply, which requires them to sequence the genome.

              They will do what they have to. Sick Sick Sick. I feel like I am in a weird coma version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and can't wake up. Somebody Shake Me.

            Upvoat4U. This is scary at best. They will keep trying unless they are stopped. A big push for the FDA to pull in the reins is in high order. Trump should be pushing this is he is the Swamp Drainer everybody says he is. Your post is so important.

            That is what the mod(s) who deleted my submissions told me.  Fair is fair.

             This is not a "general discussion." 
The ability is here to do whatever you want with DNA, and there are no regulations in place.  This fact alone is frightening.  Studies have linked genetics with pedophilia.  Yes, they are recent studies and more research needs to be done now that genome sequencing has been conquered.  The subject bears watching.
            </p>
            <p>
             And who said the mods are always fair?  Some are, some are not.  That is just my opinion, and I believe all, if not most of us who have been active contrbutors to pizzagate have experienced their wrath and what we consider to be unfairness to us.  Then again, somebody has to mind the store or pizzagate would not be a subverse.
