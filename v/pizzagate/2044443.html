            How anyone can not see that Scientology is just another Lucifer/Pedo cult is beyond me. L. Ron was besties with Aleister Crowley and they fucked young boys together while performing rituals. Enough said. I will continue to regard all high-level Scientology members as pedos until proven otherwise.

            So, I had some weird Scientology reaction when I created a fake FB account and started posting pizzagate evidence. It still doesn't make sense to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I pretended to be a journalist from the ICIJ and laid out the DNC money trail to Russia, along with Alefantis' money laundering network of small businesses.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, they felt me out with a few sockpuppets and the conversation turned to how the Bohemian Grove had been infiltrated by the same people as the Scientologists. I believe it to be the Process Church of the Final Judgment.
           </p>
           <p>
            At which point, they left messages all over my posts, saying, 'This creature is entry level who merely made some good guesses, is not involved and probably not even a female. Disregard.' Then, the sock puppets all deactivated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, I don't really understand it, other than to say I believe all religions are infiltrated and someone connected to the Scientologists AND the ICIJ was really interested in knowing if I could actually prove the Process Church had infiltrated Bohemian Grove.
           </p>
           <p>
            They seemed to really hate the primary sources I was posting... but I don't know how Russian and Saudi money in the DNC ties into Scientology or the ICIJ.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, I'm sharing this because I am certain Scientology shills prefer pizzagate be covered up, but I don't know exactly why. Maybe someone has some theories.

             Also just FYI, I just saw this and I find it really weird that Doyle worked for a company named Digital Lightwave and Lee Stranahan hater was wearing a pedo looking spiral logo tshirt he says was the Lightwave 3D logo. I just think it's a super strange coincidence like the law of attraction messing with me or something. LOL.

            <p>
             I've been able to see the Facebook pages of numerous friends from CCHR and Pizzagate is never mentioned. I googled Scientology Pedophile and found that this guy's org CCHR Florida has a page which states that Deep Brain Stimulation causes pedophilia through causing hypersexuality through brain damage. It's like they want everyone to think all evils in the world are caused by psychiatry even if they're participating in them themselves, but psychiatry as the excuse is the cover up.
            </p>
            <p>
             But even some of my other Scientology friends started acting totally weird and strange towards me when I stopped writing about the things they liked and started talking about this. Their questions to me were always insulting like, "Are you still doing anything activism related?" "Are you doing anything now a days?" Yes asshole I'm doing stuff, just not stuff you wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's like they want everyone to focus on psych drugs instead of MK Ultra. I think that is the reason they exist. To make people believe the random killings and all ills of the world are because of psychiatry instead of because of psychiatry within the government creating MK Ultra Manchurian Candidates. Is it possible to create violence with drugs? Sure. But is it even more possible to do it with drugs and mind control? Absolutely. Scientologists are some of the most mind controlled slaves I know. If you ever go to their events you feel like you just invaded an alien planet. Everyone is conditioned into the language of the cult. Maybe they don't use drugs but they are definitely mind controlled.
            </p>
            <p>
             I see Scientology and CCHR as a distraction to make people think about psychiatric drugs as the reason for everything. Chester Bennington dies in a suicide? Must be the drugs he was taking and not the fact that someone murdered him before wrapping a noose around his neck.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled, yeah
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies, while the slaves are all workin'
Blood is on the table and the mouths are all chokin'
But I'm goin' hungry, yeah

            I've had co-intel-pro pedo stalkers after me for a very long time. It happens when you are over the target. I just had to deal with one today mis AnirTak76 who looks like an operative for the OTO who is causing damage to our case.

            Can anyone explain why this brings up a Virginia address and the other tools bring up Texas addresses? Also how do you know whether this is identifying RRWE as the owner of the IP address? Or is that something to do with Time Warner Cable??? It brings up an address that when looked up has several Defense related business names / locations near an airport in Virginia I assume to be Dulles - it brings up Sophia's Cafe as well.

            Paul Haggis might be worth digging down on. He is creepy beyond creepy and yes, he claims he left Scientology but only after his now deceased sister exposed him for  what a fraud he is. For those that don't know he is a screenwriter and director who many in Hollywood know to be a thief and a fake.

                Carrollton is close to all 3 but closer to Dallas and to the Church of Scientology in Irving / los Colinas next to the world's busiest international airport
That guy Samuel Garcia is from Dallas for sure and he was one of the guys who was stalking / harassing me but he appears to be from Mexico and I don't think that he would be the one making the types of comments I posted above here:

              It's Sophia's Cafe or something? Or the DOD? Not sure. The first is a list of places near Sophia's Cafe at that address and the second is a blog that thought that IP address was the DOD who then later figured out it was someone from Sprint squatting on the DOD address. I have no idea what's going on as I know nothing about cybersecurity or computers.

             Look at the pic of Caris James taped to a table. If its not full-on penetration, people can "explain away" anything. Then they turn the whole thing around, and make it look like "Pizzagaters see child porn everywhere they look! Nothing is innocent in their eyes!" Like how everyone was defending Jake Tappers tweet about enjoying looking at pictures of his friend's kids and saying "These online trolls make everything about child porn! They are delusional freaks!" That is the angle they are playing here, trying to make US look like the perverts.

               Yeah, sorry if people don't do facebook, I don't either, but he put a lock on it.  It was available before, before all the attention he received.  With him stalking someone's child in Arizona.  He is still walking this earth free just like you and me. Scumbag.

                his instagram and Facebook are pretty closely related most of the time. His Facebook has one really weird thing on it which is a link with a weird film studio called "KP Ghost Productions."

                 He is a Scientologist. He has a quote of L Ron Hubbard on his facebook (of what I could see)  I also remember that he travels all over the place and when we researched him we discovered that he was flying all over the country when he does not make that much money, looking at his work history.  He also seems to have lots of connections.  I remember seeing those pictures and the picture of a sleeping little girl it was eerie and gave me the shivers.

              I'm not sure, but I know his business location was in that same direction whenever he came out to DFW
