              <em>
               penises
              </em>

             </strong>
             in headline text, all over public bus stops and metro stations across northern Spain, with backing by local government.

             </strong>
             exploiting children by supporting this offering of visual fodder to the masses, and the masses will take away what they will. Who knows what some of them will do with it, but at least one adult will find this drawing “inspiring.”
             <strong>
              Who might suffer for that?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Then, what’s next... when the public is desensitized enough... naked transgendered children with penises and vulvas displayed with photographic realism?
            </p>
            <p>
             That’s the relevance I find, but I could be wrong.

              ?  It's not hard to copy into a new post and clarify relevance.  It just needs to be clear from the title, and with additional explanation at top of post if needed.

                Thank you.  What I meant too, was that it was also too late, because by then there were so many comments and researching that would have had to been reposted.  There were over 300 comments and only around 14 points.  Which is not important.  What is important is when there is a post that should be seen by those other than the usual members, is that it is sad to say, that when there are high points it is more noticed.  This is what attracts those that are Newbies.  The ones we are so very hard trying to reach.  I hope I made myself clear. :)

               Most definitely.  I feel really bad for kids that are getting sucked up into this.  That time is a very difficult time for young people.  They need gentle guidance and time.  Not a rush sex change job.

             In that article this seems so important and something we should all remember.  A report by two world-renowned psychiatrists last August found most children and teenagers who claim to be transgender change their minds as they grow up.   Thanks for the link.  The Normalization Creeps are bamboozling some people into sex changes when all they need is intervention by opposing groups and counseling from a doctor.  They will ruin their lives for their stupid idiotic and selfish agenda.

             Well, I don't want to do that, but that kid has had some bad upbringing for sure.  His parents are the ones that need parenting.  Another kid whose parents are feeding this genderfluid garbage into the brains of their children.  Jolie Syndrome

               Execute is exactly what MF just did.  Deleted.  Well, we can't execute these people just for this, but speaking out and back is important.  Many people were very against them, so that is good news.  And this is on a gay site, so people are not going to put up with this Clap Trap.

             Yeah, well he can go with the flow in the non gender room. I am really mad.  I am wondering if they removed it because too many people were pummeling this kid and his parents.  I wonder if it was some kind of set up by some wack job org.  to get people riled up.  Brrrrrr.  Oooooh.  I am mad.  Some threads have much smaller replies and are not taken down.  Many people really gave it to the parents and said why would he try to stay on the boy's basketball team but would only want to use the girl's bathroom.  A few women voiced their opinions about how very shy they were at that time of the month even with only girls coming in and out.  They could not imagine how they would cope with a boy invading their privacy.  I have read articles and heard pieces on tv, I don't know why this burned me up so much.  Some people categorized this as a mental condition, which really surprised me.
