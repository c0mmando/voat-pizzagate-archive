<p>I  noticed the reference to Aqua Club in a comment on this thread about BrighterYoungThings.com <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1658020">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1658020</a> It was a picture of a Fetish party at the Aqua Club.</p>
<p>Aqua Club caught my attention while I was looking at something else in the same building:  A daycare.
Here is some time travel for the daycare. It was originally a Cerebral Palsy place (as far back as 2007).

<p>This 2013 review mentions the VIP sections and the privacy afforded there, as well as the plush benches that make good beds.

<p>2012 and 2013 reviews tag this club as an “Asian” nightclub.  It mentions creeper guys, and a warning not to go alone as a female.

<p>This December 2016 review mentions the daycare in the building. A 2015 reviewer calls the club an “unexpected hidden away nightclub” and this user even attended the FetishBall.  Another 2015 review calls this place shady. They also mention getting kicked out before their ticket expired at 2am.  For some reason, I’m thinking that 2am seems to be a popular time in DC.

            This brings up a depressing thought.  There's many stories over the years of arrests of pedos who exploit disabled children for sexual abuse and the lucrative market of filming/distributing CP online.  It could be that some foster care providers, like in the previous post, and possibly some disability helpers, etc could be another huge area where this evil exists.
