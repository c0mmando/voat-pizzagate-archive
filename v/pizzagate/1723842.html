<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I came across this thread while researching the value on my property and googling my address.</p>
<p>My name is Jack Edma and I live at 499 Stonewall Rd, Concord, VA with my family: my new born son, my girlfriend and her daughter.</p>
<p>Centre Chretien de l\'Enfant Haitien is an organization serving the less fortunate in Haiti, operating an orphanage and a church in the Port-au-Prince area. My mother, Marie Gesila Duperval Edma, started the orphanage over 35 years ago when she was only 21 years old in Haiti. My mother passed away form an heart attack in July 28th 2008 during my sophomore year at Liberty University. She was my role model and always wanted to make her proud. From then on, I decided to dedicate my life to honor her with everything that I do and have.</p>
<p>With my love for music and passion to DJ as a performer, I started the business MG Productions named after my late mother with the MG standing for Marie Gesila. Since then we became the leader in Strategic Marketing and Event Production with many great events and festivals under our belt.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also registered Centre Chretien de l\'Enfant Haitien (also known as CCEH) here in Virginia in an effort to raise awareness for our organization in the US and abroad. A portion of the revenue generated through MG Productions helps fund the work of CCEH by helping to secure shelter, food and quality of life for the kids in Haiti. We actively provided relief for the Haitian Community in the South during hurricane Matthew.</p>
<p>I have been very active in my community of Lynchburg Virginia. I have actively work in the revitalization efforts of downtown Lynchburg and in promoting Arts &amp; Culture. In 2016, I received the Vice Mayor\'s Award of Excellence for my contribution to the city of Lynchburg.</p>
<p>Marc-Arthur Aristilde is a Haitian friend that I met while attending Liberty University. He went on to become a truck driver in the US. When he got into an accident, he lost his contract and was down on his luck with nowhere to stay. I opened my doors to him and offered him a place to stay until he could get back on his feet. Throughout this time, he decided to register a trucking company under my address since he was living here. With the thought that one day he could secure his own load and work for himself, that dream never came to fruition. He now works at a local distribution center.</p>
<p>I take the time to share this information because I understand how important the situation is. As the father of a newborn son, I will do anything to ensure his wellbeing and safety.</p>
<p>I am happy and avail myself to answer any questions that you may have. I can be reached at jack.edma@gmail.com or my cell at (434) 229-6887.</p>
<p>Kindly, Jack Edma</p>

            If anyone feels the need to investigate this further I understand. This is the sort of thing we want though. Explanations. Not to be accused of making things up or being lied to. Thanks Jack Edma for taking the time to explain things.

            Giving out his address, his coordinates, his family history and marital and social status like that only means he's trying to look transparent and probably is an honest person with nothing to hide.

             Aristilde is a lot closer to Aristide than Aristotle. Aristide was the president of Haiti.

            I hope this is true but for some reason it reminds me of one of those Nigerian prince letters. Too much detail, especially knowing what this is about why would you advertise that you have a new born?

               No, faekitty trawled through someone's Instagram and found that the guy took a bunch of his daughter's friends to American Girl restaurant in NYC, and fingerpointed at every star, swirl or picture with a kid he had and said that his interest in restaurant reviews and children clearly showed he was a flesh eating ped.   He was a friend or cousin of somebody on the original instagams of PG.  Alefantis was rumored to be on this board at that time, and the guy popped up, said "someone" had Facebooked him about the post and he blasted faekitty and the entire effort as a bunch of nuts, with birdseyeview looking on and laughing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Faekitty finally deleted her own stupid post in embarrassment.  I never trusted that entire faekitty contingent because of these kind of irresponsible, nil research accusatory posts that the mods btw had no problem leaving up for days with no "accuracy in question" flairs anywhere in sight.  We are lucky it didn't turn into a bigger incident.
