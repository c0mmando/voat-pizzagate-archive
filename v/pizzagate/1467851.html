WARNING  THIS  ARTICLE IS VERY GRAPHIC.
 My Children\'s Rights Foundation has been receiving several messages lately regarding the Pizzagate scandal. People have been asking my opinion on Comit Ping Pong and  Pizzeria owner Mr. James Alefantis who is being accused by the public of child trafficking and molestation. Some of the messages I\'ve received have been from molestation victims  who are wanting their stories to be heard.  Although I was first contacted about this scandal several weeks ago, I\'m just now getting  around to investigating.  It’s my hope that this Pizzagate scandal will provide the necessary platform to shed some light on this very sad situation...</em> [...]

           <p>
            Few things that stuck out to me involving CPS:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Anthony Mangione, 50 year old Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for South Florida, was arrested on “extreme child abuse” charges on 28 September 2011. He was sentenced, November 2012, to nearly six years in prison. Mangione is a 1982
             <strong>
              graduate of the University of Maine Orono (UMO) where former Senior Child Protection Services (CPS) Cynthia Wellman claimed, at the time, CPS was operating a child sex ring, on campus, with UMO’s involvement.
             </strong>
             “Little is known about Mangione’s time at UMaine. Originally from Rhode Island, he arrived in Orono in August 1978.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            (Bolded by me)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             William Shaffer, a Child Protection Services (CPS) staff was arrested, July 2013, after he purchased nearly $7,000 of child rape and torture, aka child porn. According Shaffer’s criminal complaint “a 1987 police report alleged Shaffer sexually molested a boy between the ages of 8 and 9. The police report alleged the incident happened while Shafer was a Child Protective Services employee.” Investigators also seized “sexual stories” from Shaffer’s home. “One of them describes a seventh grade boy being abducted, molested and sodomized. It is not clear if Shaffer wrote the story — but refers to Michigan State University and 16 Mile Road. Shaffer’s residence is located just south of Maple Road.”
            </p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Stanley Dorozynski, a 53 year old Child Protective Services (CPS) employee, was arrested, 21 December 2010, and charged with two counts, one each, of possessing and receiving child porn. Upon his arrest, Dorozynski possessed more than 2,400 child sex abuse images/videos including the abuse of children as young as four years old. Investigators also recovered 11 zip discs of child porn in a locked trunk, among other CDs. Doroszynski had been trading in child rape and torture since 1990. Dorozynski plead guilty, 27 July 2012, and was sentenced to six years in federal prison. His girlfriend found the child sex abuse images/videos and notified law enforcement. He had been a police officer in Utica, New York, before he went to work for Health and Human Services.

            Can anyone find anything to show that Kathleen Dearinger was actually working with Nancy Schaefer. The work seems very similar  to what Nancy Schaefer was working on, it does seem very clear that Nancy Schaefer was killed for her work and the report that she was developing. Nancy Schaefer has a huge amount of credibility, if we can be demonstrated that they were working together and we have the best advocate for the truth behind Pizzagate who is actually alive (at the moment).

            she writes-
" It has NOTHING to do with getting likes. I had a difficult time posting the article because they kept deleting portions of it. I had to retype parts of it several times. This started happening after they added CATPA to verify I wasn't a robot. It happens EVERY time I cover this particular subject that I slipped into this Pizzagate article where I discuss foster children. They have blocked me from Facebook. I can post anything else but that subject so they must have a software that looks for certain key words"
