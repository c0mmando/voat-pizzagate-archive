            <p>
             ICICI Bank is one of the Big Four banks of India.[7] The bank has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Canada; branches in United States, Singapore, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Qatar, Oman, Dubai International Finance Centre, China[8] and South Africa;[9] as well as representative offices in United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. The company's UK subsidiary has also established branches in Belgium and Germany
            </p>
            <p>
             Controversies:
            </p>
            <p>
             Inhumane debt recovery methods- A few years after its rise to prominence in the banking sector, ICICI bank faced allegations on the recovery methods it used against loan payment defaulters. A number of cases were filed against the bank and its employees for using "brutal measures" to recover the money...The bank also faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour in recovering its loans. These allegations started initially when the "recovery agents" and bank employees started threatening the defaulters. In some cases, notes were written by the bank's employees
             <strong>
              asking the defaulters to "sell everything in the house including family members",
             </strong>
             were found. Such charges faced by the bank rose to a peak when suicide cases were reported wherein the suicide notes spoke of the bank's recovery methods as the cause of the suicide. This led to legal battles and the bank paying huge compensation
            </p>
            <p>
             Money laundering allegations - On 14 March 2013 the online magazine Cobrapost released video footage from Operation Red Spider showing high-ranking officials and some employees of ICICI Bank agreeing to convert black money into white, an act in violation of Money Laundering Control Act. The Government of India and Reserve Bank of India ordered an inquiry following the exposé.

             The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) is an independent charity established in 2011 to improve the educational attainment of the poorest pupils in English schools..The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) was founded in 2011 by lead charity
             <strong>
              The Sutton Trust
             </strong>
             , in partnership with Impetus Trust (now part of Impetus–Private Equity Foundation), with a £125 million founding grant from the Department for Education..
            </p>
            <p>
             The EEF was initiated in November 2010, when the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, announced plans to establish an education endowment foundation intended to help raise standards in challenging schools,
             <strong>
              inspired by the Obama administration's Race to the Top initiative in the USA
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The EEF was formally launched in July 2011, with Chairman Sir Peter Lampl declaring its aim would be to ‘develop initiatives to raise the attainment of the poorest pupils in the most challenging schools’.[7] The EEF took over from the Sutton Trust the development of the Teaching and Learning Toolkit, and Sir Kevan Collins, former Chief Executive of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, was appointed the EEF's first chief executive.
            </p>
            <p>
             In October 2019, it was announced that
             <strong>
              Professor Becky Francis
             </strong>
             would replace Sir Kevan Collins as chief executive of the EEF

             .In February 2017, SM Line, a new shipping firm formed by Samra Midas (SM) Group, purchased five vessels previously owned by Hanjin.[13] In March, SM Line acquired two of Hanjin Shipping's terminals in Korea, in the cities of Gwangyang and Incheon.

             <p>
              2016: The Carlyle Group has recently embarked on due diligence of South Korea’s Logen Co. Ltd. for a possible acquisition, following another private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and Affinity Equity Partners which rekindled interest in the parcel delivery company last month, according to investment banking sources on August 23.
             </p>
             <p>
              Logen, unlisted and the fourth-biggest package delivery firm in South Korea, is wholly owned by Baring Private Equity Asia (PEA). It has been put up for sale since earlier this year...
             </p>
             <p>
              But shortlisted bidders in the preliminary bidding process in March – Germany’s DHL, UPS and a South Korean private equity fund – had all dropped out of the auction because of its high price tag. CVC and Affinity, which also had placed preliminary bids for Logen, reportedly suggested between the upper end of the 200 billion won range and the lower end of the 300 billion won range.

            <p>
             Flex Ltd.[2] (previously known as Flextronics International Ltd. or Flextronics) is an American Singaporean-domiciled multinational electronics contract manufacturer. It is the third[3] largest global electronics manufacturing services (EMS), original design manufacturer (ODM) company by revenue, behind only Pegatron for what concerns original equipment manufacturers. Flex's corporate headquarters are located in Singapore, and its administrative headquarters are in San Jose, California.[4][5][6] The company has manufacturing operations in over 40 countries, totalling about 200,000 employees.
            </p>
            <p>
             n 1993, the company received venture capital funding through
             <strong>
              Sequoia Capital
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             ..In September 2015, Flex acquired NEXTracker, one of the leading solar tracker companies, for $330 million.[16] In August 2016, NEXTracker bought Bright Box Technologies, a leader in predictive modeling software and machine-learning technologies, expanding its capabilities in advanced diagnostics and real-time control of solar tracking systems..
            </p>
            <p>
             In November 2015, Flex, acquired Wink smart home platform to bring the Intelligence of Things "Home".

            </p>
            <p>
             In August 2016, the state of Massachusetts and the city of Boston offered the company more than $3 million in public aid to entice the company to open its Flex Boston Innovation Center on the South Boston waterfront. The 17,000 square feet (1,600 m2) facility will employ 25 people and be located in a former military storehouse in the Seaport, now called the Innovation and Design Building..
            </p>

He served as the company's CEO from 2006 to 2018. At the time of his retirement, Flex had $25 billion in revenue and over 200,000 employees worldwide. The Board of Directors hired an executive recruiting company to assist with its search for a new CEO.[21] On 11 February 2019, Flex announced Revathi Advaithi as CEO. Prior to Flex, Advaithi was president and chief operating officer for the Electrical Sector business for
             <strong>

             When I searched the hashtag, there was also tweet from 2016 mentioning Assange being silent since the "pizzajet" scandal. That leads me to believe that Twitter was autofilling "pizzajet" instead of "pizzagate" at some point.

             If you aren't aware of the connections between eugenics - transhumanism and Epstein's network, I can't help you.  But somehow I rather suspect you do know the connections and... I'm aware you have other accounts ;-)

              LOL this bitch thinks that avoiding nigger monkey sperm is tantamount to getting a bionic arm or brain chip installed.  With that nuanced thinking I'm tempted to speculate you've got some nigger in you too, or will this weekend.

                "donkey is a shill" is a dead meme, niggerlover, no one believes it, and either way it's ad hominem.  You should do a 6 Degrees of Pizzagate thing: connect, say, dolphins and granola bars. GO!

                 Donkey is not the account I was thinking of.. it's the other one :-) I'm just going to mute you now and get on with  compiling all the connections to MI6.  Your employers really need to get someone BRIGHTER on your watch.

              <p>
               This is why the focus should be exposing the real “ROOT” and model - Racine, Wisconsin where Trump made The Deal for the 8th Wonder of the World.
              </p>
              <p>
               What does The Deal enable? Why is it such a secret that neither party will even mention?
              </p>
              <p>
               Why is Racine ground zero for experimental COVID testing and tracing with Weill Cornell?
              </p>
              <p>
               Why was Sustainable Racine the model for global sustainable development and Agenda 21?

             Sen. Feinstein is well known as an ardent fan of the reds in Beijing. She has opposed a U.S. anti-missile defense, supported China’s MFN status, supported the COSCO purchase of Long Beach port and is a well-known opponent of linking human rights with trade. However, Feinstein’s financial ties to the communist Chinese and COSCO include her husband, Richard Blum.

             Blum is reported to be heavily tied to the PRC through his Far East investment firm, Newbridge Capitol Corp. Blum’s partner at Newbridge, Peter Kwok, also served as a consultant to COSCO, and COSCO Hong Kong Holdings, a company owned by Chinese billionaire Li Ka-Shing.
             <strong>
              In 1989, Kwok helped CITIC and Li Ka-Shing raise $120 million to buy a Hughes-built communications satellite for a company also part owned by Chinese generals.

             I am going through the flight logs and I see Prince Andrew uses this near-London airport, EGGW. I had took up a lot of airport codes.

            <p>
             Anyway, I wonder if this airport is a pedo hub like Teterboro, NJ is. Dwrshowitz flew out of Teterboro.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think pedos have certain "favorite" airports (opinion).
