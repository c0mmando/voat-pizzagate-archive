            I think I'm done posting now. Be warned. You've no government and no freedom at all of any kind that you don't delude yourselves into. They're all chameleons undertaking great evil. See the last few posts on my sub.

             You're correct. Forgive me for not wanting to go into details atm. But that someone was this guy:

             A proud DARPA psychopath.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been getting tortured for a long time. They're all in on it.. CSIS, NSA.. ETc.

             This whole pizzagate thing? Because the elite are all tranny pedos.. it's another 'legalize it' 'wait for it' public sleep command and Temple Grandin war on sentience so people just finally accept the status quo that's never changed while only the appearances around it do.. as in politics in general, economic religion. It's all psy op warfare and the Hollywood trannies you guys are looking at here are just another diversion from the real chameleons that steal your every chance at life from you.
            </p>
            <p>
             They fucked with me because I'm smart enough to see it all and don't mind saying it. They also thought they had leverage on me because I did some semi gay shit online and am not but am a little damaged from things that made me avoid life more. Particularly with the shit opportunities that I never had and because I always knew since I was made sick by another psychopath way back in the day that I would need weed to function normally and feel well. I had learned things over the years, devised methods, figured out how the world around me works.. thinks like 'rosin' came from me.
            </p>
            <p>
             'Sublimator' was stolen to try and drive me mad but instead I had them drive my concept around the world and grant it award after award. Because it is also revolutionary. They tried filing patents on it.. but were genuinely too fucking stupid. I had them every step of the way.. even when my self was lost my mind never was.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's actually a 'vacuum vaporization' concept that preserves the cannabinoid potency from thermal degradation and enables it to pull all compounds form the plant matter in primary extraction at a reduced temperature with a homogenized result such that it is the only vape that is capable of producing the proper and full effect. They can't allow that to exist in a serious way either.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's more.. I've been through hell like you wouldn't believe. So I'd ask that you appreciate some bruntness from me if you want to call it.. it's been pretty difficult and I haven't wanted to go into detail and probably also couldn't have until now. But my mind is mine again. Until the next time they bust in the door and dose me which they've made obvious they'll totally do at any time to anyone anywhere because your country is all a 'tranny' joke as well, and won't protect you from them. So I think that's what I'm here to tell you all.

            PS: I also realize that maybe some of you did this to me because you're just cowards yourselves. Let's see if you can stand at all now. I doubt it.

            Also, part of the 'grooming interview', they actually showed me the Podesta videos and asked me about the sound. I told them then that it was him with 100% certainty. Of course they already knew. Pizzagate is just a psyop to pacify you.
