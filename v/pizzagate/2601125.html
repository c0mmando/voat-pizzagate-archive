I know for sure it will bring the killer of this former A-/B+ list mostly television actor from a now defunct hit network show closer to justice. The shoe drop yesterday was one of the names our actor had. He didn\'t get to give his testimony but he did drop the name and it sent a lot of shock waves. Apparently the name that went down yesterday was protecting and sending information to that foreign born business person who had previously been convicted of the same type thing. Because of his position, the name who got dropped yesterday was able to provide cover and the networks that could be used for all this child porn. Everyone assumed they were safe because of what he did. Now, it turns out things weren\'t as safe and that those secret messaging apps, are not really that secret. If I am this A-lister who is already in hiding, I am going deep into hiding because that is one very big loose end that would be much easier to deal with if dead. If that happened, and the mogul had some big distance, he has enough power and enough secrets, he might escape unscathed, at least publicly. That would be a tragedy, but I don\'t know who would take him down.</p>

            Kevin E. Clinesmith was another name dropped that day that caused a stir.  He was a lawyer working for the FBI on the Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations before he was sidelined due to anti-Trump text messages he apparently thought were not traceable.  The attorney general's report referred to him as Attorney 2, but Rep. Mark Meadows outed him and Sally Moyer (Agent 5) during a congressional hearing.  Don't know enough about him to know whether he's a fit for this convoluted CDAN blind.  Just putting it out there.
