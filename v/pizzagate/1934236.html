            Trust me, I have. It's a valid theory and I genuinely believe there is a pedophile ring in the upper chambers of our government.

            However this post is ridiculous. He was in the hospital and they sent pizza as a kind gesture. It's common to send food in times of grief. Not EVERYTHING is a conspiracy.

            This is a MESSAGE-- just shoving it down their throats to BACK OFF. We will use MK Ultra mind controlled patsy to kill the Majority Whip. Not to mention as the Whip he is in charge of "whipping" up the votes needed to pass legislation. And now this guy might die..disgusting evil pedophiles run our government.

            Key theme, people are trying to convince us that civil war is imminent. An article from the coroporate media was published for the sole purpose of letting us know that pizza was sent to the vicitm from the DNC. It is obvious they are trying to goad people to take to the streets, to they can crack down and impose martial law, maybe even gun laws. I am suspicious about this entire news cycle with the assasination attempt. The news called the would be assasins a person distraught with Trump. Supposedly he was killed at the scene, yet this is built into the narrative of known facts, the same day of the crime. They know his feelings on Trump how? Very corny. It looks like the entire Trump psyop is extreme divide and conquer. He is obviously in on it. I call bullshit on this entire story, especially since I know the left/right are both in on it.

            Alternative theory to consider. IMO, there is also a psyop that they have been developing, to convince us that we are on the verge of civil war. They are trying to foster this. The reason they seem to want this is because they want an excuse to declare martial law. After Trump won the election, the Hollywood assets sprung into action with hysteria, including Rosie O'donell, who said we needed martial law. A completely irresponsible idiotic statment, but clearly this is what she had to push.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are they trying to convince us, that citizens are distraught with Trump, and one took the law into his own hands and fired on Republicans? Are they hoping that we think the cabal is behind it, so as to get us to react? The reason I would even consider this is because after watching the Seth Rich family video, I thought it looked staged. One of the theories  was that maybe Rich was never killed, and they wanted the people who know what is going on to rebel, all the while the sheeple would not understand this and stand with the government. I am not exactly going with this, but since they lie about everything, and since even the lies don't add up, I am trying to see what does add up.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would add up that they are trying to get us fed up with their getting away with murder and corruption. Why else would their own corporate media outlet have an article whose sole purpose was to tell us the DNC sent a pizza to the Rep staffers? Made zero sense. I would expect that from an exagerating half truther site.  Don't know, just kicking stuff around. For the time being, this is a dispicable act followed by gloating over the victims and country. But I don't know...

            This is like HRC sending Flynn the tweet after he was fired that said "What Comets around goes around." Flynn had tweeted sometime before about HRC and crew being involved in child trafficking, etc.

            If the pizza was from CPP or Besta, the message would be loud and clear, but sometimes a pizza
            <em>
             is
            </em>
            just a pizza.

             Who sends a pizza when somebody is hurt? flowers serve that purpose. Pizza is for parties or joyus occasions. Your mom died, I'll send a pizza. They know we know this, and they are purposely goading us. But the reason I think is not the same as most think. This entire story might be bullshit to push their civil war agenda, followed by crackdown laws, that they could not put in place otherwise. This story stinks.

              Office protocol. Ever work in an office? I mean a dynamic office....not a dentist office.

              Buying pizza for lunch for the whole office is expensive and rare and usually done only when undue circumstances dictate it.

              I'm on your side. I posted pictures of the "weird clown feeding child" from Besta Pizza on the first day this fucking subverse was created.

              Maybe this cunt Hoyer was sending a message by buying a pizza lunch for the staff of his Republican opponent.... maybe.

             <p>
              But maybe it was just a gesture of good will.

            "As she cowered in the tent alone, Sojourner began to ponder the situation and later on recalled that her thoughts ran something like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Shall I run away and hide from the Devil? e, a servant of the living God? Have I not faith enough to go out and quell the mob . . . I'll go to the rescue, and the Lord shall go with and protect me."

            Don't be fooled into thinking this is an innocent gesture of compassion buying a pizza lunch for Scalise's office. This is one of the most pathetic gestures of contempt in American History. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer will go down as another Aaron Burr. Steny Hoyer, remember that name. Far more kids 100 years from now will know that name than do today.

            This is pre Civil War DC circa 1855 - 1860. You only get this toxic bile if a country's been around a while and the same cast of characters have been eyeing each other for years and years. DC is drenched in gasoline and gun powder right now. This is only the beginning. It will get much much worse. Mark my words.

             Now that I have thought about the cabal trying to convince us to take to the streets so they have an excuse to impose martial law, and since you are already a suspect charachter here, your post supports the theory I considered. You seem to want to ligitimize this event despite you are always doing damage control for disinfo shills like Jones and Webb, and mock people for connecting dots. But you want to convince us Civil War might be near. Just as I suspected. I need only turn to the shills and see what they are pushing. Indeed, this might be a psyop.

              DM is after justice.  As a student of history, and the French Revolution in particular, anyone can draw the parallels DM is.  He is not asking for violence and has denounced it in the past...he is prognosticating what he believes will happen based on history.  I surely hope no civil war occurs, but I'd prefer it to being ruled by pedosatanists.

              Actually I've been warning about this and doing everything I can to remind people of their Christian roots. Go look at my submissions. Read "If I lead will you follow........"

              But you might be right about it being a hoax. I'd believe anything at this point. Personally I think it's real given Scalise's working fighting human trafficking. His shooting sent a pretty clear message.

             Is this an attempt to get some cred back. Won't work. But you see how to get upvotes now? Stop doing damage control.

              No. That's actually what I feel. DeathTooMasons you're wasting your time trying to prove I'm a shill. I'm not sure what your picking up that makes you think I'm a shill.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think it's because we don't agree on all the issues involved here. But you're conflating natural differences of opinion with outright shillary. I'm telling you I'm not a shill but if you want to continue wasting your time on me then it's no skin off my ass.

             Great post.  You're on to the vibe correctly.  I think Trump's job is actually to ensure that DOESN'T happen.  Some of the power people who support him also can see the writing on the wall and prefer his sledgehammer road to the bloodbath road that is their other option.  When they make their move, it will be big and bold.  They have to hit it out of the park, with the kind of evidence that only the most foolish can disregard.  My feeling is that they're making a play to release NSA surveillance data as some of that proof - we all know it exists, but he's got to pry it out of them.  It will be impossible to deny the veracity of information sourced from within protected, secure government sources.  I think that's also why the Obama daily briefings Nunes seems to be alluding to are important - you can't get much better evidence than that.  Once people accept that their TV heroes are crooks, it will be much easier for them to digest their other crimes.

             shall we collectively recall the first issue of  &lt;i&gt; The Liberator &lt;/i&gt;  which appeared in 1831 which carried this uncompromising declaration:

            <p>
             "Urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present.  I am in earnest - I will not equivocate - I will not be excuse &lt;sic&gt; - I will not retreat a single inch - AND I WILL BE HEARD."

            Pizzagate is an insane conpiracy theory..
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why Hoyer sent a stack of Pizzas to Scalise after he was gunned down when he made statements against child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is about child trafficking.

                Scalise leads the charge against the very same toxic crimes involved in Pizzagate. He's shot with an assault rifle. And his "friend" sends Scalise's staff pizza.

                 Kind of like dead fish wrapped in newspaper on your doorstep or your favorite horse's head in your bed under the covers.  It was a clear message.  Flowers wouldn't have had the same affect.

                  Didn't you get the memo? I'm not answering any of your questions until you answer my question as to why I should believe the NIST report saying there was no molten metal in the basement of the WTC when you yourself acknowledge there WERE rivers of molten metal in the basement of the WTC albeit from "aluminum tire rims" as I recall but whatevs.

                    Oh so when you argue with me you don't necessarily believe there's even evidence of what your arguing for.

                   <p>
                    Yep, that's pretty much what it feels like debating you. When I get you cornered you just start making shit up.

                 You know in the real world, where people have friends and family and loved ones, bringing food over in a time of crisis/sadness happens all the time.  It's a caring gesture.   It's kind of a tradition that when people, folks close to the family would bring food over.  The folks closest to it are too much in grief or too overwhelmed to take care of everyday things.

                 Not everything needs to be view through your political lens.   Take a step outside that from time to time.  It's helpful.

                  Pizza is way innappropriate for the occassion. Even if it's not code. We know you're grieving but here's an anchovie pizza to stink up your office. How about sending a quality spread with salads and sandwiches. Pizza? Pretty trashy.

             Keep in mind that this gesture was reported - why? If it wasn't a message, it wouldn't be particularly newsworthy, even for insular DC.  This got press because it was supposed to get press.

              Why would you give the pizza to him otherwise?  By the time he recovers enough to get back to his office the pizza will be gross, stale and loaded with bacteria.  I highly doubt his office has a refrigerator.  Flowers or better yet a card would function better as a "get well soon" gift.  Clearly this is a political taunt and message.
