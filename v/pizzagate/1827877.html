<p>Here\'s the case of Kevin Clash, one of the voices of Elmo, who had to resign from Sesame Street because of a pedo scandal, which was reported in the MSM: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2012/11/20/kevin-clash-quits-elmo-gig/1716901/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2012/11/20/kevin-clash-quits-elmo-gig/1716901/</a>

<p>Kevin Clash is from Baltimore, according to his Wikipedia page, and, &quot;Clash was married for 17 years, and has a daughter who was born in 1993. In November 2012, Clash came out publicly as gay in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from the Sesame Workshop, stating, &quot;I am a gay man. I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter.&quot;
Clash has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo, African-American adults tend to be surprised when they meet him.&quot;
So he only comes out as gay when the scandal of sex with underage boys comes out.

<p>Apparently he got away with everything. <strong>He never was convicted, even on appeal</strong>.

and 
&quot;In July 2013, the three cases against Clash were dismissed because the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Clash\'s alleged violations during the three years after each turned 21. Clash\'s lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life. Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling, alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse weren\'t fully realized until 2012. In April 2014, the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals.Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations, Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Clash, but it was ultimately dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had ended.&quot;

<p>Several victims came forward: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/elmo-sex-scandal-kevin-clash-third-allegation-underage-sex_n_2197666.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/elmo-sex-scandal-kevin-clash-third-allegation-underage-sex_n_2197666.html</a></p>
<p>His victims, besides a lifetime sentence of memory, have also been attacked. One said that Clash \'plied him with “alcohol and groomed him with attention and affection.” They then “engaged in sexual contact,” \' This particular one was beaten up by three attackers while the case was going on.

Quote from that article: &quot; &quot;The police told me it was out of their hands,” Singleton told The Post of meeting with Special Victims Unit cops this week.“<strong>They said if it were up to them, they would have arrested him already,</strong>” if it weren’t for the statute of limitations, he added. &quot;</p>
<p>Some <strong>damning emails</strong> Clash sent to his  first accuser: &quot;“I’m sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, it’s driving me insane,” reads one. Another: “I want you to know that I love you and I will never hurt you. I’m here to protect you and make sure your dreams come true.”

            i grew up with sesame street and when i had my kids i walked past the tv when it was on and there was this loud aggressive red creature called elmo dominating the set and i thought. what the hell is that...... turns out it was kelvin clash. first i saw a doco on him explaining how he got there and then i found out about his homosexual paedophile tendencies. he will never go to jail. he will never face any consequences. it has been buried like all the other rich and famous pedos who never go to jail for molesting young children. makes tickle me elmo seem sinister though once you know the real kelvin clash's motives doesnt it

             I agree, that's why I made this post. Pedos in the media, especially those who are brainwashing children, are protected.
That plaintiff  was beaten up by paid thugs, IMHO.
