            It looks like Suzanne Adcock is the new director and might have replaced the unnamed supervisor?  There's more info in the May 17 article.  Very interesting, though, because the first link doesn't work for me (did they see us looking in to them?) and she knew to set her Twitter to private.  Hmm . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            Reading through the article again and I think there are a lot more people to be looking at.  There was a meeting with the people who oversee the CPS department and it sounds like they were more defensive than contrite.  They failed miserably and it seems like a normal person would feel horrible about it, especially after an investigation/trial/grand jury thing that went on for almost a year.  Was Adcock doing damage control or is she really interested in reform?

            Margaret Moss Schultze is the commissioner of Virginia Social Services which overseas CPS.   There is very little information about her on the net.
  She was appointed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, best friend of the Clintons.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Margaret Schultze has been appointed by Governor McAuliffe to serve as Commissioner of the Department of Social Services. Margaret’s experience in state government began in 1997, as director of the gubernatorially appointed Family and Children's Trust Fund. In that role she raised resources and awareness for the prevention and treatment of family violence, including child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, sexual assault, and elder abuse. She assumed increasingly responsible roles within the department culminating in her current position as Commissioner. Ms. Schultze oversees both programmatic and administrative functions within the Virginia Department of Social Services. VDSS is one of the largest Commonwealth agencies, partnering with 119 local departments of social services, along with faith-based and non-profit organizations, to support families and improve communities statewide. A native of Roanoke, Virginia, she graduated from Hollins University (formerly Hollins College) with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology and a teacher certification."

            'Susan Reese, head of the regional office, said her staff is still trying to determine how many documents were shredded by the former supervisor. In some cases, staffers who became suspicious of their boss made copies before they were destroyed and later shared them with investigators, according to the internal review.'

             Thank you for sharing this!  I reposted it where I have the other articles and my notes in another comment but gave you credit.  Looks like there is a Facebook group and a petition run by locals trying to get reform, encouraging to find!

            Ya better I would really prefer them to be tortured for a long time instead of dying to fast. I know torturing people is wrong but I would personally rather have it happen that way.

             I know exactly what you mean, Warmoose.  I've got all kinds of specific ideas and feel guilty when I realize what I'm doing.  Not saying this should happen, but I can think of a few ways law enforcement can actually raise money if you know what I mean.

            Scumbags.  The lot of them.  “We don’t do it that way … because that’s the way I want it,” the woman reportedly said when asked to explain her inaction.  I am not a violent person, but I would like to grab her by the hair and smack her until she doesn't know her own name.

             I know!  Why on earth did she have that position to begin with?!  Maybe after a few smacks she will forget what it is like to not be constantly smacked and you are justified to continue???  And you are much more restrained than I would like to be . . .

             It appears the supervisor's name is Brenda Perry!!!  More info under Edit 3
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry if this has already been posted, I couldn't see it and thought it was better to post than not.  Not only is the pedo aspect disturbing, but the way it is being handled is sending off all kind of alarm bells.  CPS was alerted to the situation multiple times and only took action after the sheriff all but forced them to.  Here's what really got me:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Despite what one attorney called “subhuman” conditions in the home, Rockbridge social services workers were slow to respond to complaints from concerned neighbors.
            </p>
            <p>
             A former supervisor at the agency refused to enter the reports into a computer system as required by state policy and told caseworkers not to be bothered with the case, according to the special grand jury’s report. The Roanoke Times is not naming the supervisor because she was not charged with a crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We don’t do it that way … because that’s the way I want it,” the woman reportedly said when asked to explain her inaction.
            </p>
            <p>
             The former supervisor, who was accused of shredding some reports of child abuse that were made to the agency, also expressed little sympathy for the plight of the two young girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             “They’re used to living that way so what’s the big deal?” she was quoted as saying in the grand jury report.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The paper is protecting her and not using her name and that seems like an indication we need to find her.  I wonder what kind of connections we will find?  Actually, I'm kind of hoping she's already on our radar, I don't want there to be so many evil people who enable these monsters :(
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, sorry if this was already posted!  I'm not sure how much time I'll be able to spend on this over the next few days but if this helps someone else I wanted to get it out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             EDIT:
            </strong>
            Sorry, just saw there were related articles and they are actually doing something about CPS and how badly managed it was!  It is past my bedtime and maybe I wasn't as alert as I should have been, but I feel an urgency.  There are more articles from The Roanoke Times and I am planning on looking at other sources.  Again, highly suspicious that they won't name some people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please note: as I was gathering articles, I got a note that I could only read so many before having to buy a subscription.  I'll try to fiddle around with it when I'm more alert but I'll leave it for now.  Tried to get the articles in chronological order, looks like the investigation started before Pizzagate broke, though.  Also wanted to give anyone looking into this a heads up about the limited article reading.

            The more you learn about this, the more insane and upsetting it gets :(  At least in this article there is some hope though.  People were doing stuff behind the unnamed supervisor's back like making copies of reports before shredding them.  Also I took a look at the comments and found there is a

            Ah!  It was right under my nose, the supervisor's name is Brenda Perry!  Here is the full text from the FB page:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Richmond Times Dispatch, People magazine, The Sun, The Daily Mail, The New York Post, local and national Fox News. We are glad this story is getting coverage, realize it is the sensational details, but hope more media coverage helps us shame government officiala on both a state and local level who let Director Meredith Downey, and Supervisor Brenda Perry (who shredded the child abuse reports) keep their jobs (paid $88,000 and $66,000) for years when they were well aware of what was going on, for almost 20 years. Please sign and share our petition demanding that at a minimum, all members of the Rockbridge Area Social Services Board be replaced. There is a new director at RDSS and many great employees who need our help and support and the help and support of an active board to keep families and children in our communities safe.

            Doing some looking around, should I make a separate thread for notes for Brenda Perry specifically?  There's probably going to be a lot, I'm keeping it in a Google doc for now.
