            I think you do us all a dis-service when you state that the entire CIA is involved in this.
There are bad elements in different sectors of government. The best way to think of it is that 'they,' the enemy has their people planted all over. There are good people in the CIA. There are good people in the teaching profession. Saying there are only bad people in the CIA, is pushing the truth past its breaking point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, if we have to discuss how come the CIA hasn't gone after the bad people, I'll have to argue many have been. If the CIA is headed by corrupt leadership, and is not doing its job, then obviously there's another swamp that needs to be drained.

            The CIA is the 'keystone' of the entire cabal.  Its name tells you exactly what it is.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It is the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCEY.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <ul>
              <li>
               <p>
                It is an Agency, not a department.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                It is CENTRAL to the cabal, and named just like all of the Rothschilds banks are  named . . . 'CENTRAL'.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                And it is intelligence or 'information' . . . ..   It knows everything about everybody.  Perfect for blackmail or planting evidence.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                IT controls the 'message' and the 'facts'
               </p>
              </li>
             </ul>
            </blockquote>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            As Thomas Jefferson said:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So it would make sense that the cabal would use the  resources of the most powerful nation in the world, the USA, against itself and the rest of the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are in an information war for sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump was a genius to brand the MSM (CIA) as fake news.   It was an important step for exposing them.

             CIA is a JEW FRONT probably staffed by mostly Jews.  (Congress itself is officially 15% Jewish so STFU.)
            </p>
            <p>
             THATS WHY Mockingbird did what it did (most famously removing Nixon who literally counted the Jews in his admin because like all real American patriots he didn't trust them one fucking bit.  Think about your history class: he should be considered a GOOD or average president for his liberal policies (EPA, affirmative action) so they he to destroy him, now his very name is radioactive.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact HILLARY helped write his impeachment for TALKING ABOUT possibly using the IRS to harass someone, which her husband actually did as president.
 I have way more proof than Mockingbird.  The FBI also runs cover for Jews and executes their false flags.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally on no subject do Jews and thus the media lie more than RACE, so

             Jefferson quote should include the context that NOBODY IN THEIR WILDEST PIPE DREAM thought "the electorate" would include blacks and Indians who obviously will never be on par with whites and vote in their own interests.
