<p>Former senator from Louisiana Mary Landrieu had a particular interest in human trafficking, including the way it affected the ability of Americans to adopt foreign children from Guatemala (because that\'s what we really need to prioritize here, right?) and worked with the Clinton State Department to establish political arrangements to facilitate adoption.</p>
<p>&quot;In August 2011, an email was sent to Clinton about a trip Landrieu was taking to Guatemala about a recent court decision in the Central American nation blocking most international adoptions, leaving parents who had already met with children they were ready to adopt unable to move forward.&quot;

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Right now, Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat from Louisiana and mother to two adopted children, is finishing up her lobbying trip to Guatemala. Nothing on Landrieu’s own website mentions the trip, which began on August 21, either in the press release section, news section, or on the Senator’s blog. Last week, the lobbying group Guatemala900 sent out an email saying:</p>
<p>&quot;The Senator has asked us to please use discretion and <strong>keep this news out of the public eye</strong>, as her and her coalition believe that they will achieve maximum effectiveness in their advocacy by doing so.”&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The delegation will meet with government officials and nongovernmental adoption stakeholders to discuss the progress of pending U.S. citizen adoption cases since their April meetings. Ambassador Jacobs will also discuss Guatemala’s efforts to implement new intercountry adoption safeguards that would provide a path toward future adoption processing.</p>

            <p>
             Susan Jacobs is the Special Advisor for Children’s Issues. She was a Senior Policy Advisor in the Bureau of Consular Affairs and previously served as the Bureau’s liaison to the Department of Homeland Security. From 2000-2003 she was the United States Ambassador to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. From April 1998 to October 2000 she served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Issues in the State Department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ambassador Jacobs joined the Foreign Service in 1974. Her early assignments included tours as vice consul in Caracas, deputy consul general in Tel Aviv, refugee officer in New Delhi, office director in the State Department's Citizens Emergency Center, and special assistant to the Ambassador in San Salvador.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1990 she returned to Washington, DC where she served as an office director in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs and then as a Legislative Management Officer in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. In 1994 she was senior policy advisor to the Commission on Immigration Reform, and from 1995 to 1997 she was the U.S. Consul General in Bucharest. A high point of her Bucharest tour was serving as the coordinator for the July, 1996 visit of First Lady Hillary Clinton. In 1997 she attended the Senior Seminar, a nine-month advanced professional development program designed for senior foreign policy officials in the United States Government.
            </p>
            <p>
