            I totally agree. Pedogate is for trolls. As a matter of fact it I propose that anyone who refers to this as Pedogate from now on is a shill. And should be banned from the sub.

            Work on raising awareness. Research is important, but it's useless without awareness. The more people that see this the more pressure we put on TPTB. Keep working and don't give up. Right now they fear us. We know one of their darkest secrets. They are doing damage control so we need to keep the heat on.

            It is only those who aren't directly involved in research who are here and agreeing and disagreeing.
The actual researchers are busy researching.  Granted things may have slowed down a bit, but imo it's because researchers have to be very careful.  There have been a lot of threats and these are dangerous people.  Just what happened with Alex Jones is still an open question, but that certainly looks like threats.  Even George Webb confirmed that pizzagate is an extremely dangerous investigation.  Plus a lot of the pieces of the puzzle are still hidden which means others can't advance the puzzle without those pieces and confirmation of them fitting in.
           </p>
           <p>
            But also look at how the pedophiles have been forced to pull back.  Their symbols are now well recognized by many.
They can't advertise who they are quite the way the used to be able to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have faith as I think probably more people than any of us know working on this.
            <br/>
            And if it's at all possible these pedophile rings and those protecting them will be brought down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question is ... How high up are the higher up's?
           </p>
           <p>
            And, not sure what Trump is up to, but he certainly also has shut down reporting of list of names of those visiting the White House every day.  Why?  Are we at the point again as we were with LBJ where he is accepting pay-off's as LBJ did in his Executive Offices -- as VP and President?
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's take for granted that Trump is behind a lot of the arrests of pedophile rings -- and will continue pushing them.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I hope those arrests continue on and finally get to those higher up's protecting this trafficking.

            Hillary's campaign is where this all started. Podesta was the target because he wields power from behind the scenes in DC. When Seth Rich got knocked off, PG exploded. Podesta got hacked and the flood gates opened. The investigation into Clinton Foundation got red hot, then Hillary's run fell to shit. But we've not been able to take down Podesta and his DC pedo pals. Weiner's laptop is key. Whatever is on that computer will blowup the pay to play AND human trafficking schemes. That's how we get to Podesta, his brother, Alefantis, Epstein, Bill, Hillary, David Brock, and all the pedos and pedo protectors in law enforcement, child protective services, social services, education, churches, etc. The dominos drop in the US, then UK, then across Europe, Asia, South America, and so on.

            I absolutely agree. It hit me when I heard David Seaman's segment today on Google. He said that "pedogate" began with the Podesta emails. No, it didn't, and this this shows why we shouldn't switch to "pedogate", watering down the whole investigation and leaving the evidence we do have in the dust.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have a separate sub for
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pedogate">
             v/pedogate
            </a>
            . People should use that more often so we can keep things organized.

            Fighting about personalities inside and outside PG is certainly a major problem, but I believe the overall tapering off of good information being presented here is not due to such distractions but rather is a natural consequence of approaching the inherent limitations faced by PG researchers, who are armed with little more than the internet. This does not remotely diminished the significance of what has been accomplished.
           </p>
           <p>
            Law enforcement has the real tools to take the next step, tools of investigation the Voat community does not remotely have. By my reckoning,
            <strong>
             there is a veritable mountain of good circumstantial evidence lingering in old Voat threads
            </strong>
            , which if viewed in proper order would be incredibly compelling to any unbiased observer. If I were directing the operation of effecting arrests, I would now focus on building a dossier of what has already been collected, for formal presentation to law enforcement. This is a task best suited to a criminal lawyer or former prosecutor.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the U.S. can take the nation to war and kill a million Iraqies based on a few pages containing fabricated evidence of weapons of mass destruction, surely a well constructed summation of what has been presented at Voat over the last five months can move some law enforcement agency to begin a formal investigation, or bolster any currently under way.

            The pizza codes is what opened the door to realizing how many people at the top are involved in pedophilia, how they use it for profit and blackmail, how they are involved in other nefarious trades. To focus solely on "pizza codes" and comet would be a huge mistake. The pizza aspect is also what the MSM reports and uses to try to discredit it.

            I have mixed feelings about the nomenclature. The importance lies in the tremendous amount of research that has exposed  these psycho-sociopathic individuals, secret societies and organizations.  Pizzagate opened the door to evil on an international scale that none of us could ever imagine.  Pizzagate was the catalyst.

             Pizzagate and Pedo-gate are working together to not only show the power of the investigation into Alefantis/Comet/Podesta and so much more, but to link it internationally.  Neither term should be disappeared.  Both are valuable.

              Imho Pedogate is the alternative that postdates when they let the cat out of the bag on Pizzagate. Pedogate is take two and they get to craft the narritive. It has nothing to do with Pizzagate it's much more broad.

               I'd say that Pedogate is the historical situation with pedophiles, except the "gate" makes the term too current.
I think of it as Pizzagate being the modernizing of pedophile rings, with Comet PP likely a showroom
to display children currently on hand.
Many Europeans didn't have a problem either with recognizing "Pizzagate" as parallel to what was 
also happening in their countries right now.  It's very right now.
              </p>
              <p>
               If we look at what's still happening in the RCC and connect it to 2000 years of the church's assaults
on children what would we call it?
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, we should remember that all of this trafficking is connected -- whether drugs or organ trafficking -- or human trafficking.

               Originally, weren't pizza joints being used to sell/deliver drugs?

             Pedophilia and child abuse have been around since the beginning of time. There are always sickos roaming this earth, Its  sick but we cant save the world when it comes to this. Pizzgate however goes right to our leaders along with the pizza codes that all these awesome researchers uncovered, This is what needs to be researched over and over and once the BIG ARREST is made then all this crap between the left and right will subside (a lot of it will anyway) and people will finally be awakened that we are ruled by evil (on both sides) . We need to really hone in on this and get dirty, Go find these kids and video tape it, Video is what its going to take. I know this is easier said then done but there are many centipedes and we need to figure this out now so it doesn't  become another passing opportunity to end the evil rulers that are here. I am common sense guy , SPIRIT COOKING? THE ART? INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS? seriously, that's all real stuff and that's were we should continue to focus. All my opinion of course
