            I don't see a direct connection to Getz yet, but here' some research from reddit:

            Add "Golden Cradle Education Group" (Beijing-based Kindergarten, one of 700 schools country-wide) to the list of recent accusations.

            </a>
            Regarding RYB, there's another post that has been discussing this but I will reiterate some points here:
Liang "Leon" Meng, a Director of RYB, has Clinton connections through Yale School of Business, among others, and is also is a member of Ascendent Capital Partners, 5 of 6 members are alumni of Yale school of Management (the other one, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs). Their short portfolio includes Kindergarten care, food and beverage, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, molecular biology work, and train transport (which could infer ratlines), which are things that can come into play, in regard accusations found in OP's article and, in regard to claims that I make in the tl;dr.
            <a href="http://www.ascendentcp.com/en/portfolio/">
             http://www.ascendentcp.com/en/portfolio/
            </a>
            Leon participated in same Yale Beijing conference opening with Eric Braverman of Clinton Foundation/George Webb investigation fame, and they both are part of the same Yale School of Management Alumni year.
            <a href="http://centerbeijing.yale.edu/events/opening-conference-yale-center-beijing">
             http://centerbeijing.yale.edu/events/opening-conference-yale-center-beijing
            </a>
            Donald Gips '89, Retired U.S. Ambassador to South Africa, worked for Clinton White House, was a panelist on Yale Management School Webinar Moderated by Meng.

            </a>
            More specifically, there are many connections to the Yale School of Management that is relevant to current political goings-on in DC. Here's the bio for the Senior Associate Dean for Development and Alumni Relations at that School.
            <a href="http://som.yale.edu/joel-getz">
             http://som.yale.edu/joel-getz
            </a>
            "Mr. Getz came to Yale SOM from the William J. Clinton Foundation in New York, where he served as Director of Development for former President William J. Clintonâ€™s worldwide charitable, educational, and economic development initiatives. Mr. Getz was instrumental in creating a formal development operation for the Clinton Foundation, which raised in excess of $135 million annually."
Add to that this connection: Wibur Ross, on Forbes list of Billionaires, gave $10 million to Joel Getz to help fund Yale's School of Management library.
            <a href="http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/wilbur-ross-million-gift-will-help-fund-yale-school-management-library/RdBxKiTBnWHjiujwuucJRM/">
             http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/wilbur-ross-million-gift-will-help-fund-yale-school-management-library/RdBxKiTBnWHjiujwuucJRM/
            </a>
            Fast forward to earlier this month, it was revealed that Ross, currently current Whitehouse Commerce Secretary, had stake in a Russian gas company tied to Putin's son-in-law, which the special investigation is currently looking into, espcially wrt Obama Whitehouse cabinet conflict of interest on the matter. He had divested his stake before Trump appointed him.
            <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/05/documents-show-wilbur-ross-ties-to-putin-linked-business/">
             https://nypost.com/2017/11/05/documents-show-wilbur-ross-ties-to-putin-linked-business/
            </a>
            In fact, Clinton appointed him the 90's, to the: "...board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund, established by the government to make investments and promote American business interests in Russia."
            <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/">
             https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/
            </a>
            tl;dr: My argument is that this is not a random event, but rather, through Clinton Foundation connections in Yale School of Business, they funded, through an Chinese Alumni investment firm Ascendent Capital Partners, kindergartens in China that have the earmarks of a human trafficking ratline, similar to those uncovered by open source investigation ala George Webb, to have been taking place in Haiti, with ties to the Clinton Foundation. Regarding connections to this Chinese kindergarten incident, this is my claim and you can investigate it for yourself or not. There's no need for me to prove to you that the allegations are out there, regarding the Clinton Foundation and Haiti. You can google it. Here, I'll help.

             http://lmgtfy.com/?q=clinton+foundation+haiti
            </a>
            Before you start a shit show with me, I'm backing my claim that that the allegations are out there, and not just by neck-beards, is all, not that I'm trying to prove any of it to be true or false. You'll need to decide to look into it more than a five-second google search, before accepting anyone's opinion on it.
To be sure, I am not trying to argue this from within a left/right paradigm. I'm just following the information where it leads. If you'd like to connect the OPs article to the current Whitehouse, by all means, feel free to show your work.
