<p>&quot;700-27th Street-Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) served a federal criminal search warrant
Today, August 16, 2017, at approximately 6:30 a.m., Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) served a federal criminal search warrant in connection with human trafficking of juveniles in our city ( 700 block of 27th Street).
HSI is conducting a criminal investigation, not a civil immigration or deportation action. This branch focuses on Transnational Gangs, Human Trafficking, Human Smuggling, Child Exploitation and Narcotic Enforcement.
Yesterday, HSI headquarters in San Francisco contacted Oakland Police Chief Anne E. Kirkpatrick and requested two police officers to assist with traffic control. Chief Kirkpatrick gave strict instructions to the commander and officers that they may not assist HSI with any enforcement efforts. The officers’ only role was that of traffic control and neighborhood safety.
Although the Oakland Police Department no longer has a contract (MOU) to actively participate in investigations with HSI, the Department may assist our local, state, and federal agencies when requested as it pertains to traffic control, community safety and officer safety.
HSI is the primary investigating agency.

            It would appear that HSI doesn't trust the local police. I remember a story a few years back of a young lady who had been a prostitute and said many police were here customers. Does anyone remember that girls name? She accused a large portion of the Oakland pd of paying for sex with a child.

             The police thing is a dispute about immigration.  Oakland PD and Memo of Understanding with ICE to help out on raids that the city council didn't know about.
            </p>
            <p>
             So for this raid, the PD was just used for traffic/crowd control. They couldn't arrest anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the PD was working with HSI previously.   This more about Oakland Politicians than Oakland cops.

              people have been so naive when it comes to the Police and Pizzagate
             </p>
             <p>
              Historically, it's the first group to be corrupted in cities replete with criminal enterprise. I would rather spend the night in an alligator pen than to be locked up by the DC Police.
