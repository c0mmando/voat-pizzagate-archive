<p>2017 Why Ohio is ranked 5 in nation for human trafficking</p>
<p>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) – <strong>Ohio ranks number five in the nation for the most human trafficking cases.</strong></p>
<p>The problem is so big that a Human Trafficking Task Force was formed through the Ohio Attorney General’s Office. The operation utilizes state, local and federal law enforcement resources.</p>
<p>Much of the trafficking can be traced back to online peddling. The recent shuttering of the adult ads on the website Backpage.com is a good first step to help curb the problem, but the reality is Ohio’s vulnerability also comes from its infrastructure.

&quot;Video of Abandoned Strip Club with Evidence of Human Trafficking&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1840918">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1840918</a> (Thanks OP!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside the building are references to pedophilia</p>
<p>&quot;Band poster on the wall of abandoned strip club\'s secret basement is of the same &quot;taste&quot; as heavy breathing and that\'s not where the similarities/coincidences stop...... &quot;
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1842015">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1842015</a></p>
<p>&quot;Update: Band Abiku (Spirit of death children) was (living) inside the Disturbing Abandoned &quot;Stripclub&quot;! (Polaroid pictures of kids in underwear hanging on the wall!)&quot;
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1846963">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1846963</a></p>
<p>&quot;Update: Abiku (spirits of death children) member Jane Vincent is in a new band: Curse, with Logan Terkelsen, he have a movie tip: &quot;Don\'t deliver us from evil&quot; - a banned satan/pedo movie from 1971&quot;
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1848458">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1848458</a></p>

           Much of the trafficking can be traced back to online peddling. The recent shuttering of the adult ads on the website Backpage.com is a good first step to help curb the problem, but the reality is Ohio’s vulnerability also comes from its infrastructure.

            Great Post. Conspiracy guru David Icke wrote extensively on James Traficant's nefarious dealings and his ties to child trafficking. (Unfotunately his Interdimensional lizards cloud his otherwise stellar research) Information coincides to what David has writen about him for years.

            We in Ohio also have had many short, petite young looking adult women disappear..and I'm willing to bet it's tied to that.
On an aside, we also have a serial killer in Columbus killing gay males and dumping bodies in parks but no one seems to care about that, either.

             Horrible.  One note &gt; never assume that numerous similar killings are the work of a single individual.
            </p>
            <p>
             How can anyone, especially Police, assume that only one person is doing the killing?  In fact, the efficiency of 'serial killers' points directly to two or more killers working as a team.

              The men all have the same features and are gay, missing from public places.
Found in bodies of water or buried in parks.
It doesn't take a genius to see the trend or pattern.
There have been media reports on the Ohio missing gals..
It's not make-believe.

               What about what you just typed proves there is ONE person, acting alone?
              </p>
              <p>
               I think you are missing my point.  SERIAL KILLER should NEVER be used by Police until it is positively determined that there is only ONE person involved.
