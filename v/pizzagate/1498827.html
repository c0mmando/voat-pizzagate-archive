            noted. i was aware of it already...i did research on them long ago...i believe at least some of it is true, but iam not sure for some others things too...i tried to find more info on the ITCCS organisation, but it not return so many serious links, so iam still a little in doubt with their information even if i could easily believe them...
           </p>

            When questioned about his role in the child sexual abuse, he claimed diplomatic immunity.  Condoleeza Rice wrote a letter to the AG asking for the dismissal of the proceedings.  Cover up all around.  When he bacame Pope my father cheered for we are German, I told him that he is not exactly how they are painting him.  He remains unconvinced to this day.  At the age of 89 and 90 I feel they will not want to hear the real truth.

            John Baird was a kiddy diddler as well. He was caught in Israel with a Palestinian boy. He lost his phone which had the video and top secret documents on it. Turkey got the phone and blackmailed him. He resigned shortly after.

             I find it interesting that Israel refuses to send Palestinian children's bodies back to their parents after they violate and butcher them. Probably use their bodies in organ trafficking.

              100% agree. It is an apartheid state(Palestine) and they treat them like second class or non human people. It wouldnt surprise me that they do that.
Israelis take advantage of everything. Disgusting thinking about it let alone living under that.

            from g@@gle searches on the 9th circle, an image came up of trump and epstein as both having involvement with pedophilic groups in the past. i didn't follow the link, but it evoked a thought:
           </p>
           <p>
            Sun Tzu - the Art of War suggests sacrificing an apparently important part of your operation with the end goal of giving your enemy the false sense of hope. Sacrificing the Clinton Foundation would not have the effect of crippling this extensive practice of weapons/drugs/people trafficking but it would give us the sense of hope we're gaining ground.
           </p>
           <p>
            the purpose of the false flag is probably manifold. distraction (sleight of hand), drawing us in the direction they desire and further weakening us by expanding our internal divisions, aggravating new fronts of conflict and demoralizing us with new revelations of evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            discover in yourselves the love of the truth and do not fear to seek God. There is no other way through this.

            It's not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It's not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It's no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I'm making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.

            The Finders Cult

           <p>
            Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here's some information I've compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.

            I've identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who's behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the first Satanic band called Coven.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">

           </p>

            They're also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.

            Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.

            Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."

            So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
           </p>
           <p>
            " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."

           </p>
           <p>
            Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.

            Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.

           </p>
           <p>
            She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.

            Let's take a look at their lyrics now. What they're describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don't forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.

             It is a bloodline conflict. Ishamel was ostracized because of Hagar's jealousy of Isaac. He is not the son promised and therefore is 1) Refused the blessing reserved for the Chosen Son (the son of the Spirit) and 2) He is the Archtype of the son of the flesh.

             I will maintain a separation between the Jews of Zion and the descendants of the Hebrew Bloodline. As for the pedophilia, the Hebrew's only book of the Law is the Torah. No where in the writings of Moses is child sacrifice or the rape of children allowed by the God of the Israelites.

The present Pope Francis, Jorge Bergoglio, is in negotiations with Fellay to have his SSPX cult readmitted into the roman catholic church.
“ Big money” includes as well Minister Lebel’s ties to those global resource companies affected by his decisions as federal Transport and Infrastructure minister: companies like Power Corporation, Cargill, Sinclair Oil and others whose officers have been named as participants in child trafficking and Ninth Circle sacrificial rites.

             McGill University in Montreal Canada
            </p>
            <p>
             Yesterday two suspected members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were arrested during their preparations for what appeared to be a child sacrifice. Evidently the child homicide was to take place on a blood-stained altar in the basement of a residence in the upscale neighborhood of Outremont Montreal Quebec Canada. During an older woman’s arrest she admitted that the child sacrifice was scheduled for midnight and involved executives of America’s Sinclair Oil and food giant Cargill Corporation. According to an officer of the Brussels Belgium ICLCJ Court, their team worked in conjunction with Montreal police to perform the citizens arrests.
“This informant claimed that the two children to be used at the Montreal event were held at a separate facility at McGill University,” the ICLCJ Court press release stated, “but she claimed not to know where. She said that the normal procedure was to deliver them in a drugged condition just before the ritual began. The woman said cult members describe themselves as part of the Ninth Circle society and carried tattoos of the Ninth Circle insignia.​”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Cargill Corporation Executive Kerry Brick is among the suspected Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult members,” Kevin Annett of the ITCCS said in today’s interview. “Months ago a survivor testified that as a child they were taken to Cargill Corporate Headquarters in Wayzata Minn where they were forced to observe a child sacrifice. From what other eyewitnesses reported to the ICLCJ Court, Ninth Circle members appear to be very influential and able to get away with doing child sacrifices across the globe.”
A security guard at the Montreal private residence showed arresting officers a small sub-basement sound proof chamber that contained a blood-stained stone altar and two small prison cells with wall shackles. An adjoining room held locked cabinets with child pornographic material and articles of children’s clothing. Evidence such as samples of blood, metallic torture devices, ceremonial swords and sophisticated film equipment was photographed and bagged for analysis.
The suspect identified child sacrifice participants as Cargill Corporation Executive Kerry Brick of Wayzata Minnesota and Sinclair Oil Executive Stephen Holding of Sun Valley Idaho. A prior ICLCJ document claimed other Ninth Circle members included Montreal Catholic Archbishop Christian Lepine and a prominent US billionaire. This same influential American businessman has been identified by eyewitnesses as being at Ninth Circle human hunting parties in the Netherlands. Children were stripped naked, raped, hunted down and killed – as were children in an Australian CIA mind control program

            anyway,    I wonder what connections these names have to Vatican, because it's all part of the 9th circle.
So it is global, because it's also  UK  and Australia,  Germany,   and whatever  the US  political  masonic group does I'm unsure if their 9th circle.

             It may not be as strange as it sounds.  The Allen Memorial Institute there has a history of forced human experimentation and at one point, perhaps still, had a secret laboratory.
            </p>
            <p>
             McGill University began these experiments with the CIA, working on captive human subjects, and exposing them to “electro shock, sleep deprivation, memory implantation, memory erasure, sensory modification, psychoactive drug experiments, and many more cruel practices.”
            </p>
            <p>
             From miscellaneous-pics.blogspot.com/2010/11/wernher-von-braun-and-walt-disney.html
            </p>
            <p>
             “The Nazis became employed CIA agents, engaging in clandestine work with the likes of George Bush, the CIA, Henry Kissinger, and the Masonic P2 lodge. This is but one of the results of Operation Paperclip. Another umbrella project that was spawned from Paperclip was MK-ULTRA. .”A secret laboratory was established and funded by CIA director, Allen Dulles in Montreal, Canada at McGill University in the Allen Memorial Institute headed by psychiatrist Dr. Ewen Cameron. For the next several years Dr. Ewen Cameron waged his private war in Canada. What is ironic about Dr. Cameron is that he served as a member of the Nuremberg tribunal who heard the cases against the Nazi doctors.
            </p>
            <p>
             “When it was at its height in drug experiments, operation MK-ULTRA was formed. This was the brainchild of Richard Helms who later came to be a CIA director. It was designed to defeat the “enemy” in its brain-washing techniques. MK-ULTRA had another arm involved in Chemical and Biological Warfare (CBW) known as MK-DELTA. The “doctors” who participated in these experiments used some of the same techniques as the Nazi “doctors”. Techniques used by Dr. Cameron and previous Nazi scientists include electro shock, sleep deprivation, memory implantation, memory erasure, sensory modification, psychoactive drug experiments, and many more cruel practices.  continued.

             Yes!  Fiona Barnett told her horrible abuse by Kidman and many others.  The hunting and killing of children in the woods. She named others as well and that Kidman tied her to a chair as he abused her in front of his daughter as she stood there with a smirk on her face.  So abusing two children at one time.  He fled Australia to Singapore and had a heart attack there.  He was said to be "an unnatural death".   In the report she also named the former Pope Benedict XVI (Ratzinger).  You cannot make this stuff up.
