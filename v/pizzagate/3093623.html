<p>October 8, 2012, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/255294883680632833">tweeted</a> &quot;Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sandusky\'s criminal trial began on June 11, 2012, at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.[3][4] He maintained his innocence.[5] Of the 52 charges, 4 charges were initially dropped, leaving 48. On June 22, 2012, Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse.[6] Sandusky was sentenced on October 9, 2012, to a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 60 years in prison.[7]</p>

<p>Although those kids weren\'t &quot;missing&quot;</p>
<p>Possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Etan_Patz">this</a>, but the timing doesn\'t exactly match up. It\'s hard to say what Trump might have seen about this in the local New York papers and news shows after the investigation reopened in May 2012.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On May 24, 2012, New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced that a man was in custody who had implicated himself in Etan\'s disappearance.[20] According to The New York Times, a law enforcement official identified the man as 51-year-old Pedro Hernandez of Maple Shade, New Jersey, and said that he had confessed to strangling the child.[21] He stated in his written confession to police, &quot;I’m sorry, I shoke [sic] him.&quot;[22] According to a 2009 book about the case, After Etan, Etan had a dollar and had told his parents he planned to buy a soda to drink with his lunch.[20] At the time of Etan\'s disappearance, Hernandez was an 18-year-old convenience store worker in a neighborhood bodega.[23] Hernandez said that he later threw Etan\'s remains into the garbage.[24] Hernandez was charged with second-degree murder.[22] According to a New York Times report from May 25, 2012, the police at that time had no physical evidence to corroborate his confession.[25] </p>

            I have a different take on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            QAnon says: "
            <em>

            </em>
            ". We should look out for coincidences with time, phrasing and spelling errors.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Children: spelling error. This may well be a flag.
            </li>
            <li>
             Notice the word "grabbed". The verb "to grab" is quite seldomly used. The most famous phrase with this verb is "grab them by the pussy", also by Donald Trump. Would that be just a coincidence?
            </li>
            <li>
             Another coincidence: 4 years minus one day after the tweet, the Hollywood Access Tape was leaked, with the infamous phrase by DJT. And one day later, so exactly 4 years after the tweet:
            </li>
           </ol>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Early on Saturday morning, October 8, Donald Trump issued a lengthier statement, released by video. In it, Trump said of the video's contents, "I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize." He went on to "pledge to be a better man" and ended the video with the allegation that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had "abused women", and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims. Trump's video ended with assurances that the Clinton allegations would be discussed in coming days.
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The context of the phrase suggests that Trumps brags about abusing women. But the real context may be these sentences that hold for all celebrities, not just DJT:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             And when you're a star, they let you do it. 
You can do anything. 
Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I suspect that DJT planned already in 2005 to broadcast this message with persuasive power at a later stage. For that purpose he packaged it as if it was about his own behaviour, but the strong subliminal message is about the establisment, with the Clintons and Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2016 he had the tape "leaked", knowing from voting research that this would not endanger his election victory prospect. It The leaking upset and mobilised many people; some turned against DJT, but in spite of many allegations nobody had real dirt on him. So the public outrage naturally flowed down to the Hollywood swamp.
           </p>
           <p>
            So according to my theory DJT had applied an indirect persuasion technique which is much stronger than any direct verbal attack could have been. The main function of the 2012 tweet was to help this become public at some point.

             Interesting thoughts, andrevandelft. If I recall correctly,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1430237">
              FBIAnon
             </a>
             repeatedly mentioned Trump's masterful use of Confirmation Bias...Yep: AMA 1 Question 21. Here it is, in context:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              FBIAnon: If we recommend, we literally hand over documentation implying the entire government is involved in treason at the highest levels and everyone is about to duck and cover, as well as some sensitive details of SAPs which would obliterate national security.
             </p>
             <p>
              Question 18: Will we really see mass resignations and leaks if nothing happens? Or is that all just bluster and hearsay?
             </p>
             <p>
              FBIAnon: Foreign powers are in possession of some of the documents we have analyzed, because they were hacked from the Clinton server. Trump has some files as well, and likely plans to leak them and use them to his advantage soon. The leaks will have to be made in a non-transparent fashion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Question 19: "Making a recommendation is not the same as actually prosecuting. We only say “here is the data, you need to get XYZ” and then the DOJ acts.” I’m aware, but if you recommend to prosecute, she said she would. If you don’t public trust will be eroded at this point. Too much is out in the open.
             </p>
             <p>
              FBIAnon: If we recommend, we literally hand over documentation implying the entire government is involved in treason at the highest levels and everyone is about to duck and cover, as well as some sensitive details of SAPs which would obliterate national security.
             </p>
             <p>
              Question 21: Most people have suspected this for a while. What do you think will happen if you don’t recommend? Not just at home, but what will other nations do with the information that is already out there?
             </p>
             <p>
              FBIAnon: If we do not recommend, it will look like a cover-up and Trump will use the perception to bolster his message.
              <strong>
               I did work in PsyOps once, and Trump’s use of confirmation bias is legendary.
              </strong>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             He also mentions it in AMA 1 Question 81:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Question 81: What’s your guys’ opinion on meme magic? Kekkism? How does Obama feel about the recent Chicago Scanner threads (thanks for ruining that btw, fun-haters) and the light they shine on his ‘fair city’?
             </p>
             <p>
              FBIAnon: I am not religious, so I have no opinion on Kek. But meme magic is very real, in the sense that a thought large enough to gain traction with enough minds will manifest in external reality. That’s why confirmation bias works, and why Trump has used it to his advantage.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And AMA 4 Question 10:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Question 10: ...Where should we press harder, and where should we apply less pressure?
             </p>
             <p>
              FBIAnon: ...In my opinion, continue pushing the narrative that Clinton is corrupt and the Foundation is being hidden. Your work should complement Trump’s confirmation bias of “Crooked Hillary.”
             </p>

              Well, Trump called her 'crooked Hillary' before the election (and rightly so), and after the election said he wouldn't hurt her and her family.

                 Trump likes to toy with his adversaries like a cat with a mouse. Locking up Hillary is one of his biggest campaign promises, and so far, he has an outstanding record of keeping his campaign promises. So much so, even the press who hates him

                 </a>
                 :
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Donald Trump may be remembered as the most honest president in modern American history. Don’t get me wrong, Trump lies all the time. He said that he “enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history” (actually they are the eighth-largest) and that “our economy is the strongest it’s ever been in the history of our country” (which may one day be true, but not yet). In part, it’s a New York thing — everything is the biggest and the best.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But when it comes to the real barometer of presidential truthfulness — keeping his promises — Trump is a paragon of honesty. For better or worse, since taking office, Trump has done exactly what he promised he would do.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Trump kept his promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, something his three immediate predecessors also promised yet failed to do. He promised to “crush and destroy ISIS,” and two years later he is on the verge of eliminating Islamic State’s physical caliphate. He promised to impose a travel ban on countries that he saw as posing a terrorist threat, and after several false starts the final version of his ban was upheld by the Supreme Court.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Trump pledged to nominate Supreme Court justices “in the mold of Justice (Antonin) Scalia,” and now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh sit on the high court. Trump also pledged to fill the federal appellate courts with young, conservative judges, and so far the Senate has confirmed 29 — more than any recent president at this point in his administration.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Trump promised to cancel President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, withdraw from the Paris climate accord, approve the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploration. He fulfilled all of those pledges.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On trade, he kept his promise to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. He also committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement — and recently signed new deals with Mexico, Canada and South Korea. He committed to imposing tariffs on China to force it to open its markets and stop its theft of intellectual property — and is following through on that pledge. Whatever one thinks of Trump’s trade policies, he is doing exactly what he said.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Where Trump has failed to keep promises, such as building the wall or repealing Obamacare, it has not been for a lack of trying. Only in a few rare instances has he backtracked on a campaign pledge — such as when he admitted that he was wrong to promise a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and reversed course. I’m glad he did.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But whether one agrees or disagrees is not the point. When Trump says he will do something, you can take it to the bank. Yes, he takes liberties with the truth. But unlike his predecessor, he did not pass his signature legislative achievement on the basis of a lie (“If you like your health care plan, you can keep it”) — which is clearly worse than falsely bragging that your tax cut is the biggest ever.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The fact is, in his first two years, Trump has compiled a remarkable record of presidential promise-keeping. He’d probably say it’s the best in history — which may or may not end up being true. It’s too soon to tell.

                  Wow. Interesting how you are twisting this. I pointed out that Trump said he wouldn't hurt Clinton and her family - and guess what? They haven't been hurt indeed.

                  I'm getting tired of pointing out that I prefer Trump as POTUS, and like some of his policies etc. It seems you simply don't want to understand that one can like some things Trump does, and dislike other stuff. In other words: have a nuanced

                  I think Trump is a narcissist, and opportunist. But I also think he's entertaining. Something that Pence and other conservatives totally lack.

                    Funny how you avoid looking into him. Or not. If you did, you might find out that Trump obviously paid the Gambino crime family, so that they would leave his building projects alone. Yes, that's the same Gambino crime family that forced children into prostitution and produced child porn at the time.

                       Which part are they laughing at, the part where Trump is trying to cut off their supply of immigrant kids by closing the border? The part where 79 appellate judges and two SC justices have been replaced with conservatives? Or the changes to the Manual of Courts-Marshall that make it easier to bust pedos and allow military courts to try civilians? Or maybe they're laughing at the 20 million people worldwide that Q has tuned in to the child-abuse of the elite who now want them to hang by the neck until dead?

            found this....
           </p>
           <p>
            The mainstream media (MSM) has kept silent as President Donald Trump in his first two months of office has overseen the arrests of more than 1,500 pedophiles, almost four times more than the 400 pedophiles arrested under President Obama in all of 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recent arrest reports show that more than 1,500 sexual predators were busted for their involvement in child sex-trafficking rings in the United States since January 20, the day Donald Trump was inaugurated. A joint report by the Department of Justice and FBI reveals that for the entire year 2014, President Obama oversaw only 400 similar arrests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people are taking note of these facts and asking why a so-called "objective" MSM is so selective in its reporting policies.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's no coincidence that child sex-trafficking rings are under such attack by the Trump administration. On October 8, 2012, Trump tweeted, "Got to do something about these missing children grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents — fast trial, death penalty."
           </p>
           <p>
            At a press conference on human trafficking in the White House on February 23, Trump laid down the law: "I want to make it clear today that my administration will focus on ending the absolutely horrific practice of human trafficking. ... A lot of you have been dealing with the federal government and it's been much more focused over the last four weeks — I can tell you that."
           </p>
           <p>
            "It's not talked about enough," he continued. "And we're going to talk about it, and we're going to bring it out into the open and hopefully we're going to do a great deal to help prevent some of the horrific — really horrific — crimes that are taking place."

             Were these pedophiles, or do the numbers include johns of adult prostitutes, and prostitutes too? Because usually, Trump supporters only talk about 'arrests'. It seems that some numbers are not only referring to traffickers, but include prostitutes too = victims of forced prostitution.

             Just realized Trump said "death penalty" for pedos. This probably isn't coincidental, then:

Gallup found that have fewer than half of Americans (49%) now believe the death penalty is “applied fairly.” This is the lowest level of support since Gallup began asking this question in 2000. The Gallup Poll also revealed that overall support for the death penalty was essentially unchanged from 2017’s 45-year low, and that 41% of Americans said they oppose the death penalty.
             </p>
             <p>
              The midterm elections also bought encouraging news for the death penalty repeal movement.  The November results saw two prosecutorial candidates running on reform platforms win in Missouri, Alabama, and Texas. In addition, two of the nation’s most pro-death penalty prosecutors lost their re-election bids in California’s Orange and San Bernardino counties. Lastly, Governors in Oregon and Pennsylvania who had imposed or extended moratoria on executions were re-elected, and Colorado elected a new Governor who has openly opposed the death penalty. As these new elective administration take shape in early 2019, we remain optimistic that death penalty support will remain on its downward spiral.
             </p>
             <p>
              This new reality of declining support is the result of the hard work performed by anti-death penalty organizations and activists nationwide. Our dedication to educating all Americans on the systemic flaws within our death penalty system and fostering a culture of mobilization through time-tested and innovative ways is the beating heart of our movement. We look forward to continuing this dialogue and picking up the fight in 2019.

                The US federal government lists 41 capital offenses that are punishable by death. See the full list at the link.
               </p>
               <p>
                The capital offenses include espionage, treason, and death resulting from aircraft hijacking. However, they mostly consist of various forms of murder such as murder committed during a drug-related drive-by shooting, murder during a kidnapping, murder for hire, and genocide.
