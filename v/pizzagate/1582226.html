<p>Ok, so I decided to investigate who/what resided at 1644 North Capital after the Borf Building.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> THIS IS IN NO WAY MEANT TO BE AN INDICTMENT OF THE CURRENT OWNER OF 1644 NORTH CAPITAL NW! I\'M JUST FOLLOWING A NATURAL INVESTIGATIVE TRAIL LOOKING FOR POTENTIAL CONNECTIONS TO JAMES ALEFANTIS AND HIS ASSOCIATES.</p>
<p>Here is what I came up with as a result of my investigation: <a href="http://www.maedwell.com/">http://www.maedwell.com/</a> <a href="http://www.maedwell.com/development/contact/http://www.maedwell.com/property/1644-north-capitol-street/">http://www.maedwell.com/development/contact/http://www.maedwell.com/property/1644-north-capitol-street/</a></p>
<p>1644 North Capital NW is now the headquarters of the Maedwell Companies: <a href="http://www.maedwell.com/development/profile/firm/">http://www.maedwell.com/development/profile/firm/</a></p>
<p>Here is a quote from that link:</p>
<p>“Maedwell is a boutique, value-oriented investment company focused on the acquisition, development, revitalization, and management of real estate properties principally in the Washington Metropolitan Area. We are in the business of creating extraordinary value for our investors, and recognize that our company’s success is rooted in this pursuit.</p>
<p>At Maedwell, we also pursue a range of Joint Venture opportunities with local development firms and owners to develop a diverse range of high-potential, value-oriented mixed-use real estate projects in the Washington area. We make investments and partner with companies that touch upon our central mission of pioneering new investment concepts.</p>
<p>Maedwell strives for long-term growth by investing in high-quality assets and concepts that enhance communities, meet tenant needs and create value for investors.”</p>
<p><strong>WHO OWNS MAEDWELL?</strong></p>
<p>The owner\'s name is Syga Thomas.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting facts about Syga Thomas straight from his LinkedIn profile (THAT I THINK COULD POSSIBLY FIT THE OVERALL CONTEXT OF THE PIZZAGATE INVESTIGATION):</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: <a href="https://voat.co/user/yuke">@yuke</a> provided additional information in a comment in my previous post (as well as another poster providing the name of the LLC that owns 1644 North Capital...THANK YOU!...YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE :)):</p>
<p>The commenter (yuke) noted above supplied the following link: </p>
<p><a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_dc/EXTUID_4109530">https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_dc/EXTUID_4109530</a></p>
<p>HERE IS MY DEDUCTIVE REASONING KICKING IN: The combination of the name of the LLC (1644 North Capitol LLC) and the time it was formed (September, 2011) jumped out at me. An LLC with its name as the address of the property was formed ONE FULL YEAR before it was purchased. According to the JUNE, 2012 document showing the property (still owned by Scheve...whom Alefantis is an agent of his estate) is up for public auction due to unpaid taxes. This is very curious to me. One can (perhaps) logically deduce that the is some connection between Thomas and Alefantis/Scheve. Also, a picture from 2011 (from a link in previous post: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1580870">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1580870)</a>) shows the renovation of the property in its beginning stages.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES 1644 NORTH CAPITAL, NW LOOK LIKE TODAY?</strong></p>
<p>Here is a link to what it looks like today (as headquarters for Maedwell):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.maedwell.com/property/1644-north-capitol-street/">http://www.maedwell.com/property/1644-north-capitol-street/</a></p>
<p><strong>1644 NORTH CAPITAL, NW: THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY</strong></p>
<p>Here is the General Contractor for the 1644 project: AG Contracting Services. A little about them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ag-contracting-services">https://www.linkedin.com/company/ag-contracting-services</a>
<a href="http://www.manta.com/c/mm48dbz/ag-contracting-services-llc">http://www.manta.com/c/mm48dbz/ag-contracting-services-llc</a> a. Whitney Tull, principal
<a href="http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/19223289/AG-Contracting-Services-LLC-in-Washington-DC">http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/19223289/AG-Contracting-Services-LLC-in-Washington-DC</a> a. Notice: a construction and MINING MACHINERY company b. Mining machinery (to me) = TUNNELS
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CONNECTION NEEDS MORE VETTING; HOWEVER...a construction company that is also a MINING MACHINERY company is VERY curious to me in the overall context of Pizzagate.</p>
<p><strong>1644 NORTH CAPITAL, NW: THE WINE BAR (or lack of one)</strong></p>
<p>According to the Maedwell website, there is supposed to be a wine bar on bottom floor of 1644 North Capital:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lot1644/">https://www.facebook.com/lot1644/</a></p>
<p>As of 2015, this wine bar is yet to open (see pictures/comments in the post below)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.popville.com/2015/04/lot-1644-wine-bar/">http://www.popville.com/2015/04/lot-1644-wine-bar/</a></p>
<p>My mind is now starting to think crazy thoughts (based on what I currently know about context of Pizzagate)! What is going on in the ground floor of 1644 North Capital currently?!?! Remember, there was the General Contractor (AG Consulting Services) who ALSO is a MINING EQUIPMENT wholesaler. It again makes me think about the possibility of tunnels! (AGAIN, THIS NEEDS TO BE VETTED FURTHER)</p>
<p>Further investigation of 1644 North Capital yielded the following link:</p>

           HERE IS MY DEDUCTIVE REASONING KICKING IN: The combination of the name of the LLC (1644 North Capitol LLC) and the time it was formed (September, 2011) jumped out at me. An LLC with its name as the address of the property was formed ONE FULL YEAR before it was purchased. According to the JUNE, 2012 document showing the property (still owned by Scheve...whom Alefantis is an agent of his estate) is up for public auction due to unpaid taxes. This is very curious to me. One can (perhaps) logically deduce that the is some connection between Thomas and Alefantis/Scheve. Also, a picture from 2011 (from a link in previous post:
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1580870">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1580870)
           </a>
           ) shows the renovation of the property in its beginning stages.

           a. Notice: a construction and MINING MACHINERY company b. Mining machinery (to me) = TUNNELS
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CONNECTION NEEDS MORE VETTING; HOWEVER...a construction company that is also a MINING MACHINERY company is VERY curious to me in the overall context of Pizzagate.

            1644 NORTH CAPITAL, NW: THE WINE BAR (or lack of one)
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           According to the Maedwell website, there is supposed to be a wine bar on bottom floor of 1644 North Capital:

          </p>
          <p>
           As of 2015, this wine bar is yet to open (see pictures/comments in the post below)

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           My mind is now starting to think crazy thoughts (based on what I currently know about context of Pizzagate)! What is going on in the ground floor of 1644 North Capital currently?!?! Remember, there was the General Contractor (AG Consulting Services) who ALSO is a MINING EQUIPMENT wholesaler. It again makes me think about the possibility of tunnels! (AGAIN, THIS NEEDS TO BE VETTED FURTHER)

            Do we therefore have two units on the one lot of land? It looks that way. I'm looking for more on this.

            Good stuff zen. I'm highly suspicious of this property, it seems to have a lot of shadiness attached to it. Good spot on the LLC registration date.

            I like this dig and angle but the only link between Hubbard/Moonies and Alefantis so far is the fact that the latter bought the Pegasus property from the former - am I correct?

             Yes, but with Alefantis being an agent of the Scheve estate (Scheve died in 2008), I think he was involved in estate matters quite a bit. 1644 didn't sell unfil 2012...Alefantis actually bought Pegasus in 2014. With the close connection to the estate, I have a hunch that he may have been controlling property matters...just a hunch
            </p>
            <p>
             EDIT: a couple additional notes driving this HUNCH/THEORY of the Thomas connection to Alefantis/Hubbard. The combination of 1) The fact Thomas is on the board of DuPont Underground. Alefantis/Oliver Miller (AKA "Dr Pong") are connected to this; AND 2) the property renovation was in the works in 2011 ONE FULL YEAR prior to Thomas actually buying the property (like there was a "pre-sale" prep or something). Remember, the name of Thomas' LLC is called 1644 North Capital LLC which was formed in September, 2011 ONE YEAR PRIOR to the Thomas purchase of the property.

             It all comes down to who was controlling the Estate of Joseph T Scheve. The fact that Alefantis was involved with the estate helps drive the theory of a connection. Again, this is only a HUNCH. Needs to be vetted much more.

              Wasnt it the case the prior tenant business had a deal with owner to renovate in lieu of rent payments at that time, explaining the forming of a business to do so, before property sold? Or was that about a different property than 1644?

            i am also looking intoo Bhemian Grove which is based on Satanic ritual and the occult.  Maybe I can find some correlation with the Pentagram also.  If you look up the Valknut symbol it is comprised of 3 triangles.  It so reminds me of the boy love symbol and it goes back to the Norse Warriors which originated in Norway.  Norway large pedo rings as of late.

            The last link, the one how it looks as of Nov. 2016  it shows the building with boards &amp; door.  On the board their is a design that kind of looks like the shape of a tree?  You will also notice in the top of the tree design their is another circular design with 5 straight lines within.  This reminds me of the occult symbol with the Pentagram and it has a Circle around it.  PLEASE look into this I really think it might point to something that is going on in there.  Also look up Pentagram wikipedia you will see the signs.  Thanks.

              Yeah, I am not too quick at getting all of the drawings and investment stuff, but I have a good memory so I opened all the links anyway thinking hey, something might click.  Bingo.  It did.  I just think the form of that design looks like a tree.  I am going to look at the Pentagram info again.

            Bummer! Transformer’s DIY site specific exhibition, Here and Now, at the 1840 14th St. location has been shut down by the city. You can still support the efforts of
            <strong>
             Transformer
            </strong>
            and the Here and Now artists
            <strong>
             by going to Comet Ping Pong next Saturday night
            </strong>
            (May 31st) at 9:30 for a party that will include projected photos of the art and programming that took place at 1840 14th St.

             Glad you pointed out the Transformer link to Alefantis. This plays into the connection to the art activities that happened at 1644. Also, this address of Transformer may tie into a Moonie connection I've been working on. More to follow on that
