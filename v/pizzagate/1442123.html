            Source on the Islamic slaughter thing? I always thought for an animal to be Halal, you have to slit its throat and it can't know you're about to do it. Doesn't sound so bad to me.

            Killing the animals is part of a Satanic ritual.  Note the photo of the band lead singer writhing on the floor, face covered in blood (?) and there's an animal cage on the ping pong table in the background.
