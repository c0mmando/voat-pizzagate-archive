              You are welcome. My apologies for the delay.  I'm new here and just discovering how this works, but I've been reading (and selecting out) certain elements of this discussion into my blogs (now closed and sent to the ether). [I and others did keep copies.]
             </p>
             <p>
              I've just commented again and added two new links. The full text is online and so you can answer your own question about the occult.  I said that not to be snide or avoid you or the question but in recognition of the fact that one's mind is under one's own control when it comes to judgments of this sort. I say Hagopian does answer it but I stopped reading him and this particular book because I did not want his work to interfere with my own research and writing on a related book.  Hagopian is totally focused on the pedophilia. I am focused on a broader question of evil and how in the hell did these people gain their control and dominance?  And yes there is a lot of occult in that.  Now you can define occult... in some cases, it means simply hidden, in other cases it goes to some kind of wooly belief system in which a few people get together and put on robes and _____.  The history (which is what my book will be about, as well as its antidote) is being written for future generations. I have annotated over 80 books and collected vast amounts of stuff from off the 'net.

                It is my belief that that is one of many reasons they justify the abuse of such young children, repeated stress causes the endocrine system to flair up, many different complex proteins and peptides (many of which are not satisfactorily characterized or named) are produced by people with different genetics, and express different gene expressions during different stages of development.   The extracts from these systems could be used for treating a hereditary conditions, many posts on

                are associated to medical uses for various peptides.  I believe that this is how the get otherwise appealingly great people to disregard, participate in, or cover up pedophilia.  It is also further a belief of mine that they have some morals and values and have identified other avenues for the production of these complex peptides, one of such theories of mine is that they are harvesting endocrine systems from penguins for the production of pharmaceuticals (the reason for the Antarctica talk).  Hereditary conditions are not the only medical use for said products other uses may include, growth hormones for sex changes, platelet rich plasma for athletes, melatonin ii for skin 'enhancement', MS treatment, Aids treatment, melanin derived DMT for hallucinating, etc...

                 Fascinating answer to my question. Thanx so much for the effort. Some of this I had mulled around in my own mind and some not. I saw the shipment of penguin pineal glands in the Wikeleaks emails but it never struck me that this could be related to their fascination with Antarctica for some reason.

                 According to my research Hemophilia B is said to have been passed down in the Royal Bloodline. Due to the history of blood drinking among this group, which is documented as far back as centuries ago, do you think that drinking blood helped alleviate or temporarily treat this condition? I suppose if bleeding through the joints and passing blood components through the urine was depleting the body of needed components they could be replaced by drinking blood? There has to be a reason for powdering blood, saving it, and passing it to other people that want it, and being willing to risk kidnapping a neighbor child in the process.

                  With regards to illumination:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Illumination in a much more literal sense. both before they harvest and after.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Before harvesting they treat the subject with circadian type modulation of light.  Broadband.  Bright rooms, maybe white tiles, or other type of EM modulations, eg shock therapy.   Very regimented amount of time in light and dark.

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  After harvest I speculate they use light to treat the extracts.  AS TOLD BY EDWIN SMITH (specifically the last 5 spells, and they may have been written on them at a later date) papyrus and modern science.

                   Its historical and the documentation goes back many centuries in many things you read connected to "blood libel." It is also connected to the "Passover Bread." They put blood in Matzoh Balls. Blood was routinely dried and powdered so that it could be kept for later consumption. I was always of the mind that it has some sort of medicinal properties to the consumer and not only a ritual protocol. When child murderers were questioned they had a pattern of giving the blood to others and this was a routine custom. I'm pretty sure Toaff covers it here.

                    They believed that by drinking the blood of a Christian 
victim who was perfect in every way, they could overcome their physical short eomincfs 
and become as powerful as the intelligent civilized beings among whom they had formed 
their parasitic communities. Because of this belief, the Jews are known to have 
practiced drinking blood since they made their first appearance in history.

                    At its worst, CEP causes appalling photomutilations from the light-activated porphyrins, including loss of facial features and fingers, scarring of the cornea and blindness. The condition may have been less rare in the past, especially in isolated pockets where inbreeding could occur such as the valleys of Transylvania--perhaps giving rise to tales of vampires.

                   I also had a book that had been partially translated, found at archive.org that detailed the different uses for human blood and body parts and it was astounding how many uses there was for different things. Let that slip through my hands somehow but maybe I still have it under a name I don't recognize. My book collection is bulging and I have a hard time remembering where I read certain things.

                   Here is another one you would like. It was written by a woman who grew up in a highbrow occult family. She describes a lot of the initiation rituals and what their purpose is. Pretty detailed.
