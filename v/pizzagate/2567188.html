            I'm no friend of Jews, but I recognize that this is part of their religious practices and there is nothing sexual about it. It's very regrettable and disgusting that the child actually got a sexual disease from it but that is their religion. Are you going to condemn them for their religion as long as they are not committing outright crimes. I think we can find other things to attack and solve before we swing around to tackle this.

            is for research you demonstrate is directly related to the sexual abuse/trafficking of kids by the global elite. You have not made a case that this thread is about that (see Rule 1). You've got 10 hours remaining on your edit flair.

            "Since 2000, 24 babies have contracted neonatal herpes following MBP. Two died and two were brain damaged, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Some 5,200 babies — 48 percent of all Jewish baby boys in New York City — had a bris with metzitzah b’peh in 2006, according to a study by Awi Federgruen, a professor of quantitative methodology at Columbia Business School."

            This practice is beyond disgusting.  I have been to Christian Baptisms and a baby usually cries because water gets in their eyes.  That's about all the pain they feel.  I can't even imagine the pain that little baby must feel.  I agree that this must stop and must be spread so that others know.  I am sure most people don't even realize what goes on.  These are sick individuals that participated in this abuse.  Yes it is abuse.  These rituals are usually practiced by and in Hasidic communities.

             In reality I've seen just sprinkling of water, the jews well they added this talmudic thing to the circumcision practice which was demark them from the nations after Christ, and its not just a snip ohhh no its a blood ducking affair totally sick. Talmud-Kabbalah needs to go.

              Really someone ought to undertake this.  A get on the Bandwagon kind of push to stop the pain.  These poor little babies.  I believe it has an effect on them. The purpose behind it may be two fold.  I can't believe those little boys are not unchanged.

             What you describe is clearly child abuse, and I am completely opposed to it. If what you're doing makes a child feel pain, and you're doing it for your religious beliefs, then you're abusing your child--not bestowing upon them some kind of magical religious benefit. Water getting into the child's eyes is traumatic for them and a betrayal of their trust in their parents to keep them safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, sometimes baptism is done in an even more abusive way, which is nothing short of torture. Here is a video of such baptism in Tbilisi, Georgia, in which the Christian Orthodox priest submerges the child's head in water (warning:
             <a href="https://www.hooktube.com/watch?v=aFGHerqhSC8">
              child abuse
             </a>
             ). You can clearly see the panic on the victims' faces. Notice the adults standing around snickering uncomfortably, too afraid to stop the "holy ritual". I have no doubt that these children will suffer long-term psychological harm as a result of this abuse.

              It's not pain to get a little water in the face.  It is a minimal sprinkling not a gush of drowning water.   If there is any torture involved I have never seen it.  The last one I went to the priest wet his thumb with Holy Water and made the sign of the cross on the baby's forehead.

               To hack away any part of a human being that serves no medical benefit is cultist behavior. Just cause they did it to daddy means they can do it to you. Sheeple logic at it's finest. They even fuck it up from time to time. Look up David Reimer some time. Accidentally cut his off and tried to make him think he was female, you can guess it ended well.

            , I think you may have linked to the wrong video because that one is just music.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, would you mind deleting this post and and re-submitting with a different title (one that better explains what the post is about?)  I guess I understand that lady's rationale for using it, but I don't think it is appropriate for this sub.
           </p>

            I appreciate your understanding, thanks.

             Yes, I would mind re-titling the post. The title of the video is the taboo question which the child rapists do not wish to utter. By silencing this question, aren't wouldn't we be doing what the offenders desire? There was a proposed reform in NYC to require that parents be informed that this procedure would be done to their children before taking place. So that parents would have the opportunity to say "No! You may not suck my son's penis." But, sadly, even this minor reform was defeated.

              Thousands of children are subjected to oral rape during their "bris", each year. If only a single person were subjected to this sexual abuse, it would be worthwhile to give voice to the victim. Is it fair to dehumanize these human beings into a mere statistic?

              You find nothing remotely creepy about stripping a baby naked, ripping apart this skin from his penis, and penetrating his genitals with a knife? You find nothing creepy about a room of adults celebrating while a baby is screaming in pain from having his sexual boundaries violated?

              There would be bloodshed if I went to a "bris", but not the blood of a sexually abused child. Attending a party to celebrate the gang blade rape of a baby isn't something that I would brag about if I were you.

               I had to do a little research to formulate an informed response.  The practice is observed by a very small sect of Lithuanian Hasidic Jews.  As best as I can tell, the practice is virtually extinct at this point, and all but a very small sect still practice this ritual going back to 200CE and is attributed to the Greeks in it's origination.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not providing ANY excuse for it.  Use of the mouth as a method of staunching blood is gross beyond gross.  And a health risk.  It has almost been banned at this point.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I have to assume that you are part of the non-circumcised crowd.  That was your parents choice.  It isn't our problem if you got laughed at in the locker room for having an anteater.  I'll make the assumption you're American.  In which case 70-90% of males in America are circumcised.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let me ask you this - remove the oral component as that is RARE upon RARE - how do you think circumcision is done in the hospital?  Same exact way a mohel does it.  No difference.  Except a mohel may perform 30 per week.  A pediatrician maybe 1 or 2.  I actually called a Jewish friend on this and found out - wait for it - even non-Jewish doctors call on the local mohel's to perform a non-ritual circumcision at the parents house because they are far more experienced than the doctors are.
              </p>
              <p>
               Personally, I find all religious ceremonies creepy.  It doesn't matter what the celebration or ceremony is.  But that is just me.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I can get how some arcane practice might get your dander up, each to his own (less dick sucking).
              </p>
              <p>
               I am curious - what are your thoughts on bacha bazi?  Is that OK in your book?  I've actually seen that in Afghanistan.  Very widespread.

                There is no moment in time when a parent chooses to put foreskin on their son. The child grows his entire penis in the womb, for himself, using his own DNA. It is true that a parent has the
                <em>
                 power
                </em>
                to remove the genitals of a child in whole or part--thereby taking away the freedom of that person to keep their whole penis or clitoris or whatever. Is it right for a person to make a personal choice or decision about their own body? And, is it right to permanently impose our preferences onto someone else's body which does not belong to us?

                Some parents fear their child will be bullied or shaming as a boy or a man simply for having typical male anatomy. Isn't it also bullying to remove healthy, functional body parts from a child when they are helpless and cannot defend themselves? Other parents teach their children that they are

                 If you really want to get technical, circumcision goes back to the ancient Egyptians.  You may want to read a little more on the subject and not be so myopic.

                 I completely agree - a few thousand infants subjected to this gross ritual is a few thousand too many.  A baby has no say.  That being said, I do know one adult who wasn't circumsized and had so many health issues he got snipped at 27 yo - extremely painful.  That's why circumcision is done as an infant.

                   I do know one adult who wasn't circumsized and had so many health issues he got snipped at 27 yo - extremely painful.

                  You know a man who consented to circumcision as an adult, and it was extremely painful for him. It is also extremely painful for a man to be circumcised as a baby. Babies must be conscious during the procedure because general anesthesia is too dangerous for them. Not to mention the pain of having a bloody open wound on your genitals that is burned by acidic urine. Not very sanitary environment either inside a diaper with feces.

                  What disease was your friend diagnosed with? One man out of how many men who live without any problem of their penis their whole life? How unlucky for him to have a rare condition that couldn't be treated any other way but amputation. How do you compare an adult with a medical condition to subjecting all infant boys to unnecessary surgery when they have perfectly normal, healthy genitals without any diagnosis of disease?

                   That's why circumcision is done as an infant.

                  The reason why infants are circumcised is that they can't fight back. An adult man can defend himself and will not let you circumcise him without his consent, but it's very easy to force circumcision on a child.

                   Now that I have answered all of your question - how about your thoughts on bacha bazi as a ritual?

                 <p>
                  I'm not familiar with it. I think I've vaguely heard something of socially accepted gang sexual abuse of young boys in Afghanistan. Is that what bacha bazi is?
