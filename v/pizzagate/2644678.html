            this was a hilarious movie. the aristocrats joke as itself is an exercise in fun debauchery. thats the whole point of the joke. to say the most disgusting things you've ever heard of. i can see why people are getting butthurt about this, but thats because they are just reaffirming their confirmation bias. YES i understand the joke is about pedophilia,beastiality, etc... but it doesnt mean all of these comedians are actually interested in doing these things in real life to actual children.
           </p>
           <p>
            people need to be able to differentiate between being edgy, and actually having the lust for children, theres a giant difference. i swear people are just deconstructing everything in society to find the "answers" that they
            <em>
             want
            </em>
            to find. in my humble opinion, this is a stupid, irrelevant fucking post. sorry, but its my opinion and you cant change it, you can only downvoat it.

            Well, I'm as outraged about actual abuse as anyone, but I'm also sad about the way we have lost comedy. I mean... it's JUST A JOKE. And jokes have a healthy function. Just like swearing. Like using offensive language. I did not take that movie or the jokes to mean or to imply that the talker was a doer. "Bad men do what good men dream," is the title of a book that explains why good people are so interested in the doings of bad people. We are all human, none of us are free of venal, shameful impulses of one kind or another. I understand completely why all of you are so exercised about this show, but my concerns for civil liberties being speedily eroded are more prominent in my mind. Every day I see more and more of the unhealthy effects of this wave of suppression of expression, and am really disappointed that We The People are so easily swayed to willingly forego the very foundation of our American Revolutionary form of government. This new Right To Not Be Offended is being given precedence, and sure, it has a certain feel-good cachet to it, but the end effect of our giving up the appreciation for the right to OFFENSIVE speech is not going to feel very good for any of us.

            Well the premise of the joke is to be as vile as possible. Seinfeld won't even utter it. Surprised you haven't talked about the Stanhope one where he's saying it while holding someone's kid.

            The whole point of the aristocrats is for the comedian to make it as filthy and offensive as possible and tell it with a straight face. It's the comedian's equivalent off an acting exercise like "pretend you are a palm tree in a hurricane who is trying to keep all your coconuts but failing"

             It's not that simple.  There is much more at play here that straight faced comedy.  I am sorry, but if you are a normal person you could never come up with stuff like that.  Most people think it is immoral stuff and vile.

              Whoopi's the only one who says "these things are happening now" on the video.   Hiding saying they are "just jokes" now has been exposed as a lie by these perverts.   They think it's funny because it's part of their behavior or that of their social circle.

             No one surprised my except Carrie Fisher and Tim Conway.  Go figure.  I think Carrie was abused and later saw the light and removed herself that's why she had problems with drugs and drinking.  Tim, Well, I guess you have to pay to play.  Sick and Sad.  Comedy It Is NOT.
