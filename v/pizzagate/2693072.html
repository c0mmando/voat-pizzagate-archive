<p>&quot;A rising transgender star in the Green Party has withdrawn from the deputy leadership race after her father, who had twice previously acted as her election agent, was <strong>jailed for the rape and torture of a 10-year-old girl in the attic of the family home</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Green Party candidate Aimee Challenor</strong>, 20, withdrew from the race on Sunday after her <strong>father David Challenor</strong>, 50, was sentenced to 22 years in jail last week for the false imprisonment and rape of a child, reports <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/27/greens-rising-star-quits-deputy-leader-race-after-father-jailed-for">The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>Warwick Crown Court had heard that <strong>David Challenor had acted out his sadomasochistic fantasies by dressing up in adult-sized baby dresses and diapers and pretended to be a girl called ‘Lucy’, before tying up the child in the attic of his Coventry home, raping and whipping her and giving her electric shocks.</strong></p>
<p>After she had left the house, the young victim was too frightened to tell anyone of her abuse but eventually did so with the crime reported to police at the end of 2015. Mr Challenor was subsequently arrested and charged.</p>
<p><strong>Despite knowing her father was charged with the abuse of the 10-year-old, and even after his court date had been set, Aimee Challenor named her father as her agent when she ran in the 2017 general election and in council elections in May 2018</strong> (in which she failed to gain either seat).</p>
<p>In a statement posted to her website, Ms Challenor, who shared the family home with her father and mother, wrote that she was withdrawing from the deputy leadership race as she did not want the election process becoming “dominated by what my father has done” and wanted “to ensure the focus stays firmly on the good work that the Party is doing”.</p>
<p>“My father was sentenced to 22 years in prison for a series of serious sexual offences including rape and gross indecency. I am horrified, I am saddened, I am disgusted and I am devastated by these events,” the party’s equalities spokesman wrote.</p>
<p>“I did not know about the full details of the crimes my father has been found guilty of until very recently,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>“The offences committed by my father took place in the attic of our family home. I did not go into the attic during my adult life — it was considered ‘dad’s space’.</strong> That didn’t seem unusual for me at the time,” she added.</p>
<p>“On reflection, I can understand that it was unacceptable for me to appoint my dad as my election agent when he had been arrested. I can now understand the potential risks of that decision,” said the aspiring politician who transitioned from male to female at the age of 16.</p>
<p>The Green Party said it did not know about the allegations against the former candidate’s father before he was sentenced and his membership of the party was subsequently “removed with immediate effect”.</p>
<p>The party said it would be reviewing its safeguarding and criminal disclosure policies, adding that “A full investigation into how this was able to happen is taking place.” &quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>Notice the ex-candidate specifies that she &quot;did not go into the attic during my <strong>adult life</strong>.  What about during her childhood, you have to wonder.</p>',

            Like his son Aimee, David was  a fetishist. He wore children's clothing and an adult nappy while he raped the 10-year-old girl.

             Note the comment from Waddlelikeapenguin about animal cruelty charges.  He must be talking about this from Conservapedia:
            </p>
            <p>
             "In 2013 Ashton and his four siblings were all taken into care by the local council, which happens when parents are neglecting or abusing the children. All the family's pets were also removed by the RSPCA on grounds of cruelty and neglect. His father got a criminal conviction for animal abuse, with a 12-week prison sentence. However, at age 16 Ashton returned to his parental home and changed his name to Aimee."

              https://www.conservapedia.com/Aim%C3%A9e_Challenor
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I haven't included this in the OP because I haven't been able to verify the truth of it and also because it's obviously written by a political enemy.  Maybe there is some truth in it.

              It wouldn't surprise me at all if it were true. Aimee publicly supported his father, with whom he worked very closely, until just recently. There's no way he wouldn't have known about his father's proclivities.   Also, Aimee set up something called 'Terf blocker'  which put hundreds of women at risk.  If these are the kinds of people representing the Greens, the Greens shouldn't even exist.

            The friggin Green Party is a joke.  It supports Aimee and his father rapist, David, while it bans a woman for using the incorrect pronouns.  ffs Green Party--you are what's wrong with the Left.

            How did mom and “Aimee” not hear screaming, hitting, movement upstairs? Come on... obviously they did and they know. The son is in deep denial. I bet if we look further into the dad we will find a Freemason connection somehow due to the political aspect of the case. And notice dads fetish for cross dressing up as a little girl, same as the son now transitioned. I bet dad was abused too. I bet this whole family has been into ritual abuse for a few generations back. Does dad dress up as a little girl and do those sick acts on the 10 yr old girl as if he is inflicting the abuse upon himself? So twisted. This poor girl needs some serious psychological help and help I hope she’s getting it. The articles don’t mention where the girl came from and how he chose her and further how long he kept the poor child for. These people are just SICK. I do have to wonder if the son has deviant tendencies also...

             Everything you said is right on point.  How did she come to be in his house in the first place--that's what I'd like to know.  There's no info about this anywhere.  How can people call themselves journalists without addressing this question?

            My question: just *HOW *is Challenor getting off scot-free for this? She lived at home WITH her father (and mother) -- how can you not hear screaming, stomping, or pleas for help coming from your attic? Just WHO was this small child? A sibling? A neighbor kid? A child sex trafficking victim?

             All excellent questions.  Also, how is it possible the wife didn't know?  She's culpable imo.  Who was the little girl?  Apparently not a sibling, according to this article in Metro:
             <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/23/paedophile-dressed-up-as-baby-and-raped-girl-10-in-torture-den-7873346/">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "Prosecutor Andrew Wallace said most of the charges related to the ordeal to which Challenor subjected one girl, who lived in the Stoke area of Coventry at the time."
            </p>
            <p>
             What was she doing in Challenor's house?  That's the most obvious question that no journalist has addressed that I can find.  There might be a gag order.  In practice, freedom of the press or speech doesn't really exist in the UK.

            After the jury returned its verdicts, Mr Wallace read out an impact statement in which Challenor's victim said she had been left traumatised by her ordeal.

            I would highly imagine.  I hope to God, someone will see this child gets serious intervention and not for a few months.  For years.  You do not overcome or learn to deal with things like this with a few sessions.

            That "woman" needs immediate intervention psychiatric help, before the damage is done.  There has to have been some damage done living with her father.  I am imagining a scene of horrors involving her/him as a child.  I am now wondering if boys that have been heavily abused by their fathers hate their maleness so much that they want to transition.  And the opposite as well.  This is all so sad and sick.  I am seriously worried for this child of the rapist father.  I am going to read both articles again.  I was in a state of shock and disbelief while reading.

             Carmencita, when they were little, the children were all taken away from their parents because the parents could not look after them. However, they were returned by the authorities when 'Aimee' was, I think 6.  It's clear that the children didn't get a normal upbringing and that the family is highly dysfunctional. Aimee has said that he knew what was going on but didn't realize had bad it was.  Both Aimee and his dad were very computer literate.

              How did you know this?  I did not see this in the articles.  Not doubting it, you must have read another article. What in the world was wrong with those parents at such a young age, some serious stuff really.  Also if they were not capable, they children should not have been returned.  Evidently there was no mental evaluation.

                I’ve seen a few things about the Green Party. This gives me reason to really worry. The bear stuff is also connected to their love of the panda. Stuffed animals. Their infatuation with childish toys and clowns bunnies. Sad sad sad.

               thread there is a link to a dog and bear race that Aimee and her dad participated in. Apparently Aimee identified as a bear (as well as a woman). I suppose it's one of those furry fetishes.
              </p>
              <p>
               David Challenor also has a conviction for animal abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
               An organization called Coventry (?) Of which aimee and her dad were members, found out about the charges of rape in 2016 and threw David out. So aimee has known and continued to use his dad as campaign manager, calling him 'Baloo' Challenor.
              </p>
              <p>
               David, the dad, was also a scout leader.  Aimee had campaigned for trans women to be girl scout leaders.....nothing suspicious at all.
              </p>
              <p>
               Aimee has a history of calling women 'cunts' and 'non-men'. Yet someone who referred to Aimee as a 'him' (Miranda Yardley) was banned on Twitter.

                “She” needs to be watched  She May just turn out a Cc of the father. This is so sick and scary. Seems that’s what he was trying to do. Passing it on in the family. Possibly a family  type cult. There must be serious intervention. NOW.

             The rapist father was obviously abused as well if he gets off on sex while dressed up as a baby wearing diapers.  How many generations back does it go I wonder.

              This is what always occurs to me as well.  What in the world was done to someone with such sick perverted sexual habits.  This is how he sees sex?  Something went seriously wrong along the way, during HIS childhood as well.  Just like with  Clement Freud and his father and grandfather and his ..........well we could go on and on.  Yes this is systemic and also included family cults that go way back.  Here is one that will be continuing the practice with his two sons.  One is pictured with him here

              Yes, and here are tons of pictures of the fez hat including men wearing them who are Shriners.  The Famous Shriner's Hospitals are run by the Freemasons.  This should tell us something about what may be going on there too.  So this guy was a Shriner too possibly at one point.  This is some really sick stuff.

            I'd be willing to bet that the bulk of the not-male or not-female crowd are victims of some form of trauma or another.  Mostly the very bad kind.  Making yourself as freaky or non-appealing is a reaction to getting away from someone close to you.  Just like the morbidly obese.

             I completely agree. In fact, I'd go as far to say that child sexual abuse is the culprit in many/most of our social dysfunctions, from LGBTQ, to the moral inversion in our media/entertainment, as well as politics.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sexual abuse is a virus that moves across generations, where many victims later become victimizers, and so on. Many of these corrupted people go on to be icons in the media and influence our culture in profoundly corrupt ways. They only way to destroy the virus is to prevent future victimizers. But this disease is especially difficult to confront since sexual abuse is primarily a private crime and most victims are young and ashamed and can't/won't speak out.

             While researching pizzagate I saw many possible victims who wore curved barbell rings in septum nose piercings. I wondered if it was for a similar reason or a sign that they were child sex slaves.

              It's interesting you say that.  Many years ago I heard someone speak about the 'subconscious' meaning of piercings and where they're placed.  The theory was that people who wore nose rings wanted to be 'led' around and be subservient eg like bulls.  I don't know whether that's a bit like playing the subservient victim role.

            LOL Tranny backs down after father gets convicted but not when he gets accused. Trannies never think that they or their family members can do any wrong unless it's someone denying them sex or calling them men.

              Yeah, something that the trans movement does NOT mention is that transwomen--no matter how much surgery or hormones they take--have the same criminal rates as that of males.  And if people think that some men won't bear the embarrassment of donning a dress to enter a woman's changeroom to photograph, video or peep on women, think again.
