            Alex Jones has again harmed the movement. That's the point here.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was inarticulate, unprepared, and could have done a lot of good had he chosen not to behave like a bombastic buffoon. I'm only upset that Cernovich has aligned with him, but then Cernovich did dismiss #pizzagate in lieu of promulgating a global pedo problem. For now, Cernovich gets a pass because he's doing massive good ... but this? Completely on Jones for not seizing an opportunity by the balls.

             There is no "attack" against Alex CIA Jones
            </p>
            <p>
             It is all scripted, each side is playing its part to keep the MSM and the Infowars sheep entertained.
Just like in the presidential debate, when Hillary was given the questions in advance, or just like when pedo Alefantis got the questions for the Megyn Kelly "interview" in advance, so he could  prepare his "answers"
            </p>
            <p>
             It is all a game, a big joke, don't you get it?
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone doing real attacks and real journalism, gets FIRED right on the spot, like the useful idiot Glen Beck, or 2002 Pulitzer Prize winner leftie Chris Hedges, who was fired from the NYTimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Give me 10 minutes with Alex Jones, and i will destroy his narrative and credibility, but.. do you think, anyone who is asking real questions, will ever get in front of him to interview him?

              Sorry but I'm not going to fall for the CIA funded operation to discredit Alex Jones. He still talks about a lot of truth such as vaccines/gmos/Bilderberg/bohemian grove/globalism.  He's still awakening people everyday. He's a gateway to further truth, and that's a good thing tbh. Why would the CIA want someone telling all of that truth to the people? It doesn't make sense. Who cares if he doesn't talk about Zionism, at least he talks about George Soros and the rest of the globalists

              Jones did an interview with David Duke, who asked real questions. How does that square with your theory that no one asking real questions can get to Jones? I guess that means David Duke is controlled opposition too.

                Yet the video still exists and is available for viewing. Do you really think Jones imagined that he could make the video disappear forever? No. Ne knew it would survive, but if it wasn't to his liking, it is well within his rights to not host it on his own channel. I think DD has many valid points and is often misunderstood by his worst detractors. Chew on that point for a while. There is subtlety and nuance to very complicated subjects like the one at hand, but dolts like you think it's reducible to "It's the Jews!" Even DD's positions are subtle and require consideration by those with an open mind. I also think Jones did not give DD enough consideration in that interview. So, how are you going to spin this response?

            Jones is doing what he always does. Mix in lies with the truth, then go goes on national televison and denounces the truth while overacting and portraying an unstable "conspiracy theorist". He works for Time Warner. He has stratfor agents on his staff. He admitted it on his show and said it was no big deal, you guys sound crazy for bringing it up. Only a shill or a mental sloth who could never be red pilled supports Alex Jones.

             It's interesting to note that you hurt your own case by citing the second video. See, most Jones bashers imply he never pursued pizzagate, but your video proves Infowars did, for a time. I've committed to text perhaps half a dozen semi comprehensive outlines of the circumstances surrounding Jones's retraction under my username rwb, not that someone as shortsighted as you would ever make the effort to actually seek them out, so that you could know the truth. It's much easier to be a big man beating on Jones anonymously in some forum than to actually seek out the truth.

              Jones is never going to come out clean and explain the real reason why, he stopped pursuing pizzagate. But there is no need.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those reasons are clear.. his (((advertisers))) and his CIA / Deep State handlers told him to back off pizzagate, That is it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Same thing happened recently to Hannity when he started talking about Seth Rich.
He almost lost his job. Glen Beck lost his job when he did an expose on George Soros

             <p>
              Alex Jones knows his fate can be the same as Glen Beck.. and being the Deep State puppet / entertainer / gutless goyim that he is, he backed off.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               So why did Jones cover pizzagate at first?
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Because Jones is some kind out journalistic wonder? a curious mind?
             </p>
             <p>
              NO.. Jones covers ALL conspiracies to keep the sheep in his audience entertained.
             </p>
             <p>
              Is there ANY conspiracy he hasn't "covered"? Aliens, reptiles, MKUltra, Illuminati, Masons, etc etc.. to him pizzagate was just another silly bandwagon to jump on and when his bosses told him to apologize and back off, he did.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Anyone still supporting Alex Jones, is clearly anti-pizzagate

               I am in complete agreement with the generally accepted theory that Pizzagate is real, i.e., that there is a cabal of wicked people in powerful positions doing beyond wicked things, and that this began to surface with the wikileaks Podesta emails. I also understand how and why Alex Jones was forced to retract on Alefantis, a suspected Rothschild in the flesh. Jones was strong armed into a retraction by a veritable Rothschild who was backed by every last one of the major global media empires because he was the ideal foil or proxy for everyone else remotely investigating pg. Force a retraction from Jones (using incredibly conniving techniques like feeding an Infowars reporter with a fake Comet Ping Pong menu offering children for sale, and having a witness to the CPP shooter [who happened to be a lawyer] incriminate Jones during an interview to establish grounds for a defamation suit) and there would be no need to bother with the smaller fish, while simultaneously driving a wedge between Jones and his followers. Well, not this follower, who takes some pride in having a very tactical mindset. Jones has an impeccable 22 year record of tearing into the pedophile child sacrificing elite in a way no one else has, so he gets a full pass from me for doing the right thing in order to keep Infowars from being litigated into oblivion, in a D.C. courtroom no less, likely run by a judge who is an associate of Alefantis, rather one of Washington's 50 most powerful people. Jones has earned the right to take a pass on this one lone engagement with the enemy, in order to fight another day, and on another field.

                What you are saying in no way contradicts what i am saying, in fact it confirms it.
You are just trying to justify and rationaize his behaviour.
AJ is a coward, looking out for himself.. so let me ask you this question.

                 If AJ was unable to stand up to a  sick, pedophile pizza store owner like Alefantis, and had to kneel down and apologize to him, what makes you think, Jones is going to denounce the REAL POWERS behind what happens in the US and around the world; namely AIPAC, Israel, the military Industrial Complex, etc,, etc????

                 He already has. If Jones were to retire tomorrow and never say another word, his body of work would stand as an unprecedented twenty-two year struggle against the PTB, and he gave impetus to thousands of others to start their own platforms of resistance. As it is, he continues the fight on dozens of battle fronts, and he has the support of plenty of people who recognize the points I've made over and over and over again. And Jones stood up to JA as long as he could, until it became apparent that solely Infowars was in the crosshairs of the cabal for a coerced retraction. You obviously gave no consideration to anything I wrote, not that I really expected you to. Your response was as predictable as your next.

                   Are you baiting me down the Jew question? Sure, I'll go there. Who runs CNN? According to this link:

                   </a>
                   which was posted at Voat, it's the Jews. Who savages CNN day in and day out, week after week, year after year? One Alex Jones. Coincidentally, I've addressed Jones and Jew question already some months ago, quite comprehensively I might add. Jones has pilloried more jews than any other terrestrial radio talk show host in history, bar none. The one thing he does not do is call them out as Jews. He calls them out as human beings doing evil things, because Jews do not have a lock on evil. Not inserting the question of ones religion is his right and his sole prerogative. In fact, it's one of the reasons why he has managed to build Infowars into the platform it is. See, he's smarter than you and your ilk. He can gnaw on the legs of the likes of an Alan Dershowitz, Sumner Redstone, Michael Bloomberg, Diane Feinstein, or Chuck Schumer, etc., without having to carry the baggage you want to attach to him. That is unless you're playing for the other side and want to attach that particular baggage because you know it will sink him ;-)

                       You missed my intent, entirely. I'm not surprised. You're just not very bright. Have you ever read The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt? I have. Do you know who savaged Mearsheimer and Walt for writing the book, calling them traitors to Israel and the U.S.? The Israel Lobby, AIPAC, ADL, etc. The problem you allude to is not going to be solved by people as stupid as you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Do you know how many times Jones has mentioned the attack on the USS Liberty? More times than I can even recall. It's well into the scores. You sir, know nothing about me, Jones, or the big picture.

                         Of course they extract energy from children. In fact, there's even is a physiological explanation. Eliciting terror and suffering causes a massive increase in things like adrenaline, dopamine, and endorphins in the brain and body of the torturer, and this in fact translates to a very real kind of energy. But I trust you've never studied these things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The part about creatures from another dimension is a metaphor, a way of describing these people facetiously, but the two minute clip you keep citing is someone's creative expression in attempting to paint someone else. It has no validity. It is a kind of propaganda, and it has no merit. Did you make that video?

                         <p>
                          WOW.. that is true journalism LOL... never blame anyone directly, and speak about everything metaphorically, so the sheep just make up their own theories about all the BS he spews. This is perfect.. as everyone interprets things their own way and nobody ever gets angry, because no one is ever directly named.... the funny thing is that libtard rhetoric is not far from becoming that..

                          Anyway, this sounds like cult propaganda to me... all religions are based in this sort of non-sense.., like people seeing Jesus or Mohammed in the random clouds, or loonies giving whatever meaning they see fit to various books on the bible.

                          this brings to mind one of my favorite books, Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Taleb, i highly recommend it but it is not for everyone it, as it touches on finance, philosophy and other obscure stuff, but hey, what do i know.. since according to you i am not very "bright", LOL

                           You can say that, but it's not true. Jones names names, and has done for over twenty years. Of course I can't stop you from pretending to know what Jones has said in those 10 000 hours of video time, but anyone who has watched Jones with any regularity, especially the earlier years, knows Jones has been very specific.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The cult of Jones bashers is no different and just as strong as any other cult. And someone like you who thinks the world is perfectly comprehensible is doomed by sheer hubris. Can you cite two specific examples of BS Jones spews, without obfuscation, of which I have to confess you are rather adept? Let's see some of that simplicity and clarity you accuse Jones of avoiding. Just present two positions Jones holds on real issues that are BS as you say.

isn't that enough??

knock yourself out.. those are pure disinfo..  (and please don't tell me you believe in aliens, ufos and mkultra mind control, reptiles, etc , because if you do, this conversation is over.. LOL)

                             Jones never talks about reptilians, unless in jest or facetiously, and he never talks about aliens at all, except to note that some of the elite believe they're being visited or channeling contact from other realms, so the fact you keep mentioning it tells me you know precisely nothing about Jones except what you've cobbled together from some lame youtube videos like the one you keep citing. And you're already under mind control if you think mind control, mkultra, and the Illuminati do not exist. What are you doing here at

                             anyway? Most are here trying to contribute to the hastening of the arrest and prosecution of demonic child sex traffickers. Do you deny it's happening? What's your theory of the Podesta wikileaks emails using food words in incongruent ways? And in the spirit of fair and friendly discourse, why could you not cite just two specific viewpoints of Jones that you consider BS when requested? As someone who enjoys logic, I see only two plausible explanations. 1. You have such a meager knowledge of Jones, you cannot cite any because you don't have the foggiest idea where he stands on any specific issue. 2. You know I'm going to beat you over the head with any truthful response. Name the BS brother. Play your hand like a man instead of waffling with vagaries.

                 Jones is not a prosecutor or a member of LE, so blaming him for the State's lack of fulfilling its duty to protect is outrageous beyond description. Would you like Jones ride into Dodge and personally dispatch the evildoers? Are you going to bust him out of prison? Jones has named names thousands of times, and it is incumbent upon the State to act on any information it is provided with. The State's failure is not Jones's failure. Jones doesn't believe in the shapeshifting reptilian theory like David Icke (who incidentally doesn't get everything right but who also has done excellent work reporting the child sex crimes of the elite) and the fact you attributed the belief to Jones
                 <em>
                  twice
                 </em>
                 is the clearest proof you know absolutely nothing about Jones and his worldview, and merely take your talking points from other similarly unobservant youtubers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Jones's job is to wake up a population that is in a somnambulistic stupor, and he does this very well.

                   Jones has committed something like 10 000 hours of broadcast time to informing the public. That's a lot of material for his enemies to chop up and edit into any message they want while even using video effects like replaying the same phrase at slow speed multiple times, like yours does. This is an outrageous manipulation of the truth, and if I was inclined to waste even more time communicating with the deaf than I already am, I could search out and furnish less facetious video where Jones says he does
                   <strong>
                    not
                   </strong>
                   believe in shape shifting reptiles. Nonetheless, I actually like the video. Jones's words drip with unmistakable passion for the children. And make no mistake, the people who torture children are possessed by something otherworldly. What it is exactly remains a mystery, but know that Jones would like to tear off the mandibles of those who would bring harm to the children, and beat them with it until nothing but a pulpy mess remained, and no mischaracterization by you is going to change this immutable fact.

             You know what they call women who sell themselves for money. She is just a high end call-girl, hooker, prostitute/pressitute. High end according to the money paid to her, not her personal worth.

            AreWeSure that Alex Jones is a gatekeeper disinfo agent? AreWeSure that truthers don't do corporate media interviews? We have to be very very very very very very careful to not jump to conclusions. Careful everybody. Very very very dangerous to make decisions about what is obvious.

               Double LOL! You're so observant, you didn't even know Kelly called and arranged the interview with Jones, not the other way around. Perhaps you'll want to correct yourself and try again. I'd be willing to respond directly to a more accurate comment. And as far as truthers never getting interviews with mainstream media personalities, I guess you've never heard of Luke Rudkowski of We Are Change. Luke's managed to engage Henry Kissinger, Jacob Rothschild,
               <strong>
                and
               </strong>
               Anderson Cooper in dialogues before the camera, where he savaged them I might add. Is Rudkowski also working for the CIA/Deep State like Jones? Have you ever even heard of Luke Rudkowski? And can you kindly verify somehow that you're not part of a hired crew to attack anyone remotely trying to knock a hole in the Deep State's power grid like a Jones or a Rudkowski or a Dave Hodges or a John B Wells?

ahh.. NO, you read this piece of "news" somewhere in the mainstream media.. the media that always tells the truth, LOL
You have absolutely no proof of what you are saying.

                Anyway, nobody forced AJ to do the interview.. and he did it anyway, because it is good for his failing ratings.. because let's face it, MK is an idiotic bimbo who has nothing to say.

               <p>
                Even if she was the one to start the talks about doing the interview,, she is doing it for a reason.. she is FAILING. MISERABLY.. her "interview" with Putin tanked, and the one with Alex Jones did worse.. she couldn't even keep up with 60 minutes reruns.
Nobody cares about MK, and even less than about AJ

                 I'm always amused by comments like yours. Trifling ditties, mere blather that the author thinks has weight by virtue of terseness, as if the subject of Jones's complicated role in the world is so closed it's reducible to one sentence. Well, I have news. I've waged war with Jones bashers at Voat for four months, some much smarter than you, and have hamstrung everyone on a point by point basis. My record exists for my target audience, which is rational and reasonable people. You don't strike me as either.

                 The most loyal followers of  Jones know he is a flawed man, but nonetheless a flawed man who is ferocious in his defense of innocent children, as exemplified by his Herculean efforts to inform the public that MMR vaccinations are causing skyrocketing autism rates and his efforts to tell the world that it's run by satanic pedophiles. You don't know this and thus will refuse to acknowledge same because you are ill informed, but ignorance is no excuse. Controlled opposition does not exist today. The PTB are operating one whole level above saps like you. They send out troops to label every and every hard working alternative media personality as controlled opposition, limited hangout, cointelpro, and a whole raft of other designations, since it's the easiest way to dissuade large swaths of truth seeking individuals to turn and attack the very truth seeking people who have made it their mission to battle the PTB. However, you are at least partially correct in that there is
                 <em>

                 fool in this particular dialogue.

                    Why do you need to follow someone?
Why be a follower?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Do you think a single person has all the answers?

                   <p>
                    If you knew the dealings of some of the people you follow, you would know, these people do not deserve to be followed. they deserve to be jailed (as in the  example case of HIllary, Obumma or Bush for example, i am not saying you followed these people, but millions of other people did and still do)
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Stop being a follower, create your own path, create your own videos, do you own research, read books from the right and the left..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Listen to everyone, believe nothing and follow no one.

                     We're all followers, whether we like it or not. If it wasn't for you following your parents from birth to say age seven (where in theory you had perhaps enough cognition to survive) you'd be dead. When we get older, we follow others and emulate behaviors we see for one reason or another. If you were dropped on a desert island at seven years of age, what kind of social skills might you have at twenty-five by not following anyone?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now back to my question. I asked you for the name of one person who I should follow. Your response was why be a follower, as if you somehow conjured the idea that the world is a bad place all on your own. You knew the real thrust of my question, that I wanted to get a scope on your influences, because we all have influences, but instead twisted it around because you can't answer it. If you are what you pretend to be, you know f****** well you didn't figure out the planet is run by mental cases all on your own. You learned that somewhere brother. Well, where did you learn it?
