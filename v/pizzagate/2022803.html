            This needs so much more attention. You are the researcher that posted this on steemit right? If so, you don't get enough credit here because you are a great researcher.

            I have many locations in my area. I called the first one just to see. It was a doctors office! I asked if I had the right address. She said they just changed locations.
           </p>
           <p>
            With as many locations there were here, it's really weird that I've never even heard of them.

             I'm not the researcher. I stumbled upon Mandi Rei Serra through fanfiction.net. She was writing a Fifty Shades of Grey spitefic and worked in pizzagate/pedogate/MKUltra into the story (around 2014, I think) and it was really engrossing. Her author notes on chapters were my original red pill. It's around chapter 45 where she starts dropping things like Franklin Cover Up,  Dutroux, and Epstein.

            <p>
             I'd post less of her stuff if others posted it first lol
            </p>
            <p>
             And yeah, it's really really weird how a website boasts of accurate hours AND locations has all these weird things that don't add up. There's a couple locations where I live. There's a bunch in the city closest to me. And no one has heard of them. If it was a bot error, it'd make more sense if all the listings matched. Only thing that ties them all together are shitty websites. And when those websites have ties to military intelligence or associates of the Clinton admin, it gets just...weirder.

              She's awesome. I follow someone on twitter that has a profile picture like hers. Maybe it's the same person. There's nothing wrong with you posting links to her because she's good! Thank you for sharing.

             Ya know, given how Clinton helped sell a fifth of America's Uranium to Russia, it seems especially foolish to pick a fight with a nuclear power.

             If Putin is laughing, it's because America is full of sheep lacking critical thinking skills and the perspective to understand how history shapes the present. Yay for social engineering, right?

             Wonder if there has ever been an AD in a newspaper for Josephs -- or Franks.
How do you run a business without advertising?
            </p>
            <p>
             But the internet would be a very easy way to spread knowledge of a "contact" list, imo.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do we know exactly how it may work, however?

            <p>
             EDIT ...
            </p>
            <p>
             In checking for advertising, I did find this from February 2012 ....
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              WESTMINSTER -- After 33 years, two locations and countless employees and customers, Joseph's Bistro will close its doors on Sunday.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I grew up in this restaurant,"
              <strong>
               Joseph Pandiscio III, who co-owns Joseph's Bistro with his father,
              </strong>
              said with tears in his eyes Thursday. "It's very emotional to let it go. Sometimes in business you have to make a decision to cut ties and move on. Hopefully, it will open a new door."
             </p>
             <p>
              Pandiscio's father first bought the building that
              <strong>
               now houses Subway and Dunkin' Donuts
              </strong>
              in 1978 and opened the Little Town Hall, changing the name to Joseph's Bistro in 1995.
             </p>
             <p>
              Five years ago, the restaurant moved to a larger building behind its original spot, becoming more of a pub and downsizing from 250 seats to 100 to manage costs, he said.

              The fact subway is now housed where the original bistro was is super frown worthy since they didn't do shit about Jared Fogle when they had the chance.

             <p>
              Maybe it's just me, but it's weird wording they have on their front page, boasting of the website's accuracy-- which, if true, means the bot theory is nixxed. Accurate hours and locations? Why is that so important if the franchises listed are common place, and one could find out store hours via the franchise's website?
              <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/369853df76/33751.png">

             </p>
             <p>
              Their About Us section also makes mention of the accuracy.

              People can
              <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/business-submit/">
               submit businesses
              </a>
              to add; according to hours center, they'll be verified first.
             </p>
             <p>
              But here's what I don't get for those who feel it's a bot-driven mistake: if it were, wouldn't they pull the entire subfolder and reverify if their reputation for accuracy at stake? Wouldn't an irate random Joseph or Frank contacte hours center to notify that they're being called by people looking for a bistro? I mean, that is, unless they are part of it, and all the other legit businesses are background noise to hide them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's one more thing of oddness: they offer nutrition facts for their listed restaurants. Except for Joseph's Bistro and Frank's Franks (and Duccini's, but since they are shut down, no biggie there).
              <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/nutrition/index/">
               https://www.hourscenter.com/nutrition/index/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              If they boast of accuracy of location and hours, then one must consider that they are indeed accurate locations and hours, deliberately listed for whatever reason, and meant to escape the eyes of those not privy to their existence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Or "bot error" because why not.

               Think there are some very essential pieces of the puzzle missing on this subject.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, the article that I found may have nothing to do with anything ... but odd.
              </p>
              <p>
               Meanwhile, Cattle Mutilations ...sounds like at the rate they're killing babies that they'd have enough human blood for their violent rituals.  But, of course, some of these cattle mutilations are thought to be "alien."
               <br/>
               Cattle blood is the closest to human blood -- pig blood for clotting.

               Maybe Edward Snowden tunes into Voat every once in a while from Russia and might offer a suggestion or two about whether this all means anything or not.  :)

                I have no doubt that it's not the full picture by a long shot. It feels a lot like assembling a huge jigsaw puzzle and all that's been done with the pieces is make the corners and part of the outline. There's a lot of missing information and pieces and the odds are not in our favor of finding them. But we can keep looking for pieces, see if it fits, keep it if it does and chuck it if it doesn't.
               </p>
               <p>
                You know, earlier today I was thinking about the cattle mutilations and people convinced they've been abducted by aliens... with the right resources, it's not hard to fuck with people on that level. Rancher loses and finds a cow, drained and diemboweled, but no blood in sight. Gets people talking.  Someone under covert surveillance, maybe illicitly given LSD, some high beams flicked on through window blinds at night, masks and a surgical site made all futuristic... the whole traumatising people via anal sex playing out with the often joked about "anal probing"... sounds too weird to be believable, meanwhile those responsible giggle about their accomplishments.
               </p>
               <p>
                Side note: all blood clots if it stands still. Unless one has a bleeding disorder like hemophilia. Cow blood included. Was in the hospital and watching Fear Factor. The nurse attending made a remark about the tub of bovine blood being used, as having an anticoagulant in it to keep it fluid. As she said, "Because all it takes is 15 minutes to make unadulterated blood into clot dumpling floaters." (sorry for the mental image of "clot dumplings," but that was something that stuck with me for YEARS.) ... it explains why they need fresh blood, straight from the tap, so to speak.

                <p>
                 I keep thinking that someone in intelligence might come along and make some suggestions
about these mysterious companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 MKULTRA and Franklin keep you on sure footing and sadly it does look like our military is
involved in child trafficking as related by Detective Rothstein in Fetzer interview.
Hampstead also, imo, has a lot to show us about how these things run.
                 <br/>
                 Children supplied a great deal of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Re Aliens/abductions -- We did have UFO's flying over the capital in 1950's.
Sadly, I thought "intelligence" meant peace and not just more advanced technology.
Will have to look for it, but at that time (Truman administration) high ranking military leader
advised the public "no threat to the US."  Think it's probably somewhere on YouTube.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But, my own feelings are positive on alien visitation going back hundreds of thousands of years.
Likely we are hybrids.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And looks like you feel just the opposite?
Yes, there can be aliens -- and we can still have a government which works with them.
Lots of evidence for Eisenhower having met with them a la "Encounters of the Third Kind."
It's being said now that Hitler/Nazis had contact and were working on UFO's.
We can actually have a government having given them permission for abductions/breeding program
in trade off program for technology.
And we can have aliens and/or our military involved in the animal mutilations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As I said, with all the murders of children we can see or estimate, I don't think they have a problem
with human blood for their violent rituals.
But, if there is a breeding program, blood from cattle and/or pigs may be a default use.
Also ....

                <p>
                 I'd highly recommend the "Ancient Alien" series that has been running for years ...
even if it is only our own government trying to slowly get information out about aliens.
Recall also that when the astronauts began they were referring to the "Heinz57 varieties"...
now I see estimates of 300+ alien species.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of course, I also understand there are many who don't feel they can trust such information.
I think the Disclosure Project is helping a good bit and, imo, gives a much better idea of the 
frequency of sightings and the kind of people who have experienced such events and/or abductions.

                  I'm not against the idea of aliens-- the thought that the vast universe being home to a blue marble/and only ant farm in existence doesn't seem logical to me. But I know people love screwing with others and can't rule that out.

                   True, you can't rule out "people screwing with one another" ... but traditionally that has come
from Elites/right wing, historically. 
From Our Founders if you actually read the Constitution which actually created an Elite patriarchy while
all the while proclaiming "all are equal."  They also endowed them with land grants and gave them 
immense influence and control over our people's government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
As you see, that was quite some "screwing" of the American public and democracy and has landed us
where we are now.
