             I think that is the main purpose of the Q Leaks. They are trying to create an "underground" communication network. It not only gets the message out past the MSM perimeter, it also exposes the fakeness of the MSM.

            Great post.  Some reason I did not get shadow ban. It is all out war on Twitter.  Our work is paying off in a big way. We could not have done it with out all of us. We banding together made a huge difference.  There is only 8,500 of those bastards and then us, the bottom feeders they like to think of as.

           </p>
           <p>

We will infiltrate the "epicenter of Democrat's work" and put them on Candid Camera....or Veritas.
We will expose their boondoggle plans to get YOUR VOTE AND MONEY, and give you NOTHING in return.

           </p>
           <p>

            I read this great post a few days ago, at
            <a href="http://rebelpundit.com/haitian-immigrants-protest-against-hillary-at-dnc/">
             http://rebelpundit.com/haitian-immigrants-protest-against-hillary-at-dnc/
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Rebel Pundit filmmakers Jeremy Segal and Andrew Marcus documented Haitian protesters against Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention this week in Philadelphia, PA. In the video, the protesters call out Hillary and Bill Clinton for stealing from earthquake victims in Haiti and cite the efforts of the Clintons to incarcerate black people through legislation during Bill Clinton’s term in office.
            </p>
            <p>
             The protesters voiced their support for presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying that they believe he can offer job opportunities that the Clintons do not seem to have on their agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             As seen in the video, these protesters defend Donald Trump against the accusation that he is racist and anti-immigrant by highlighting the corruption of most media outlets.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The world should know the crimes the Clinton family has committed against Haiti.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “They pretend they like us. They’ve been deceiving us. It’s time for us to wake up.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Then this video was posted,
            <a href="https://youtu.be/-QtAhtrRA1M">

            I tweeted this last night on

           <p>
            I think Haiti needs the US to recognize the disaster on top of the disaster, we owe Haiti justice.  The Clinton's owe them BILLions, let's make sure they receive it this time.

            I'm gonna say all this then go back and finish readn the post cause this is real time. Everything - so far since I yesterday fake awards, where there was heavy competition seemed to me PEDO BASED. On Twitter. With but a little check on Google hashtag Riverdale turned out to be pedo..then Nintendo...turns out to have a pedo scandal Allison rap got fired...and I started adopting those hashtags as well and calling them out and they fucking vanished SHORTLY. 
This morning top trending was winnierhepooh on Twitter. Having found out Pizzagate has to do with satanic ritual sodomy, the name POOH should be taken literally and the scene where he gets stuck in the hole should be taken symbolically and the honey should be taken metaphorically. As in the Alefantis photo with pizza and HONEY. Suggestive of anal.sex. in other words, do you think pedophiles aren't totally into Winnie the Pooh or pedo bear or furry party?
           </p>
           <p>
            No coincidences. In that respect an eye on Twitter, just looked now top trending FORBES and one simple search For bed just published an article billionaire says not everyone who looks at childporn is a pedo. Who cares Forbes. Child porn is sinful. Forbes wake the fuck up! Right ? This is clearly a little pattern here, 
 I think we watch what top trends on Twitter and destry their glass, stay mobilized like yesterday rip off hashtags.  There soldiers are pedo s. Totally too busy being narcissistic, wanting attention, wanting to game these little ploys for attention. Laughing at us guys.

             This fits in with the fact O'Keefe just revealed they've got 400 people paid to lurk people's DM's. The only people I can think of who would be able to tolerate that job are pedophile voyeurs who aren't ashamed of looking at the self-porn of teens. Any healthy adult would out that shit in a minute. 400 pedo voyeurs with their hands on the code could easily trend whatever the hell they want, I'm sure.

                I was thinking that would be really good. Even as an excersize because oeople are losing faith by the hour with waiting for TGE MEMO. 
The next time with a little  concentration on looking into what is competing with what our hashtag is on twitter as top trending. While the push we made seemed to bring out a concerted effort on Twitters part to push their pedo normalization agenda.
If we are wrong in guessing that that's what Twitter is doing then this would prove it. If we are right that they manipulate the trend to suppress down our hashtags and push the pedo normalization agenda on twitter, then our message and memes will echo that and expose it as well, and we will be vindicated.

              Thanks Vindicator. Looks like things are heating up. Uranium 1 may take down Team Clinton. Call Reps and demand evidence be made public. This could be it! We must continue exposing the PEDOS.

             That is true we do. She snatched them up without proper documentation and got caught crossing the border with them. She is a child thief. "33" of them as a matter of fact.

            PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti –  A missionary from Spain who devoted her life to helping the poor in Haiti was fatally shot at a crowded intersection in the Caribbean country's capital Friday.
At Sacred Heart Catholic Church, the Rev. Hans Alexandre described Sola as a "tireless servant of God" who helped build houses, worked as a nurse, fed the hungry and created a workshop where prosthetic limbs were made for amputees injured in Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake.

            A Tennessee missionary known as "Mom" in the children's home she ran in Haiti was gunned down behind the wheel of her car Saturday night, and a child around the age of 4 with her was kidnapped

            Could we provide all the redpill posts linked/located in one place?  Some of those are nice and easy reading and ready to go for linking to social media if Meme Wars-Haiti edition, or another opportunity takes place.  Also, in the spirit of Q, are there any existing Haiti related posts that show the chain you mentioned above that caused us all to believe?  It's still remarkable to me the sheer impact power the information has, seeing and discovering the ties for oneself between the bad players and their wrongdoings.

            Beyond seeing this on a meme spiderweb infographic, when one views the interconnections of relationships on the evidence we have in our arsenal it is mind-blowing: the pics, the town hall mtg for comet ping pong complaints, the artwork, the Maccoby, Silsby, CF document trail, etc etc.  Seeing isn't always believing, but it sure is the nail in the "working on my night cheese" coffin, if you know what I mean.  To understand that the lives of children were already horrific under the watch of Haiti gatekeepers willing to sell them, then to be subjected to the awful realities of the trafficking network...it's an unthinkable life of unending horror for these victims, the ones that didn't get discovered for who knows how long!  Let's not ever be jaded to the injustice of it all!

            Finally, Q also uses dates and socratic questions as a method.  The average Storm/CBTS/Q Research autist has a good working knowledge of pizzagate, but not to our detail level over here as you say.  If we could provide a clean snapshot bullet point listing of the date trail of Haiti related PG events with only introductory prose on a post, others would/could make memes from this simple list and dates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dedicated people have been staying up for days in a row just to create memes...such patriotism!  What would they do if they were armed with what we know in clear detail? We could also directly offer/provide the redpill info for 8chan in a broken link over on the q research board.  People here could provide any of these suggestions below if they are savvy with the search functions of our older post catalog.   Lets join forces, and rally against the forces of evil ForGodAndCountry pizzagaters!!!!!!!!!!!!  The moment of full rescue and vindication for the lives of the silent suffering is near!  Hats off to mods here...especially Vindy for this great idea which will put a year plus work into action!  We have devoted hours to bring this fight!

             This is a great idea. It also makes it possible to create multi-tweet threads, which are really powerful (see Thomas Wictor as
             <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasWictor/status/951701664641163264">
              an example
             </a>
             ). These have the red pill advantage of memes -- each tweet being an individual little "pill" -- yet the serious persuasive power of substantial research articles. I see it as a new persuasive writing genre that has grown from Twitter. Memes fit right into it, as long as you don't overdo it (meme lack substance and therefor can backfire a be experienced as spam).

             Since Q is asking for stuff regarding Haiti, this should help immensly.
            </p>

             This post contains my "crime scene analysis" of the Haiti incident.

             In short, the cholera epidemic was INTENTIONALLY spread via a septic pipe at the UN facility. Cholera was used as a murder weapon for the sake of an organ harvesting operation. The murder weapon was also part of the coverup.
