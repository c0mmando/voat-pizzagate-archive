<p><strong>According to a Senate subcommittee testimony last week, nearly 1,500 immigrant children were lost in government arranged foster homes last year, with the suspicion that many of them were kidnapped by human traffickers.</strong></p>
<p>During the hearing, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota told child protection representatives with the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) that they were “the worst foster parents in the world.”</p>
<p>“You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are. We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids that makes me angry,” Heitkamp said.</p>
<p>Many of the children are still unaccounted for, but some of them who have been found were held captive by human traffickers in terrible conditions.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Chairman Senator Rob Portman said that an investigation into the lost children began after the HHS put eight children from Guatemala into the custody of human traffickers, who forced them to work on a farm for 12 hours a day without pay.</p>
<p>“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard. What makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers,” Portman said after learning of the case.</p>
<p>“Whatever your views on immigration policy, everyone can agree that the administration has a responsibility to ensure the safety of the migrant kids that have entered government custody until their immigration court date,” Portman said.</p>
<p>Since that incident came to light, HHS and The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) promised to check up on the unaccompanied immigrant children who passed through their care. After these checkups, it was revealed that many more children were slipping through the cracks than anyone anticipated.</p>
<p>Acting assistant secretary at HHS, Steven Wagner, told the committee that between October and December of 2017, HHS called 7,635 children that the agency placed with sponsors and they were only able to track down 6,075 of them. At least 28 of them had reportedly run away, five others were deported, 52 were living with someone else and 1,475 were missing.</p>
<p>The number of children in danger could be much larger, considering that since 2013, more than 180,000 unaccompanied immigrant children passed into America, and very few of them had family in the states who they could stay with, so many of them were placed in the care of random foster families who did not have to go through the same types of background checks and scrutiny that foster families usually do.</p>
<p>The agencies blame their neglect of these children on low budgets, but they seem to have billions to spend on fighting the drug war and creating a police state at the border.</p>
<p>Of those 180,000 children that were placed in new homes, it is hard to imagine how many are currently missing, since so many of the 7,635 children who were actually followed up on could not be found.</p>
<p>In 2016, an AP investigation found that more than two dozen children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay.</p>
<p>Child welfare lawyers from Ohio who testified at the hearing said that increased persecution from immigration enforcers has made family members of unaccompanied children who enter the US afraid or unable to take custody.</p>
<p>One of these attorneys, Jessica A. Ramos, suggested that the children be appointed lawyers, in addition to having the opportunity to reunite with family members in the US without fear of deportation.</p>
<p>“Prioritization of enforcement over humanity is endangering children. My clients, despite having been born in another country and not speaking English, are still, above all things, children. Children who deserve to be safe from harm. Children who deserve a chance, just like our own children,” Ramos said.</p>
<p>“It’s not unreasonable to say that we’re looking at 10,000-plus children. Not all of them will be criminally exploited; some might have been passed on to family members. We just don’t know where they are, what they’re doing or whom they are with,” Europol’s chief of staff told the Observer newspaper.</p>
<p>While it is possible that some of these children are intentionally staying under the radar because they fear deportation, there have been enough cases of human trafficking in these circumstances to show that this is a widespread problem.</p>
<p>Along with immigrants and refugees, Native Americans have an especially high risk of becoming victims of human traffickers. As The Free Thought Project reported last year, Native American women and children are disappearing from areas near oil fields, where thousands of workers from around the country live in “man camps.” Investigations have revealed human trafficking to be a factor in many of these instances, but police in native tribes do not have jurisdiction to arrest non-natives, making it difficult to prosecute the human traffickers who are preying on their community.</p>
<p>Sadly, whether they are immigrants, natives, orphans, or just poor, children who are in vulnerable positions become easy targets for predators, and they are often ignored by the law as well, since these are already groups who are not treated with the dignity that they deserve by the systems that they live under.</p>

            Hello.  I am new to this platform and have not familiarized myself with it yet but really need some help with research skills.  My children were kidnapped by their mentally ill father and his child-trafficking parents in 2008.  I strongly suspect these people of impropriety because of how my custody case was mishandled.  I am asking if anyone here knows how to get data on the activities of Jim Preston, a CASA volunteer, and the child services organizations he works with in the Coeur d' Alene, Idaho area.  They have abused my children very badly and continue to do so on an ongoing basis, with no accountability at all.  They have no fear, they do whatever they want to my children in front of God and everybody and no-one bats an eye.  It is horrifying so please, if you know how to gather evidence, give me some tips.  Thanks!

            Everyone is acting so surprised.  The bureaucratic swamp is so vast and deep it's hard to find out where it ends.  The Deep State infected EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course there is some $27 million dollar program run by a HRC/Obama/Cabal cronie which "processes" 110 immigrant kids a month.  The SES above him gets a cut.  No one knows.  No one says anything.  Shit like this goes on in every branch of the US government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Restoring the rule of law, restoring peace, rebuilding the criminal and military justice systems, is just the start.  POTUS has good people in his Cabinet and they are quietly and without fanfare dismantling the Deep State which has infected the US Government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice how some circles are now saying Trump was doing it for human-trafficking "bonuses" for trade deals or something like that....

             Maybe you should ask yourself what they are doing with the children.  Because whatever it is, it won't only apply to immigrants... if that reasoning is what it takes to open your eyes.

              This is almost certainly Eva Longoria and her husband Jose Antonio Baston. Longoria is involved in over 40 charities and has at least 5 of her own. Baston runs ops at her charities and is very actively involved. Her charities are based in the San Antonio area which puts them in an ideal geographical position to pick off immigrant children after scooping them up through her charities.

              Baston keeps an ultra low profile and is

                40 charities??  That is a major red flag.  Interesting how the spike in charities matches the spike in human trafficking over the last 20 years. Also notice this bitch will not make a statement on the 'lost' children and neither will any other charity, beyond a fund raising ploy.  Michele Obama's 'bring back our girls' is a perfect example of somebody who hashtagged an event and did absolutely nothing about it. They are STILL MISSING !

                 And we can thank HRC for refusing to declare Boko Haram a Terrorist Outfit.  So they are allowed to roam free.  She had a method to her madness as usual.  She is why those Girls Are STILL MISSING.  I would not be surprised if they are actually working with BH.

                 Are you saying they're legit or not? Can 100% guarantee you the site has numerous contributors with CDAN's host just the editor. He's even admitted as such on the site.

                 There's a mix of standard, risque posts contributed by publicists seeking pap attention and expanded name recognition for their clients under the guise of there's no bad pap attention "game."

            Right when evidence points to Government as the actual criminal enterprise, government will always claim INCOMPETENCE.

            'Government can't do anything right' ?

            No.. Government is the source. Government officials are the CARTEL

              Governments are never the solution yet we always look to them to solve everything. They rip apart families when parents defy school demands to medicate their children, they allow criminals to run foster homes. Time and time again. We turn a blind eye. This is just another case of "incompetence", the outrage will fade and it will happen again. Thus my question. If citizens cared, this would stop.

             This is probably just the governmental aftermath of the loads of arrests that's been happening the last year. There's been a lot of posts about catching the criminals and rescuring the children.
            </p>
            <p>
             So there is a lot in the works and it's not entirely as grim as it might seem. Now we're at the point where the government takes responsibility and cleans up the corrupt pieces of filth sitting in high positions. That's where Trump comes into the picture and is at work. Though he's mainly trying to destabilize the corrupt foundation the cabal has created first. :)

              <strong>
               But now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has instructed agents to separate parents and children entering the US illegally, instead of keeping them together in detention, questions have been raised over whether the federal government can protect these kids.

              Don't fall for their pathetic attempts at blaming this on Trump. The President just yesterday attacked the law that separates parents and from children and said it had to stop.

               This is going to get very interesting.  On Twitter the idiot snowflakes who won't listen to any of the mountainous evidence on the Clinton Foundation are suddenly up in arms about the 1500 immigrant children becoz 'Trump'.  Pizzagate is going to smack them hard in the face now.
