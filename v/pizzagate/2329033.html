             I hope so. It's very weird because it mentioned that the footage was from 1992. I looked up every list I could of all the episodes of Americas Most Wanted and can't find an episode about Gosch anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Throughout my research on this case, I recall coming across information that someone that went by the name "The Colonel" was said to be the owner of the "ranch" that Gosch was held at in Colorado.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's an excerpt from a blog post I found summing up the Gosch case.
            </p>
            <p>
             "“The Colonel” was the man who Bonacci said ran a ranch in Colorado. Bonacci said the last time he saw Johnny was back in 1986 at that same ranch. Johnny, whose hair was now dyed black, and was renamed “Mark”, had attempted to run away. When they caught up with him, they branded Johnny on his right buttock, like a piece of livestock."
            </p>
            <p>
             Americas Most Wanted said the old owner of the property was an ex prison guard, and Bonacci says a man named "The Colonel" ran the ranch.  Could this ex prison guard be The Colonel?

              Ah!   I know that one.  Look up "the colonel mcmartin preschool".   His name will pop up.  Michael Aquino, I beleive it is.   He is still alive today.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is an extended interview with Johnny Gosch's mother online.  It is worth listening to.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have not watched the Netflix movie you mention, but I will.
