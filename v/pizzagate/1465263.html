            THIS!!  Fuck this Sharif Silmi shill scumbag - he clearly is reading off of a script and repeatedly asks Alex to "stop using hashtag pizzagate" "ignore comet ping pong" - and he got all flustered when that other guest came on and asked him if he had heard of pizzagate before heading there with his children, and he admitted that he had heard of the NPR show interview with Alefantis.  Shady shit all over this tool and his interview, he even tried to make the claim "they don't have a basement" that got a bit cut off in the audio mixing when he kept trying to yell over Alex (a change for once, lol).  Also, isn't it a bit strange how SO many places keep trying to push this Clinton involvement when I haven't seen much of anything to connect the Clintons to all of this yet I keep reading in the fake news sites about this being a "Clinton based conspiracy theory" and this guy on Infowars was trying to tell Alex to "tell your audience to focus on the Clinton foundation" and then again mentions to tell people to "look at Clinton" and "not comet ping pong".  Misdirection much?

            I don't remember which article it was or if it was the lawyer speaking to Alex Jones, but they made sure to say "after the gunman looked around and saw there was no basement he surrendered".

            It was a deliberate seperation of the name, that obviously went over your head. Usually only the worst kind of people, rush to insult someone they hardly know. I do not know you, or what your motive is, and do not really want to. Please do not message me again.

            on friend of Harry's was Russ Staqer (yes, you read that name right) he was murdered in mysterious circumstances. I look it up and it was his wife. What would make a woman do that. Harry swears Russ did more for inter city youth than anyone...

            He also first blamed Alex Jones at the time of the shooting, then when he was on Alex Jones, he claimed that he had not seen Alex's coverage of pizzagate until "30 minutes before he came on the show".. so why blame Alex before if you hadn't even seen his videos? Shady.

            He's not an actor.  No acting credits in that IMDB page, which was just glossed over by the idiot that made that video.

               I know right? The guy just has an imdb page and got credits in multiple films, but who doesn't? That's just like an average everyday gig that everyone does, like working at a pizza joint or something. People here are so behind the times that they don't even realize imdb is like the new linkedin now. Hell, I bet even you have more film credits on your imdb page than that "actor" guy, amirite?

            As someone who studies the other false flags (I prefer to call them hoaxes since they're mostly completely staged) of the Obama administration, I can tell you most of them have giveaways that are just as obvious as this one but people don't question them. Omar Mateen had an imdb page as well, for just one example. That was a complete hoax. The sad fact is most people don't question them because they don't view the media critically enough. They are carried out in such a sloppy way it almost seems intentional, as though to flaunt the power of the perpetrators to deceive the population, as well as causing argument between the people who are able to easily see through them and the people who call us retards for doing so.

              I hear that almost every time I bring up any of these hoaxes that had Muslim culprits and it is a fair objection. I used to think the same thing, even after I figured out Sandy Hook was a completely fake event where no one actually died I couldn't believe they would do the same thing with Muslims because it contradicts their pro-Islam, pro-immigration, pro-refugee, pro-multiculturalism narrative. However when I saw how obviously fabricated and staged the Boston Marathon Bombing was, I had no choice but to rethink this presupposition.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's how I explain it: yes it goes against their Muslim narrative, but if you've read
              <em>
               1984
              </em>
              you are familiar with the concept of doublethink, whereby you are expected to hold two conflicting ideas in your head at the same time. In this case, you must think that Muslims are our friends/Islam is a religion of peace, and also that there are scary ISIS agents who could kill you at any moment. This makes people confused, scared, and more amenable to the police state.
             </p>
             <p>
              It also justifies Obama's increased military action in the middle east - remember that when the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s America needed a new "bad guy" to blame everything on and it became radical Islamic terror.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, no matter who does the shooting it still serves as a pretext for
              <strong>
               increased gun control and surveillance
              </strong>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Finally, and in my opinion most importantly, if every fake shooting were an Adam Lanza, Jared Loughner, Dylann Roof, or James Holmes, aka a freaky psycho white kid, no one would believe it. Most people don't bother questioning the authenticity of any event where a Muslim is blamed.
             </p>

              The Pulse discussion starts at about 21 minutes in, before that he talks about Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon, and there is a ton of great stuff on Youtube if you want to look around or I can give you more material.

                I'm not sure about that one. There are definitely many weird details about it that don't make sense. Some people think he was mind-controlled, others think he was drugged and framed/arrested at the scene after other people did the shooting. Haven't studied it enough to take a strong opinion. There do seem to be crisis actors involved.  I know it didn't happen as reported so in that sense it is fake. Considering most of the other ones are completely staged it's safe to say this one probably was too.

               I am a 35 year old attorney who never believed a conspiracy theory before in my life. I am 96% sure that some variation of pizzagate is real. I was convinced when I was reading FBIanon before the Wall St. Journal announced the massive CF investigation. He predicted so much. Then I was doubly convinced by the four colobomas. My estimated odds of the federal government being filled with psychopaths went from 4% to 80% overnight. The only way I can try to make sense of it is through the concept of psychopaths filtering up into power. I read the book Lifting the Veil and it really made a lot of sense. Now, not only am I sure that some variation of pizzagate is real, but I no longer have confidence that other conspiracy theories are false. JFK, satanic rituals, breakaway civilizations, 9/11, nothing is off limits.

               It's a total mindfuck, and people don't even seem to realize what is about to happen. I don't think this story can be contained.

                Nice to have an attorney on board and i hope more sign up here and join the fight.
You are correct that psychopaths get in positions of power (in many corporations right now) and then hire like minded psychopaths beneath them. It doesnt take long before the whole organization is contaminated. Between that and blackmail is how evil takes over. Welcome to the matrix friend and you are correct, nothing is off limits, almost every historical event has been a false flag or faked event even including pearl harbor, the moon landing, the sinking of the titanic, yes it really sunk but it was sunk by the bankers to kill those on board who were planning to stop the FED from being formed. NASA is full of shit and loaded with satanic freemasons. I have been studying this stuff for 20 years now and have known about their satanic mind control programs for a long time. Just remember if they are psycho enough to kill kids they are also killing us every day with GMO poisons, fluoride, chemtrails, vaccines which are pure evil. The latest thing i started studying which even i said id never touch is flat earth... well i can tell you, i laughed at it like everyone does but after you look into it enough i am now convinced this is the biggest coverup ever, even bigger than pizzagate.  If you want to go there i highly recommend Eric Dubays vids on youtube as he has some great videos explaining all the tons of evidence, meanwhile NASA has zero proof, just they told you so. Just like James Alefantis, told you im not doing anything, case closed!

                Ok as I was saying, Aurora definitely has a lot of fishy business involved with it, but it's a little weird and some people think there was an actual shooting that took place even if James Holmes wasn't the real shooter. Even some of the witnesses reported smoke grenades being tossed from multiple directions. It obviously doesn't make sense that a broke college student could afford expensive body armor and multiple weapons and a ton of ammunition like that, either, and all of his appearances have been bizarre. Since he was a graduate psychology student, some people suspect that mind control might have been involved. Anyway, I'm not as well-researched on that particular event so I'll skip by it to a few months later, when Sandy Hook happened in December of 2012. That was the big one. Here's an entire
                <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/files/NobodyDiedAtSandyHook.pdf">
                 book
                </a>
                that's free to read online (it got banned from Amazon). It's over 400 pages, has multiple authors, photos, and all the evidence you need to know for a 100% certainty that it was a staged event revolving around a FEMA drill in which no one died.
               </p>
               <p>
                So basically every major terror attack since then has been a farcical staged production. The truth is there's just not that much domestic terrorism in the United States but it is beneficial to TPTB for us citizens to think there is. All the shootings and bombings, etc., during Obama's second term have shared these similarities - obvious crisis actors, lack of bona fide medical personnel, and they all seem to coincide with some sort of drill.

                  Hey man if you're interested in watching an amazing video (the video that REALLY blew the roof off of the whole Sandy Hook fraud and without a doubt will convince anyone, even the most ardent anti-conspiracy-theorist mainstream media-believing middle American housewife, if viewed objectively -- because the evidence in support of the hoax aspect is so overwhelmingly strong it can't be denied) is here:

                   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcZIRi_NkJI
                  </a>
                  (this same guy who I have been sub'd to on YouTube for years also correctly predicted this pizzagate false flag attack over 10 days ago on his channel, he's got a lot of great videos and I can assure you it's nothing that's "out there" or based on some numerology or random confirmation-bias type "evidence" he only uses actual facts and sourced material)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Mind you, that video is the 'full length' hour long one - if you only have 3 minutes, watch this video as he made it specifically to show people that're skeptical :

                   I'm watching now. I skimmed through half of the book and was not that persuaded. Doesn't mean that it's a hoax, or not a hoax, just not very convincing. I will watch this video.

                9/11 is a total mindfuck but as far as conspiracy theories go it's a bit of a black diamond trail, and you should warm up with a few bunny slopes first.
               </p>
               <p>
                At the beginning of Obama's second term,
                <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5736">
                 this legislation
                </a>
                was passed, hidden away in the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, and overturned the 1948 U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act (aka the Smith-Mundt Act), which had hitherto precluded the U.S. government from propagandizing its own citizens as though they were an enemy nation. In other words, it's now legal for the media to present fake stories as though they were true, including terror attacks. You're probably already aware of Project Mockingbird and the CIA ties of major media figures such as Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer. Interestingly enough, this legislation (HR 5736) was drafted several months before Sandy Hook and the 2013 NDAA which contained it was passed several months after.
               </p>
               <p>
                So in my opinion it all started with the Aurora shooting and Sandy Hook. Shit, I have to go for a second, I'm at work so I have to submit this comment or it might get deleted. I'll continue in a minute.

             That was a transparent hoax. Shocked, if anyone believes it, after looking at the facts. Om arm a teen's dad was later campaigning for Clinton, and described as an asset. I wonder, if there is a connection. I figure it would be similar types of people, involved in both of these crimes. And I figure that they are connected now, since we have a hoax done, to try and frame this story. Such see through efforts should be expected from these ghostly types of people, who would harm innocents. They are not very conscious or alive. They seem to be driven by wanting power over us, but really they do it because they are resisting life, like vampires do light. In the movies, when they find the head vampire, the rest are healed.

              They also use real events perpetrated by mind control victims. Omar seems to have fallen for that. Just my two cents.

               Om arm a teen had a strange kind of presence in that movie the oils spill one. It is hard to imagine it being possible, but if it is, then they are doing it. There is, incidentally, a drug scopamine that can turn people instantly submissive. it comes in powder form, and achieves its effect by being blown onto the victim. there is a painting of Bromovic doing this to a boy.

              No ambulances on the scene, "injured" person being loaded into a
              <em>
               pickup truck,
              </em>
              civilians carrying another "injured person" towards, not away from, the club, the terrible actress Christine Leinonen who never manages to actually cry but immediately starts talking about banning "assault weapons," the other obvious crisis actors, not to mention the absurdity of the alleged shooting where he called 911 to pledge his fealty to ISIS (give me a break) while performing an impossible feat.... then there's the question of how you sneak a long gun into a nightclub in the middle of the summer and how a club with 11 parking spaces can fit over 100 people in it.....

              And the Pulse shooting wasn't even the most obvious hoax of the past 8 years! They make these things so sloppy so we will pull our hair out in frustration and others will call us tin foil retards.

               I have experienced more grief, at losing my cat for the night (he came back the next morning) but while he was gone, I was inconsolable. they do not come anywhere near being realistic, these actors. I sometimes wonder, if it is their soul rebelling against what they are doing, by these obvious mistakes. lying, in truth, is impossible.. Only by accomodating it, can it ever get past the gate. Less and less people are accomodating it, thankfully, and it is becoming plain to see .

            Funny how every single MSM report goes out of their way to call it fake. Did they actually investigate these allegations? Of course they didn't, that's not what the media does. They parrot whatever propaganda their globalist masters tell them to. It's so fucking obvious how worthless they are.

             The only "proof" they have of it all being fake is an interview with James Alefantis himself denying everything and claiming to be a victim. He doesn't even attempt to explain why he is posting images of children with highly inappropriate remarks and why he is posting pornographic images on the account of his business marketed towards children. He even got caught in a blatant lie yet everything is fake of course.

              This community includes people from outside the country. I don't think it's hard to believe that people led to believe that a business is being abused by conspiracy theorists will express support on Facebook from around the U.S.
