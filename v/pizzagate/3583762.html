<p>At a dinner of mostly business stars hosted by Richard Caring, I was forced to ask: &quot;Who is the guy next to Richard?&quot; The restaurateur and clothing tycoon had Henry Wyndham, chairman of Sotheby\'s, on his right. But who was the bloke on his left, with whom he clearly enjoyed a close rapport? </p>
<p>&quot;That\'s Peter Dubens,&quot; came back the reply. &quot;Who?&quot; I asked. &quot;You\'ve never heard of Peter Dubens? You\'re kidding me.&quot; My informant murmured: &quot;Dubens is very smart. They all know him. Worth loads. Runs Oakley Capital, before that, Pipex. Serial entrepreneur.&quot; </p>
<p>...There is something irrepressible about Dubens. His father was a film producer (he made Modesty Blaise) and Dubens enjoyed the trappings of a rich family, being driven around in a convertible Bentley. Then, suddenly, it vanished. His mother was diagnosed with cancer and his father stopped filming in Italy and flew to be with her. She later died and his father never worked again.</p>
<p>He went to the Jewish Free School in North London. His first job was as a driver for Joe Lewis, the British billionaire, in London and the Bahamas. &quot;I\'d drive him around and sit with him all day — it was very good training.&quot;</p>

<p>So, let\'s get back to Peter Dubens.  Who is Peter Dubens? Note that in that first article they downplay his background and state “His first job was as a driver for Joe Lewis, the British billionaire, in London and the Bahamas. &quot;I\'d drive him around and sit with him all day — it was very good training.&quot;”</p>
<p>Joe Lewis?  You mean that main investor of the Tavistock Group and godd business partner with George Soros?  See: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2852400">UK Ping Pong, Football and that pizzagate scandal , Tavistock and George Soros</a></p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3328339">ALL of Rachel Chandler pics have been scrubbed from Getty Images. Well, the Chairman is connected to British intelligence, today\'s fire at Warner Bros. and the Maxwells..that means the EPSTEIN case</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, Peter Dubens\'s  father (Stanley) was a film producer on Modesty Blaise.. which takes us to:</p>
<p>From Mim Scala\'s book Diary of a Teddy Boy: A Memoir of the Long Sixties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/p5cTIi3">https://imgur.com/a/p5cTIi3</a> Stanley Dubens was a West End theatre agent and son of Harry Dubens also a West End agent. Stanley ran his agency above the Soho Snooker House on Frith Street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kenneth More\'s biography notes that Harry Dubens actively sought actors who had served at the front <a href="http://archive.is/d47t7">http://archive.is/d47t7</a> </p>
<p>Harry Dubens name also pops up on this dissertation on early children\'s television : Style, Space And Seriality In Early Children’s Television Drama: Puck Of Pook’s Hill, Five Children And It (BBC, 1951) and Man In Armour (1951–1954)  - <a href="http://repository.falmouth.ac.uk/3309/9/HJFRT%20Final%20Draft%202014.pdf">http://repository.falmouth.ac.uk/3309/9/HJFRT%20Final%20Draft%202014.pdf</a> </p>
<p>So, Harry Dubens worked with BBC Children\'s television producer Cecil Madden. <a href="http://archive.is/wip/WVyXW">http://archive.is/wip/WVyXW</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>..After D-Day, there were new opportunities for the BBC to supply a specially-tailored radio service to the armed forces. There were also new and potentially more explosive challenges. </p>
<p>In anticipation of the opening of a ‘Second Front’, Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) had been established in the autumn of 1943, with General Eisenhower in ultimate command.</p>
<p>SHAEF wanted a completely new broadcasting service that would accompany the hundreds of thousands of mostly American, British and Canadian troops as they pushed inland from Normandy. And it turned to the BBC for technical and editorial assistance.</p>
<p>One of those who was soon involved in making programmes for the AEF Programme was Cecil Madden, who’d been running the BBC’s Empire Variety Unit..</p>
<p>..In reality, there were profound and frequent disagreements behind-the-scenes over the new service: about whether or not the BBC was obliged to follow directives from the American psychological warfare teams based at SHAEF, as well as Britain’s own Political Warfare Executive, and – even more often – about whether the mix of programmes on offer was simply too British for the American troops. </p>
<p>..Considerable staff time was expended smoothing-over such disputes. By this stage, Malcolm Frost, who had previously set up the BBC’s Monitoring Service, worked for MI5 and planned the BBC’s deployment of reporters for D-Day, was working closely with General Eisenhower himself, providing top-level liaison between SHAEF and the BBC. </p>

           So, let's get back to Peter Dubens.  Who is Peter Dubens? Note that in that first article they downplay his background and state “His first job was as a driver for Joe Lewis, the British billionaire, in London and the Bahamas. "I'd drive him around and sit with him all day — it was very good training."”
          </p>
          <p>
           Joe Lewis?  You mean that main investor of the Tavistock Group and godd business partner with George Soros?  See:

            Stanley Dubens was a West End theatre agent and son of Harry Dubens also a West End agent. Stanley ran his agency above the Soho Snooker House on Frith Street.

           <p>
            ..After D-Day, there were new opportunities for the BBC to supply a specially-tailored radio service to the armed forces. There were also new and potentially more explosive challenges.
           </p>
           <p>
            In anticipation of the opening of a ‘Second Front’, Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) had been established in the autumn of 1943, with General Eisenhower in ultimate command.
           </p>
           <p>
            SHAEF wanted a completely new broadcasting service that would accompany the hundreds of thousands of mostly American, British and Canadian troops as they pushed inland from Normandy. And it turned to the BBC for technical and editorial assistance.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of those who was soon involved in making programmes for the AEF Programme was Cecil Madden, who’d been running the BBC’s Empire Variety Unit..
           </p>
           <p>
            ..In reality, there were profound and frequent disagreements behind-the-scenes over the new service: about whether or not the BBC was obliged to follow directives from the American psychological warfare teams based at SHAEF, as well as Britain’s own Political Warfare Executive, and – even more often – about whether the mix of programmes on offer was simply too British for the American troops.
           </p>
           <p>
            ..Considerable staff time was expended smoothing-over such disputes. By this stage, Malcolm Frost, who had previously set up the BBC’s Monitoring Service, worked for MI5 and planned the BBC’s deployment of reporters for D-Day, was working closely with General Eisenhower himself, providing top-level liaison between SHAEF and the BBC.

            Uhm nope Mr Wace.  From where I'm sitting that well connected generation just tries to keep their family histories and the true origins of their wealth on the down low.

            You might find this research from a few years ago of use, directly discusses ARK, etc, which is tied to Findhorn, the United Nations, and Luciferians:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@whitedeer9217/ra-anon-part-3-findhorn-1-2">
             Part 1: Findhorn (1/2)
            </a>
            - Discusses ARK, Busson, his familial connections to Haiti, ARK's direct relationship with the Clinton Foundation, etc. Also relates over to Tavistock, Huxley, and related figures.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@whitedeer9217/ra-anon-part-3-findorn-2-2">
             Part 2: Findhorn (2/2)
            </a>
            - Mostly focuses on occult and ritualistically abusive material associated with Findhorn, which was the campus in Scotland known as a hippie resort but which was founded by British military intelligence figures and which I speculate has been used for a training ground for luciferians/MKULTRA type activity.

            David Tabizel has been active for many years as an analyst and a creator and developer of businesses in the finance, media and technology sectors. He has the unique distinction of reputedly being the only British entrepreneur to conceive and co-found three UK companies that have achieved peak market capitalisations of over $1 billion.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1991 David jointly founded Durlacher plc, a technology specialist investment bank that achieved a market capitalisation in excess of $3 billion. Initially chief executive, David went on to head up the research division and was responsible for initiating many of Durlacher's largest corporate finance transactions between 1991 and 2000.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1995, with Mike Lynch, he co-founded &amp; financed Autonomy Corporation. The company subsequently became a global leader in knowledge management technology and initiated a series of major acquisitions that has driven it to its current position in the FTSE-100 with a market capitalisation ofapproximately $10.5 billion.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the 1990s David also co-founded 365 Corporation plc, an online publisher taken from start up to flotation in 2 years, achieving a peak stock market valuation of approximately $1 billion. 365 Corporation was a pioneer of digital publishing, creating a number of sports websites

             - an American multimillionaire accused of large-scale child sex abuse who committed suicide in his jail cell earlier this month. What has since become known as "Epstein's black book" contains the names, addresses and contact numbers of an endless list of celebrities, princes, CEOs, and athletes.
            </p>

             In Epstein's book the names of both Heineken, who died in 2002, and his daughter are not spelled quite right. The beer magnate himself is listed as 'Heineken, Mr. Fredie' on the same page as actor Dustin Hoffman. Gawker, the website that published the address book, blacked out actual addresses and contact numbers for privacy reasons. The redacted info under Heineken's name is an address Epstein used for the beer magnate in the French Riviera.
