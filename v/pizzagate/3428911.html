<p>In 2003, Mnuchin established the company SFM Capital Management together with <strong>George Soros</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2009, a group led by Mnuchin bought California-based residential lender IndyMac. One of the members of this group also was <strong>George Soros</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="md-section-4"></h1>
<p>A deep rabbit hole that needs to be looked into is Mnuchin\'s work as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin">film producer</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mnuchin teamed up with filmmaker <strong>Brett Ratner</strong> and Australian businessman James Packer to merge his Dune Entertainment company with Ratner and Packer\'s newly founded RatPac Entertainment joint venture; resulting in RatPac-Dune Entertainment, which then struck a financing deal with Warner Bros.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 1995 and 2014, [Mnuchin] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin">donated</a> over $120,000 to political organizations, PACs, politicians, and political parties.

<h2 id="md-steven-mnuchins-mysterious-link-to-jeffrey-epsteins-fellow-sex-trafficker-jean-luc-brunel">Steven Mnuchin’s \'Mysterious Link\' to Jeffrey Epstein\'s fellow sex trafficker Jean-Luc Brunel</h2>
<p><strong>The treasury secretary’s name <a href="http://archive.fo/7vemQ">shows up</a> on official records for a company formed in the 1980s by Jeffrey Epstein’s close friend, the model scout Jean-Luc Brunel.</strong></p>
<p>In the late 1980s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin served in an official capacity for a business run by one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most infamous associates. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>**In official records, Mnuchin is listed as the official state point of contact for Next Management Corporation, a company formed in 1988 by modeling-industry insiders Jean-Luc Brunel and Arnaud Brunel. </p>
<p>At the time, Jean-Luc Brunel had just been the subject of a 60 Minutes documentary accusing him of drugging and raping at least three models. Later, he would be accused by two women of supplying girls to Epstein to be sexually abused. (Brunel has denied the allegations.)**</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Records list Mnuchin as the New York Department of State process for <strong>Next Management Corporation</strong>. According to department officials, the DOS process is the person who files a company’s registration papers and receives lawsuits and other official documents on their behalf—usually a lawyer or some other legal representative.</p>
<p>A Treasury Department official said Mnuchin did not know he was listed as the DOS process for <strong>Next Management Corp.</strong> before the newspaper inquiry. He said it was “not clear” how Mnuchin wound up serving in that role and added that the secretary did not recall ever meeting either Brunel brother and has never done business with either of them. </p>
<h1 id="md-section-7"></h1>
<p>Mnuchin’s office did confirm that he was longtime friends with <strong>Faith Kates</strong>, the owner of <strong>Next modeling agency</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>The Brunel brothers co-founded the Next agency with Kates in 1989</strong>, and their company, Next Management Corp., owned a 25 percent stake in the agency for several years. The address listed under Mnuchin’s name in State Department records is the first address for Kates’ company, <strong>Next Management Company</strong>.</p>
<p>Kates denies any involvement with setting up <strong>Next Management Corporation</strong> and said she had nothing to do with Mnuchin serving as the DOS process. </p>
<p>“Ms. Kates was never involved with <strong>Next Management Corp.</strong> in any way,” a spokesperson said. “Given that, she never designated anyone, including Sec. Mnuchin, to be a DOS process or any officer or director of <strong>Next Management Corp.</strong></p>
<p>The spokesperson added that Kates’ agency sued <strong>Next Management Corp.</strong> 25 years ago, over allegations that the Brunel brothers had “raided” the agency, and said Kates has not had any contact with them since then. </p>
<p>She said Kates had “no knowledge” of why her company’s address was listed in official records for Next Management Corp.</p>
<h1 id="md-section-8"></h1>
<p>Kates has her own connections to Epstein. Former employees say the financier regularly dropped in on the agency’s New York offices, and tax filings show he donated tens of thousands of dollars to charities connected to Kates and her family. At least two former Next models have been romantically linked to Epstein, and a third appears in his infamous address book. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Kates said neither she nor the <strong>Next agency</strong> had any business or financial ties to Epstein and that Kates never introduced the financier to any models.</p>
<p>Mnuchin has been friends with Kates for approximately 30 years, according to the Treasury Department official, and once helped Kates set up a business “as a friend.” A spokesperson for Kates confirmed the two had been friendly for decades. She said Mnuchin had offered Kates business advice when she started Next Management Company and served as her real estate broker.</p>
<p>Mnuchin’s spokesperson said the secretary had no ownership in any of Kates’ businesses or served them in any business capacity.</p>
<h1 id="md-section-9"></h1>
<p><em>Flight records show Brunel flew on the financier’s private plane more than 20 times between 1999 and 2005, and house staff said in depositions that the modeling agent was a regular presence at Epstein’s Palm Beach estate. When Epstein was arrested in 2008, Brunel visited him nearly 70 times in jail.</em></p>
<p><em>One of Epstein’s first public accusers, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), says Epstein forced her to sleep with Brunel and many other powerful men in the years he kept her as his “sex slave.” She also accused Brunel of using his modeling industry connections to supply Epstein and other wealthy men with foreign girls to abuse.</em></p>
<p><em>A former bookkeeper for one of Brunel’s agencies told the FBI in 2010 that Brunel used the company to bring in teenage models from around the world, and housed them in Epstein’s Upper East Side apartments. The bookkeeper claimed the girls were loaned out to wealthy clients.</em></p>',

           Steven Mnuchin’s 'Mysterious Link' to Jeffrey Epstein's fellow sex trafficker Jean-Luc Brunel

            </a>
            on official records for a company formed in the 1980s by Jeffrey Epstein’s close friend, the model scout Jean-Luc Brunel.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           In the late 1980s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin served in an official capacity for a business run by one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most infamous associates.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            **In official records, Mnuchin is listed as the official state point of contact for Next Management Corporation, a company formed in 1988 by modeling-industry insiders Jean-Luc Brunel and Arnaud Brunel.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time, Jean-Luc Brunel had just been the subject of a 60 Minutes documentary accusing him of drugging and raping at least three models. Later, he would be accused by two women of supplying girls to Epstein to be sexually abused. (Brunel has denied the allegations.)**
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Records list Mnuchin as the New York Department of State process for
           <strong>
            Next Management Corporation
           </strong>
           . According to department officials, the DOS process is the person who files a company’s registration papers and receives lawsuits and other official documents on their behalf—usually a lawyer or some other legal representative.
          </p>
          <p>
           A Treasury Department official said Mnuchin did not know he was listed as the DOS process for
           <strong>
            Next Management Corp.
           </strong>
           before the newspaper inquiry. He said it was “not clear” how Mnuchin wound up serving in that role and added that the secretary did not recall ever meeting either Brunel brother and has never done business with either of them.
          </p>
          <h1 id="md-section-7">
          </h1>
          <p>
           Mnuchin’s office did confirm that he was longtime friends with
           <strong>
            Faith Kates
           </strong>
           , the owner of
           <strong>
            Next modeling agency
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The Brunel brothers co-founded the Next agency with Kates in 1989
           </strong>
           , and their company, Next Management Corp., owned a 25 percent stake in the agency for several years. The address listed under Mnuchin’s name in State Department records is the first address for Kates’ company,
           <strong>
            Next Management Company
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Kates denies any involvement with setting up
           <strong>
            Next Management Corporation
           </strong>
           and said she had nothing to do with Mnuchin serving as the DOS process.
          </p>
          <p>
           “Ms. Kates was never involved with
           <strong>
            Next Management Corp.
           </strong>
           in any way,” a spokesperson said. “Given that, she never designated anyone, including Sec. Mnuchin, to be a DOS process or any officer or director of
           <strong>
            Next Management Corp.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The spokesperson added that Kates’ agency sued
           <strong>
            Next Management Corp.
           </strong>
           25 years ago, over allegations that the Brunel brothers had “raided” the agency, and said Kates has not had any contact with them since then.
          </p>
          <p>
           She said Kates had “no knowledge” of why her company’s address was listed in official records for Next Management Corp.
          </p>
          <h1 id="md-section-8">
          </h1>
          <p>
           Kates has her own connections to Epstein. Former employees say the financier regularly dropped in on the agency’s New York offices, and tax filings show he donated tens of thousands of dollars to charities connected to Kates and her family. At least two former Next models have been romantically linked to Epstein, and a third appears in his infamous address book.
          </p>
          <p>
           A spokesperson for Kates said neither she nor the
           <strong>
            Next agency
           </strong>
           had any business or financial ties to Epstein and that Kates never introduced the financier to any models.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mnuchin has been friends with Kates for approximately 30 years, according to the Treasury Department official, and once helped Kates set up a business “as a friend.” A spokesperson for Kates confirmed the two had been friendly for decades. She said Mnuchin had offered Kates business advice when she started Next Management Company and served as her real estate broker.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mnuchin’s spokesperson said the secretary had no ownership in any of Kates’ businesses or served them in any business capacity.

           <em>
            Flight records show Brunel flew on the financier’s private plane more than 20 times between 1999 and 2005, and house staff said in depositions that the modeling agent was a regular presence at Epstein’s Palm Beach estate. When Epstein was arrested in 2008, Brunel visited him nearly 70 times in jail.

           <em>
            One of Epstein’s first public accusers, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), says Epstein forced her to sleep with Brunel and many other powerful men in the years he kept her as his “sex slave.” She also accused Brunel of using his modeling industry connections to supply Epstein and other wealthy men with foreign girls to abuse.

           <em>
            A former bookkeeper for one of Brunel’s agencies told the FBI in 2010 that Brunel used the company to bring in teenage models from around the world, and housed them in Epstein’s Upper East Side apartments. The bookkeeper claimed the girls were loaned out to wealthy clients.

            Well to (capture/own) bad thoughts is clearly a good business.....isnt that a picture of humans own mirror. To promote/act and build bad behavior for unbelievers well... who will fall? You will PAY for your own destruction in every way possible. Money is and will always be a tool for control (mind) for they who will never reach a higher thought in life. Life will always be a struggle and with billions on YOUR account YOU are not in the game. It aint no escaping///every action is scaled.

             In the mid 1990s, Paolo Zampolli founded ID Models in New York City. The agency operated until 2008 when Zampolli divested from various fashion-based businesses he owned and operated. He went on to form a partnership with the Trump Organization as Director of International Development.

             2012 Ron Burkle Talks Ryan Kavanaugh (Relativity Media)  And Harvey Weinstein To The New Yorker
            </a>
            link to New Yorker piece in the article
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Burkle received all of Relativity as collateral for his most recent investment of a “couple of hundred of millions of dollars” – and that Burkle, not Kavanaugh, is now calling the shots at Relativity. It also speculates in the future Kavanaugh goes out and Weinstein comes in..
            </p>
            <p>
             Kavanaugh agreed to dramatic concessions. At this moment, Burkle appeared, and in a familiar guise: a fierce opportunist, cloaked in benevolence. Colbeck Capital, a New York firm that he helped establish, negotiated the deal with Kavanaugh, Burkle said: a fifty-million-dollar loan, followed by others. “Ryan was fair with us on one deal, and we liked the math and the structure and the security,” Burkle said.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...One popular Hollywood theory is that Burkle will eventually fire Kavanaugh and most of the Relativity employees, put Harvey Weinstein in charge, and call the merged entities the Weinstein Company.

            Mnuchin was co-chairman of the trio's movie company, Relativity Media
           </p>
           <p>
            Ryan Kavanaugh was the founder of Relativity Media

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Kavanaugh founded Relativity Media after briefly serving as a consultant to other small businesses and venture capitalists.[4] In the late 1990s, he asked his father for a $50,000 loan to start his own hedge fund; his father declined, but this did not dissuade Ryan, whose aim was to use mathematical tools to connect financing and movie projects in a more efficient manner than traditional Hollywood finance. At Relativity, he created what is now known as "the model", a monte carlo model designed to predict the odds of a given film being successful. No film at Relativity is given a green light unless the model predicts a high probability of profitability. During Relativity's first year of operation, Kavanaugh executed what was considered to be an innovative finance deal for Marvel Studios which led them to create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Kavanaugh went on to structure business deals for such companies as: Sony, Universal, Warner Brothers, among many others. Kavanaugh has acquired a number of assets, including the marketing and distribution operations of John Malone's Liberty Media/Starz film unit Overture Films, and reaching a first of its kind TV pay deal with Netflix.[4]
            </p>
            <p>
             Kavanaugh forged a marketing, promotional, and production partnership with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Mobile and Virgin Produced, in which Relativity owns a stake. Kavanaugh also brokered an innovative cross-platform marketing partnership with Clear Channel Radio, the media company with the most reach in the United States. He was also instrumental in launching Relativity's historic partnership with China's Huaxia Film Distribution Co. Ltd. to become equal partners in Sky Land Entertainment with private-equity firm SAIF Partners and IDG China Media to handle production and distribution of films in China and U.S. This marks the first strategic alliance between a Hollywood film production entity and a Chinese government-sponsored company.[citation needed]
            </p>
            <p>
             Relativity has produced, distributed, and/or structured financing for more than 200 motion pictures, generating more than $17 billion in worldwide box office revenue and earning 60 Oscar nominations.[3][18] In 2012, Kavanaugh brokered a deal in which billionaire Ron Burkle will partner with Relativity and invest $800 million in the company.[19] As Chairman and the largest shareholder, Kavanaugh will retain control of Relativity and control the majority of the board of directors of Relativity.[20] In 2013, Relativity Media expanded into television (Relativity Television), Sports Management (Relativity Sports) and Digital Content (Relativity Digital), with the aim of leverage divisions to create a global media company.[5]
            </p>
            <p>
             On July 30, 2015, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[21] Kavanaugh stepped down as CEO at the end of 2016.[22] In May 2018 the company filed for bankruptcy a second time.[22]

            So connections to Marvel Studios and to China, and to Richard Branson.  Recall too that Soros, and the Obama's have recent ties to Netflix (if I recall correctly) and Netflix has a pedo normalizing line up since then.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Kavanaugh was 21st on Fortune's 40 Under 40 Most Influential People in Business in 2010[32] and in Forbes' Future 400: Ones To Watch. He was named a "Top Thinker" by Esquire.[1][30] He also serves on the boards of other charitable foundations such as Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors and as Chairman of The Art of Elysium.[33]

            Any connection to Eva Dubin's charity?  His philanthropic focus has been for dogs (animals), and his "dedication to inner-city young people;[40] and by First Star for his dedication to improving life for child victims of abuse and neglect."
