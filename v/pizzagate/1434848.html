<p>For example, say someone is looking into some of the live bands that play at Comet Ping Pong (or anywhere, for that matter).  What I\'ve seen is TONS of YouTube comments going &quot;ZOMG you pedophiles are goin\' down!!!111  We\'re onto you!&quot;  All that does is encourage these people to delete everything or make their profiles private!  We\'ve already seen a ton of Instagram profiles become private, including people affiliated with JimmyComet.  This only makes evidence gathering more difficult for all of us.  It effectively makes our cause look like a bunch of immature mob-mentality lunatics on a stupid witch hunt with no merit.</p>
<p>Here\'s what I think is a better strategy:  For us to not make our presence known.  Think like a detective or investigative journalist.  Gather the evidence or what you think is evidence or could be a clue or person of interest.  Take the screenshots, capture the original URL details, use archive systems, but DON\'T make your presence known!  1)  It\'s inflammatory and counterproductive and makes us look like tools, and 2)  It encourages them to freak out and hide or go away.</p>
<p>Example:  In a past life, I had a very minor role in law enforcement efforts.  Most of the communications between the police officers, sheriff deputies, firefighters, EMS, etc. was done using their cell phones or over the radio system (which the public could monitor with scanners and radios), but all the drug busts?  Those were secret.  When the SWAT team was geared up and scheduled to go to 123 Main Street for suspicion of meth/heroin/whatever, they used a completely different radio system that was encrypted and unavailable to the public.  Because guess what?  If the drug dealers got tipped off in advance that the cops were coming, they\'d flush all the drugs down the toilet, burn all their paper materials, take their cash and equipment, hop in their cars and GTFO.  Evidence gone.  Drug bust hampered.  Now suspects are scattered all over town on the highway instead of all in one place.  And boom.  The SWAT team woke up at 3 AM for nothing because some moron was sloppy and tipped off the bad guys.</p>
<p>So my suggestion to those who are willing to follow this advice:  Be more mature, professional, SECRET, and DISCRETE in your investigatory efforts.  Don\'t leave ANY comments on people\'s social media pages.  Now sure, engaging in discussions on, say news articles related to Pizzagate?  Sure.  But screaming out &quot;YOU PEDOS!&quot; on someone\'s Instagram or YouTube?  Stahp.</p>',

            This is a pretty damn good point, as much as making noise about the subject is good in some ways it has to be done in a sense that rattles the cage but doesnt make then clean house so to speak. 
They have to sit in their ivory tower and think it'll all blow over only to find the bowels of the internet are about to spray shit all over their plans. 
If people want to jump on the bandwagon do it by joining voat 2 days ago &amp; comment spammimg here like me haha, but not on the peoples youtube, facebook, or any social media that might raise unnecessary alarms right?
