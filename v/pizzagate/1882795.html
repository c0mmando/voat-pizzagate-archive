They\'re ready to debauch, defile and desecrate a holy and sacred site-- Loz Feliz Convent, owned by the Immaculate Heart of Mary sisters, who pooled their money to purchase the property in 1972. They ran retreats, did charity work and built up a multi-million dollar business. Sister Callanan and Sister Holzman worked hard to ensure that the property didn\'t end up in the hands of illuminati <a href="https://www.ecr.co.za/coca-cola-top-40/katy-perry-met-gala-dress-compared-satanic-bride/">wife-of-satan Katy Perry</a>, but it seems that Archbishop Gomez is starstruck--and the fact he has millions to pay in damages for victims of pedophile priests-- and has decided to pull rank. He has insisted that Perry get the convent.  Seriously, has the archbishop seen ANY of her videos?.  
</p>
<p>Perry, in an effort to butter up the sisters, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4293564/Nuns-fight-disgusting-Katy-Perry-sale-convent.html">turned up</a> and sang them a song--Oh Happy Day.  Except that she had to look up the words to the song on her phone.  She told the sisters that the convent was a good place to \'find herself\'.  She boasted that she had a tattoo of Jesus on her arm.  Sister Callanan has said that she wanted to ask her what kind of tattoo she had on her backside.  The nuns asked Katy why she attended the Witches Walk in Salem. Perry remarked that she couldn\'t recall whether she did. Sister Callanan replied, \'Come on, you didn\'t know you were at a witchcraft thing?\'  The nuns also asked why Perry had stated she had \'sold her soul to the devil\'.  Again Perry\'s memory seems to have failed her and she said she couldn\'t recall making the comment.  The nuns remarked that some of the things that Perry does are \'disgusting\'.</p>
<p>The nuns checked Perry\'s videos and saw all the homages to satan and decided they would prefer to sell to Dana Hollister, a restaurateur.  Hollister paid a deposit and moved into the convent.  Recently Perry\'s \'people\' turned up to the property and Hollister had to call authorities to get rid of them. The matter has now gone to court with the judge ruling that it\'s not for the nuns to sell to Hollister. The nuns have vowed to take it to the Vatican.</p>
<p>The Satanists will be revelling in this <a href="http://laist.com/2015/06/30/photos_katy_perry_wants_to_buy_this.php">place</a> built on 8 acres with views over LA--a villa, replete with stained-glass windows, a pipe organ, and a main room with 30-foot ceilings. It\'s absolutely [beautiful].(<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2017-05-18/for-surfers-indonesia-has-never-been-better">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2017-05-18/for-surfers-indonesia-has-never-been-better)</a>)</p>
<p>As a sidenote, Loz Feliz was used to shelter priests accused of molestation.  It\'s pretty clear that Archbishop Gomez wants Perry\'s money to pay the agreed $660 million settlement with more than 500 alleged clergy-abuse victims and hundreds of millions in damages and legal fees. </p>
<p>All properties sold for more than $20 million need the approval of the Vatican.  Perry\'s offer is $14.5 million. Hollister\'s offer was $15.5 million (so even from a profit point-of-view, Hollister\'s is the better bid).  Years ago the sisters had been <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/6738125/katy-perry-real-estate-battle-nuns-catholic-church-los-angeles-property">told</a>that the estate was worth at least $21 million.  If Archbishop Gomez were to sell the property for its true value, it would need the approval of the Vatican.  No wonder he wants to sell it for far less than its worth.</p>
<p>Said Hollister of <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/6738125/katy-perry-real-estate-battle-nuns-catholic-church-los-angeles-property">Perry</a>: “It’s interesting she has all this girl power and she’s running over a woman and five nuns.” Sister Holzman, meanwhile, vows to continue the fight. “I owe it to every sister up in Heaven looking down on me.”  
</p>
<p>It\'s absolutely disgusting that Katy Perry, who calls herself a feminist, is willing to ride roughshod over ailing, frail and elderly nuns, who\'ve done nothing but serve the community for their entire lives. She\'s used every resource at her disposal--and considering she\'s wealthy, she has many resources--to bully and intimidate nuns who have no power, and little money.   Katy Perry--go elsewhere and find someplace other than Loz Feliz for your illuminati and satanist rituals, orgies and sex magick, where children are tortured, abused and murdered, slowly and painfully, and then dismembered and eaten.</p>',

            I don't tweet.  So someone please comply.  This is one of the most nastiest things done to Sisters.   WTH is going on down there.  We should keep abreast of this for sure.  We should antagonize Perry for sure.  Stealing from Sisters Women of the Cloth.  With all her money she is cheating the Nuns? Shame Perry.
