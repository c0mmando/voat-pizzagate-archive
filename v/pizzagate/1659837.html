            This is what Prescott Bush was doing in France. Worked as a handler for these poor sods. I found it in a French WW1 archive many years ago. Should have taken a picture.

             Miltary intel used tortured prisoners for high risk suicide missions in WW1 - what use for tortured kids ?
            </p>
            <p>
             with regard to the use of torture and trauma based brainwashing to control 'intel assets' and its possible connection to torture of children in Pizzagate:
            </p>
            <p>
             Eastern State Penitentiary inmates and Kingston Penitentiary inmates and tortured psychiatric patients were used to storm the German front lines in the Battle of Passchendaele and the Battle of Vimy Ridge in WW1
            </p>
            <p>
             Group psychology experiments conducted by the military elite using psychiatric patients in the Civil War confirmed that an army regiment needed only one or two suicidally-programmed psychotic individuals to lead an entire regiment into what amounted to certain death, accompanied by coercion from the rear (threats of reprisals, court martials, accusations of 'desertion' and imprisonment or even execution by firing squad if they displayed cowardice and did not 'follow the leader' at the front.)
            </p>
            <p>
             No one told them that the 'brave guys' leading the way at the front had been tortured for years in a coffin at Kingston Penitentiary and electroshocked at Rockwood, or buried alive at places like Eastern State Penitentiary and probably countless other institutions in 'preparation' for the big day.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further , preliminary , ongoing (developing) research suggests that at least some, if not many , of the prisoners used in this capacity had been trained soldiers before being imprisoned, such as is the case with Eastern State Penitentiary inmate Harry F Gangewere, who was a dishonorably discharged soldier prior to spending ten years at Eastern State Penitentiary and then being sent into battle on the front line trenches of WW1.

             a place very similar to Eastern State Penitentiary in Austria, with very similar isolation cells, said to have been a prison for soldiers known as the Narrenturm

             "The five floors of the tower were divided into their separate departments. All the patients on the first floor were soldiers - or the so-called ‘military insane’."

            </p>
            <p>
             The Narrenturm was built in Vienna about, roughly, the same time that Eastern State Penitentiary
            </p>
            <p>
             was built , and Benjamin Franklin had dealings with its builder Emperor Joseph II. He played chess with him when visiting him in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which could have been the genesis of Franklin's idea to build Eastern State Penitentiary
            </p>
            <p>
             along similar lines.
            </p>
            <p>
             The implications then are that Eastern State Penitentiary may have intentionally imprisoned and tortured already-trained soldiers , for later use in suicide missions, and that the Germanic nations Germany/Austria were doing the same thing at the Narrenturm.
            </p>
            <p>
             So WW1 and WW2 may have been planned genocides , using suicidally-programmed individuals on both sides. Essentially guaranteeing the mutual destruction of both sides.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you find this interesting, could you help research this? For example, can you find out whether Eastern State Penitentiary had an entire ward or wing to house 'criminals' from the military? Kingston Penitentiary is factually documented to have had a section reserved for incarceration and punishment of Canadian soldiers.

              Germany was definitely doing the same. Training men like Ernst Junger. Early mind control is all over his books.
             </p>
             <p>
              But the program likely involved many if not all of the entire upper strata of the later Nazi Party esp the SS.
             </p>
             <p>
              Incidentally Junger also was one of the first people to use LSD, being a friend of Albert Hoffmann.

             The feminists have used the 'men are war-like idiots' mantra  to discredit men since WW1.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Look at  those violent, hysteria-driven male fanatics killing each other in the millions! WOMEN have to take control over from these morons or we will all die!"
            </p>
            <p>
             "Men are testosterone-poisoned morons."
            </p>
            <p>
             That is exactly the sort of feminist propaganda which our social-engineeering universities have been BLEATING INCESSANTLY at teen college girls for 100 years now.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the feminists  only knew the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which is that 100% of the war dead were either bribed or  DRAFTED (forced)
to go to their deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
             Worse, most humans do not wish to kill, or to be killed by, other humans.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the indescribably evil means by which these massive war casualties were brought about will never be told to same feminists.
            </p>
            <p>
             No one will tell them that 100% of the young male soldiers were HORRIFIED by what they were being forced into.
            </p>
            <p>
             No one will tell them that the men leading the charge at the front were the 'walking dead', men who faced being returned to prisons with coffin sized isolation cells and being tortured in coffins , etc. , if they didn't lead the charge.

               then there are the  poor DRAFTED Vietnam veterans , many of whom returned home after risking their lives,  to survive hell on earth, only to be met with the scorn of hippie feminists.
              </p>
              <p>
               Only to return to communities which were , increasingly, 'closed to males', essentially. 
Fake 'male serial killer' psy-ops, radical feminist agendas, etc., meant that returning to America meant mass unemployment and cultural ostracism.
Second class citizen status for the 'violent, dirty males' basically.. No education. Returning to 'war footing ' urban economies engineered to function increasingly without men. A nation going berserk in its haste to de-industrialize and transfer all jobs to Japan, Taiwan, and Korea.
A cult of feminists taught that males have all the advantages due to their gender, and that any man who was poor was surely only poor due to his own laziness and immorality.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then the added insult  of 'cultural marxism' thrown  in, with the white feminists taught to despise their own race and to worship blacks, and the black feminists constantly told that black men are useless, violent sluts.
