<p>&quot;This is pizzagate related to that the same Globalist Elites behind trafficking, that are trying to shift the focus and trying to divide the american people. Craig Sawyer is a Ex. Navy Seal and has a organisation called &quot;Vets4Childrescue&quot; They are in the productions of making a video on pizzagate/pedogate. The best about this guy, is that if he knows whats going on.. then all the Navy Seal knows.. These guys are as brothers.. and you don´t mess with these guys.</p>

<p>I encourage you to listen to Hagmann report´s interview with Craig. Sep 20, 2017 (link below)</p>

            The last target on 9-11 was the White House.  Then they sent in Barry Hussein.  He spent 8 years attacking 9-1-1 as his handlers dictated.

            Isn't kneeling normally a sign of respect?  It is in Game of Thrones anyway 🙄
           </p>
           <p>
            And isn't this kind of kneeling a peaceful protest?  Now we are against peaceful protest?
           </p>
           <p>
            If we can pretend the flag represents the criminal pseudo government, would you have enough respect to even kneel for it right now?
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you people even listened to our real troops who come home as addicts and complain they NEVER would have gone to war had they known the facts?

            Geez, maybe I don't feel like putting my hand over my heart in some sick worship ritual to a piece of cloth.  A cloth that represents the dead of millions and millions of people because we couldn't just fucken get along.

             Some of us are against disrespecting our country, propagating a false BLM narrative and generally acting like an idiot. Yes this is a peacefull protest. A peaceful protest founded on a lie and fueled by the same financial elements that hide pizzagate, pedogate and everything else. Maybe you should watch a Kris Paronto video or two.

              My grandmother lived in a time when blacks had to sit at the back of the bus.  So why don't you try putting down the videos and talking to an old person or two.

              Yes, I believe "BLM" is a propaganda tool used by the elite, but it works because it is based in truth.

            What lame and paranoid writing with no one shown as having written it?

            One has only to look at the photo of the NFL players to see why Trump is attacking them
and the NFL.
           </p>
           <p>
            We see over and again that the right wing has absolutely no respect for the 
right of all Americans to peaceful protest.  In fact, the interference with protests
was what finally triggered the first Revolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            The flag is merely a SYMBOL of our inalienable rights -- which means natural rights
of human beings whether or not a government exists to protect a Constitution which
which acknowledges those rights.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are rights which our soldiers die for every day -- and which are being
overturned by the right wing -- or attacked by the right wing.

             No, it's about paid employees protesting thus making it a corporate sanctioned display.  Protests are done by individuals either independently, or coming together as a group.  Not when I am paying for a fucking service on my dime.

             Leftists are out bashing skulls with bike locks and you are accusing the sold-out right?  As long we continue to pretend that there is a fundamental difference between the parties, as long as we play into their divisive diversionary tactics, we all lose.

             Take the gay marriage issue.  Had it been put forth as a sharing of assets and rights equal to that of marriage, no conservative would have balked.  Wasn't that the stated goal?  If I work for a pension and wish, upon death, to share it with my same-sex partner, that's something no one would have disagreed with.  But no, it was framed within bigotry and fear and forced the redefining of the traditional meaning of marriage.  Thus, it attacked traditional values and the definition of family and THAT was the entire purpose of the weaponized version we saw of it.  Gays could have cared less for the nomenclature, until some of them were led to outrage by those wishing to instigate and further the cultural Marxism agenda.  The rest had no choice but to join in, as no other opportunity was being put forth for legal recognition.  But then, I'm sure you're already well aware of all that.

              Kapaernick is an individual and other individuals have followed him -- 
and as an opponent of corrupt government, MIC/CIA/NSA/CFR, warmongering, illegal wars of aggression, the lack of National Health Care for All, attacks on social programs ....racism, sexism, homophobia ... I will be another INDIVIDUAL who will be sitting it out given the next opportunity where the anthem or flag are presented to be honored.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you're talking about the fakery of the LEFT attack -- possibly as "Anti-Fa" -- that's as fake as all the other false flag events we've seen over last decades and more.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is the right wing which is violent as it is the only way the right can rise ... by violence, deception and stolen elections.  And that's always been true of the right wing -- and it's still true today.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is no difference between both parties -- they are both owned by Elites/wealthy.
Our entire government is corrupt, criminal and murderous.

              The gay rights issue was framed in the "bigotry" which Christianity has presented it as an "abomination" for more than 2,000 years.  Male-supremacist religion -- organized patriarchal religion -- underpins not only Elite Patriarchy ...but male-supremacy.
             </p>
             <p>
              How has any heterosexual's marriage been harmed by Gay marriage?
             </p>
             <p>
              "Traditional" values are well recognized as male-supremacist/Elitist values which have long governed our lives to oppress native people, people of color, women, children and homosexuals.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you're supporting the teachings of organized patriarchal religions, then you were taught the lies you are living -- 
i.e., that homosexuals are an abomination.  Time to work out of that brainwashing.

               They are paid to a job as professionals.  It is their profession.  One doesn't protest while practicing their profession, it is an abuse of their position which they hold by right of the paying ticketholders to try and proselytize them instead of performing their jobs.

               Fakery?  False flag?  It was only through the massive digging by the internet that Eric Clanton was unmasked.  The evidence must be pretty damning for him to get charged in liberal Berkeley, a town where the mayor is tied to an organization supporting Antifa.

               It's the Left which attacks and spits on the Right.  It's not safe to wear an innocuous MAGA hat and expect to not be molested, even though it simply stands for returning the nation around towards economic freedom and restoration of the middle-class which has been decimated through liberal policies.

               You obvious either didn't grasp my illustration, or do not wish to, regarding Gay marriage.  Gays as individuals wanted legal equality and recognition, not to redefine marriage.  I don't pull that out of my ass, but directly from three Gay couples I am close friends with.  No other option was presented to them.  Had it, they would have received it gladly.
              </p>

               Males are superior to females in many regards.  To ignore that and say it is antiquated doesn't make it any less of a reality.  A plethora of studies show women are happier in a traditional role, but that wouldn't interest you, as you'd be certain they were Stockholm victims of the patriarchy.
              </p>
              <p>
               Really, we don't have much to discuss.  Your either a shill (and I rarely use that term), or a brainwashed subject of Marxist indoctrination.  Either way, I see little benefit in wasting my time with you, particularly on a remote thread where it cannot even benefit the observer.

                What's the likelihood, however, that if it were a right wing protest against Affirmative Action
for AA's or women that you'd be all in favor of it?

               <p>
                You haven't actually read enough about that false flag event -- both sides were bused in together.
Anti-fa is a fake organization having nothing to do with the left and it's violence is one more sign of that reality.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is the right wing which rises on violence, stolen elections, deception, propaganda of lies and the history of that is clear.
If you are talking about genocide vs the native people here and stealing of their land, it is right wing/Elites.
If its the system of slavery here, it's the right wing Elites/wealthy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Our citizens create our economies which are then manipulated by our banks and financial institutions for the benefit of Elites/right wing.  The Middle Class are being wiped out by Elites/wealthy because after the fall of the Berlin Wall a middle class was no longer needed here as a model of our capitalist economy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Royals morphed into corporations -- 
It is corporations where Elites/wealthy are united in control of our now corrupt government and it is corporations/capitalists who have been destroying economies and jobs for the middle class.
It is corporations who have put 25 million and more out of work in America.
                <br/>
                Corporations who control our government who destroyed Unemployment insurance.
Corporations/Elite who control both of our political parties.

                We haven't had a liberal president in the White House since the coup on JFK ... also by the right wing.
And if you think LBJ was a liberal you are confused.  This is a man who together with Bobby Bakker had set up prostitutes in hotel rooms to blackmail other members of Congress.  This is a man who had his own personal murderer in Malcolm Wallace.  Read something about LBJ.  LBJ was "Mastermind"  of the coup on JFK, likely with Allen Dulles.
Check out Madeleine Brown for the long list of the conspirators who met at Clint Murchinson's/OIL home the evening before the assassination.  No "liberals" among them.  Nor is the OIL industry liberal.
               </p>
               <p>
                Our right wing Congress, btw, has done nothing but try to stop the minimal economic recovery which began two years before Obama left office.  Obama is now off to Wall Street to pick up his wear for 8 years of economic destruction and wars and letting the banks off the hook for what was actually a new depression.
               </p>

                You have no point on gay marriage.  Homosexuals seek long term adult relationships with other adult homosexuals, same as heterosexuals do.  Naturally, that also leads to marriage.  Often they intend to have families, as well.
Maybe heterosexuals will give up marriage and simply settle for your "illustration" ... legal equality and recognition?
               </p>
               <p>
                Males are the weaker sex, but they were capable of the violence which it took to overturn women and to turn the world upside down.  More males children die in spontaneous abortion and up to the age of about two, and males die earlier than women.  Ask any doctor who withstands pain better -- males or females and they will tell you FEMALES.
They only way males because "superior" was through violence and oppression  -- and the oppression of women all over the world still by male violence continues on.  Or are you denying that, as well?
               </p>
               <p>
                You're correct -- we have very little to discuss -- but wherever I see nonsense as you're posting, there will be debate.

            Actually, "takeaknee" is uniting the nation against racism and murder of "Blacks"
which we've seen happening so often in the streets of America over the last decades.
           </p>

            This is a liberal nation which is against US/CIA illegal wars of aggression, against the
lawless CIA of MKULTRA and NSA spying on citizens 24/7 -- and citizens were against
these wars and US/CIA warmongering even before the wars happened.
Recall the sentiments after 9/11:  "
            <strong>
             Do not use our grief and sorrow to create war."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            What too many do not understand is that labels no longer mean anything.
There is NO liberal Democratic Party ... it is merely a party serving the interests of 
corporations/wealthy.  Same for Soros.  Same for the Clintons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both of our political parties are owned by Elites/wealthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Forget labels -- watch what they are actually doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who is involved in moving 40 million people off of medical care isn't
a liberal.  They're right wing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone pushing wars by the US/CIA isn't a liberal -- they're right wing.
           </p>
           <p>
            It also looks like W told us the story when he called these wars a "Crusade" ....
US/CIA has murdered at the least 1 million Muslims.

             What you have to understand is that both parties are owned by Elites/wealthy --
However, Elites exist to overpower one another and sometimes they take different
roads to the same destinations -- but it's always about power and control over citizens,
the nation's wealth and natural resources.

             Disregard labels -- Democrat hasn't mean liberal since the death of FDR
and the JFK presidency.  Everything before and after that has been about 
government control by Elites and CIA, those involved in the coup on JFK
and those who have covered it up.

                 Was Hillary Clinton the Original ‘Birther’?
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Two Republican presidential candidates
                <strong>
                 claim
                </strong>
                the so-called “birther” movement originated with the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008. While it’s true that some of her ardent supporters pushed the theory,
                <strong>
                 there is no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with it.
                </strong>
                &gt;
               </p>
               <p>
                In an interview on June 29, Sen. Ted Cruz said “the whole birther thing was started by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008,” and earlier this year,
                <strong>
                 Donald Trump claimed
                </strong>
                “Hillary Clinton wanted [Obama’s] birth certificate. Hillary is a birther.”
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Neither Cruz nor Trump presented any evidence that Clinton or anyone on her campaign ever questioned Obama’s birthplace, demanded to see his birth certificate, or otherwise suggested that Obama was not a “natural born citizen” eligible to serve as president.

                 Donald Trump's History of Raising Birther Questions About President Obama
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                The re-emergence of a discussion over President Obama's religion and birthplace as part of Donald Trump's presidential campaign might give some people a sense of deja vu.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reality TV star and businessman has spoken extensively about his questions over whether Barak Obama was actually born in Hawaii like he (and the state of Hawaii) says he was.
               </p>
               <p>
                In 2011, when he was vocally mulling over a possible presidential run, Trump launched a public pursuit of Obama's birth certificate, announcing that he has sent private investigators to Hawaii to see what they could find.
               </p>
               <p>
                The president then released the long-form version of his birth certificate in response to the uproar that Trump had caused. After its release, Trump said that he was "proud of myself because I've accomplished something nobody has been able to accomplish."

                 Donald Trump Clung to ‘Birther’ Lie for Years, and Still Isn’t Apologetic
                </strong>
                It was not true in 2011, when Donald J. Trump mischievously began to question President Obama’s birthplace aloud in television interviews. “I’m starting to think that he was not born here,” he said at the time.
               </p>
               <p>
                It was not true in 2012, when he took to Twitter to declare that “an ‘extremely credible source’” had called his office to inform him that Mr. Obama’s birth certificate was “a fraud.”
               </p>
               <p>
                It was not true in 2014, when Mr. Trump invited hackers to “please hack Obama’s college records (destroyed?) and check ‘place of birth.’”
               </p>
               <p>
                It was never true, any of it. Mr. Obama’s citizenship was never in question. No credible evidence ever suggested otherwise.

                     Trump has to be somebody's puppet as there is likely a lot of power which moved him into position.  Very much like Obama.  But the CIA seemed to be very into Hillary ... maybe preferring bombing campaigns over Syria and ME in general over full out nuclear war.

                    <p>
                     In all that we discuss here, the power of the Vatican (which underpins Elite patriarchy) 
has to be understood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     On the pedophile issue, they are "Royals" in their own sense of it involved it seems with other Royals as we see clearly in a lot of the European scandals.

                     Not so long ago I came upon two questions which puzzled me but didn't actually have time to pursue ... First ... Did Capitalism/Elites create Communism .... and the Second, did Vatican create Islam.  One of the clues to the second one which moved me to keep an open mind on it was the
                     <strong>
                      Afghan Jihad schoolbook scandal?
                     </strong>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                     <p>
                      "The primers, which were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines, have served since then as the Afghan school system's core curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books..." -- Washington Post, 23 March 2002 (1)

                     You might remember that as Americans saw repeatedly on the TV screens Afghan school children robotically reciting from these books.  Scared Hell out of everyone.  Americans certainly believed it without question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Another very big clue was a CIA whistleblower I'd been aware of for maybe 20 years ... C-span used to actually present him.  The last time I saw something of his I noticed that he referred to the CIA as "Catholics In Action."

                     Mentioned this question one day here and someone here sent me the Veith link which is very informative.

                     Haven't yet gotten to the "Communist" question ... but it seems that every great myth requires an opposing myth.

                    <p>
                     On this front of pedophilia and child trafficking .... I see the Weinstein scandal as a step toward the population being more willing to accept the word of women.
                     <br/>
                     Nature gave pretty much everything to do with childbearing and nurturing of children to females.  When women are oppressed and de-powered in our societies -- actually all over the world -- they do not have the power within society to protect children.
                     <br/>
                     We're actually seeing now fears of a return to child labor.

                    <p>
                     Koch Bros./John Birch Society is certainly one of the large players -- with other large corporations, as well.  Koch Family has been trying to overturn democracy in US for more than 100 years.

                     Veith, I think, said that it's about 100 wealthy families.

                     Hard to say where the head of the snake lies, however.

               Jim -- 
There's something wrong with you video's sound ...
              </p>
              <p>
               However, truth be told, as the right wing rises -- and I certainly include Obama in that -- there has to be a way for Elites to hold them accountable.  Therefore, the place of birth may have been the way they were doing it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Have no idea what Arpaio is presenting as "new information" here ... but connecting with either Arpaio or the Donald on any issue is to support volatile racism.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again, our entire government is in the hands of the right wing and that's been true since at least the coup on JFK...
at the least.  The Founders actually put us in hands of Elite Patriarchy, endowing them with land, supporting their genocide and Slavery.  Supporting the Civil War which split the nation into two camps of hatred which continue to echo today.
              </p>
              <p>
               Like Clarence Thomas -- our pervert on the Supreme Court -- Obama is just another right wing puppet serving Elites.
I believe you see him cashing in from Wall Street in recent days?  Payoff for doing nothing to corrupt/criminal banks and Elites who once again stole everything and got away with it with a lot of help from other right wing criminals holding office.
              </p>
              <p>
               Both of our national parties are owned by Elites/wealthy and that has also long been true of the Democratic Party.
Forget labels.

                They are presenting evidence that Obamas birth certificate is a forgery. And this is not from way back when Trump asked about Obama´s BC. This press release was in Dec 15, 2016. So this is nothing that has been debunked.

                 That's your conclusion, however, your link isn't working so no one here
can judge for themselves -- and further ... anything presented by Arpaio
or Trump on Obama is overcome by their racism.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What we know is that Obama had a "meteoric rise"-- that he likely has 
attachments to the CIA -- and that he is a puppet who they would logically
"have something on."  May be a birth certificate, may not.  But you can be
sure that it's something to control their puppet.
                </p>
                <p>
                 CIA took control of Oval Office with GHWB and they're not about to let it go.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Obama has come and gone and done his dirty work for Elites.
And he's now off to Wall Street to collect his "reward."
While we're all here trying to deal with the aftereffects of the destruction.

              Would those rabbi-reports trip off narcissism, habitual lying or islamophilia?  Probably depends on who's running the reports and what they're looking for huh?  Being raised by a transexual nanny raise any red flags?  Would a lack of Birth Certificate even get him a job sweeping floors at the FBI?

                Why did you blank out the rest of the handle name?  You should look it up.  Look up St. Simon of Trent, or did you and that's why you blanked it out.  Curiously shillish.  Yes, I'm anti talmud.  Anti sodomy and pro-Christian purity.  What are you here for?

                 What you're making clear is that you support organized patriarchal religion -- male-supremacist religion --
which underpins Elite Patriarchy.

                 And I doubt anyone would argue that children exposed to those religions are brainwashed 
by those religions as early as possible.  Get over it.

            This one thing sealed the deal for me on the truth about life:

             The Revelations of Dr. Richard Day
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In simple speak, a baby doctor revealed all the globalists plans all the way back in 1969.
           </p>
           <p>
            Almost every prediction he made has come true.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that includes the elimination of all professional sports.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said football would be the hardist to eliminate.
           </p>
           <p>
            But that is exactly what the globalists are doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just look at the stands over the last 7 years - most arenas are not even half full.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has nothing to do with the NFL losing money...
           </p>
           <p>
            It is all about controlling us... moving us from one sheep pen to another.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder what our next breads and circuses will be.

             It may shock you since you think 1969 is ancient times, but during the Youth
Revolution of the 1960's .... people were moving away from sports, boxing had
pretty much been shown to be harmful to contenders and to the audience.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would we want to push violent sports -- ?
Didn't someone recently call US football games out as being "Nuremberg rallies"?
            </p>
            <p>
             We're sending 8 year olds out to practice football with pretty much all the gear 
that the NFL has.  But the injuries will be the same.
            </p>
            <p>
             These are personal decisions often made by men who are bonding once
again with women and children and moving away from male violence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, we still have many men who are awash in pornography ... and 
studies show that --
            </p>
            <p>
             "The consumption of pornography -- whether violent or non-violent -- 
leads to sexual aggression."

            Anyone know of any NFL child predator football players that got off easy??? I know a lot have been convicted of rape and violent crimes but not seeing much against children. Let's Find some stuff and take offense to those players still being in the league, not the peaceful protesters.

            This is a Soros/Obama/BLM agenda that these idiot fools have fallen for. Too stupid to see that this tactic is out of the Saul Alinsky handbook.
NFL will lose big time $$! The players and owners are overpaid overrated millionaire LibTard gophers. Just like the POSs that are pd by Soros to be bused in and protest, they are beyond being able to see they are being used. Book smart maybe, street smart NO fucking way!

             Some say that NFL is scripted and many of the top players are paid to perform much like WWE. Superbowl 51 was scripted as hell. 
BTW, who were the winners of the first SB in 2002, after the false flag staged 9-11 - The Patriots!!! 
It's all a sick show. 
But here is a thing - who would sign off to all this madness - only a child murdering pedophile - everything leads to pizzagate.

              Remember the Patriots were losing?  Everyone was saying they would lose.  Then I saw Donald Trump Jr. post a tweet that all the people saying they would lose were like the pollsters predicting Trump would lose.
             </p>
             <p>
              So he was talking smack, when they were losing big time, then lo and behold, Patriots went on a run and won.

             <p>
              That shit is SO scripted.  People need to wake up.

               Totally forgot about that! Thanks FE_Rebekah. 
Tom Brady is rarely tackled hard, he is a second rate player, an actor agent. NFL was founded by freemasons, all numbers ritual! For all of those who think otherwise I invite you to see the film Poltergeist (1982) which predicts Supeebowl venue (San Diego 1988) and the scoreline 42-10. (42 ultimate freemasonic number, 88 - refers to time/Saturn - current cabal worships Saturn) Guys, world has been hijacked by occult child murdering kabbalists - it's time to expose them. Just check out Steph Curry's wife tweet in 2015 when she said that NBA is rigged and she lost all respect for the playes - she was forced to retract. It's all WWE - sick show! Pizzagate is at the very heart if it!
