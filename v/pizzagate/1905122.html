            So, Voat is infiltrated by shills who came from the PG subverse right into the Seth Rich subverse in order to criticize every action, work and video from Webb. Commenting any video from Webb now automatically leads to the same old interventions from its detractors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, it seems none of our CTR-Brock's-Elite-Team is actually following their live feed nor correctly quoting their videos. Shill techniques in order to cause mass disruption. Masks are falling.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's recap : he is right about the Awan brothers, right about money laundering, right about DC police, all the connections to the Podesta family and big-John being the godfather, the security flaw in NGPVAN, the use of pre-configured BlackBerries, Brownstone, arms dealing in Lybia/Syria, worldwide organ harvesting on children, drug cartels and many more. I also think he is right when designating Cernovih as the official leaker for the Trump administration in order to expose monsters like Petraeus.
           </p>
           <p>
            The anti-Webb propaganda is absolutely obvious.

            I share your sentiment. As far as these creatures being successfully prosecuted, I won't hold my breath. DOJ and FBI work with the CIA to keep this industry going and immensely profitable. So, the chances of it getting shutdown completely is slim at best. My guess, the heads we know will roll, unless your name is Clinton. After that the monster will crawl back underground. Causing natural disasters that leave 100s of thousands of children without a place to go...

            You would think, if there actually is some sort of cosmic balance between "good" and "evil" the good guys would win some of the time. But no, the good guys get shit sandwiches for lunch so often they use toilet paper for napkins.

            Webb has done nothing but made an ass out of himself!  He is a G damned attention whore!
Like Beck he needs to be put into a rubber room! Profiting off of this stuff even a little is disturbing!
Getting hits on YouTube just to earn $$ from it, is fucking low!

            If that were true, then we would never have to worry about disinformation. Like, if somebody gains a lot of attention tying Pizzagate to aliens and Bigfoot, we'd be forced to appreciate the exposure. That's not how this shit works, though.

            George Webb is a hero for breaking this story wide open. But again today George implied after Hillary things will go back to business as usual. And again he totally lost me. Is he saying everyone will go back to just importing drugs and leave the child rape and organ harvesting out this time?

            but what the hell. Go back to business as usual? It makes no sense. How the hell are people going to forget the CIA is padding their budget running drugs?
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing that I can think of again is GW is being facetious and ironic. He's basically saying it's game over for Black Budgets and it's time to plow a new field. And to back that up I'd point to this upcoming History Channel special about the
            <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/paradigm-shift-history-channel-air-documentary-exposing-cia-drug-trafficking/">
             CIA and Drug Running.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm thinking this was part of the plan from the beginning when Trump had just won the election and convened the MSM into his office in Trump Tower for
            <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/11/21/donald-trumps-media-summit-was-a-f-ing-firing-squad/">
             an extreme ass pounding.
            </a>
            I bet the plan was "Hey the jigs up. We're going to air all the dirty laundry next Summer. Until then don't talk about the Deep State. And hey you History Channel, come up with a
            <a href="http://www.aenetworks.com/article/history-sets-premiere-date-limited-doc-series-americas-war-drugs-618">
             documentary on the CIA running drugs
            </a>
            so we can slowly wake up the American public."
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the MSM silence was on purpose so as not to wake up Deplorable Shit Lords who drink way too much alcohol and own way too many assault rifles to handle the Truth all at one sitting. It's like how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. I'm guessing we'll be "eating the elephant" for a while.

              I'm thinking only the top 23 will go to jail. The rest will probably get immunity in exchange for testifying against the 23 psychotic perps behind this whole thing.

                  Yep. Did you read this part: "Clinton’s for their diabolical decade long scheme with the controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy to sell watered down AIDS drugs to Africa"?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Sessions is going to get her on selling watered down Aids drugs. It's unassailable. I'm sure he could have gotten her on 100 things but cheating poor black Africans is right up there with organ harvesting and child rape. I think they chose the fake Aids drug case because it's the least toxic while still being unconscionable.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Who's going to attack Trump and Sessions for putting Hillary in jail for that? No one. It's impossible to object to putting someone in jail for killing poor black people with Aids.

                   I haven't heard! Where did you find that? I've been away for a while. She is sick. It's hard for my mind to comprehend how these people can even sleep at night. We're all under the control of ruthless Satanic psychopaths. I never thought I could actually hate someone so much. I would love seeing that woman locked up. Oh yeah. 911 was totally an inside job. That's when I really started getting into alternative news and getting redpilled. There's not a doubt in my mind. I don't get how people don't see it. Especially when you know about building 7. Do you remember when it happened or were you too young? I think when something like that happens, you can look back and remember exactly where you were when it happened.

                    Hillary is psychotic. Seriously she is literally a narcissistic psychopath. Psychopaths are missing the lobe in the human brain that deals with Empathy. They can't gauge how other people think of them. When a psychopath fucks up they can't conceive of their audience holding them accountable.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That's why Hillary can blithely walk around with a big vibrant smile and without a care in the world because she can't sense people's disgust. If you or I got caught conspiring to sell poor black people in Africa watered down Aids drugs we'd screw a .38 in our ear or at least hide away in shame. No sir, not Hillary. A psychopath is mentally unable to feel guilt basically.

                     Oh the link wouldn't open. I restarted my iPad. I thought it had to do with something else. It's loading now so I can read it in a little bit. I'm curious. Wow I didn't know that they're missing a lobe in their brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I know. I read something today about some teenagers that could get jail time because I guess they were mowing lawns without a license! I was thinking to myself, these kids can go to jail for that and Hillary isn't even being charged?!  Elizabeth Warren said the other day about Trump, that nobody should be above the law. All of this just pisses me off because I think of everything Hillary is getting away with. Nothing happens to her. I always go back to those poor people in Haiti. Knowingly letting these people suffer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I'm love seeing how she's freaking out now! You can just see in her eyes that she can't get over losing to Trump. I would rather her be living everyday tormented at least by that than being happy! I couldn't stand that cocky smile that she would get when she thought she was winning.

                     <p>
                      There's more to that cocky smile I think. She is psychotic there's no question. But she's sharp as a tack and I think part of that smile is her knowing if she goes down she'll bring the entire Deep State down with her. In the grand scheme of things Hillary is just a Mafia Capo, the Don's are the guys like Kissinger, Buffet, the Rockefellers, Rotschilds etc.  She could easily bring all those down with her.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And to be honest I think that's why Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch in Phoenix. I suspect Obama wanted to indict her because she's guilty as fuck. That meeting on the tarmac was Bubba saying don't fuck with Hillary because she'll bring everyone down.

                        And watered down Aids drugs is the tame stuff. There's evidence these people used HAARP to look for oil in Haiti and accidentally kicked off the earthquake. HAARP is used to heat up ground water and produce steam which will force any oil to the surface the location of which is where the Oil Drill goes.

                        I'd say it's about 50/50 they caused the Haiti earthquake but as you can imagine that's kind of a hot potato.

                          The real danger is if she is given partial immunity. if HRC is facing serious prison time, and she can reduce her sentence by playing ball, we expect this will be the most profound thing Trump can do to drain the swamp. HRC has the goods on Schumer, and McCain, Graham, Blumenthal, and so much more. Imagine the most powerful mafia Don snitching on 30 years of tangled and corrupt relationships. Then triple the effect. HRC could effectively put 200 people currently in power behind bars.

                         I think they caused the Haiti earthquake too. I think AIDS was created by them as well.

                         Israel has developed the technology to remote control airlines via laptops. A false flag was being prepared. Trump discussed it with Russian officials,exposing the “plot” McMaster pitched, and now all hell has broken loose. 😮 DAMN. No wonder their freaking out! These liberals don't even realize what a good thing Trump just did. It's so frustrating.

            in a way i bet he has left some bread crumbs out there.  however, the true culprits pulling the strings that stretch down to the p/g level involve heavily the banksters/zionists that he didn't get into. (probably cuz he apparently --i don't watch his vids -- admitted to having ties to the mossad who along with mi6, and the cia are the main ways which the strings are pulled)

             He straight up boasts about being a proud Zionist. He didn't study the community he was trying to (and did) infiltrate very hard if he thought this admission wouldn't evicerate his credibility.

              safe to assume that this (it being clear he's a zionist now) is why he's apparently stopping his daily videos throwing shit at the wall? (again i don't watch em cuz i don't wanna try and sort thru the disinfo for a few crumbs)
