            I remember seeing an episode of The Blacklist that was all about this. One of the first times I’ve ever seen it depicted on American TV. This is frankly a very little known fact that I only found out about a couple years ago and the VAST majority of Americans have no clue that it’s even legal in certain areas in the United States.

            What a retarded post.  Not elite,  not pedophilia, and promoting an ahistorical and anti-biological notion that older men shouldn't marry younger women.

            A pubescent girl is a woman and women are meant to be bred by husband's.

            I think the assumption by the general public is that underage marriage only happens between two high schoolers who have had sex together and are trying to bring some stability to their relationship. That is clearly not always the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, this topic has been brought up before and we are seeing some progress. Since 2016, 11 states have modified their laws to increase the minimum age of marriage. (
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_the_United_States">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_the_United_States
            </a>
            ) While there is still work to be done, it should encourage pizzagaters that some government officials do listen to our concerns, even if it is only in the broadest of laws.

             Two teenagers marrying isn’t always the case, but without seeing numbers I’m going to assume it’s the case in the clear majority of cases. Of course Muhammad and legitimate pedophiles are a greater problem than religious Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only thing I would caution about is the feminists and kikes trying to make white people stop breeding. I wouldn’t put it past them to try to increase age of marriage to 21 while continuing to tell women they really just need PhDs and cats.

              I think you guys are way off on your assumption.  I would have guessed almost ALL of the child marriages were products of certain religions in general or a "white tribal" issue in some of the more rural areas.

               I live in one of the “tribal” areas you’re thinking of, and you’ve seen too many goddamned Jewish movies. Just as the South is demonized by kikes (the same South which is of course traditionally Jew-pilled to a much greater extent than the fucking Yankees who were founded by the kikes), so any conservative and rural areas are demonized by them.
              </p>
              <p>
               I guarantee you that country people are as a rule much more civilized and principled than the shitstains the rest of you call “urban areas.” If you want to see baby raping or other degenerate shit on an industrial scale, you don’t look to Appalachia or the Ozarks like your Jewish movies might make you think. California and New York are more like it. Out here is paradise compared to any city, which is why I left them.

                This is not a Jew-pilled subverse, mainly due to the high proportion of women. And since it has long been obvious that pizzagate is a Jewish affair,  it isn't an exaggeration to say these women are abetting child rapists.

                 True. In the name of “tolerance” and the false idea that everyone is completely equivalent in every way, this shit has been allowed to go unchecked for generations. People failing to realize they are not like us is a major part of the problem.

               People wonder why I get so pissed off when I here this "pet parents, "forever homes", and "hoomuns"; I have a real family I don't have to anthropomorphism my pets but I think it is even more insidious than unmarrieds calling their boyfriends "hubby".

               I was showing my ex gf pictures of babies and she said she thought animals are cuter. Also says she has too much schoolwork to spend much time on a relationship and her future plans are basically endless degrees paid for by her rich family. She already has a masters, now getting her second one. So yeah I’m back to looking for actual wife material now and I told her she has a future of cats to look forward to. Sad but true. She’s already 30 and no plans in sight.

                Not only that but women naturally want to marry up and when they're more educated they'll simply not marry.
               </p>
               <p>
                All over the world even in MONGOLIA you see this new problem devastating marriage rates.
               </p>
               <p>
                Women exist to bear our children and should be married off as soon as possible.  No point risking her losing her value through slutting or Jew brainwashing.
               </p>
               <p>
                A few heinous examples of actual child marriage doesn't invalidate this fact of life.

                 Fully agreed. Jews are obsessed with deflowering virgins. It's one of the things they delight in most: preventing white women from participating in true monogamy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When you consider studies that women can retain genetic material from ALL of their previous sex partners and potentially pass them on to their children, the whole scheme is disturbing. Coal-burning should especially give people pause in consideration of this.

            Sadly not much has changed in banning child marriage.  This is a sick practice and must stop.  Why do people keep electing these fool pols that leave laws in place that allow pedophiles and just plain sex crazy religious freaks to rape our children in the name of "marriage".   It is not marriage.  It is legalizing rape.  I also believe it is unconstitutional.  Does the child really know what they are committing to?  Of course not.  They are forced into these child "marriages" by parents or legal guardians because they have ancient radical beliefs or for money.  This must stop now.  Christie  should lose his job. He needs to be primaried and be set up as an example.
