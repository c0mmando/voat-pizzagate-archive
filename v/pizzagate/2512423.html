            Okay probably nothing but I can’t help but think about the “Racine” connection because Kenosha’s a hop, skip, and a jump away, as in day 10 miles or so. I mean, all the way from CA to Kenosha, WI of all places to do a drug deal. Hello “Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt” wherever you are.

              Anthony Kiedis has confessed he once spent the night with Cher. The Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman revealed how, as a teenager, he spied on the singer as she stripped for bed, when she was babysitting him. He revealed in his autobiography Scar Tissue "I was in bed and Cher got up to go to the bathroom and get ready for bed. I watched her take off her clothes. There was a woman's naked body. I remember thinking, 'This is not bad, lying next to this beautiful lady.'" The singer - who lost his virginity to his dad's girlfriend at the tender age of 12 - also admitted he used Sonny Bono's address to get into the school with the best looking girls. The heartthrob star says Cher's former husband gave him permission to use the fake address after he had set his heart on the Los Angeles school. He said: "Everywhere I looked there were these hot little 13-year-olds.
             </p>
             <p>
              I said, 'Whatever it takes, I want to go here.' Sonny was fine with the deception so I enrolled."
             </p>
             <p>
              Meanwhile, Anthony says his dad introduced him to drugs at the age of four.
             </p>
             <p>
              He revealed: "We were walking down Sunset Strip, and he gently blew some pot smoke into my face."

            39 yr old Cher babysitting?

            Each summer, he would visit his father in Hollywood for two weeks, a time during which the two would bond. He idolized his father, and recalled, "Those trips to California were the happiest, most carefree, the-world-is-a-beautiful-oyster times I'd ever experienced."[5] In 1974, when Kiedis was twelve years old, he moved to Hollywood to live with his father full-time.[6] His father was a struggling actor who sold drugs, which had a significant impact on Kiedis, as the two would often use marijuana and cocaine together

            Cher and Sonny had marital problems since late 1972, but appearances were maintained until 1974
           </p>
           <p>
            In February 1974, Sonny filed for a separation, citing "irreconcilable differences
           </p>
           <p>
            Their divorce was finalized on June 26, 1975
           </p>
           <p>
            During the divorce proceedings, Cher had a two-year romantic relationship with record executive David Geffen, who freed her from her business arrangement with Sonny, under which she was required to work exclusively for Cher Enterprises, the company he ran
           </p>
           <p>
            On June 30, 1975, four days after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married rock musician Gregg Allman, co-founder of The Allman Brothers Band.[81] She filed for divorce nine days later because of his heroin and liquor problems, but they reconciled within a month
           </p>
           <p>
            They had one son, Elijah Blue, on July 10, 1976.[83] Sonny and Cher's TV reunion, The Sonny and Cher Show, debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a divorced couple

            Anthony Kiedis was born on Nov 1, 1962
           </p>
           <p>
            he would have been 13 in 75-76
           </p>
           <p>
            If true, this had to been when he just turned 13 and she was in first trimester or after Elijah Blue was born

             There's a lot more. Here are the two posts I did on Cher/Geffen. She got on my radar so I did a dumpster dive.

             Clearly there was. Part of it was the old man was totally into pizzagate as proven by the other link I posted in this thread. Here's my quote and link:

             As for the pregnancy, don't know what was going on there. It's a disgusting thought but given the above link about Kiedis and his dad, I'm pretty sure he was in that Cannibal Elite ring. Doesn't make any sense that he'd not only let his twelve-year-old sleep with his eighteen-year-old girlfriend, but that he'd arrange it! I mean, that girl must have been into screwing minors also.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, this whole thing is just scummy ... like Cher. And people think she's an icon. Somebody that crawls into bed with a thirteen-year-old!

            Wonder what the real story is with Chaz Bono her adopted daughter now son and growing up what really happened to her. Kim kardashian was recently posting pics of Cher and how she thought she was so inspiring and did her long black witches hair just like Cher’s. These people are so fcking degenerate.

             I hope it comes out. It's what I attempted to hint at in connecting Cher with Geffen. They were ''dating'' when Chastity was three. That seems to be the magic age when these kids are messed up for life. Then there's Chastity being buddies with Jennifer Anniston -- a stupid bitch if I've ever seen one. Poor kid. Wonder what her dad knew. Wonder if that's why he went into politics and if it got him killed.

              This is true. Revelations is very clear about their unmasking. They are the synagogue of Satan.

            RHCP's album 'The Getaway' is 100% about pizzagate topics. From start to finish. Even the cover art. Its dark. But the music is great.

                Im not infalliable to trolling. But this account is rather pathetic and too low brow to snare me. Had to latch onto a name with a slight significance to even play ball. Unoriginal is not a characteristic of those worth paying attention to.

             The problem is that the group was/is talented. No doubt, but they're all fucked up in the head. Just added this link. Tells of Kiedis' dad turning him onto drugs and letting his eighteen-year-old girlfriend have sex with him when he was TWELVE!!!

               Chosen to be trustees of the blood covenent are the true tribe of judah..
The khazarian central asian counterfiets found a loophole in the covenant ..and are operating the trusteeship inside a war game of debt ..
Till the tribe of judah as predicted reduce the debt at the treasury ..they are considered civilitus mortuus ..civily dead of their status inside the war..we all are ..and have the remedy to reduce the debt ...uncan do it now with one dollar ..but only the 144000 will reduce it ..ie move away from hell..which legally means a state of debt ..this is the rapture ..
Only they will have the balls .to reduce debt..
They will turn the roman war corporation around and run itt from london..new jerusalem.....london runs the blood covenant from the Temple ..the temple bar inns of court ...with the theives in the temple..
Middle temple runs the US corporation..
It will be taken over with just one dollar..
Pay unto Ceasar what is Ceasarz ..and to God what is Gods..

              And if any of that is true, then it's no wonder why her daughter wanted to become a man (no offense to anyone)... any girl who was raised in an environment where they were offered up for sex will react in some extreme ways, whether that be identity disorders, or complete psychopathic breaks (becoming one of them -allison mack, Rachel Chandler, etc)... cher is a hypocrite and I have believed that for a very long time... plus, her fucking tweets make no God damn sense!

            LOL! You share tweets from Liz Crokin and TheRealMrSazonn... a hysteria pusher and antisemite respectively.

            Here I was thinking you were starting to understand the bigger picture after NXIVM broke... I wholeheartedly regret ever pinging you to any of my work in regards to that and anything else.

              Seeing the Jewish pattern is NOT the same as seeing all Jews as childfuckers or seeing all childfuckers as Jews. Your illogical premise is going to allow a lot of royals off the hook. And where does Huma Abedin fall into your equation?
             </p>
             <p>
              I prefer to think of it as: Jews are more likely to be "out there" in the public view because they choose professions that run in the tribe, such as Hollyweird and the law, while the bigwig gentiles hide behind those Jews. The Jews are used as shields.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not saying that most Jews aren't fucked up, because they truly are. I can even say that it looks like pedophilia might be encoded into the Jewish gene. This idea should be considered.
             </p>
             <p>
              My concern is that you're giving a whole lot of non-Jews a freaking pass when it comes to scrutiny. You're telling people to look more closely at the fucked-up jews, when you should be telling people to look more closely at the fucked-up EVERYBODY.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's ok to sensationalize "the Jew" if that's what you're trying to do, but Jews don't have childraping Sharia laws upon which their entire country is founded. I'm a Jew and I'm on your side, but what you're doing is like saying that some fathers beat their children, while ignoring the fact that some mothers beat their children.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, if I ever run across one of these childfuckers, I'll strangle him or her with my own bare hands, Jew or not. I'm a mother. I have superhuman strength when it comes to protecting children. I would kill to save a niglet. I would kill to save a Christian child. I would kill to save an Asian child. I would kill to save almost any child if I were confronted with irrefutable evidence such as walking in on an act of pedophilia. I'm not big and I'm not strong, but that fucker would be toast.
             </p>
             <p>
              I agree that most Jews are fucked up, but I think everyone knows that. Maybe you should look into the people who are hiding behind the Jewish lawyers.

               I'm merely pointing out a pattern that I've seen in a lot of cases. Yes, there are many non-jew pedo's, too. I never denied that or said otherwise.

                .  And I agree with you that there are a surprising number of J pedos. It makes me sick.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think I know what your saying with this Jew thing. I don't even like most jews, and I probably know more about them than most. We all knew jews could be clicky and obsessive and inbred, but the pedo aspect is shocking. And Cher DOES act a bit like a J princess, but so does madonna. Kek.

             Every single poster on this website is a rabid antisemitic, except women like you.  So naturally they've made half the mod team female.   Why can't you all just fuck off and bake cookies or something.

              As soon as a turkey pulls  out the  phrase 'anti-semite" you  are THROUGH
this is chicanery, and  it  only suggests  you are  hiding corruption and are  acting deceitfully-

               why don't you explain the "bigger picture" and how it absolves people from feeling hostile to jews.  personally, more than anything I despise jews for turning white women into snarky disrespectful cunts like you.
