            These figures are shocking.  This has blown me away.  No wonder they don't want to create businesses that give us real jobs.  They have a better investment going.  Our children.  Dirty evil vile perverts.

             Yes, it looks like there is a whole industry created around child trafficking, and it starts with Juvenile Courts

              I don't even know where to start.  This article is very painful to read, and in addition frightening.  This could happen to anyone with children, actually if you are a responsible carer for your child you are the one that will be badgered and have the child taken from you and given to the unfit parent.  Amazing.  This can be stopped if the Federal Govt. files a RICO Act.  This is what we must do.

               Yes, it's a clever set up, "transfer wealth" out of parents pockets, turn around and syphon taxpayers money from the Fed Gov, and feed kids to the pedo wolves for more kickbacks with one catch all phrase "in the best interests of the the children".

                I don't know much about the system in Chicago, but if it says it has improved, I don't know about that, because in charge of the Chicago nasty business is friend of Bill and Barack, Rahm Emanuel. I have a hatred of him since he was part of Clinton's Cabinet.  You can bet he is protecting all of the opportunities for monetary benefits for the elites.  This includes the protections of pedophiles, judges, trafficking and organ harvesting.  We know that he was put there to guard all of these profits for himself and others of the same ilk. It's getting to where I do not trust any of these jerks.

            I'm telling you. Debra Sigmund is one of the No.1 Gatekeepers of this shit. The rabbit hole with anti-human trafficking rings being run by the actual human traffickers really fucked with my head. See my other thread on this subject

             It is entirely possible, for example, Protect.org was founded by Clintons

             You can say the same about the DOJ, rightfully. It wasn't helpful in the past, and should be investigated, the main actors are still there.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Senator Chuck Grassley learned that an Assistant U.S. Attorney had child porn on his computer (for his pleasure, not as part of an investigation) -- but faced no legal consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
             Grassley wrote a letter  to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder asking why the unidentified government lawyer has not been charged with a crime. He cites an Inspector General's report from May which recounted the lawyer's tendency to surf XXX sites during work hours (assumedly, not in the line of duty):
            </p>
            <p>
             “The OIG conducted an investigation concerning allegations that an AUSA was using his government computer to view inappropriate material on his government computer. The investigation determined that the AUSA routinely viewed adult content during official duty hours, and that there was at least one image of child pornography recovered on the AUSA’s government computer. The AUSA acknowledged that he had spent a significant amount of time each day viewing pornography. The U.S. Attorney’s Office declined prosecution. Disciplinary action against the AUSA is pending.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The Justice Department told the Washington Times that the lascivious lawyer no longer works for them, but "would not comment on why it did not press criminal charges or on whether the attorney had been charged at the state level."
             <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/7/grassley-seeks-data-on-porn-viewer/">
              http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/7/grassley-seeks-data-on-porn-viewer/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Grassley wants Holder to tell him why the lawyer wasn't prosecuted, what kind of cases he worked on, and why the pornography was able to slip through the DoJ's filters. A question he didn't ask, but perhaps should have, is why a government attorney has several hours of free time every day to look at porn if he's not on the porn squad."

             Fish rots from the head down. Perhaps the DOJ is a good start to look into inner workings of child trafficking. Not to forget some of those so called child welfare organizations, social services, and the so called community-based treatment services for children.
