Achilles was a brave fighter, and the freemasons like to think that he was one of them. This is an excerpt from some freemasonry <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/dun/dun09.htm">sacred texts</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ACHILLES.-- ... that fierce and ferocious man-slayer, nay, man-eater at heart, for he exhibited a strong propensity to cannibalism in longing to have devoured the dead body of Hector--is it possible that he could have been one of our philanthropic society? Yes, we reply, such is the actual fact, and Bonaparte was one, too, in the highest degree. But, if you will not believe Homer, or us, believe your own eyes, if, indeed, you are a Mason. Ecce signum! Behold Achilles giving Priam THE HAND, when the latter is supplicating for the body of his slain son ... And who will say, now, that Achilles was not a Mason?--Freemasons\' Quarterly Review.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This to me indicates that Alefantis is a member of the \'brotherhood\'-- a brotherhood who will protect one another before anything and anyone else, even when criminality is involved. This is a short version of freemasonry\'s five points of fellowship: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the necessities of a brother call for my support, I will be ever ready to lend him a helping hand to save him from sinking ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indolence shall not cause my footsteps to halt, nor wrath to turn them aside;...  I will be ever swift of foot to save, help, and execute benevolence ...  but more particularly to a brother Mason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I offer up my <strong>ejaculations</strong> to Almighty God, I will remember my brother\'s welfare, even as my own; for as the voice of babes and sucklings ascends to the throne of grace, so, most assuredly, will the breathings of a fervent heart ascend to the mansions of bliss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A brother\'s secret, delivered to me as such, I will keep as I would my own, because, if I betray the trust which has been reposed in me, I might do him an irreparable injury; it would be like the villany of an assassin, who lurks in darkness to stab his adversary when unarmed and least prepared to meet an enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A brother\'s character I will support in his absence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is why judges and lawyers call one another \'brother\'. It\'s why police and authorities will protect pedophile rings and child murderers. It explains Awan\'s freemason hand gesture signalling distress when leaving court.</p>
<p>Freemasonry, on its face and at its lower levels, pledges allegiance to God. However, once members move up the hierarchy, they kneel with one knee at the alter of God and with the other knee at the alter of satan.  It is impossible to serve two masters, and the freemasons know this.  Their true master is satan. This is secular humanism; 
\'do what thou wilst\'.   It\'s not surprising that these men, with no moral compass or scruples, let their minds turn to debauchery, lecherousness and the most disgusting of deeds involving children.</p>
<p>\'Ejaculations\' point to the fact that freemasonry is basically a sex cult that pledges its allegiance to satan. It\'s a cult based on phallic myths, like the myth of Osiris and Isis.  This brings me to John Podesta, with both hands in the air bearing the number \'14\' and a picture of a fish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number 14 is Osirian cycle, is the base number that all mythology begins with, Set chopped Osiris in to 14 pieces and threw him in the Nile. Isis found 13, and the 14th was eaten by a fish, it was the phallus</p>

             interesting. i've done considerable research on the Rothschild lines and have not come across an "Achilles Rothschild." i know they change their names frequently to blend-in better, so if you have a reference to their usage of that name, i would greatly appreciate it.

              Evelyn Achille de Rothschild (1886-1917)
             </p>
             <p>
              Evelyn Achille de Rothschild was born on 6 January 1886, the son of Leopold and Marie Perugia.
             </p>
             <p>
              During his childhood he spent many long summers in Scotland at the Sassoon family's Speyside lodge where he enjoyed to the full all the sporting activities the area could offer.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was a close friend of his cousin, Neil Primrose, the son of Hannah Rosebery, whose family also joined the summer parties. Evelyn was an exceptionally fine horseman. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1904, and in 1907 became Joint Master of the Cambridge University Draghounds. He twice represented the University in the Grind and rode the winners of several races in the University Steeplechases.
             </p>
             <p>
              He entered the family business at New Court in 1907, although he never became a partner. He visited Brazil and Chile, in 1913, in the interests of the firm, and was active in Jewish affairs, serving as Treasurer of the United Synagogue, 1911, and Vice-President in 1917.
             </p>
             <p>
              The First World War
             </p>
             <p>
              Evelyn Achille served as a Major in the Bucks Yeomanry, and was mobilized with his Regiment on the outbreak of the War. ln August, 1914, he was promoted Captain and left for Egypt in April, 1915. He was then sent to Gallipoli, where he was temporarily in command of the Regiment, but after three months there was invalided to the base. He remained in Egypt till his death on November 17th, 1917, and was present at both Battles of Gaza. In March, 1917, he became Major. He was wounded in the Yeomanry charge on El Mughar on November 13th, 1917, and died in the Citadel Hospital, Cairo, four days later. His cousin Neil Primrose fell on the same day. The Officer Commanding the Bucks Yeomanry wrote:
             </p>
             <p>
              "The Regiment was taking part in a mounted charge on the Turkish infantry, who were very strongly posted on some high ground, El Mughair. I attacked with the Regiment in column of squadrons, and Evelyn was with the 2nd Squadron and was to take command of the two leading Squadrons on reaching the objective. We had some two miles of open country to cross, which was fairly swept by machine-gun and rifle fire. It was about half-way across this plain that Evelyn was struck down by a bullet. After all his death was a glorious one, killed when charging at the head of his men of Bucks.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Writing to his father, Leopold, Evelyn’s Commanding Officer, said:
             </p>
             <p>
              "And then Evelyn has gone - a friend of fifteen years. Evelyn was a 'very perfect gentle knight; and as Second-in-Command of the Regiment almost ' more royalist than the king.’”
