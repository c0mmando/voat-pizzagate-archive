Some of you may enjoy this disgusting &quot;life style&quot; if you can even call it that, but others are likely stuck in the catch 22 of having to do your job and follow orders and protect &quot;state secrets&quot; because the &quot;ends justify the means&quot;...that is what you are schooled in isn\'t it?...we all know that by the way.  Most of you think you have to do this to advance, and there may be some truth to that, but advance to what end?  Is the stuff that pizzagate is made of something that you would be comfortable accounting for, or leaving a legacy about just because you believe the ends justify it? Or are you a hot shot writer for the New York Times that knows deep down that something stinks here, but you wouldn\'t dare challenge the orders from the higher ups to paint it as just a conspiracy?  You still have a chance to make a difference in this life and make right the things that you have worked so hard to cover up or conceal regarding pizzagate.  I beg of you on behalf of the millions of people who are now aware of what you are all involved in or covering up to have a shred of mercy on the lives of the children that are victims of this vile scourge on humanity.  All of these 100\'s of thousands of children who once had a fair shot at life cry from the grave (if not from a cell), and you can make this right.  I can understand your unwillingness to come forth and testify, but at the very least, you can leak the needed evidence to bring it all down, and maintain plausible deniability.  Some of you are technical geniuses and could easily do this and no one would be the wiser.  Yes, I am speaking to you, the intelligence or law enforcement who still has a conscience.  Leave that missing piece out to be gathered by the citizenry and expose those that should be.  Do the right thing and start to really &quot;live your dash&quot;.</p>',

            Lol. If they aren't religious, they can fear me getting some alone time with them, by a decade's time. These "people" don't give a fuck about your plea. They need some good gas.

             Oh believe me many of them are religious and indeed revel in the Satanic nature of this vomit.  However, I still have hope though that a handful of people who may not be directly involved in the actual crime but are connected to the coverup are torn between leaking the information needed to bring it down, and maintaining their own safety or station.  There have to be a handful of intelligence people who are chomping at the bit to do the right thing, but feel damned in either choice.  My message is to them mostly, to cross over that line. I mean seriously how hard would it be to "accidentally" drop a few USB sticks in a crowded area with the info that needs to get out.  Or to leave an envelope in a populated area away from street cameras...you all know how to cover your tracks better than anyone else...why can't this happen intelligence folks? You could pull this off and no one would know?
