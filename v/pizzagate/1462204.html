            Lol. If they aren't religious, they can fear me getting some alone time with them, by a decade's time. These "people" don't give a fuck about your plea. They need some good gas.

             Oh believe me many of them are religious and indeed revel in the Satanic nature of this vomit.  However, I still have hope though that a handful of people who may not be directly involved in the actual crime but are connected to the coverup are torn between leaking the information needed to bring it down, and maintaining their own safety or station.  There have to be a handful of intelligence people who are chomping at the bit to do the right thing, but feel damned in either choice.  My message is to them mostly, to cross over that line. I mean seriously how hard would it be to "accidentally" drop a few USB sticks in a crowded area with the info that needs to get out.  Or to leave an envelope in a populated area away from street cameras...you all know how to cover your tracks better than anyone else...why can't this happen intelligence folks? You could pull this off and no one would know?
