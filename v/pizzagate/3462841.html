            Something is up.  I think the dude had something to do with little kids.  Not 100 if PG related, but seems like all the articles are making an effort to not mention much about the father.  Also, they say there is no threat to the public and no investigation.  Odd, maybe a familycide by the father?  Not 100

            Well,hell.  I didn't hear a word about this (after the first allegations were made public) and this would be on the local news.
           </p>
           <p>
            So glad they caught this guy before he got to years and years of this under his belt...  Terrible for the current victims, but thank God he didn't get the chance to victimize more little girls!

            Parents must start asking questions of their Children. Gym coaches/teachers are to be suspect. Yes there are many good ones but there are many sick perverted pedos that are getting into this field to get their hands onto Our Children. This guy should not be walking the streets. If they suspect someone of murder they can pick him off the street and lock him up. I think the # will go much higher. I can’t even imagine what those parents are going through.

             yes! My sister constantly tells her daughters to be aware of all these things, she is so real with them because she is aware of all this like us.  Her kids friends are totally clueless about any adult danger it seems.

              Idk what is up with the parental generation of today. Their heads are in the clouds. Dazed and confused about what’s going on in the real world. All the time they spend on their phones and they don’t keep I will n the dangers that could happen to their Children. Tech Smart Child Dumb. Lord help our next generation.
