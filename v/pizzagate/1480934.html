<p>How typical is it that Kelly, the ultimate WhoreMedia Presstitute, is chosen to act as the eyelid-fluttering, outrage-feigning \'journalist\' chosen for this task, which will have been chosen as Alefantis\' MAIN interview, as it targets the political right (not to mention Fix News is now by far the biggest station). </p>
<p>Their intent will be to get right-support for the Fake News agenda and the demonisation of the citizen investigation into Elites involved in paedophilia / trafficking and worse (otherwise known as PizzaGate). This is what &quot;controlled opposition&quot; looks like. Leading low-info conservatives by the nose in defence of a criminal cross-party Elite - the UniParty Establishment.</p>
<p>For this reason I feel this interview is a MAJOR opportunity as well as a risk. We need to get smart and ORGANISED just like they are and get ahead of the curve and fight back.</p>
<p>We can be damn sure that CTR have already had a staff meeting and planned a support campaign several days ago. They will be there on every news article covering the Kelly interview and on social media. </p>
<p>We must not cede the battleground, we must turn their cannons back on them by exposing who they are and what their transparent agenda is. </p>
<p>Hate to sound like Alex Jones, but to steal a phrase - THIS IS PRIMARILY AN INFO WAR. Our battle space is comment sections and social media until we can force this into the open. </p>
<p>I suggest we use the advance warning if this impending psy-op to bombard Twitter and social media with a campaign based on hashtags, that will draw uncomfortable scrutiny in the lead-up to the interview, but also in the days after when the FakeNews MSM will be doing follow-up stories based on this interview.</p>
<p>I suggest #AskAlefantis as the main tag but also #PizzaGate (both used in each tweet or post). </p>
<p>Each tweet should be a question we are asking <a href="https://voat.co/user/MegynKelly">@MegynKelly</a> to ask James. Ideally they will be the most awkward ones and backed up with memes and /or links.</p>
<p>This will expose to people new to PizzaGate that the interview is a complete whitewash and nothing of any substance is addressed by Alefantis or indeed even posed to him by Kelly. Our campaign will break through cognitive dissonance of those caught in the glare of MSM gaslighting techniques.</p>
<p>It\'s a major opportunity for some guerrilla PR. Let\'s teach these bastards the meaning of the Streisand Effect and use our freedoms and social media access while we still have them. I am serious! This is war!</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>1 - we should suggest questions and images below for each of us to pick up and use. </p>
<p>2 - we should search #AskAlefantis on Twitter (etc) and retweet the hell out of EVERY one we find, and combat and point out the CTR trolls who will be out in force with disinfo and ridicule. </p>
<p>3 - We should have memes ready for CTR and JTRIG so we can highlight &quot;this troll has 45 followers and only ever tweets in defence of Alefantis - here\'s an article about CTR trolls. PS DavidBrock is CTR owner, lover of Alefantis). That way any defence they mount will simply backfire and WAKE more people up.</p>
<p>4 - please let me know your ideas and how we can make this thread the HQ of OPERATION ASK ALEFANTIS</p>

            Yes it is real. But I don't believe the guy was talking about it that way. I just looked at his instagram and he changed the caption. He didn't really know what pizzagate is and also his whole rest of his feed is him praising his daughter. I think this is a weird coincidence more than anything.

            No guest is getting on FoxNews without Murdoch knowing about it.
The pope himself has called anyone investigating Pizzagate #$%^Eaters....
First public speech Clinton gave after the loss was about Pizzagate investigators now threatening to "harm" Alefantis....
Everyone just needs to direct others here where's it being investigated. We were at 5k subs 2 weeks ago we are at almost 9k subs now...
We just need to keep this going keep them on their heels until the President gets in when all this is going to come down on them.
For now learn the facts and direct others here we need to keep them on their heels from the Pope on down:
Why does James Alefantis call infants 'retarded whores'?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do his social media friends support this view?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is his social media avatar a statue of the 13 year old lover of a roman emperor?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are three of the logos associated with the business complex mentioned in an FBI file as pedophile symbols?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why does Alefantis compulsively upload pictures of sexualized infants?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are major media outlets reporting about a small pizza place?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is this pizza place advertising kid friendliness, hosting events with people making jokes about pedophilia and transvestites rambling on stage about strangling infants during birth with cables?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are these bands using the same pedophile imagery from the FBI memo?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why were the traffic cameras turned the other way during the time the supposed gunman walked into Comet Ping Pong?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why does Colbert tell his audience that the basement is suspected to be under comet ping pong when we already have footage showing it to be at besta pizza? / Why is this distortion his only argument for dismissal?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why doesn't he mention that all the properties are owned by the same people?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is there another ping pong establishment in Berlin featuring infants and children on their menu under offers? Why did John Podesta spend time there?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why has the owner of the Berlin Ping Pong bar an internet security business without online presence with a business parter working in import/export?

           <p>
            What are they importing from Thailand?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is the only information on the product they're selling; 'something you might be looking for'?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are all news outlets simultaneously reporting that this is false even debunked, without a single one conducting an actual investigation or even providing evidence for this being the case?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are google, facebook, reddit, and youtube so concerned with deleting those videos while ignoring pedophile or terrorist content?
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Why is a foster mother announcing to John Podesta that her little children (3 under 10) will surely be entertaining him by using his whirlpool?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is Stephen Colbert trying to derail a public outcry for an investigation? What is Stephen Colbert's problem with the police investigating this place?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why didn't he mention that his sister has received funds from the accused? (John Podesta)
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did Andrew Breitbart tweet in 2011 that Podesta covers up a child sex slave ring? (discovered during investigation not before) Why did he have an heart attack shortly after?
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Why did the governments of Australia and Norway reduce their contributions to the Clinton foundation to zero, in the same week they busted large elite pedophile rings?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did 10 or so large pedophile rings get busted in the last 3 weeks?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is Colbert jumping on a sinking ship?

            For example, timing would be perfect to have the poo tunnel hoaxers on with the big reveal. Or maybe something to do with the actor. Be wary, something's up.

            They are so trying to frame this narrative. 
1) fake news
2) pizzagate fake
3) false flag
4) make "victim"  of fake news famous and craft narrative that he's a real swell guy
5) what's next? A bomb at CPP?
           </p>
           <p>
            They are so confident in the brainwashed masses buying their BS.

            I don't understand why more people aren't trying to hammer these easy pedophilic connections on him.

            Edit: And I haven't checked the veracity of it but apparently his sister wrote to a convicted pedo while he's in jail.

            We need to create a single, compiled MEME with the most damaging evidence and post this in social media and broadly before the interview, if possible. Send it to Kelly. When they do not address these things, which they won't, it will open more eyes. The most damaging items are the instagrams and comments (including those of friends who made the initial comments), screen shots of the videos from Heavy Breathing and Majestic Ape (this is a great video with which to start:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicUO0sz08c">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicUO0sz08c)
            </a>
            ), sick posters for bands at CPP that welcome "All Ages," quotes from some of those damaging videos (like the one where the person in audience says that Alefantis "likes little children/boys"- at the end of this video:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro)
            </a>
            ), the claim by Alefantis that he has no basement when he said differently in this published interview in 2015 (
            <a href="http://archive.is/2O5n7#selection-1587.586-1587.612">
             http://archive.is/2O5n7#selection-1587.586-1587.612)
            </a>
            ). We want to create visuals and bolded statements that come from them, asking how do they explain.

            This list of questions is only a starter template and ideas to be used in tweets to bring to public attention the fact that the interview will only include softball questions for Alefantis. Kelly will not pay attention to tweets from this board, if that's what you are thinking.

            My parents sincerely believe that Fox News is the "honest" news source. And Kelly will almost certainly portray Alefantis as a victim! He would not appear on her show if she had not already promised him good press!

             Same here. Just checked her Twitter going back a few days and found nothing but a tweet thanking Politics &amp; Prose. The website for The Kelly File says for Monday, "The Democrats continue to refuse to accept results of the election. Plus, Mike Huckabee sounds off about the questions over Russia's hacking. And, more on the debate over President-elect Trump's secretary of state search"

            Let's get real, when the 50th most influential gweep in Washington goes on teevee, all the questions have been agreed to in advance. This guy is a cog in the Clinton machine, he is not a random pizza guy.

            This is a great idea, as I have felt powerless on so many levels, including that so many people are so much more tech savvy than I am. I DO know how to use social media and I am on Team #AskAlefantis.

            It will be so scripted, so rehearsed, so anything BUT an interview, it's insulting to even watch.
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis needs to be interviewed (with blindsided questioning) by one of us if we are ever to hear the ugly truth albeit, still wrapped up in pretty lies. But at least our way it will be very clear and quite evident when he lies.

            Someone found some records indicating that he does own it, or at least the back half of it, which is listed as a commercial garage for selling vehicles. Someone linked to the records in the comments. Very weird stuff.

            IMO, they are making sure Pizzagate will be known as "AlefantisGate" so it draws attention from the big picture. So I think we should also use this opportunity to show people there is MUCH more in Pizzagate than  one weirdo pizza guy.

             hold up lets talk about ping pong...
            </p>
            <p>
             What the fuck inspired you to open up a restaurant centered around ping pong ? Too cheap to buy arcade machines ?
            </p>
            <p>
             i mean you advertise this as a " Kid friendly " establishment, kids aren't even Tall enough to fucking reach the tables.
            </p>
            <p>
             i grew up in the 1980's ping pong is fucking boring to me. were you born in the 1950s ? what the fuck dude.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do all Serial killers lack that basic human connection and empathy, that emotionally informs us on that fundamental affinity of being human that Ping Pong is fucking dumb.
            </p>
            <p>
             i think the most disturbing part of all of this is that you're supposedly a[n alleged] pedophile - and you think Ping Pong attracts children... if you've spent more than 5 minutes with a child you would understand that being forced to play ping pong in a child's
mind would be torture...   oh... wait....  now it makes sense... you sick fuck
            </p>
            <p>
             take a page out of Michael Jackson's playbook, he had an Amusement Park, a petting zoo, Arcades, rooms filled with toys (hoarder)... a theatre,  all of that... you've got a ping pong table... just saying man, you should step up your game, dawg.

             Maybe this tweet is why the OP thinks she's interviewing Alefantis tonight, because I and others here can not find any verification for this claim. Wouldn't a fake Twitter campaign highlight the flaws with this investigation?

            We know Alefanis reads these boards, giving him a heads up about what questions people want asking will just give him time to make a cover story....Although, he's had plenty of time to do that anyway.

             Trust me fella they wont even BEGIN to ask him any of the questions we will pose here... even if he had a great answer for each, the weirdness and massive stacking of coincidences and concerns will look incredibly damning.  Instead it will be about the False Flag gunman, how his staff are terrified, how local business is suffering, and how his receding hairline is retreating even faster due to the incredible stress

            When I looked online for info about the time of the interview, I found
            <a href="http://megynkelly.org/205681/pizzagate-banned-on-reddit/">
             this unofficial fan site
            </a>
            . Hopefully her interview will have a similar slant, or her fans will call her out on it.

             we won't ask directly we ask publically; we know she's not going to act on them we want to highlight to the public that this is a whitewash - this will create a real cognitive dissonance when they see the pathetic interview

            Why are major media outlets reporting about a small pizza place?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is this pizza place advertising kid friendliness, hosting events with people making jokes about pedophilia and transvestites rambling on stage about strangling infants during birth with cables?
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>

            Why are google, facebook, reddit, and youtube so concerned with deleting those videos while ignoring pedophile or terrorist content?

            Why didn't he mention that his sister has received funds from the accused? (John Podesta)
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did Andrew Breitbart tweet in 2011 that Podesta covers up a child sex slave ring? (discovered during investigation not before)

           </p>
           <p>
            Why did the governments of Australia and Norway reduce their contributions to the Clinton foundation to zero, in the same week they busted large elite pedophile rings?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did 10 or so large pedophile rings get busted in the last 3 weeks?
           </p>

              Really we should try to think of trick questions. Maybe ones that look like curveballs to Megyn, but are actual hard hitters? Hmm. Thing is she will ignore anything obviously exposing anything. So I can only imagine she will cherry pick questions. So what do we have that looks like a cherry picked question but in reality does expose something. Maybe too hard to find.

               Excellent. Can you create one that shows about a dozen of these (why from Instagram...including the "killroom" shots, why this band that has these images, why posters like this inviting "all ages," why did he lie about a basement...), why is the media not reporting about major hi-level pedo rings being busted?
