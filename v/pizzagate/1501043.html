<p>As a quick update, Jay B Stephens was working as the Senior VP of Ratheon when <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/27/podesta-relative-earned-six-figure-fees-lobbying-clintons-state-dept-during-his-tenure-there.html">he hired John Podesta\'s wife</a> to lobby on behalf of Raytheon to the State Department. </p>
<hr />
<h2>The Attorney General</h2>
<p>From 1988 to 1993 he was the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and lead the investigation into the Washington &quot;Call Boy Scandal&quot; which was the Washington DC side of the Franklin Scandal. It seems Stephens used the Gulf War as an opportunity to sweep the sex parties and midnight tours of the White House under the carpet, because there seems to be no news articles or details easily available regarding the outcome of the grand jury.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/2001-09-20-S-Hrg-107-603-Jay-B-Stephens-Senate-Confirmation-Hearing-as-Associate-Attorney-General-Serial-No-J-107-39-Judiciary-Committee-US-Senate-Sep-20-2001.pdf#page=72">this copy of the Senate Confirmation Hearing As Associate Attorney General document</a> we can find some interesting connections to the Clintons and also where he might tie into the current Pizzagate investigation.</p>
<p>I\'ve found a few interesting leads, but I haven\'t read the entire document to data mine it for everything available.</p>

<h2>Stephens Resume</h2>

<h2>The Connections</h2>
<ul>
