<p>Several puns related to cannibalism and/or pedophilia (&quot;are you hungry now?&quot; then a complicit gaze ; &quot;you\'re just seeing parts...of the body of work&quot; she then nervously laugh ; &quot;please enjoy&quot;, &quot;and I did enjoy&quot; ; etc)</p>
<p>She says that the song <strong>Bon Appetit</strong> is about sexually empowered liberation (my translation= &quot;we should be able to enjoy cannibalism and pedophilia, right?&quot;) while <strong>Chained To The Rythm</strong> is about mental political liberation (my translation= &quot;I can\'t wait for a satanic new world order!&quot;)</p>
<p>She says &quot;I love, you know, a consensual interaction. There\'s nothing wrong with that, we\'re all animals!&quot;. Ellen then replies &quot;nothing wrong with that... ga ga ga ga ga!&quot;... (To me, it sounds like she\'s imitating a baby... It\'s almost a confession in my opinion).
Katy then put her head down to laugh, is she embarassed of what Ellen just said? </p>
<p>The way she talks about consensual interaction looks to me like an argument in favor of normalization of pedophilia. Like, if the child is consenting, there\'s nothing wrong with it. (forgetting that a child can\'t &quot;consent&quot; to that sort of thing without being confronted to it first... So,  without a crime being committed first)</p>
<p>Katy then talks about her partnering up with <a href="https://www.bgca.org/get-involved/katy-perry"><strong>Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America</strong></a>. 
(<a href="http://archive.is/XDWRa">http://archive.is/XDWRa)</a>)</p>
<p>The logo looks a bit like two hands in each other and 3 bands each way. If someone can analyze it better maybe?</p>

<p>&quot;In partnership with Katy on her new “Witness” album and tour, we #WitnessTheFuture where all young people, especially those who need us most, can reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit : maybe I should post it in &quot;pizzagate whatever&quot;, not sure?! Some of it is my interpretation, but Ellen imitating a baby when they\'re talking about sex really creeped me out, that\'s why I decided to post it.</p>',

             They say the opposite...  (Although one could interpret it as a liberation
             <em>
              of the elite
             </em>
             ).  It also reminds me of satanic inversion of values.

            Why does fearful talk garner such enthusiasm? Could it be that the programmers have truly won out? Is the only thing that makes people engage their energy and attention, fear? Seems the answer is a big yes. What conquers this monstrosity is the opposite of what begat it. Ignorance, lack of compassion, holding money and wealth above all things, that is the nest where this all began. Ya'll did not know that there is an actual con-fucking-glomerate that runs this show right now, that is the ignorance. Ya'll did not know that lack of compassion is like food for cockroaches. It leaves rotting spirit that is ripe for take over. The best is last, money cures all ills. It would if it would cure the first two. Take stock, my fellow travelers. Wake up, compassion up and wise up. This is no dress rehearsal.

             Dude have you watched TV since 1994? It's all fearmongering and rage harvesting all the time. Americans (and those who consume American media religiously like me) have been MKUltra'd by the evening news. Manufactured compliance via continual traumatization.

              Yes, I have watched. I watched from when it was in black and white, TV that is. It started for me, the waking up, when I watched Watergate. I was around 9 or so. I was saddened but at that age, who knows what actually makes you sad about it? I was disappointed. Then I watched news reporters become people who were supposed to be unbiased, impartial and critical thinking kinds of individuals become opinionated. That was another bump in the road to awakening. Then I watched Hollywood become immersed in symbolism, like butterflies, and checker board patterns and symbolic gestures and colors. Then, are all the next steps that we all take to waking up to what you are surrounded by in each circumstance. We are all different. We wake up according to many things. After that lovely wake up, you get to actually start thinking for yourself. That is intention. My path will not be for all but I see similarities. Fear is the inroad to darkness, which begets more fear. Gotta stop the cycle somewhere. Fear is as good as any. Compassion for our fellow travelers is the antidote. This is no easy path. People think they have one career? They have at least two.

            that's an ellen thing from the beginning of her talk show days... originated from her saying 'right back at ya' when receiving applause from the audience... as she is a Comedian... it became and exaggerated - back-ack- ack... and eventually -ak -ak -ak..... inside joke kinda... but maybe you should do better research... like the many others here who focus on facts and actual research rather than grossly discrimatory trollish opinions and paranoia. 🔥

             At least i'm trying. :/ 
That said, I don't know her well and didn't know she used to say that. I will look it up.

              Don't feel bad.  I've even seen ellen a few times and I would have had no idea what that was, and when she did it, with her cute little face, it did sound strangely like a baby and seemed entirely inappropriate, and then she's got that audience so entrained, they shout with joy! at this weird signaling.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm glad that the other commenter explained it, that's why we have a community to draw from, but bringing it up and posting the video was still a good thing.  Dissecting pop culture is one thing we do (and I also think sometimes people go too far here with the celebrity bashing, but you didn't.)

            "we're all animals" was also said by a pedophile in a documentary while he was being secretly recorded convincing his victim that child rape is acceptable. Can't remember documentary title, it was about hollywood directors preying on child actors.

            She also seems a little manic the entire time. She's fidgeting and rubbing the chair while sitting. Maybe she was nervous, but she also wipes her nose at the end when she stands up and she seems a bit too hyped. Is she always this way? Reminds me of the famous Tom Cruise interview with Oprah except she didn't jump up on the chair.

             She gets more manic as the show progresses. She's literally screaming everything &amp; acting so bizarre.

                 Women's intuition. It's quite obvious she IS female. Only women look that way &amp; put on weight in the places she does. She just has strong features.

                    okay, that sounds very reasonable. this is a bit fringe but what do you think about the claims that hollyweird is filled with transgendered celebrities? i'm not really a believer but all the harping this one vid did on megan fox really made me do a second take on her....

                     By the law of averages &amp; how liberal Hollywood tends to be, some of them are highly likely to be. But Megan Fox is definitely legit female, as well.

                      really? even with the big (fore)head, jaw, broad shoulders? I admit upon review of a general image search of her, most pics don't look suspicious.

             It fits though.  Boys and girls clubs are for disadvantaged kids.  That's exactly the kind of children these kinds of people target.  The disadvantaged, the quiet, the introverted since they generally don't make a fuss, have limited resources and are left alone a lot and are more vulnerable.

             This makes me feel sick inside.  Nearly every moderately sized city has one of these.

              My friend's grand daughter goes to one.  We pick her up sometimes after a lunch date.  She is well taken care of and have 2 caring parents that both have to work. She is a smart kid, so I hope she is smart enough to evade the pedos.  I am sure she has been talked to, but it still worries me.
