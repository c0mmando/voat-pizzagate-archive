            Dutroux was paid to be the fall guy to keep all the high level pedos out of jail. Dutroux is the tip of the iceberg there were hundreds of powerful people who he could have helped prosecute but he kept his mouth shut he knew he would be dead killed in jail if he ever implicated any of the players above him.

            The only media outlet that I have ever seen publish the full quote from him after his conviction where he said he was just a small part of a much larger network involving rich and powerful people, etc. was al Jazeera. Everyone else chops that part off. I wish I had archived it last time I looked at it because I can't find it now.
