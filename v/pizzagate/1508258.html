<p>CHILD SEX SCANDAL ROILS UNICEF UNIT</p>
<p>By PAUL LEWIS, Special to the New York Times</p>
<p>Published: June 25, 1987</p>
<p>PARIS, June 24— The head of the United Nations Children\'s Fund in Belgium resigned today after the disclosure of a child pornography case linked to the Belgian branch of the organization.</p>
<p>A spokesman at Unicef headquarters in Geneva said the head of the organization\'s Belgian committee, Gilbert Jaeger, had resigned \'\'to show how angry he is about what has happened in his organization.\'\'</p>
<p>In a statement issued in Geneva, Unicef said it is \'\'deeply shocked\'\' by the scandal, which has led to 14 arrests in Belgium and others in Switzerland, France and Britain. Unicef said it was investigating charges that the Belgian committee was linked to an organization producing pornographic photographs of children and distributing them throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Unicef\'s mission is to help and protect the world\'s children. Like many other United Nations bodies, it has independent volunteer committees in all Western industrial countries to raise money for its activities - in Unicef\'s case, largely through the sale of holiday greeting cards. \'The First to Suffer\'</p>
<p>The Unicef statement noted that the organization spent $400 million last year on projects promoting the health, nutrition and education of children in developing countries. It is currently drafting an international convention for the protection of children\'s rights, to be submitted later this year to the General Assembly in New York.</p>
<p>\'\'The first to suffer from the discredit which would unjustly fall on this organization as a result of this affair would evidently be the children of the third world,\'\' Unicef warned in the statement.</p>
<p>The scandal erupted last week, when the Belgian police arrested Jos Verbeek, 63 years old, the director of Unicef\'s Belgian committee, and charged him with inciting minors to debauchery.</p>
<p>The arrest followed the discovery of a secret photographic studio in the basement of the Brussels building where the committee\'s offices are housed. The studio was used to take pornographic photographs of children, many of whom were of North African origin, the police said. #1,000 Photos Seized The police said more than 1,000 such photographs were seized, along with a mailing list of some 400 names in 15 European countries that had been prepared on the Unicef office computer.</p>
<p>Similar photographs found in several other European countries appear to have been taken in the Unicef office in Brussels, according to investigators.
Among those arrested was another Unicef employee, Michel Felu, 45, who the police say organized evening computer classes for children in the organization\'s offices. These children were then sometimes made to pose for pornographic photographs, the police said.</p>

            What boggles my mind is that these people think they will never have to answer for these crimes.  It makes me wonder if many of these high profile suspects were held at will to do these crimes and so they would be the scapegoat or patsy when everything gets exposed.

            John Ashe was head of UNICEF at one point and was ambassador to a country that had lots of Clinton foundation help in areas he would have been involved in. In the most recent case he was a defendant in, his codefendant was Ng Seng who had given money illegally to bill Clinton via proxy 1996. Ng didn't get caught but his proxy did.

            Parts of Belgium such as Antwerp, are now well over 40% Muslim immigrants. Looking at what Muslim immigrants did in the UK should lead one to guess what they are doing in Belgium as well.

             Immigrants probably have nothing to do with this. On the contrary:
"Research suggests that up to 50% of the unaccompanied children accommodated go missing from certain reception centres in the EU, and in many cases, information about the child’s whereabouts remains unknown. "

             Kanye is getting 'woke,' but he married into the Kardashians, one of the most Satanic families in Los Angeles. His career and fame come at a very steep price; I would be very surprised if he could ever leave that family unscathed.

            <p>
             A day after he talked about Pizzagate at his concert, he was 5150'd to UCLA Neurospychiatric Hospital, well known as a place you get taken to if you 'say too much.' Search Youtube for 'Kanye pizzagate.' Kardashians are major drug traffickers, notorious Satan worshipers with a deep appetite for human sacrifice. The original Kardashian wife published a diary showing the depravity of the deceased father and mob lawyer Robert Kardashian, of OJ Simpson fame, showcasing their dysfunction.

            A shady organisation that doesn't pay taxes, isn't liable for neutral audits, that gives positions to the most powerful politicians and business people and that has completely free and unlimited access to children in third world countries. Without much question or critique  they can send millions to 3rd world warlords as charity. Yep, nothing can go wrong here people.

             Great link.
I googled on 'CRIES "center for research and information on infants and sexuality" ' and that yielded 3 results. One to the same article; the second one maybe not so interesting, and the third one to this discussion:

            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Lots of information
             </strong>
             there; most unrelated to CRIES, but interesting anyway. Among others on pedophile UK MPs Cyril Smith and Leon Brittan. The latter served several ministerial roles in Margaret Thatcher's government, including Home Secretary.
From 1989 to 1999 he was a member of the European Commission; from 1995 he was a vice president.

              When you read shit like this it just blows your mind on the scale and scope. The William Colby to John Decamp quotes seem more prescient by the day. I can only hope that the awareness we can get via SM and the internet changes the game in a way not possible when Colby spoke about it. And its why we all continue to push, at least I know it's true for me. Godspeed ladies and gents.

             It actually makes perfect sense for this to be the case. If you want to be close to vulnerable children, you put yourself in an organization that's meant to help or guide children. No one will suspect a supposed child friendly organization is full of predators. They'd expect any predators to immediately be removed, but in order for that to work, there must not be an overwhelming majority of predators all working together to abuse children.

             It's actually really easy to figure it out with some of the most blatant ones but others are much more subtle. Don't let this make you think there are no real NGOs because that's just not the case. People risk and give their lives for others in many NGOs, even in the bad ones most of the ground people don't know they're doing shit. They think they're helping. Like nazi supporters thought they were doing good. You just need to dig to find the ok ones. MSF and theirc (rescue.org) are some of the best out there.

             "65% of Missing Children Europe's funds come from the European Commission Daphne Programme, and the remainder is collected through fundraising events, structural partnerships and membership fees." 
The only name I could find connected to this program was Antoni Vitorino. A Portugese EU comissioner.

             I wondered if there's more in Belgium per capita, or if it's a small country and they're sloppy,  or are there  more whistle blowers and citizen activists?
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at the Netherlands next door have a political pedophile party:
             <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/dutch-court-approves-pedophile-political-party">
              https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/dutch-court-approves-pedophile-political-party
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The Netherlands must be open and accepting enough to have a party,  so  maybe not as sloppy as  Belgium or not as many activists or    whistleblowers as Belgium?
The UK is full of pedo's in politics, and it's not a big country either -- not as many activists or whistle blowers?
            </p>
            <p>
             If nobody blew the whistle  we still wouldn't know about the Unicef   deal.
Still,  in all these  cases one or two people take the fall,  that seems to be their oath,  protecting the rest of the pervs.

            This is how they operate: They 1) partake in illegal activities, 2) setup the judiciary system to punish said illegal activities and rig this system in their favor, 3) setup organisations (like UNICEF) to "help" the victims of said crimes, 4) use the "victims" as a pool for human traficking and more illegal activities and finally 5) setup awards, trophies and medals that they give each other as to better laugh at us peasants.

             We discover in 1986 that Michel Felu used the offices of his employer, Joseph Verbeeck, Director of UNICEF Belgium to realize erotic and pornographic photographs of children. The more "soft" of these photos have been published in L'Espoir , the police are required to make excavations at Philippe Carpentier and other members of CRIES. She "discovers that the CRIES hides an international network of pedophiles that affects at least 18 countries". More than 4000 photos and tapes are seized, involving a hundred children. The images are taken and tours not only in the premises of UNICEF, but also in private apartments in Antwerp or Brussels where parents prostituted their children, and around the world. The lists of members of the CRIES are seized, and searches are carried out, especially in Belgium, the French police being uncooperative. Although all members of the CRIES have not participated in the exchanges and purchases of pictures and movies of child pornography , Philippe Carpentier and Michel Felu were sentenced in 1988 to ten years in prison for organizing the network

           <p>
            So he got just 10 years in prison, and oh, the French police were actually uncooperative? I thought arrests were made over this in France?
           </p>
           <p>
            And it was 4,000 photos? And also tapes?

            Wow.  Just more evidence.  So the general public isn't convinced by the disgusting instagram posts and corresponding comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actual documented cases such as this and Dr. Kidman and Gutman, the US Ambassador in Belgium and Saville and the Priests should be enough to convince them there's a problem and that children need us to expose it and bring down these monsters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Add in the "suicides" "one car crashes" and "plane/helicopter crashes" and there's should be no doubt left!  But no they still bury their heads in the sand

             To be honest I dont think the public really gives a fuck until the problem hits home.
And many ever believe trump created pizzagate or is a pedo trying to make a sweet ol lady like killary look bad and make a great man like obummer look like a pedo.

            Any chance EU officials are involved in this? Because so many of these things in Europe happen in Belgium and the EU headquarters is located in Brussels in Belgium.

            Good job. I really wish we had a masterlist somewhere that lists all these stories. The one thing that keeps this from popping open is the idea with a lot of people that it is just too crazy to be true.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore, cases like these are so important. We need that masterlist.
