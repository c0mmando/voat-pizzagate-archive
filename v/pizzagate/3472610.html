             Yep. I was mad because a Mossad asset had spent forty years raping American tweens to blackmail our politicians into bankrupting the country bombing brown kids. But I'm over it now. All better.

           </p>
           <p>
            We know this story is fake, because the NYPD did not seize weiner's laptop.  The FBI seized  it.  So the idea that the NYPD saw all this incriminating evidence and the FBI shut them down is pure hogwash.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the warrant to seize Weiner's laptop www.documentcloudDOTORG/documents/4465430-WEINER-Search-Warrant-2016.html#document/
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see plainly at the top that the warrant was issued by the the
            <strong>
             US District Court for the Southern District of New York.
            </strong>
            This is a federal court which means the laptop was seized by the FBI.  The local court would have been the court covering Manhattan which is the Criminal Court of County of New York

            He zooms in the name Paul Olson who died in a plane crash (Clinton Body Count believers claim it was a bomb) after talking to prosecutors about.  You can find info  on the plan crash on Wikipedia, just look up USAir Flight 427.  The plane did not explode in the air, but was intact before it smashed into the ground.  He was not involved in a case against the Clintons, but a man named Joseph Autullo.

           <p>
            And on and on it goes.  This not going to convince anyone, except those who already believe in all these things.  He shows video of Alex Jones and this video seems aimed at an Alex Jones type audience, folks who love to believe in all sorts of conspiracies.

           <p>
            Wow.  I thought this guy was pretending to be more sophisticated than this.  At 2:49 this dude is FLAT OUT LYING.  He doesn't respect his viewers at all.   He claims the Baptists arrested in Haiti in late January 2010 worked for the Clinton Foundation.  Clinton's State Department emails make it quite clear that nobody at the State Department knew who any of the Baptists were and had to look up the name of the group used in the press.  From there they found a document of local Baptist's Church website that identified them, but wouldn't learn that Laura Silsby was the one leading this group until later.

           <p>
            He makes a common and false claim that Epstein flight logs that came up during a lawsuit (he thinks they came up due to a federal investigation, but this is wrong) show president bill Clinton going to Epstein's "orgy island" 27 times.  This is false. Fox News looked this flight logs and zero of them show Clinton going to Epstein's Island.  And the times that he did fly on Epstein's plane correspond with known and public trips.   It's know that Clinton flew on Epstein's plane during a trip to Africa where he visited 5 countries, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Mozambique and South Africa.  This single tour, accounts for almost half of the "27 times"  because a flight log is everytime the plane takes off and lands.    So you take a round trip somewhere and the plane lands to refuel in another country on both legs, that's 4 flight logs even if you never get off the plane.

            He does point out that the woman who is suing Epstein for sex trafficking her when she was underage.  However he claims that she said Bill was at these orgies and must have known what was happening.  She makes no such claim.

            He mentions that folks start poring over Podesta's emails and don't really find anything juicy so they had to resort to baseless speculation about code words.  Yup.  That's the whole issue, there's zero evidence that any code is used in the Podesta emails and he stumbles right out of the gate. He show a 4chan post saying Cheese Pizza means child porn on /pol.   And here's where he falls flat on this face.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the reprobates on 4chan might enjoy this code, John Podesta never used it.  The phrase "cheese pizza" doesn't appear AT ALL, not one single time in Podesta's emails.  So his best example of code, is code used by someone else.

I just completely disagree with your interpretation of any of them.......this is part where I say  &gt;Jesus, he drops all logic here and is just showing instagram posts to the Benny Hill theme.

              Do you want to address the areas that you are flat out lying.  You claim Clinton Foundation employees were arrested trying take children over the border.  This is completely false.  You compound this lie by wondering why it wasn't a tremendous scandal.....it wasn't a tremendous scandal for Clinton at the time because none of the 10 Baptists worked for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had no idea who these people were until they were arrested and caused an international incident.

              This was a giant part of pizzagate, but we now know it is false.  The NYPD did not seize Weiner's laptop.  The FBI did.  This is supported by A. the federal warrant, B.  the affadavit the FBI agent sworn to to provide evidence for the warrant (i.e. is there enough evidence to believe a crime occurred.).  This document was released to Judicial Watch along with a whole host of documents on the case.  The DOJ IG report from 2018.  A whole chapter is dedicated to the laptop.

              I don't call this one a lie, because this while completely false, has been repeated and repeated, so it didn't originate with you. Zero of the flight logs show Clinton flying to Epstein's island. But you claim you are applying Asperger's to research, why don't you tell us what airports he did fly to.   You will find a bunch in Africa in 2002, I know because I checked these logs. Also a common mistake is that a single flight log equals a single trip.

             <p>
              I still can't get over that  also seems to think Besta Pizza was a place for Democratic Elites or that John Podesta is the famous art collector.  Have you ever seen the inside of Besta Pizza?  Look up Jack Posobiec visits Comet Ping Pong &amp; Besta to see it.  It's laughable this is a place for the elite.   This is particularly weird when Comet was a more expensive and more upscale restaurant and came with a chef's pedigree....Alefantis's old partner was well known in DC culinary circles.

             <p>
              Do I know this?  No.  Is this a possibility?  Yes, but I would say it goes beyond politicians.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also think that Epstein's methods were waaaaaaaaay more subtle than folks imagine.  I mean in 2002 Trump say he knew him for 15 years.  Does that mean Trump knew he was running a pedophile/blackmail ring?  I think he offered you use of his plane or donated money or threw a party with interesting people......and girls were there.  He didn't offer you a girl when you got there.  But if you were staying there and had some drinks and the girls seemed so friendly......that is I don't think Epstein made the move.  The Epstein move was putting people together and putting out bait.  Not everyone took the bait of even understood there was bait.   The guests were the ones who made the move and the cameras were rolling.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the idea if someone gets involved with a sex scandal that everyone who knew them, definitely knew of the scandalous behavior is just bizarre, people act different ways all the time.  You act differently in front of your mother than you do in a bar on Saturday night.  You act differently in the office than at a party or at church.   Unless you're like Charlie Sheen I would think someone who visits prostitutes would not want their close friends to know about that....wouldn't want folks who know their wife to know about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I more interested in your answer to my questions above....but what do you make the deal this Epstein was given by Alex Acosta....and why would Trump add him to his cabinet given that the thing he was most famous for was cutting this deal with Epstein?

                The document you point to is not an email, but an EMAIL ATTACHMENT and we know exactly how it got to Hillary Clinton's emails.  We know this because it's in the Hillary Clinton emails on the State Department website or on Wikileaks.

                Nobody at the State Department knew who these 10 Baptists were when they were arrested.  The document you point to, the New Life Children’s RefugeHaitian OrphanRescue Mission PDF was found on the Baptists' church website by a low level State Department employee after he googled the name of the group.  So the State Department was looking for answers and they were getting their info from the media

                 It's coming from Consular Affairs in Haiti and goes up the chain. Consular Affairs is part of the State Department's mission. It involves helping Americans arrested overseas.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Go look on the State Department website for this
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>

                 <p>
                  **One of the highest priorities of the Department of State and U.S. embassies and consulates abroad is to provide assistance to U.S. citizens incarcerated abroad. **The Department of State is committed to ensuring fair and humane treatment for U.S. citizens imprisoned overseas.

                <p>
                 The second hugely important thing to note is nobody at the State Department knows who these people are. They are identified at 10 AMCIT or American Citizens. The way the guy found the PDF that he attached to the email is by googling the name of the group arrested in Haiti. You can go to the State Department's website and read all the emails chronologically and see Silsby and these other Baptists were unknowns. In fact, there's no evidence whatsoever that Hillary Clinton or anyone else in Washington DC, had any idea at all about who Laura Silsby and this group of Baptists from Idaho were before they got arrested in Haiti
                </p>
                <p>
                 So YES, there is a lot of State Department Activity involved Laura Silsby's group and the State Department going up to the Secretary's level. But that is not because it was Laura Silsby. It was because a bunch of American's were arrested in Haiti, Baptist Missionaries at that, and assisting Americans arrested abroad is one of the core mission of the State Department. The reason it reached the Secretary's level is because this was an international incident. It made headlines around the world. Silsby was denounced at the highest levels of the Haitian government including by the Prime Minister. Baptist leaders were pleading with President Obama to get involved. The reason there is any connection between Clinton and Silsby is simply that Clinton was Secretary of State at the time of Silsby's arrest and it was part of her job. There was no preexisting relationship. Read that first email thread to see this www.wikileaks DOT org /clinton-emails/emailid/3765
                </p>
                <p>
                 The chain is 1. Consular Affairs in Haiti emails other State Department officials about a phone call saying that "10 Amcits from Idaho" were arrested. 2 Then Michelle T Bond who was the deputy assistant secretary of state for overseas citizens services forwards the first email to Cheryl Mills and others. She still doesn't know the name of the people involved, but she knows the name of the group
                </p>
                <p>
                 The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). Bill Bistransky found the attached "Plan of Action"(P0A) on their web site when he googled that name.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Cheryl Mills forwards this to Clinton. She just says "Heads up - will forward more as known"
                </p>
                <p>
                 Silsby is not mentioned in these emails. There's no indication at all that Silsby is the leader of these team. She is named in the PDF attachment which just says
                </p>
                <p>
                 Haiti Team: Laura Silsby, Charisa Coulter, Carla Thompson, Nicole &amp; Corrinna Lankford
                </p>
                <p>
                 The next email that mentions them is just called Update on Arrestees and includes no names again, but mentions they are from Meriden, Idaho www.wikileaks DOT org /clinton-emails/emailid/3752

                Yes, I will ignore it because at first the pizzagaters said we should be suspicious because of the emails, but the emails weren't suspicious.   So then they claimed claimed there was "code" in the emails and that was suspicous, except there wasn't any code at all, all of that was fake and the closest example of code was not in the emails.  Then they claimed Clinton knew some child trafficker in Haiti, except the wikileaks emails make abundantly clear that nobody at the State Department knew who these Baptists were until after they were arrested and the googled the name of the group and even then, they learned about them and their story from the press.  There was a big giant hoax story about about the NYPD grabbed Weiner's laptop and found all these evidence, except THE NYPD DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE LAPTOP.
               </p>
               <p>
                So every accusation has turned out to be a mountain of bullshit, but I'm supposed to be suspicious of something, some gleaming castle that you can only see if you climb up this mountain of bullshit.  Except you can't.  It's bullshit, you just sink into it until you're covered in it and then you every thing you see looks suspicious because you are up past your eyes in bullshit.

                  This is utter nonsense.   Jimmy was looked with utter suspicion from the very, very start and that's why determined political enemies of the Democrats like the folks who hung out in /pol/ and /thedonald CLAIMED his posts were creepy.

                 <p>
                  The crowd who made up pizzagate primed their audience to already be primed to view things as creepy.  Using politics and pedophilia --two of the most emotional subjects we have-- just absolutely overwhelm rational thought.   All these instagram photos are being looked at the end of a long chain of false claims
