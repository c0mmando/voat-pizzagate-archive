<h2><strong>Questions -</strong></h2>
<p>Was Madonna\'s \'Surprise, Impromptu Gig\', held on election day eve Nov 7, not so impromptu ?</p>
<p>Was there another event planned which didn\'t happen due to Dzhigurdu\'s cancellation ?</p>
<p>Did Hillary commission Dzhigurda to create an occult rite at Madonna\'s election performance ?</p>
<p>What did the Hillary project want Dzhigurda to help them with ?</p>
<p>What was &quot;Hillary Clinton is the Mother World&quot; project ?</p>

            Why did you take out the discussion of Thelmiac religion. This is direct evidence as seen in many emails from both HRC &amp; Podesta who reference "Thelma" John also has the number 14 &amp; the symbol of the fish on his palms This is the direct correlation to the Egyptian mythology of Osiris the god of the underworld. Osiris married his sister Iris and had a son... it gets worse. The number 14 involves  sacrifice ritual, then canibalism, then eternal youth.

             I agree it's important, and 100% relevant. I believe we're both on the same trails of research, and we both have more info to post in time.
            </p>
            <p>
             The thread is long already, I wanted to make it as simple as possible, and specifically about the meeting and connections between the people mentioned.
The post is all fact. If we had proof that Joseph Crowley was related to Aleistair Crowley that would be different, but we don't so far. Wish we did.

              There is proof of all things posted. Research Osiris &amp; eye of Horos. And the "Order" Aleister left his estate to. Who are members now? What is the third eye and what does sodomy of children have to do with it including MK Ultra tecniques but also stealing souls.

             I believe the white hats are doing everything they can.  I think they are assisting law enforcement in finding the pedos.  I think they will help take down Comey and McAbe.   I think they are behind the coast guard capture of the Lady Michelle.

            Just adding this in for fact checking purposes. Joseph Crowley is NOT the son of Aleister Crowley. As soon as I saw the name I immediately investigated.

             No one said son... believe relative has been mentioned. Also would it surprise everyone to learn some of the US political leaders since WW11 were actually given new surnames. Deeper than you think

              Worth the time for people to watch "From JFK to 9/11" on boobtube. There were a couple parts that had me scratching my head, but particularly in the beginning the history laid out is fascinating bc it's all researchable if people want to follow the trail of the surname changes after WW2. It really is engrossing from minute one.

              The information regarding his family history is a dead end after his father, other than the fact they are from Ireland and immigrated to the US. If they were actually tied to Alesiter Crowley, there would be plenty of evidence. I cross referenced all of his family names as well, including siblings of both him and of his father. There is nothing there.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, I wish there was. But there isn't. This is why I constantly post in this forum trying to get people to slow down and actually research things. The forum gets cluttered with bullshit and impedes the real investigation.

            Here is some more to add for you. Please archive. A. Crowley was a British intelligence officer worked directly with inner circle of Hitler in the dark occult of the Black Sun. There is more to release in good time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also this is not a rabbit hole of the occult that does not involve pizzagate. Crowley i.e. Dark occult that ties this together is the belief that children through sex, ritual, sacrifice leads to illumination. Justaposed with the deeper hidden belief elites can use children's blood, organs, or whatever they choose to gain eternal life. David Rockefeller died last night after his 7th heart transplant. G.H.W.B sent out a tweet of sadness. They are connected. Trust me

              The connection between the occult and intelligence agencies is a very interesting one.  A certain Mathis thinks its all a ploy, a distraction.  But there seems to be more to it.  But when you understand the occult mindset, Satanic inversion for example, things start to make more sense.  Firstly, deceiving people is at the heart of the dark occult.  To be a spy, it would certainly help to be extremely good at deception.
             </p>
             <p>
              Secondly, deception can  be very helpful in intelligence agencies' disinformation campaigns (professional lying/propaganda/omission of critical truths).
             </p>
             <p>
              Thirdly, an occultist can argue his occult activities were a cover for his intelligence work.   Aquino is a good example of this, he can say he was just pretending to be an occultist.

            As much as I like this post I still have to regurgitate FBI anons warning about getting lost down occult rabbit holes. Best I think we can achieve is to raise a body of evidence against each player to demonstrate that they are known occult practitioners. I don't think all the occult evidence in the world will send anyone to jail, that's why I repeat FBI anon s warning.

             I agree with all you've said here. All the occult evidence in the world won't send anyone to jail. It's not illegal to practice the occult, after all. Every little connection helps, as a body of evidence, and importantly, to use to redpill. I feel that when the
             <em>
              facts
             </em>
             mount up and become too much to ignore, it will reach tipping point where a majority will realize that they're being ruled by practitioners of the dark arts. This may be the catalyst which will bring about change.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for the reminder about what FBI Anon said.  It's important.

            Please add &amp; archive that R-Joseph Crowley is related to Satanist &amp; Majick dark Occultist Aleister Crowley who self-identified as "the beast" bearing the number 666.
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Crowley authored the Book of Law...precursercto Thelmiac religion seen in HRC &amp; Podesta emails. Thelmaic is based on Osiris in Egyptian mythology bearing the number 14 &amp; a fish symbol on the palm of John Podesta hands...denotes pedo &amp; cannibalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joseph Crowley spoke at the DNC convention and the aforementioned occultist (madonnas friend) tweeted out about it. This was captured and Wikipedia immediately scrubbed the historical truth of J. Crowley and Aleister. This was also archived in real time.

              The connection between the occult and intelligence agencies is a very interesting one.  A certain Mathis thinks its all a ploy, a distraction.  But there seems to be more to it.  But when you understand the occult mindset, Satanic inversion for example, things start to make more sense.  Firstly, deceiving people is at the heart of the dark occult.  To be a spy, it would certainly help to be extremely good at deception.
             </p>
             <p>
              Secondly, deception can  be very helpful in intelligence agencies' disinformation campaigns (professional lying/propaganda/omission of critical truths).
             </p>
             <p>
              Thirdly, an occultist can argue his occult activities were a cover for his intelligence work.   Aquino is a good example of this, he can say he was just pretending to be an occultist.

               Indeed. Satanic inversion, Black Mass, everything inverted - with pleasure.
Deception, as you so interestingly point out, would certainly be done with pleasure and I believe is.
              </p>
              <p>
               An interesting excerpt from an article I found, regarding Black Mass and the Satanic inversion -
              </p>
              <p>
               "The Sadistic glorification of causing pain to others for your own pleasure, and the ability of a Masochists to turn that pain into pleasure for themselves, goes right along with the motto of the Black Mass, “Demon est Deus Inversus” (“The Demon is God Inverted.”)
              </p>
              <p>
               The Black Mass is specifically a mockery and parody of the Catholic mass. It is meant to be officiated by an ordained priest, so that the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit can be called into the host wafer, and then defiled.
              </p>
              <p>
               Traditionally, everything in such a rite is done backwards. The priest has his back to the altar, the cross is turned upside-down, the Lord’s Prayer is read backwards, and the meaning of everything is inverted.
              </p>
              <p>
               The altar is supposed to actually be formed by the naked body of a female, and the Holy Host is to be humiliated by being placed inside of her nether regions. Instead of wine, the blood of unbaptized babies sacrificed on the fleshy altar was consumed.

                I remember one time I was explaining symbolism to some 'non-believers' and they said "Is there anything that ISN'T Satanic?"  And I said, "No, you don't understand at all.  Because any given symbol can be inverted, and therefore become a Satanic version of that symbol."

                 Indeed ! You know, it's surprising how many aren't aware of this. Maybe the reason that it's so prevalent now. I have a feeling we'll be having more and more discussions on this subject here on Voat, very soon. Stock the popcorn. I enjoy your posts btw! Thanks for sharing your wisdom.

              It is not that it isn't effective its just that its very likely to backfire. You are directly challenging god. No one in there right mind would think that is a good idea. For you to even acknowledge that magic works puts you in the assumption that there is something answering your calls/will/spell. You just put it out there. Something else answers. Something you can't see or measure. You can feel it with sensations in your body that is about it.
