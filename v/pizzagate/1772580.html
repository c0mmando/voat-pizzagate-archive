<p>&quot;The Clinton Foundation admitted Thursday that a 2010 donation from the Algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the Obama administration put in place with the foundation when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009.</p>
<p>The &quot;unsolicited&quot; $500,000 donation was made by the Embassy of Algeria &quot;immediately following the devastating earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010,&quot; the Clinton foundation said in an unsigned statement.
&quot;As the Clinton Foundation did with all donations it received for earthquake relief, the entire amount of Algeria\'s contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti,&quot; the statement said. &quot;This donation was disclosed publicly on the Clinton Foundation website, however, the State Department should have also been formally informed.&quot; &quot;</p>
<p>Funny that Clinton would &quot;forget&quot; to tell her own State Department about this donation, and just this one (that we know of).</p>
<p>Camp Clinton were not amused that Scarborough claimed this payment was to get them off the terror watch list, and looks like they got PolitiFact to help them rebut it.</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/50436">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/50436</a></p>
<p>But it would appear that, barring some serious scrubbing, it is true that Algeria was never on the list.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Sponsors_of_Terrorism">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Sponsors_of_Terrorism</a></p>
<p>Could Algeria have been attempting merely to lobby the State Department out of calling out their human rights record?</p>

<p>But I ponder another possibility, hence this thread and it\'s relevance to PG.</p>
<p>Algeria happens to be Tier 3 flagged in Trafficking in Persons reporting:</p>

<p>More specifically, &quot;The government demonstrated negligible efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims.&quot;</p>
<p>And yet, they discovered a child trafficking ring in 2009, believed to have been operating since the 90s.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22680856">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22680856</a></p>
<p>&quot;The network behind the alleged trafficking was reportedly composed of both French and Algerian nationals.&quot;</p>
<p>The trial didn\'t conclude until 2013...meanwhile, in France and other countries in 2010:</p>

<p>But Algeria apparently just wants to &quot;help Haiti&quot; by giving an &quot;unsolicited&quot; donation to the Clinton Foundation that she forgot to tell her own State Department about.</p>
<p>&quot;Help Haiti&quot;. The same Haiti where Laura Silsby and her missionary friends were arrested for trying to smuggle kids out of Haiti without documentation.</p>

<p>So, what\'s the deal, Algeria? Were you trying to buy kids, or encourage the Clintons to usher everyone to look the other way?</p>
<p>IMO, FBIAnon asked that we &quot;focus on the Foundation&quot; for good reason. This may be part of that reason.</p>',

            Does this add anything? From that voater who just mysteriously died: "Master LL Quant Dual is the name of a UBS client which shared the same postal address as LMR’s office but had a different and unusual name. I discovered trade contracts in the name of Master LL Quant Dual, counterparty UBS bank, in the scans folder of the shared drive, signed by Shane Cullinane. Therefore the claim that Shane Cullinane was not familiar with this entity is clearly a deliberate false statement. I strongly suspect that these contracts are not legitimate trades but may be US dollar payments disguised as trades in exotic currency derivatives, specifically “Non Deliverable Forward” contracts. The existence of all the trading in these instruments was kept secret from me during my time at the firm and these contracts contributed to our profits whilst not being factored into the risk and positions. I know this absolutely for certain as I wrote the bespoke system (referred to elsewhere in the proceedings as Risk Ninja) that calculated all of these. For these trades to exist in secret from me was a strong indication that they were not legitimate. When I investigated the contractual terms and how the market operated in great detail, I became quite convinced that these signed scans were evidence of money laundering on a large scale. There were dozens of these trade contracts in the scans folder with the contracts signed by Shane Cullinane; some on behalf of Master LL Quant Dual and others on behalf of LMR. 160. I was asked to represent a list of the currencies associated with these trades as US dollar in our bespoke system formerly known as Risk Ninja. The system calculated P&amp;L, positions and risk at a position level and across trading books. I can say with total certainty that the currency positions created by the trades in Non Deliverable Forward contributed to the profits, but were not accounted for in positions (they showed up as USD cash) or in the risk, where they were also treated as USD cash. At the time I was told that the repeated appearance of obscure currency positions, for example in Korean Won, was due to a bug in the upstream Sophis system and that actually these should be shown as being US dollars. I do not mean that a currency conversion took place at a conversion rate between the two currencies; I mean that a position of 1 million KRW from the upstream system would be treated as 1 million USD by Risk Ninja. To users of the system they would never see these positions except as USD cash. This was the case for all the currencies that were being traded in these contracts, but the existence of this trading was kept entirely secret from me. I do not believe that the trades that I have seen would make sense in the strategies that they were being booked in, and it is impossible that any legitimate trading should have been kept secret from me given that my bespoke system needed to model all our positions in all instrument types."

            Great Post. Check into Soros Connections to Albania. Child trafficking yes but organ trafficking as well. Believe Soros Open Society was involved or attempting to execute a coup in Albania like was done in Ukraine.

            Remember what FBIanon said dig into the Clinton Foundation and then he said Soros owns them all and owns the US government. And said what we find is sickening.

            Class piece of research.  Thanks given.  It's good to keep remembering Anon's recommendations.  When I think about the sheer scale of corruptions surrounding the Clinton Foundation and its patrons my head gets completely bamboozled under the volume of details involved.   We ought to compile some kind of list of all the individual components of what we have discovered in relation to both of the Clintons AND their foundation, for clarity and also to enable those not so attuned to examine the sheer volume of crimes attributed.

            Hmm, Bill also seems to indicate here that they received Algeria's donation two days after the quake. This means the donation was made prior to Silsby's arrest, FWIW.

            “Take the money from Algeria again?” he asked. “Two days after the Haiti earthquake, with all the money coming in and people still buried under the rubble, there are few countries in the world I would not accept for help to Haiti."

           <p>
            Of course he claims he gave it straight to the UN and they never ACTUALLY gave it to the Clintons, but I also have a lovely beachfront in Arizona I need to sell.

            I came across that fact back in November when the spirit cooking stuff and Podesta cannibal picture came out and it struck me that wherever human sacrifice pops up as a thing in history, cannibalism follows shortly thereafter. WTF?

             RE: the links you cited for Algeria and cannibalism: doesn't look like any of the cases were in Algeria, and the soldier you reference supposedly ate someone as a result of his PTSD experience (unless he witnessed cannibalism, which this story didn't mention). Countries I saw referenced were CAR and South Sudan. Same continent, different countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             With that said, we need more digging into Algeria.

              Sorry, I thought the one link was Algeria. I couldn't find the article I read back in the Fall...didn't have time while vetting posts. It's out there though. I was looking through the countries that don't have birth certificates, if I recall correctly.

            So fishy. It'd be one thing if it was a rich country giving money to help Haiti. But Algeria doesn't strike me as a country with enough that it can just fling it at every humanitarian cause.
