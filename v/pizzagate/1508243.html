            If you actually DID your research, you would have found out that there was NEVER any tribunal and it was "made" up. You also forgot to mention that than, Prime minister Stephan Harper knew about this all along. Man, do your damn research before copy and pasting shit. Get the facts straight.

             I’m Irene Favel. I’m seventy five. I went to residential school in Muscowequan from 1944 to 1949, and I had a rough life. I was mistreated in every way.
There was a young girl, and she was pregnant from a priest there. And what they did, she had her baby, and they took the baby, and wrapped it up in a nice pink outfit, and they took it downstairs where I was cooking dinner with the nun. And they took the baby into the furnace room, and they threw that little baby in there and burned it alive. All you could hear was this little cry, like “Uuh!”, and that was it. You could smell that flesh cooking….

              UNREPENTANT: Canada's Residential Schools Documentary
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              This award winning documentary reveals Canada's darkest secret - the deliberate extermination of indigenous (Native American) peoples
             </strong>
             and the theft of their land under the guise of religion. This never before told history as seen through the eyes of this former minister (Kevin Annett) who blew the whistle on his own church, after he learned of thousands of murders in its Indian Residential Schools.

            Growing up in canada we are never taught about any of this. Yeah we are taught that residential schools are bad because we are segregating natives, but nothing more.

             Same here, apart from the "the Europeans gave the natives blankets with diseases"  with the implcation that shit was a loooong time ago.

             My own family was caught up in the 60s Sweep (I'm part Native but so white I look more German than a lot of people born in Germany) and I never knew about that part of my personal history until recently.

              I grew up in newfoundland, so we have a much different history than the rest of Canada. Mainly because we were a soveriegn country until 1949. But still, we should be taught that.
