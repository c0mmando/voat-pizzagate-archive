<p>The U.S. Treasury -  &quot;First in line would be the government — in Epstein\'s case, several governments — which will collect any taxes owed on his properties and on his estate itself.&quot;</p>

            Trump signed an EO a few months ago that forces traffickers to give up at least a portion of their assts to the victims they trafficked.  Epstein had a lot of victims.  It'll be interesting to see what happens with his assets.
