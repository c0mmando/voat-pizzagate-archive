            Until you prove your assertions, you are just conspiracy theorists. Either way, it will be interesting to see what you come up with.

            I've seen the "fake rabbit hole" (wild goose chase) thing done on 8chan (/pol/) a little bit.. The shills will try to convince you it is some world-wide massive conspircy that has been in play for decades or centuries or some crap, to try to lead people away from just focusing on the here-and-now.. And they will point out tiny trivial random crap in pictures and say "This is a secret satanic symbol!" and start posting old lore about lucifer and crap..
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course that is better than 4chan's /pol/ where supposedly they are having their pizzagate threads deleted and giving people like 4-day bans for even asking questions about pizzagate..
           </p>
           <p>
            In the end the shills never win.. I hope we can elevate pizzagate to where small online blogs start talking about it (I think I saw one already earlier on voat) and then to where the bigger online media starts talking about it.. That is how you move it up the ranks and eventually end up with an FBI investigation..

            I know there are people much deeper in it then me but if there is one thing I can add it is this advisement.  Move all data to one or two very organized people.  That doesn't mean you can't share.  Do both.  We just need to consolidate the data in an organized way.  I don't know what wikileak's interest in this is but for the emails we had them to organize multiple sources.  We could not have pressured the FBI without that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also would suggest giving all data to wikileaks.  They may not be immediately interested in it but if some aspect of it sparks their interest it would be good for them to have a backlog of prior ignored information.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next thing is to get Trey Gowdy involved.  We need these prongs of effort because we've proved that they work.  Us, Wikileaks, Gowdy, Trump.
