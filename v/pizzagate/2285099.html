<p>Matt Lauer (from the Today Show for anyone else who hadn\'t heard of him before) has been accused of sexual misconduct by 10 different co-workers, who say that he has a button under his desk that can be pushed to lock the doors behind them. The insider who broke this information said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He couldn’t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people, because he’s Matt Lauer and he’s married. So he’d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn’t ever complain.”</p>

<p>I can source that claim <a href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/07/matt-lauer-love-children-accused-two-more-kids-mistresses/">here</a>, but you probably knew all this already.</p>
<p>Lauer\'s office is located fairly out of the way in Rockefeller Center, New York.

<hr />
<p>In the first article I linked, it is also mentioned that Lauer may have fathered 2 children who weren\'t his wife\'s.

It could potentially become a new indicator of a predator - by parenting children that aren\'t their own. </p>
<p>Oh, and to give the story a happy ending, his wife is divorcing him despite him begging for her to stay (although she probably knew all along).</p>

             lol yeah just found it several minutes before your comment xD
            </p>
            <p>
             I left this(or the original) one alone on purpose because of the Crowley mention... figured you had it handled on account of that.
            </p>
            <p>
             As much as Woody Allen warrants speculation(seriously, I concur, it does pop up in media references from time to time, it's sus), with respect, I don't give a shit what people think of Crowley lol - I've made it clear at the very least, that he has no claim to the knowledge behind Thelema. I know what I know(I suspect others know it too), others have painted their own picture, others don't know what to think.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't ask me to elaborate here, it might make a lot more sense soon, though.

             The first post was deleted for rule 3. If you don't like it apply to become a mod. I'd LOVE to know why you think Layer is exempt from PizzaGate, though. At the moment, we are both only speculating and neither one of us is more likely to be correct.

              Lauer is just your typical creepo CEO. They exist in every corporation. His shit has been known about for years, but only came out now as a valid excuse to get rid of him as ratings plummeting and need new blood.

               No hard feelings. This is a discussion, not a monologue and I appreciate the input of others. I'll take your word for it - for now, unless something else comes to light although I reckon we've heard the end of Lauer.

             Ha! Thanks for being the only one to notice! To be honest, it's a little discouraging the response that this got - I was called a shill
             <em>
              immediately
             </em>
             and then it was deleted. No one seemed to care when I reposted it. Shame, I thought it was an interesting perspective.

              Acknowledging patterns is usually the first step to discovery regardless of whether that discovery is nothing or if it's something. It's always good to be aware.

              I have a friend who's an atheist and claims to be redpilled. He says he's gone down the rabbit hole and I always tell him that he hasn't gone far enough because at the end of that rabbit hole is God/spirituality.

             I don't believe I am but it's possible that I got that detail wrong. Either way, it's an interesting factoid that Rockefeller Center is less than 2 hours away from where Crowley worshiped Thelema.

               Edit: the reason why it is strange is because Crowley only worshiped Thelema in ONE place in the entire US and it is that close to Rockefeller Center.

                I dont know if Lauer is into Crowley...but I will say Crowley has a huge following with the elite Jew art/music/movie crowd.  They hold him up to be the most important Occult figure of the 20th Century.  Only Levi and perhaps Blastsky in the 1800 gets anywhere similar treatment.
