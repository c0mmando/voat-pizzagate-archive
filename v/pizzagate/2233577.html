<p>TL:DR - Clinton has funnelled funds into a fake Wood factory owned by the founder of the Medcure body parts company (receives bodies donated to \'science\'). Stephen Paddock (LV shooter) was found by the FBI to have been paying regular visits to the company. Nevada has the most lax human remains laws in the US.</p>',

           <p>
            There's a lot of unsupported claims here, and a couple of stories, that are likely unrelated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Story 1: Manafort's money laundering / Russian collusion case is proceeding under a gag order.
           </p>
           <p>
            Story 2: Medcure was raided by the FBI for records, under a sealed warrant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Claim 1: There was FBI from DC, Los Vegas and Portland involved in the Medcure raid.
           </p>
           <p>
            Claim 2: The law firm of Perkins Coie paid $100,000 a year to Janis Locenieks, via her Wood Furniture PDX company.
           </p>
           <p>
            Claim 3: Wood Furniture PDX can't possibly be making wood furniture at a large mansion in Oregon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Claim 4: Stephen Paddock worked for the CIA
           </p>
           <p>
            Claim 5: Stephen Paddock smuggled guns and engaged in human trafficking
           </p>
           <p>
            Claim 6: Stephen Paddock made deliveries to a Medcure facility in Henderson, Nevada.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no way that every one of these claims is true, and yet somehow it ties together.
           </p>
           <p>
            [Paul Manafort -&gt; Christopher Steele -&gt; Fusion GPS -&gt; Perkins Coie -&gt; Hillary Clinton]
           </p>
           <p>
            [Stephen Paddock -&gt; CIA -&gt; Medcure -&gt; Janis Locenieks -&gt; Wood Furniture PDX -&gt; Perkins Coie -&gt; Hillary Clinton]
           </p>
           <p>
            A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link, do we have any proof that Perkins Coie gave money to Wood Furniture PDX even?
Or proof that Paddock ever had anything to do with Medcure, or the CIA?

            "Abel Danger" explained Stephen Paddock got  hi level comps &amp; free everything  at Mandalay Bay, as he filled the VIP rooms with members of a certain club. To belong one had to commit an extremely sickening sexual act which was always secretly filmed. Hence the supply of bodies needing to be quietly disposed of on a regular basis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recall there are secret underground tunnels connecting Mandalay Bay to VIP parking, private elevators and staircases to Saudi owned floors and to The Four Seasons restaurant.
           </p>
           <p>
            The perps face was replaced on these videos with anyone desired for the purpose of blackmail. Paddock's employer created the software tech to accomplish it.

            Exclusive: FBI agents raid headquarters of major U.S. body broker
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             FBI spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele confirmed the day-long search of the 25,000-square-foot facility, but declined to comment further because the matter is under seal. A person familiar with the matter said that FBI agents took records from MedCure but did not remove human remains.
            </p>
            <p>
             The search warrant, though sealed, signals that an FBI investigation of MedCure has reached an advanced stage. To obtain a search warrant to seize records, rather than demand them via subpoena, FBI agents must provide a detailed affidavit to a U.S. magistrate with evidence to support probable cause that crimes have been committed and that related records may be on the premises.
            </p>
            <p>
             “MedCure is fully cooperating with the FBI, and looks forward to resolving whatever questions the government may have about their business,” said Jeffrey Edelson, a Portland attorney who represents the company. “Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we do not believe that further comment is appropriate at this time.”

             MedCure expanding in Gresham as whole-body donation business flourishes
            </p>
            <p>
             "We are a clearinghouse for families focused on donating a body to science and medical researchers needing a body for their work," said Valere Beck, marketing director for MedCure. "The marriage of those two services is why we exist."
            </p>
            <p>
             Beck wants to make sure people know what MedCure is not. The company doesn't provide organs for transplant; regional nonprofit organizations coordinate those services with hospitals. It doesn't sell body parts; doing so directly is against state and federal law. Instead, MedCure and similar companies donate bodies or body parts and then collect fees for finding donors, testing tissue for infectious disease, transporting, tracking and cremating remains.
            </p>
            <p>
             "That's what we do: find people who want to donate," Beck said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beck said 20 percent of the company's business involves training doctors from outside the U.S., and the addition of the Gresham center will allow the company to expand that market. 
"There's a big niche for providing training for foreign doctors," she said.

             Thanks for that thorough work. Agree about Sorcha Faal, if I'd seen it from there I would have been more wary. The owner however is listed as the same person so that checks out.

             Also, Reuters said that they were able to buy two heads and a spine so the company is lying about selling body parts.

              Was the buying of the parts from that specific company? Here's the quote I saw from USA Today
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In the United States are not allowed to profit from the sale of organs intended for transplantation, e.g., heart and kidneys. However, the Reuters investigation showed that in most U.S. States to sell donated body or their dismembered parts, such as the hands and head, medical research, training and education, legitimately. The reporter bought two of the head and spine in Tennessee after a short correspondence on the Internet.

               Q: What should I do if a death has occurred or a patient or loved one is close to passing?
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                If someone has already passed, they can still become a whole body donor. However, MEDCURE should be contacted immediately to increase the likelihood of acceptance. Also, if a patient or loved one is currently receiving hospice care and/ or is close to passing, MEDCURE should be contacted immediately. Donation Coordinators are available 24 hours a day to assist in the completion and submission of necessary consent documentation.

              <p>
               Q: Am I eligible for body donation?
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                Most people who wish to donate are eligible. MEDCURE has no upper age restrictions and can accept donations from individuals with a wide variety of medical conditions. The most common reasons for ineligibility include a diagnosis of certain communicable diseases such as HIV / AIDS or hepatitis B or C, history of intravenous (IV) drug use, recent prolonged incarceration, institutionalization, or homelessness, and being severely over or under weight at the time of passing.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               Q: Is there really no cost to body donation?
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                Once a MEDCURE donor is accepted at the time of final transportation to a MEDCURE facility, all donation-related expenses will be covered. These expenses include transportation arrangements, one certified copy of the death certificate, cremation, and either the return of the cremated remains to the family or a scattering at sea.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               Q: Who is responsible for providing transportation to a MEDCURE facility?
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                Upon completion of the eligibility screening at the time of passing, MEDCURE will make arrangements for transportation and care. MEDCURE covers transportation expenses once acceptance is determined at time of final transportation to a MEDCURE facility. Donor families are encouraged to not contact a funeral home themselves at the time of passing.
               </li>
