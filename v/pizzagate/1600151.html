            Perhaps you misunderstand. You refer to 'happiness' or being 'happy' quite a bit yet I don't see how it relates to my comment. You may be reading into my statement a bit too much. I appreciate your perspective and respect another's understanding of reality but I disagree wholeheartedly; there are many good guys/gals out there in positions of power -- there was never a bubble to burst and I don't subscribe to defeatist and self-defeating beliefs. This coming from someone who asks people not to stop researching until they get to the J.Q., not some do-gooder kitten. Cheers.

             Interesting. How so? I remember reading what a senior detective had said somewhere; the best detectives go back over their first leads... over and over and over.

              Basing a lot on George Webb's content, presumed to be FBI intel. He claims that every false-flag shooting is handled by DynCorp...  Dyncorp had activities in Haiti, where Edgar Welch and his father were in 2010... the most recent Webb videos are speculating on how the Haitian trafficking use CPP as a showroom for the trafficked children. Not to mention Alefantis' DC connections to the Haiti gang, further connected to Dyncorp. I'm a couple videos behind, but I believe someone else has posted more on the CPP mentions from his recent video.

            The whole story of Edgar Welch's father is worth recalling. I may have it wrong. It certainly raises alarms that he was had something called Forever Young Productions making teen movies, (and I believe there are not too many degrees of separation between his IMDB and Alefantis's). But he also has a long and distinguished career in Law Enforcement and public service with some high contacts, and a particular (and church-based) concern for the young. In fact I know I heard, astonishingly, that he ran a child-protection NGO in Haiti. I don't have time to look at all your references, but I assume you suggest that Judy Smith would know more about it.

             Yes, the lines of the good guys and suspects are so blurry (honestly it makes me uncomfortable to research some of these people because it has a tendency to make one believe there are no more good guys, they're all corrupt -- which isn't true) because some of these people in similar, caring positions
             <strong>
              <em>
               have
              </em>
             </strong>
             , in fact, abused their power as law enforcement or CPS or Adoption agencies, etc. and some have not. When confronted with the question, 'Why does the Pastor have a treasure trove of porn videos?,' in which I and a friend had discovered one day, my grandmother replied, 'In order for him to preach openly to people about the evils of the world, he must experience some of it so that he knows.'  --
With Judy Smith, I'm suggesting that Alefuckle had contacted her/her firm for help and the 'shooter'/hoax/staged event/false flag/etc. was a direct product of that consultation.
