            Don't forget West Yorkshire Police.
You know, the ones who have just imprisoned Tommy Robinson for reporting on the Muslim rape gangs.
I'm sure it's just a Qoincidence.

            A suspicious "murder suicide" suspected to have been committed by a "Jack the Ripper Team".
           </p>
           <p>
            I just had a horrifying realization......
           </p>
           <p>
            What if the Judith Barsi murder had "Jack the Ripper Team" involvement.

            Title of his blogpost:
- mad hatter
- post entitled “I know my parents love me” 
I know my parents love me because they have shown me so much love. My mom picked me out of soo many panels at MAW on Sunday 4/25/2010. we talked and got to know each other and it felt so right. After a while i was gone because of rl for a while and she thought I had disappeared on her and my future dad who i had just met.

            Had a hunch regarding the Jack the Ripper stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems "Jack the Ripper" is an organized murder ring involved in false arrests, gang stalking, assassination, and murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            The original Jack the Ripper must have been such a group.

            This is complicated, but I think Stratfor served as the private intelligence network for the Deep State.  Yes, they had access to national level assets, but I think their access to analytical elements was far more limited.  Enter Stratfor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stratfor management is obviously involved in some nasty shit as evidenced by the cryptic email messages which give the appearance of involvement in trafficking.  If this is the case, I can envision Stratfor providing intelligence on issues ranging from geopolitical conditions; political changes; trade routes; currency issues; money laundering; etc.  All of this information/intelligence is needed if one is to run an illicit, global trafficking network.

              Stratfor was a recipient. Apparently from a source who doesn't favor BCC. It was the only message from the sender (

              Google that email address. There are quite a few threads about it. Sorry that I am not more helpful. On my phone and must go to work.
