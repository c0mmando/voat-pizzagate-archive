<p>George, Helen Vournas: Classic Power Couple</p>
<p>“This couple was very instrumental in Washington, DC right after WWII,” his NEPHEW, businessman and community leader, CHRIS VOURNAS, one time president of the Pan Arcadian Federation of America. George was very close to people in power, from highly visible movers and shakers like presidents and speakers of the House of Representatives to those with their hands on the levers of power whose names were not known outside the Beltway.”</p>
<p>other bombshells in this article: Both George and Helen met through OSS ties, George had his Greek citizenship taken away for fomenting rebellion, George had “a 200 acre farm” in Maryland where he hosted politicos including president LBJ, George’s FOIA request is 10 inches thick and heavily censored, George was a life-long bachelor until he met his wife.</p>',

            Alefantis and Stavro (the owner of Maple Leaf Gardens during the Maple Leafs pedophile scandal) both linked to Order of AHEPA
           </p>
           <p>
            please be sure to vote this up , this is very important The following video reveals that the family of the owner of Comet Pizza (James Alefantis) has links to a Greek secret society which is devoted to returning the world to the pre-Christian mores of ancient Greece, when slavery and torture of slaves were legal, and homosexual child slaves were owned by the ruling class, etc. The organization is named The Order of AHEPA. It is significant that Alefantis' family is linked, because Alefantis uses the homosexual Greek sex boy god Antinous as his avatar on Instagram.

            As we all know, this somehow always leads back to the Freemasons.  Drum Roll.    Also interesting how so many of these Pizza Places and Pizza Owners and Sports Owners as well tied in together.  I need to read stuff like this every once in a while to Refresh My Memory. Wow.

             I think Carmencita just made these AHEPA threads exponentially more interesting.  Not that they weren't interesting to begin with. Seems like a pretty solid pattern right up to Comet Pizza and Doktor Pong's trafficking and abuse network modus operandi, ingratiating themselves within SPORT like Jerry Sanducky's Second Mile

              Oh Yes, I found them VERY interesting and have not finished reading them yet.  I will do that.  But I immediately thought of the connection of Alefantis and the Greek connection.  There is so much info in the WORM Posts.  Thank You.

                I have to finish 2 more.  But so far this one is my favorite.  That is if I can say I enjoy reading about that, not really.  It is a quite nasty subject.  But interesting for the information you have provided.  It's hard to keep all of what we read in our heads, isn't it. You have really come up with a masterpiece, really.

               I'm currently trying to get part 6 re-instated in the series  (AHEPA &amp; THALASSEMIA

               it was removed due to claimed "disinfo" status").
              </p>
              <p>
               As soon as I get that reinstated (prove to the mods I'm not a Vampire/Adenochrome shill), I will be posting part 8, which directly connects to Canada &amp; Greece...(and yes it uses the exact same playbook as restaurants, hotels, masonic organizations, and TRAVEL AGENCIES)
