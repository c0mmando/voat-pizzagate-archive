            Not everybody who downvotes is a shill. Pizzagate is real because we looked at the evidence and came to a rational conclusion. Your post actually lacks evidence. For example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mike Pence's best friend is a pedophile. YOU ARE WHO YOU HANG AROUND M8.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            With 1/3 of politicians being pedophiles, they probably all have a friend who is a pedophile. It's infested. That does not entail that they know exactly what is happening. You need to have better evidence, sorry. And you do not specify how he defended Hastert. That would be interesting if true, but what was the context?

                  What is their to explain? You're shit posting the delusional ranting of a mad man. That's your case against Mike Pence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Last night it was David Seaman, or was it two nights ago. Yeah you soulless mother fuckers were told to discredit David Seaman. When that failed you moved on to Mike Pence. But there's literally NOTHING you could use against Pence so you went with the delusional rantings of man on his death bed.
                 </p>
                 <p>

                   Lol you don't have to defend pence everyone already knows he's a pedophile lmfao. You need a much stronger strong shill personality for the rate your paid bro.

                    If you're not a shill you can apologize here too. But you putting stock in anything Torry Smith said means you're a shill or an idiot.

            Also, it was reported after Trump announced Pence he had second thoughts and looked into picking someone else but decided against it as it would look bad.

            I'll say this, Pence was an establishment pick. I'd imagine recommended by Reince, who I don't trust for a second. I don't know whether Pence is a pedo, but we all know there are many among the establishment, and Reince at the least knows who they are. Reince, Ryan, Rubio McCain all want a more establishment policy, and Pence being a career politician I would imagine identifies more with them. Flynn would not be gone if the likes of Reince and Pence didn't push for it. At the very least the Rep Establishment is trying to get its way at the expense of Trump's will. Hopefully him sacking Flynn is just for the look, I'd imagine he's still talking with Flynn. I hope.

             Well. By that logic all shill spammers are valid pizzagate investigators. With the amount of posts. On this board it's only evidence which bears any value. If you're so high and mighty, I'd have thought you'd know that by now. Sure this is a throwaway, but theres nothing to your claims.

                 HAHAH alright its a known fact around the chans that if wiki, IA's or Trump do not deliver within a reasonable amount of time their will be protests. Not from the Left (Antifa), but this time by the mighty bible thumpin right in washington. But we don't think that will happen because sessions will deliver :)

             I've even seen a video of Sessions scooting his granddaughter past Biden when Biden tried to embrace her as if Sessions knew he was a creepy fuck.  I'm assuming Sessions knows a lot of them are pedophiles for sure. That could be exactly why he want's to go after them, doesn't mean he's a pedo, same could be said for Pence too. The original post here reads like it was written by a freshman in college.

            Yeah there are very few people who hang out with pedos and don't know it, especially since pedos tend to hang out together. He needs to be looked into. Follow the road where it leads

            I think you're going too fast. My advice is slow down and wait for evidence. These spooks keep contradicting each other.

             Just pointing out this guy is very active on the Pence defending. See my comments on his other thread, he also responded very quickly to my suggestion that Pence is not above scrutiny.

              No problem, I don't mind. I'm just a truth-seeker. I was "quick" because I'm not busy today (unfortunately). Here's the thing. How is Trump going to redpill the public on Pence (if indeed he is dirty) and keep the whole apple-cart steady? I think it would be rather 'revolutionary' level, but perhaps that may be the case. Would have to go long guillotines.

              It reminds me of the old quote from Louis XVI upon being informed in 1789 that the French people had stormed the Bastille. The King asked, “Is it a revolt?”
             </p>
             <p>
              “No, sire,” the duke replied, “It is a revolution.”

               The public already is redpilled on pence. They hate him he shocks gays. it won't take much for the masses to catch on. The final nail in the coffin is when Dems oust pence and Trump didn't even have to do anything.

                The public is redpilled on Pence? The public isn't redpilled on much of anything are they, except for Trump? Shocks gays? A lot of candidates have shocked gays. But Pence has publicly stated he wasn't against gays. Not being ornery, I promise.

              It's a CIA account. Every time they post its going around on 4chan now all you do is downvoat, then reply 
-IA Shill 
to identify them so people can move on and the comment gets shoved to the bottom. They are striking hard because they know this Pence narrative is true and if it gets spread they are toast. People (both dems and Repubs) were already not in favor of Pence before the election it won't take very much to blow up this bigbomb. If it hits MSM pence will have to resign quickly. It will also result in the congressional switch where all the neocon repubs will band together and try and impeach trump. You will see based non pedo dems come out of the woodwork to defend trump.

               Bopper is a "CIA" account?? I can assure you I'm just an old guy w/ a desktop and not much more :)  (Though I have been around the block a few times and do know some 'high-level' people - in the family.)

                The point is trump doesn't still hang out with Jeffrey Epstein or Bill Clinton. In fact he banned epstein from his Maralago club. However, pence still hangs out with baker who is a pedophile

                 Yes, I'm aware of the Epstein banning rumours, but again this is all high level fuckery and I am reserving judgement in the absence of good information. I do find Pence a bit suspicious. I am hopeful for Trump and Sessions, I refuse to put my faith entirely in them.

            Are you sure? Why infer that he is a pedophile because one of his best friends turned out to be a pedophile? Is Donald Trump a rapist because he used to be friends and went golfing with Bill Clinton?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Pence has a history, with Kucinich and Cynthia Mckinney, of wanting child traffickers to be prosecuted, and it is legit. Why didn't you mention that?
           </p>
           <p>
            However... if he defended Hastert after Hastert was busted, that's a different story. Can you explain the precise manner in which he defended him?

             Yes it is very common for pedophiles to jump to "prosecute" other pedophiles in court and make sure no juicy details get out of the "investigation" on the bigger operation going on plus it is part of initiation to show loyalty they take cases to get each other off so they get little to no sentences. Trump very well could be a pedophile as well and this whole world is doomed, but I'd like to not think so. You are right we must continue to question everything and everyone, however, Trump has proven time and time again to openly speak about pedophiles and child abductions, something Mike pence has never spoken about or we haven't decoded it. Trump mentioned it at the Al Smith Dinner, he mentioned it on the campaign trail about jeff sessions. As far as Bill Clinton goes Trump may not know everything about Bill or does and just had no power to do anything and Trump being president was the only way for him to fight back. As far as I'm concerned with regards to Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton. Both of them like to ride on airplanes and are rich and like to play golf. So what many people would like to do that not all of them are pedophiles.

              Maybe Clinton rode the Lolita Express 26 times to chat with Epstein about shady things and relax on the beach, and he had just had a very unlucky coincidence. But pizzagate is a thing partly because the Clintons and other elites just have so damn many unlucky coincidences. Too many, I think, to be mere coincidences by someone who just fancies flying and golf.

              We have multiple respected people saying different things. Steve p and Robert Steele. I'm not sure which is right. But if what you say is true then certainly trump knows it, even Steele said he has his memo. I'm not sure about pence yet. So far I don't see any proof but it's a good angle to consider and scary as fuck because they will just kill trump

            Yes but think about the impact if trump openly knows the situation behind pence. Trump plays dumb and stays patient as the arrests climb up the pedo ladder. Pence being last on the list. Trump has the Trump card which is the American people going to war for PREZ if he is assassinated. The only wild card i haven't put together is Blackwater because they are the SS detail for trump. We have to remain vigilant and win the media war because it is the people that are giving trump his leverage. Our guns are what are keeping anyone from trying anything hasty on trump. And on trumps end he must purge evil so that they cannot detonate nuclear weapons. According to Torypill though we don't have to worry because the galactics got our back :)

            I have been yelling Pedophile at my TV every time he appears.  Why did Trump choose him?  I would think Flynn (since he was advising Trump) would have spilled the beans?  This is what puzzles me.
