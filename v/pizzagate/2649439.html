            One thing to add, seems Giustra contributes articles to the papers up here in Canada. He writes in the articles about how the powers of the world are commiting crimes around the world and that the average citizen is too pre occupied with their own Instagram posts and their social media 'to care'. A real douche bag posturing as a humanitarian. Sadly, most Canadians fall for it the same as the women in America fall for Hillary Clinton's retoric about caring about the rights of women. This is the game plan of these creeps. Rape and pillage resources around the world and then pretend to care. Real sociopaths!!!!!!!!!!!!

            This man is beyond twisted. Sticks his nose where it doesn’t belong, open borders, bankrupt the countries, go in fuck it up and abuse more kids. You really have to decifer what he says and read between the lines because he doesn’t speak truth. Yes, El Pedo his “children’s charity” with the boy lover pedofile sign in blue in front of the building then removed a day or two after he was called out on it. Remember the pic of him and his loser buddy standing in front of it giving the thumbs up sign? Fucking pigs. We know he has a few other BOYS charities in Vancouver Canada like the Sandusky pay for play to donors and sponsors. Boys from broken homes, poverty and the foster system. Everyone knows Frank Guistra is a boy loving pedofile and an evil man. A Freemason and oh so proud of it too. Doesn’t he have some sauce company for olive oil and pasta sauces? I’d hate to think of what the ingredients are that are put into those sauces. I wonder where he was last night for the blood moon satanic sacrifice? Sadly, this boy diddler has a couple kids too. Hypocrite, thief, liar, pedofile, scammer.... this “man” is revolting to say the least. Even Isis, Horus and Set think he’s a piece of shit. People need to wake up.

              Hi, I’ve commented about Guistra on nearly every single thread he is in. He is hated by MANY. If u are ever threatened by his associates - or I would have to speculate, the Hells Angels MC (since he is a Mason and this is who they use) - then please document it so everyone knows. Things don’t get deleted if u make a video on Bitchute if u choose to. I’m sure I know who u are as I’ve seen a number of ur interviews in regards to ur kids. Ur story and many others similar to it make us all so angry. I don’t know how old ur kids are now but I hope that they will one day understand their father always loved them and tried his best but the forces of evil were most times too great. However, time is to ur advantage given that one day they will seek the truth about their dad. How this man could have a hand in tearing away a father from his kids is beyond comprehension even to do to a dire enemy. And this man has kids of his own. There is no need to have u killed and it pisses us all off thinking about these kinds of threats to good people with good positive intentions in this world. They will soon feel a wrath greater than any other before them.....

            He is scum scum scum. Hi Frank! Know your people read this on Voat. I am here to tell you ...you are scum. You took ownership of a company I was starting called Lionsgate. How did that happen? You or your crew want to tell me? Are you good buds with John A Hardy, who was my partner in a film production company he insisted on calling LionsGate/ Did you hire a team of losers to break in my homes, my storages and steal all the paperwork I had? Huh? You had me blacklisted (actually now I am grateful the more I learn about Hollywood) and harassed for years. slander, every kind of low blow only scum like you could think of? Fuck you Frank, if you did this to me, I can only imagine what a evil sociopath like you would do to an innocent child.The worst things you have done are yet to be uncovered. Long after I am gone, the truth will come out.

            Its easy for these uberwealthy folks to lament the separation of parent and child of illegal immigrants  when their only contact occurs by way of hiring gardeners, nannies, etc for substandard wages without the perks of Soc Sec  contributions, health insurance, child care for their brats, paid vacations.

            When one has multiple homes all over the world like Clooney , you need access to semi -slave labor employed from the ranks of refugees and immigrants.  The middle class cannot be taxed to death to pay for the integration into our society and the rich wont do it unless they can keep some human nuggets for themselves. I've  commented on Clooneys sexuality previously and I  suspect he has a long simmering appetite for teenage boys which doesnt conflict with his marriage to a much younger  androgenous woman.
