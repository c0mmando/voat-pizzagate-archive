            CNN is scum.
           </p>
           <p>
            CNN also just leaked what that fat disgusting slob Tester alleged. How is broadcasting unproven facts about someone appropriate? Couldn't they have done the bare minimum of journalistic standards and waited until the Secret Service verified the scurrilous lies? And the traffic accidents were also easily proven if CNN had actual journalists on their staff instead of assets who talk out their ass.
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone ever is looking for an example of what not to be when you grow up to their kids, they just need to turn on CNN.

            Clapper did not leak the dossier.  Nor does the House Report say that he did.  This is what they found

            They are not saying he lied to Congress.

            Here's the discussion, you find this by searching the report for Tapper

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             CNN reported on January 12, 2016, that President-elect Trump was briefed on classified information indicating that the Russians have compromising personal or financial information that the Russians
could use against President-elect Trump..... former Director of National Intelligence
             <strong>
              James Clapper admitted that he confirmed the existence of the dossier
             </strong>
             to the media 
.....
When initially asked about leaks rel~ted to the ICA in July 2017, former ONI Clapper flatly denied "discuss ling] the dossier [compiled by SteeleJ or any other intelligence related to Russia hacking of the 2016
eledion with joumalists."~5 Clapper subsequently acknowledged discussing the "dossier with CNN journalist Jake Tapper," and admitted that he might have spoken with other journalists about the same topic.45
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Footnote 45 says
 Regarding his communication with Tapper about the dossier, Clapper stated: "I don't know exactly the sequence there, but It was pretty close to when we bri~fed it and when It was out all over the place. The media had it by the way. We were kind of behind the power curve, because the media, many media outlets that I understood had that, had the dossier for some time, as did people on the Hill."
           </p>
           <p>
            CNN did not publish the dossier.  Buzzfeed did.

             inconsistent testimony is a nice way to daru that the initial statement is a lie.   i stand by that assessment.
            </p>
            <p>
             cnn was confirming the existence of the dossier before buzzfeed published it, and tapper was one of the first users of the term "fake news", which is truly ironic.
            </p>
            <p>
             point is that that's not clean media.   it's not honest reporting and it's definitely not decent politics.

            So, you're saying that the Tappers are friends with alleged Pizzagate extortionist James Alefantis, who used his mysterious DC power to force Clapper to feed info to Jake Tapper to advance his career at CNN?
           </p>
           <p>
            So the "journalists" are in the driver's seat?
           </p>
           <p>
            That seems unlikely to me, but maybe.

            What else do we know about Jennifer Tapper?

             i'm asking that, and it seems a stretch - but consider that clapper 1) disclosed the information, 2) lied about it, and 3) cnn/tapper covered for him by not naming him as a source.
            </p>
            <p>
             which would be worse:  clapper doing this of his own volition, or clapper doing this because he was forced to?
            </p>
            <p>
             (also - point of clarification - i'm not saying that the journalists are in the driver's seat...my own expectation is that the journalists and the politicians are both being equally "driven")
