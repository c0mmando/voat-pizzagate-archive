<p>According to figures provided by the Public Health Ministry to the Embassy on 04 Feb 2010, a total of 29,467 people had received vaccinations of various sorts (e.g., for diphtheria and tetanus) and another 13,612 had received &quot;medical attention&quot; from &quot;mobile units&quot; by 25 January. Another 848 had had &quot;mental health consultations.&quot; Slightly more updated figures (as of 03 Feb) were available regarding the number of people who had been hospitalized at some point: A total of 6,720 had received &quot;medical attention&quot; in hospitals, according to SESPAS. However, by 04 Feb 2010, just 633 persons remained hospitalized in &quot;health facilities of the Public Health Ministry,&quot; said SESPAS. Of those, 225 are reported to be at the camp in Fond Parisien, Haiti (reftels A - C). The next largest group (129) is at the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; medical facility in Jimani, where there is also a 26-bed municipal hospital or clinic. (Note: In Fond Parisien, the facility is a field hospital, with over 200 injured Haitians, located on the property of a faith-based NGO called &quot;Love a Child.&quot; It is managed by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. </p>

            .  I hope you are taking the time to make archives of all these source links before posting them via archive.is or archive.org or both. I notice Voat is having trouble staying online again today. Even wikipedia links should be archived, and the archives posted here.
           </p>

            I will give this the Help! flair to see if we can get folks to pitch in and post archive links to all the sources in this submission.

            can we look at Science Applications International?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             his return to the U.S. from South Africa. He became a protege to Bill Patrick, considered by many to be America's leading bioweaponeer and the holder of several secret patents for the anthrax weaponization process. Hatfill was involved in numerous Pentagon "black" projects through his role as a consultant for Science Applications International, and the Pentagon appears to have been pleased with his work. The Pentagon seems to have been largely unaware of Hatfill's growing problems at work -- including his loss of a security clearance after a failed polygraph in the summer of 2001. Again, we see a case of one government agency not knowing -- or pressing to find out -- about the security concerns surfacing in another federal agency.

             What I Learned By Joining Justin Bieber's Church
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I'm watching a cross between Bill Murray and Bradley Cooper in all-black: a COS-style scoop-neck top, slim-fit trousers and suede desert boots. The man looks primed to deliver a TED talk, but his charismatic oratory is met with cries of "amen" and "preach it!" from faces lit up blue by the neons that surround him. He's not just talking, either. He's in rapture, his words are rough. It begins to sound like the creepiest dirty talk.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I'm saying—what I'm telling you—is you messed up coming to church tonight," he growls, "cause God's about to wreck your little jungle life."
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The man is Jentezen Franklin, founder of the ministry Free Chapel in Gainesville, Georgia.
             </strong>
             Tonight
             <strong>
              he is the headline act at Hillsong
             </strong>
             , which, every Sunday, holds four services at London's 2,000-capacity Dominion Theatre. It's on Tottenham Court Road, wedged between a Garfunkel's, a Dorothy Perkins and a bunch of Crossrail-related road-works.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hillsong isn't a normal church. It's the international pentecostal mega-church that Justin Bieber allegedly quit his world tour for. It's been called "trendy," noted as an example of "hipster Christianity" and compared to "an Urban Outfitters stock room explosion."
            </p>
            <p>
             As well as attending Zoe Church Conference, set up by pastor Chad Veach—an occasional Hillsong preacher who is so close to Bieber that Bieber has a tattoo dedicated to Veach's daughter—Bieber's been hanging out with other Hillsong preachers Judah Smith, founder of the Seattle's City Church, and Rich Wilkerson Jr, founder of Vous, an LA-based church. His closest friend in the church, though, is Hillsong's New York City lead pastor Carl Lentz. Justin first met the skinny-jeaned, unnecessarily-bespectacled preacher in 2008, and in a recent Instagram post on Bieber's account Lentz snuggles so close that his Dov Charney-style lensless aviators dent Bieber's cheek. The caption reads: "THIS IS MY DOG TIL THE DAY I DIE .. he's the biggest Brodog. ride or die.."
            </p>

             The pair were just as close at Australia's Hillsong Conference. Check out this one Hillsong-approved interview where Bieber, sitting between Veach and Lentz, wears a grey marl tracksuit bearing the slogan "Young &amp; Free", the official name of the youth wing of Hillsong, and proclaims: "I just enjoy seeing people worship, praising God," before cleaning his teeth with a mini toothbrush. Wilkerson is interviewing, and he's patient, having had practice after sitting through the 45-minute groom's speech at Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's 2014 wedding, which he officiated. Bieber then rests his head onto Lentz's shoulder and says, "I just want to love people more, I just want to love Carl more," before adding: "I just think my faith grows every day, so my faith is stronger than it was two years ago: better, stronger, wiser, kinder."

             Yes he told me if the full story behind the CIntons involvement with Deaconess was ever revealed it would take them down.

            <p>
             Yes Rick Scott is filth. He was bailed out by Jeb B after hitailing it out of Texas on charges. Jeb B was on Tenets board but quit to run for Pres. His dealings there were eye popping. Type in Jeb Bush Tenet Health are and American Thinker and read it and weep. I found news even for myself and the Wolf and I had researched this for mos.  45 Deaths at a Tenet Hosp during Katrina. Drs admitted they had given shots to some patients. Murderous Scums.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The camp that houses 35,000 of Haiti’s earthquake homeless is a sprawling mess of tarps and bedsheets, of steamy air and brimming latrines, of people who’ve lost everything — houses, possessions, family members — yet whose first thoughts concern the children.
            </p>
            <p>
             “No child in Haiti is in school now,” said Jacky Coutia, a member of the camp’s leadership committee. “There are so many children here, they’re just racing around.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Coutia was talking to some visitors to the camp, built on a former military airfield in battered Port-au-Prince. Among them was Louise Ivers, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Haiti clinical director of Partners In Health (PIH) , the nonprofit group that runs mobile clinics there. The camp houses about 12,000 children, evidenced by homemade kites fluttering overhead and a pickup basketball game nearby. The camp also has several trained teachers — who could start a school if they could find tents for a classroom.....
            </p>
            <p>
             East of Port-au-Prince,
             <strong>
              near the Dominican border, is the field hospital established under the leadership of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative in Fond Parisien

            <p>
             As the recovery begins, Harvard affiliates will keep their sleeves rolled up. Roles will be played long term by Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) faculty members, including Joia Mukherjee, assistant professor of medicine and a Brigham and Women’s physician, and Paul Farmer, who holds appointments at both HMS and HSPH and who is also a physician at the Brigham. Along with Ivers, they work through Partners In Health, which Farmer co-founded decades ago and which has lengthy experience providing health care in rural Haiti.
            </p>
            <p>
             Roles will be played in the intermediate term by figures such as Hilarie Cranmer and Michael VanRooyen of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI), who also have appointments at HMS and HSPH and who willed a field hospital out of the dried grass outside Port-au-Prince in the weeks after the quake. S. Allen Counter, a professor at HMS and in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and director of the Harvard Foundation, recently worked on the shelter problem by procuring and distributing 150 tents to homeless families in Port-au-Prince, a follow-up to an earlier relief trip.
            </p>
            <p>
             The field hospital, an
             <strong>
              HHI-led collaboration with the University of Chicago, Love A Child, and other partners
             </strong>
             , provides broad-based care for earthquake victims, including amputations, skin grafts, treatment of infections, and physical therapy.
             <strong>
              There are special teams for unaccompanied minors
             </strong>
             and outreach teams to identify those whose medical needs are unmet, and to improve local health care capacity.

             ..Jennifer Scott, an instructor in obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School and an obstetrician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, worked at Fond Parisien in mid-February, spending half her time at local clinics.

               Soros had been bragging for years about his longstanding scheme to stage a "hostile takeover" of the Democratic Party. It was Soros money that catapulted Howard Dean into the chairmanship of the Democratic Party, following his failed bid for the 2004 Democratic Presidential nomination. After the defeat of Sen. John Kerry in November 2004, Soros launched the Democracy Alliance, a behind-closed-doors cartel of billionaires, who pooled their funds to establish a parallel Democratic Party structure, modelled on the Soros-bankrolled "civil society" revolutions in such locations as Ukraine, Georgia, and Serbia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Soros's bankrolling of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili's "Rose Revolution" has drawn recent media attention, after Saakashvili's murderous attack on South Ossetia, which nearly triggered war between Russia and NATO this Summer. What was largely ignored in the fog of the Russia-Georgia war was the role of British Foreign Office figure Mark Malloch-Brown—Soros's longtime British partner and "handler." First, as head of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and later as vice chairman of both Soros's offshore Quantum Fund and his Open Society Institute, Malloch-Brown was Soros's full partner in all the filthy Caucasus endeavors. It was only at the point that Soros was about to take a lead role in launching Obama's Presidential campaign, that Malloch-Brown went home to "Mother" and became the number two man in the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
              </p>
              <p>
               But until that moment, in mid-2007, Malloch-Brown was Soros's 24-7 link to the British Crown for more than 20 years, a role that earned the Foreign Office mandarin his British knighthood.

             <p>
              Keeping track of vaccinations remains a major challenge in the developing world, and even in many developed countries, paperwork gets lost, and parents forget whether their child is up to date. Now a group of
              <strong>
               Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              </strong>
              researchers has developed a novel way to address this problem: embedding the record directly into the skin.
             </p>
             <p>
              Along with the vaccine, a child would be injected with a bit of dye that is invisible to the naked eye but easily seen with a special cell-phone filter, combined with an app that shines near-infrared light onto the skin. The dye would be expected to last up to five years, according to tests on pig and rat skin and human skin in a dish.
             </p>
             <p>
              The system—which has not yet been tested in children—would provide quick and easy access to vaccination history, avoid the risk of clerical errors, and add little to the cost or risk of the procedure, according to the study, published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.
