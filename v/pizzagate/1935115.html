            It's a really good theory if you have no idea what you are talking about.

           <p>
            A.  Your use of DNC is just silly.
           </p>
           <p>
            B.  Antifa and hardcore Berniebros are not Democrats.  They are further left.   Way further in antifa's case.
           </p>
           <p>
            C.  The baseball shooter voted for the Green Party.  The Green Party got 1.07% of the vote in 2016.  Plain loopy to think this guy was influenced by the DNC.
           </p>
           <p>
            D.  Your theory only works if you cherry pick your villains.
           </p>
           <p>
            Explain how these recent events fit into your theory.

             Hhm, it's kind of like you cherry picking evidence of molten metal in the basements of the WTC. One day there is molten metal and then a few months later there ISN'T any motel metal.

             Just for the record do you think there was or was NOT molten metal in all the basements of the WTC?

              Many, times I tried to explain to you that steel is a type of metal, but not all metals are steel.  And many alloys present in the WTC have much lower melting points that steel.  One of them is aluminum.  Tons of aluminum were delivered to the WTC that very day.  At speeds around 500 miles per hour.
Oh and the exterior of the building contained millions of pounds of it as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              You should also look into the technical difference between heat and temperature, because once you understand that the fact that the heat persisting as long as it did shows it came from some source other than thermite which expends its energy very quickly.
              <br/>
              The long term heat was from the many, many combustible materials present in the buildings and the energy generated by a hundred million pounds of building crashing into bedrock and the fires being protected by the pile itself
             </p>
             <p>
              Thermite would also leave tons of other tell tale evidence that was not present at the WTC.
             </p>
             <p>
              For one, the white hot bright light of thermite reactions would be visible for miles and easily distinguishable from the flames.  (You would need tons of thermite to accomplish the job.)
             </p>
             <p>
              For two, thermite reactions leave easily identifiable evidence because a thermitic reaction spits little drops of molten metals all over the place.
             </p>

             </p>
             <p>
              These molten bits would form irregular wierd shapes like this when they cooled that would be seen when the steel was examined.

              Thermite would also be very difficult to work with.  It's unpredictable and would not result in the simultaneous structure failure that occurred at the WTC.   It also requires an exceeding high temperature to ignite.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thermite is usually ignited using magnesium ribbon.  The temperatures of the office fires would have ignited this long before the towers fell..  There would basically be no way to setup an ignition system all around the WTC that withstood the fires for an hour and then all ingited simultaneously.

               That's where I stopped reading. You forgot we've been over this before. Aluminum if heated hot enough is HIGHLY flammable. In fact Aluminum is sometimes used in solid rockets for that very reason. You know what a solid rocket motor is don't you AreWeSure?

               <p>
                Also I have no idea what the molten metal consisted of.  There's no reason to believe it's steel.  Metals from wires and electronics melt very easily.   Thin metal like wires melt a lot, lot easier than bulk metal.

            It is MUCH more likely that the "shooting" was a FF to ensure that the House's gun legislation FAILS.
           </p>
           <p>
            The House hearing that was scheduled was CANCELED because of this "shooting." Proposed legislation was to ease restrictions on SILENCERS, etc. Now it is doomed to fail.

            MY PREDICTION: Rep. Scalise, from Louisiana, the state known as "Sportsman's Paradise," will become the MALE COUNTERPART TO GABRIELLE GIFFORDS. He will do a 180 and suddenly be "pro gun control." He was only "shot in the leg," not "the head" like she was, so his ACTING JOB will be much easier than hers.

             We will see.  I think the future congressional seats are more important than a bill about silencers, grips, etc, because that can be undone, and the most pressing problem for the DNC is the anger, apathy and split they are suffering currently.
