<p>Vitaly Churkin, a former Russian UN ambassador died in New York last  Monday from a heart attack.  There are rumors around the internet that he was poisoned (<a href="http://archive.is/hd2pL">http://archive.is/hd2pL)</a>) but you can read the full story of his death here <a href="http://archive.is/39tTu">http://archive.is/39tTu</a>

<hr />
<p>Churkin also spoke out against &quot;Pussy Riot&quot;, a Russian feminist protest punk rock group based in Moscow.  Here\'s what they look like <a href="http://archive.is/IaZq4">http://archive.is/IaZq4</a> and here\'s what they look like when they dress up as witches to support Black Lives Matters (I guess that\'s a thing) <a href="http://archive.is/dOIuK">http://archive.is/dOIuK</a></p>

<p>It\'s gonna take a little backstory to understand why Churkin would care about a punk rock group and how the Clinton\'s and George Soros are involved.  The band actually has a rather interesting story.  
</p>
<p>The group consists of 11 girls and they got famous by performing protest songs in public places that were often off-limits such as government areas or churches.  They went viral in 2012 when they performed a sacrilegious performance at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow aimed at the clergy and President Putin.  2 members from the band were arrested and spend 21 months in jail for &quot;hooliganism motivated by religious hatred&quot;.  The band members felt they were wrongfully imprisoned and that they were a victim of &quot;fake news&quot;.  This quote from a New York Times article says it all:</p>
<p>*Leading up to Ms. Tolokonnikova’s trial, Russian news reports carried suggestions that she and her bandmates were <strong>pawns of Hillary Clinton’s</strong> State Department or **witches working with a global satanic conspiracy *<em>— perhaps linked to the one that was behind the Sept. 11 attacks, as lawyers for one of their offended accusers put it. <strong>This is what we now call “fake news.</strong>”</em>  <a href="http://archive.is/K3eWp#selection-2185.0-2193.158">http://archive.is/K3eWp#selection-2185.0-2193.158</a></p>
<p>Politicians and human rights groups from the west got involved and criticized Russia\'s actions.  US ambassador Samantha Power was one of Pussy Riot\'s advocates, and Churkin blasted her after the release of the imprisoned band members by saying:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I would expect her to invite them to perform at the National Cathedral in Washington,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;Maybe they could arrange a world tour for them, you know.  St. Peter\'s Cathedral in Rome, then maybe in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, ending up with a gala concert at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. So if Ambassador Power fell short I would be disappointed,&quot;</em>  Here\'s a link to the full exchange between the two: <a href="http://archive.is/2WVfE">http://archive.is/2WVfE</a></p>
<p>The story of Pussy Riot made them a perfect face for the &quot;Purple Revolution&quot; that took place these pats months.  Read this infowars article if you aren\'t familiar with the Purple Revolution  <a href="http://archive.is/HbvOI">http://archive.is/HbvOI</a>.  It\'s basically an anti-trump movement funded by George Soros disguised to be seen as pro-femminsm -lgtb -rights -etc.  This brought them much political fame and even support form the Clinton\'s themselves.  They were featured at the Clinton Global Initiative University and met with Hillary Clinton at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner as well as at the &quot;Women in the World Summit&quot;.

<hr />
<p>Now the Soros connection.  Shortly after the election, George Soros launched the &quot;Purple Revolution&quot; that I mentioned earlier.  The Clinton\'s dressed in purple many times after their defeat to promote the movement.  Pussy Riot has received direct funding from the US State Department and is indirectly funded by Soros (<a href="https://joequinn.net/2014/02/26/pussy-riot-a-grotesque-creation-of-the-us-state-department/">https://joequinn.net/2014/02/26/pussy-riot-a-grotesque-creation-of-the-us-state-department/)</a>).  Relevant quote from the blog:</p>
<p><em>Oksana Chelysheva is the coordinator of Pussy Riot’s support campaign in Finland  but she is also a member of the steering committee of the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum (CSF).  The CSF was established in Prague in 2011 with the help of the Open Society Fund Prague which is funded by George Soros. Chelysheva also Deputy Executive Director of the Helsinki-based Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, which is directly funded by the National Endowment for Democracy. So at least in Finland, Pussy Riot’s coordinator is a high-level member of several ‘open society’ organisations that receive funding from either the US government or George Soros.</em></p>
<p>The blog also has videos of the group sticking chickens up their nether regions in supermarkets.  Yep...chickens.  I didn\'t follow the link all the way through so I can\'t attest if the video\'s are still there.  Somebody braver than me can look into it if you wish.  
</p>
<p>Alex Soros (George\'s son) has posted multiple photos of the two on instagram:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/56kcY">http://archive.is/56kcY</a>
<a href="http://archive.is/1CW5Q">http://archive.is/1CW5Q</a>  (Chicken\'s in vagina confirmed comment: &quot;philipnightLololol <strong>remember when she shoved the raw chicken up her vagina??</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Pussy Riots music videos have some very interesting themes...specifically organ trafficking.  Here is their latest anti-trump video &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; (I\'ve cued it up to the part about organ harvesting)</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/s-bKFo30o2o?t=3m49s">https://youtu.be/s-bKFo30o2o?t=3m49s</a></p>
<p>And another one with a fitting title &quot;Organs&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTmNxp3e4m4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTmNxp3e4m4</a></p>
<p>This group is acting as a pawn in the Clinton/Soros agenda to desensitize us and normalize perverted acts such as sticking animals in places they shouldn\'t be.  I believe the use of chickens had a symbolic meaning and follows along with some of their instagram photos and youtube videos.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>I\'ll finish where I started...the story of Vitaly Churkin, the Russian UN ambassador who dies last Monday.  Perhaps he died from a heart attack, or perhaps it was not an accident.  We will probably never know.  But the fact remains that Churkiin spoke out for Donald Trump and against the Clintons and the punk bands they support.</p>
<p>The last time that Churkin made headlines was in support of Donald Trump when he denounced  Zeid Ra\'ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who called Trump a demagogue.  Here is the quote:</p>
<p><em>&quot;He should stick to human rights,&quot; Churkin said of Zeid. &quot;He should not be criticizing foreign heads of state and governments for their policies. This is not his business. He should be more focused on his specific responsibilities.&quot;</em>   <a href="http://archive.is/lsJ7j#selection-339.0-339.232">http://archive.is/lsJ7j#selection-339.0-339.232</a></p>
<p>Clinton\'s camp responded by issuing a statement that may have been a major catalyst to the &quot;fake news&quot; stories about Russia that have dominated the media the past couple of months.  
</p>
<p><em>&quot;This is not only strange -- it\'s scary,&quot; Jake Sullivan, Clinton\'s primary foreign policy adviser, said of the Russian complaint to the UN. &quot;A major party candidate for the presidency of the United States is being protected by the Kremlin. Wow.&quot;</em></p>
<p>President Trump responded to Churkin\'s death by saying: <em>”While American officials sometimes disagreed with their Russian counterparts, Ambassador</em>* Churkin played a crucial role in working with the United States on a number of key issues to advance global security.** The President offers the condolences of the American people to the Russian people and government.”*  <a href="http://archive.is/Rn0aS">http://archive.is/Rn0aS</a></p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that the Clinton\'s weren\'t doing the same thing in Russia that they were doing in Chinagate.  Especially after reading what Doug Wead had to say about it in his new book:</p>
<p><em>\'Clinton encouraged American tech companies to help fund Skolkovo, the Russian version of Silicon Valley\', Wead explains.
\'In return, Skolkovo raised millions of dollars for the Clinton Foundation\'.
But Hillary took that relationship with Russia one step further.
\'Her State Department approved a deal that allowed the Russian government to control almost 20 percent of America\'s uranium production. The company involved, Uranium One, donated $2.6 million to the Clinton Foundation\', Wead states.</em>  <a href="http://archive.is/DsJZO">http://archive.is/DsJZO</a></p>
<hr />
<p>So there you have it.  6 Russian diplomats killed in less than 60 days.  Something isn\'t right.  Combined with the recent death\'s in the Chinagate scandal (see John Ashe) and I would say we have a full fledged genocide against anyone who knows the Clinton\'s deep dark secrets.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I could really use some help digging.  Two places you could look would be first to look into are the other 5 (really 8) dead Russian officials and second to look at the instagram accounts of the other 10 members of Pussy Riot.  The names of the other deceased Russian\'s are all in the Zero Hedge article.  I haven\'t been able to find a full list of Pussy Riot members, please let me know if you find one.</p>',

           The blog also has videos of the group sticking chickens up their nether regions in supermarkets.  Yep...chickens.  I didn't follow the link all the way through so I can't attest if the video's are still there.  Somebody braver than me can look into it if you wish.

           Pussy Riots music videos have some very interesting themes...specifically organ trafficking.  Here is their latest anti-trump video "Make America Great Again" (I've cued it up to the part about organ harvesting)

           This group is acting as a pawn in the Clinton/Soros agenda to desensitize us and normalize perverted acts such as sticking animals in places they shouldn't be.  I believe the use of chickens had a symbolic meaning and follows along with some of their instagram photos and youtube videos.

           I'll finish where I started...the story of Vitaly Churkin, the Russian UN ambassador who dies last Monday.  Perhaps he died from a heart attack, or perhaps it was not an accident.  We will probably never know.  But the fact remains that Churkiin spoke out for Donald Trump and against the Clintons and the punk bands they support.
          </p>
          <p>
           The last time that Churkin made headlines was in support of Donald Trump when he denounced  Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who called Trump a demagogue.  Here is the quote:
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            "He should stick to human rights," Churkin said of Zeid. "He should not be criticizing foreign heads of state and governments for their policies. This is not his business. He should be more focused on his specific responsibilities."
           </em>
           <a href="http://archive.is/lsJ7j#selection-339.0-339.232">
            http://archive.is/lsJ7j#selection-339.0-339.232
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Clinton's camp responded by issuing a statement that may have been a major catalyst to the "fake news" stories about Russia that have dominated the media the past couple of months.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            "This is not only strange -- it's scary," Jake Sullivan, Clinton's primary foreign policy adviser, said of the Russian complaint to the UN. "A major party candidate for the presidency of the United States is being protected by the Kremlin. Wow."
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           President Trump responded to Churkin's death by saying:
           <em>
            ”While American officials sometimes disagreed with their Russian counterparts, Ambassador
           </em>
           * Churkin played a crucial role in working with the United States on a number of key issues to advance global security.** The President offers the condolences of the American people to the Russian people and government.”*
           <a href="http://archive.is/Rn0aS">
            http://archive.is/Rn0aS
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           I find it hard to believe that the Clinton's weren't doing the same thing in Russia that they were doing in Chinagate.  Especially after reading what Doug Wead had to say about it in his new book:
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            'Clinton encouraged American tech companies to help fund Skolkovo, the Russian version of Silicon Valley', Wead explains.
'In return, Skolkovo raised millions of dollars for the Clinton Foundation'.
But Hillary took that relationship with Russia one step further.
'Her State Department approved a deal that allowed the Russian government to control almost 20 percent of America's uranium production. The company involved, Uranium One, donated $2.6 million to the Clinton Foundation', Wead states.
           </em>
           <a href="http://archive.is/DsJZO">
            http://archive.is/DsJZO
           </a>
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           So there you have it.  6 Russian diplomats killed in less than 60 days.  Something isn't right.  Combined with the recent death's in the Chinagate scandal (see John Ashe) and I would say we have a full fledged genocide against anyone who knows the Clinton's deep dark secrets.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I could really use some help digging.  Two places you could look would be first to look into are the other 5 (really 8) dead Russian officials and second to look at the instagram accounts of the other 10 members of Pussy Riot.  The names of the other deceased Russian's are all in the Zero Hedge article.  I haven't been able to find a full list of Pussy Riot members, please let me know if you find one.

            Another red herring. Pussy Riot is a female Russian punk band who hates Putin and has been around for years. Yes, they're publicity whores who love hanging out with any famous people they can. There's nothing satanic or witchy about it, and everything hacky and celebrity-hungry about it.

            If you're not willing to watch videos that disturb you, don't make claims about them. There was one video link on the site, and the link went to a video that doesn't play. Some quick searching didn't turn up any other videos of the topic, so I'm assuming the link was bullshit to begin with.

            Update: the "chicken in vagina" thing was a completely different group called Voina:

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voina#How_to_Snatch_a_Chicken">

            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On 20 July 2010, Voina staged one of their more notorious actions in the Nakhodka supermarket in St. Petersburg. A female Voina activist nicknamed "Vacuous Cunt With Inconceivably Huge Tits"[27] removed a chicken from the refrigerated section of the supermarket, then laboriously stuffed the entire chicken into her own vagina, while being filmed by other Voina members. She then shoplifted the chicken by leaving the supermarket without paying, with the chicken still inserted, and rejoined activists outside the store.[28] The activists held signs spelling out the word "bezblyadno", which translates roughly as "without whoring", a reference to the group's rejection of paid employment and preference for stealing food, and a pun on the word besplatno, "free (of charge)".

             'Pussy Riot', or 11 Russian women between the ages of 20-33, has received direct moral support from the US State Department and likely indirect financial support, and appears to be one aspect of the US government's decade-long attempt to undermine Russian society and its president, Vladimir Putin.

             NED-funded Oksana Chelysheva of the US State Department-funded "Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, who is also coordinator of the 'Pussy Riot' campaign in Finland.For the last 30 years the US State Department has created and used phony NGOs in many countries as an advance guard for 'regime change'. Funneling $billions into 'student' and 'activist' groups in foreign countries, the US government attempts to carefully prepare the local population for 'revolution' that is not of their making and has nothing to do with improving their lot (if indeed it needs improving) and everything to do with getting rid of a, usually democratically-elected, leader of a sovereign country because, in one way or another, he or she refuses to roll over and play dead for 'pax americana'.

             I'm pretty sure several Voina members went on to form Pussy Riot so the mistake is understandable.  The group is fucking disgusting.  They are also a 100% totally fake band. I don't mean like Monkees fake.  Those guys had actual musical ability.  Ever listened to any Pussy Riot albums?  The only song they have was made with the assistance of the corporate media.  They are still Voina just posing as musicians.
