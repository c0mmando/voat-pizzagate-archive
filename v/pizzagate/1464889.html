            The main thing is these instagram images are being intentionally omitted from the conversation, because while not damning they are certainly suspicious, hence all the suspicion aroused. If you did this in front of the place, it would probably piss off the normies who haven't seen these images and don't want to, but they would then be forced to admit that they haven't actually debunked anything. It's putting them in a damned if you do damned if you don't spot - they don't want these images widely seen, so by framing the distribution of these images as helping to debunk the theory, they can't very well call you out on it without admitting that the images are suspect

            I mean redirect their energy in the sense that we are taking their narrative "this has been debunked and the believers are crazy" and flipping it to "you'd have to be crazy to think this is debunked"
