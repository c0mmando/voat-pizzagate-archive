            Crime can't exist without the cooperation and protection of corrupt government.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this case, CIA is a branch, if not a controlling influence on our government ....
and MKULTRA was funded by our US Congress.

            Interesting article by "Anonymous Patriots."
           </p>
           <p>
            There must be more to it as well, obviously, such as foreign governments operating rogue cells within each faction of the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, my parents were involved in CIA black ops, and, they met with Vladimir Putin back in the day.  In my opinion, he appeared to feel uncomfortable around my parents.   As a matter of fact, my best recollection is that the person above my mother, who was in charge of all the terrible things they did, was a Russian government person (not Putin.)  So in my estimation the Russians must also have copies of everything the cult my parents were in did (for example, Boys Town, blackmailing notable people, Satanic-themed snuff film parties where the murders were blamed on John Wayne Gacy, and perhaps on other so-called "serial killers" as well.)   I don't know how this could have happened, maybe the CIA thought my parents were working with the Italian mafia on these things not the Russian mafia, who knows -- and never bothered to confirm anything my dad said.  He has a charismatic way that affects people.
           </p>
           <p>
            This also sounds outrageous but I will say, I suspect my parents were actually "triple agents," CIA, Russia, and France.  My memories of the forgotten parts of my life are limited, and I don't have addresses, dates, times, nor photographs.  But I remember more all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just thought I'd add that about foreign governments.  Take it with a grain of salt, as my memories could be inaccurate.

            Ted Gunderson and John Decamp were fighting this pedophilia plague 30 years ago and spoke of FBI and CIA agents being used to collect the kids and protect the perverts. Enough is enough !

           <p>
            The first thing I read:
“The economics of a child being sold into sexual slavery are such that it is very lucrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            A child in the sex slave business has a useful expected lifetime of two years. They fail to thrive in that setting. They die of disease, neglect, abuse and giving up.
           </p>
           <p>
            The kids are killed if they are seriously hurt, refuse to work, or become too jaded to attract customers. They are almost never freed by their owners because they could talk. It is a dead end occupation usually.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one takes a child like that to an ER because the sexual abuse might come to light. They are expendable goods that the owners don't expect to last anyway. If they are boys, they might grow up up to be a pimp. Some children run away, but they are often re-captured by other pimps. If they come from another country, they have no papers and poor language skills. If they are picked up by the police, they are detained for months to years and deported, often back to the same war zone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some were child soldiers or child spies before being forced into sexual slavery. Even without that, they have disabling Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome intentionally inflicted in them in order to disable them and keep them from being able to run away successfully.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The most lucrative aspect is the blackmail/brownstoning. The power of the people photographed with one of these kid is consigned to the cartel, be it local law enforcement or a sitting president. That is why this apparatus is so entrenched and difficult to fight. The tragic life and end of the victims must be vindicated.
