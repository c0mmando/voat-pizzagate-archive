<h2>Background of the commercial</h2>
<p>The commercial was to be first aired on February 3, 2013 during the Super Bowl according to <a href="http://archive.is/pSbCI">The Bahamas Weekly</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/xjivc">David Copperfield.</a> </p>
<p>However I have not found it listed anywhere as such, <a href="http://archive.is/ESb5B">for example.</a> </p>
<p>The ad was created by the Zimmerman agency and directed by Nigel Dick. </p>
<p>It was most recently aired three days ago on August 26, 2017 during the PGA Tour on the Golf channel <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4339/36088314353_0af4dd9828_h.jpg">bringing the total airings to 513.</a></p>

<h2>Prime Minister of the Bahamas Perry Christie (2002-2007 and 2012-May 2017)</h2>
<p>Perry Christie reportedly spent a lot of time with at least one <a href="http://archive.is/RWIMk">alleged pedophile and former senator, Trevor Whylly,</a> and at least one drug dealer.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Pea88">Christie, center, pictured with Bill Clinton</a> in this article, with two seemingly ticked off young girls and a boy with a dazed look. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2>The segment with the children was filmed on David Copperfield\'s property</h2>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/xjivc">According to Copperfield</a> the commercial featured his property.</p>
<p>He owns the 11 &quot;Islands of Copperfield Bay&quot; <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4414/36090220213_2bb8dac61c_h.jpg">which include those named Secret, Forbidden, and Lucy,</a> and the resort island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511022813/http://www.mushacay.com:80/html5/#/home">Musha Cay</a> with <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4416/36090176833_65bb504040_h.jpg">rates starting at $39,000 per night for up to 12 people.</a></p>
<p>According to Forbes magazine Copperfield said he wanted to purchase Musha Cay because when he drew a line from Easter Island (by the way, known for all ages murder and cannibalism) to Stonehenge (a presumed human sacrifice spot), and one from the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan (an area of former all ages human sacrifice and cannibalism) to the Great Pyramid of Giza (ancient Egypt\'s religion was witchcraft), Musha Cay was at the intersection.   Source <a href="http://archive.is/kndSh">page 1</a> <a href="http://archive.is/8iuBW">page 2</a></p>
<p>He told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/yvqm4y/the-magicians-retreat-234098-v20n8">Vice</a> he is finishing a <strong>three-acre underground area</strong> on Musha Cay called The Secret Village.  </p>
<h3>Is the underground amusement park/zoo actually that large and if so, what operations that size and larger lie beneath some other private islands around the world??</h3>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>By the way, I have found no mention of a school or children\'s organization in the Islands of Copperfield Bay.  </p>
<p>Copperfield does run <a href="http://archive.is/WSRnN">Project Magic:</a> &quot;Project Magic is an innovative program that uses magic as a form of therapy for people with physical, psychological, and social disabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>I\'m going to be honest, I started out wanting to hate David Copperfield but after reading about him for two days I started to wonder if he was an unknowing victim of some program.  Coincidentally someone posted the book Programmed to Kill today.  His father was <a href="http://archive.is/OOwTv">in the military.</a></p>
<p>Anyway I have no answers but just thought I should post this concerning information.</p>

             But, yes, you bring up a great point, other islands may have horrific areas under the ground for that kind of torture and who knows what else.  The size of it, three acres, that he told the Vice reporter, really surprised me.  I wonder if it is that large, I guess that's possible, or even larger, under an island.  But in the interview he did at times joke with the Vice reporter and his friend, such as about a fountain of youth, and holes that go down to the ocean.

              Sure, the zoo may be an innocent "ego collection" for Blaine, but I personally don't agree with zoos and believe that anyone who keeps exotic animals should have unannounced inspections multiple times a year. One thing to remember is that the exotic animal trade has financially surpassed the drug trade, so I can only imagine that those who are involved with the exotic animal trade might be involved with human trafficking. Gotta know how to ship them so they arrive alive, you know?

               I am personally against zoos too.  And I had forgotten I read on Voat about the sometimes connection between wildlife shipping and human trafficking.  Thank you for the reminder.  Awful stuff.

                Yes, horrible indeed! You're welcome for the reminder, and I'm also wondering if his islands, or a few of them, are outfitted with cameras and audio equipment in order to conduct blackmail operations like Epstein's island.

                  Isn't it funny how they want us to believe that Russia and other countries are a threat, but when it comes to their work in the shadows and the space station, they're always friends?
