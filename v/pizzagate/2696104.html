            I think the charges were stopped at the state level so the feds could prosecute for bigger and better........
Kinda like the Awans in fla.  clear state charges then the federal gov can come in etc.

             Quite the opposite by the sound of it. The kids themselves reported they were being trained to carry out school shootings. The local police were going to charge them with child abuse, and with causing the death of a child. The Feds are now only charging them with firearms violations.
            </p>
            <p>
             I suspect the "MK Ultra" style brainwashing may get quietly forgotten about. Also, I note that the group was run by the son of an Imam who was part of the original Twin Towers bombing (Siraj Wahhaj, see article below). The twin towers bombing was an FBI organized operation that was claimed by the FBI to have, "gone wrong". The fact Wahhaj senior was never prosecuted for that indicates he was working for the FBI. Now his son has been running this operation, and the FBI are quietly focusing away from the brainwashed "Manchurian Candidate" kids and focusing instead on firearms violations.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             *"Wahhaj’s family background was already controversial prior to his arrest.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to his father reportedly being named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 bombing, the elder Wahhaj, who heads Masjid At-Taqwa mosque, was a character witness in the trial for Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the notorious “blind sheikh” who was convicted in 1995 of plotting terror attacks in the U.S."*
            </p>
            <p>
             UK papers reported that the "Blind Sheik" over there worked for MI5. No surprise that America's equivalent works for the FBI. This child camp sounds a lot like MKUltra, and that has US Military Intelligence written all over it. I hope I'm wrong, but the brainwashed child assassins element of this case my quietly be "forgotten". Here we have kids being trained to carry out school shootings. An FBI/CIA specialty. One wonders if the local cops stumbled on a Federal operation, rather than a bunch of standard Jihadists.

            This is exactly what happened in the 1990s when a judge and jury found the owners, and about five of their employees of Little Rascals Daycare Center guilty of more than 400 counts of child abuse on children aged between 2 and 7 in their care. The charges included:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              sodomizing children with screwdrivers and other objects
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              forcing them to watch adults have sex
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              forcing them to participate in satanic rituals where the perpetrators chanted, wore capes and masks and killed a baby
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              hung the children from trees and placed them in bags
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              forced children to drink urine and blood
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              forced them to watch children being killed
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              drugged them &amp; forced them into sexual acts while they videotaped them
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              forced toys and sticks into their vaginas and bottoms
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              forced to watch satanists burn bibles.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Bob Kelly was found guilty of 99 counts of child abuse and child rape and he was sentences to 12 life terms (one life term for each child he abused).  His powerful lawyer got him off on a technicality. Go figure.  All the other abusers who were found guilty got off on a technicality too.  There are people high up protecting this poor excuses for human beings.

             It goes above the judiciary.  They are compromised by the ones pulling the strings, who are yet to be clearly identified, but there are many theories.  One day the truth will come to light.  The Little Rascals Daycare case is stomach-churning.  It's hard to believe that human beings can do such evil.  You're doing great work in highlighting this horror.  People need to be reminded.

            When these pedos get off like that I think they are involved with the CIA and protected by the legal system. There's just too much of it to be just clerical errors or whatever else they blame it on.

             Good point. In 1960s gunrunners caught redhanded were frequently  having their charges dismissed when another branch of govt., usually the CIA would  intervene and claim the gunrunners were operating on behalf of the  U.S. govt.

            Thank you for posting this.  There is something very strange going on with this case.  FBI was on this case for weeks and watching those people.  They knew where they were and they refused to show up for the Big Press Release with the Sheriff.  Why?  Why did they refuse to speak about the case.  Why did not anyone bring up Linda Sarsour and her connection to the NY Imam,   Father to Wahhaj?  Too many questions and not enough answers.  There is a big coverup going on here. Was this part of a DS False Flag they were planning?  Idk, but this reeks like 3 day old fish.

             I got within 6' of Sarsour a bit back.  I'm pretty sure it was Nation of Islam guarding her.  They back down more easily than one would think.
