<p><strong>RACINE</strong> — <a href="https://archive.is/ht4ER">A month after news reports first circulated about kindergartners simulating sex acts at a local Racine school, Racine Unified officials have remained tight-lipped and parents are continuing to ask questions.</a></p>
<p>“I want answers,” said Jamie Durik, a parent of a kindergartner and classroom volunteer at Janes Elementary School, where the incident reportedly took place. <em>“Each one of my kids should have come home with a letter stating that this school, our kindergarten class had sex acts going on in class. Nothing was ever sent home.”</em></p>
<p>Although <strong>Racine Unified School district officials have not released the name of the school or details about the situation</strong>, Durik and two other parent volunteers, who wished to remain anonymous, confirmed that the incident happened at Janes.</p>
<p>Racine Unified School District spokeswoman Stacy Tapp on Thursday would not confirm what school the alleged incident occurred at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only did the Racine County School District fail to tell parents the name of the school where this occurred, they did not even tell the parents <em>whose children attended that school.</em> Instead they sent out an unbelievably sanitized letter <strong><em>only</em></strong> to the parents whose students were in the offending classroom and the letter <em>did not even mention that sex acts had been occurring between at least six kindergartners for months</em>. It did not even state that the teacher of this classroom was fired, instead it claimed she abruptly resigned (was she allowed to resign?) without providing any explanation why. They also redacted the teachers name and did not mention the ousting of the principal. <a href="https://archive.is/ht4ER/23af7780bc6d5ca921792122f3ebf852cd4f287f.jpg">The letter was authored by Eric Gallien</a> who became superintendent of the entire Racine Unified School District two years later. </p>
<p>Through his official capacity as superintendent of RUSD Gallien is connected to both <a href="http://archive.is/C0Ffj#selection-333.0-333.66">Community Policing initiatives</a> and <a href="https://www.johnsonfdn.org/aboutus/community/hero-gallien">The Johnson Foundation</a> at <a href="https://archive.is/gfqEa#selection-1061.82-1061.456">Wingspread.</a></p>
<p>There are also a bunch of <a href="https://imgur.com/SeK0Vd3">pedo enabling comments</a> in a <a href="https://archive.is/IAVo2">Fox news article</a> about the incident as well as an <a href="https://imgur.com/Z7DEMR2">anonymous comment</a> that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not surprised! Considering <em>one of the teachers in that school district ( <strong><em>special ED, Kindergarten</em></strong>) has a loooong history of DUIs, felony hit and run charges and spent 120 days in jail.</em> Because of the Union and the district NOT caring enough about it, this “teacher” was able to <strong>go to the school and TEACH while in jail</strong> ….</p>
<p>I do NOT understand the ability to maintain a job that should require professional, accountable, law abiding, respectful and mentally sane people. NOT drunks and drug addicts unwilling to get help.</p>
<p>Just because the district “can’t afford” to fire the above mentioned offender and due to a tenure with the RUSD <strong>this teacher is STILL employed by the school. <em>The teacher also has been arrested for BnE after assault while a restraining order was in place</em></strong>……</p>
<p>So, yeah. This is sad but I’m not shocked at all. It was only a matter of time before someone said something to someone. You can NOT “teach” children when you are hungover, high or drinking during school hours!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that an RUSD teacher received <a href="https://archive.is/czaRI">Huber Privileges that enabled him to leave jail and go to work</a> seems especially relevant due to the aforementioned connections between this school district and the SC Johnson Foundation, because an heir to the Johnson fortune, <a href="https://archive.is/MAhxw">Samuel Curtis Johnson III, also received Huber Privileges after he confessed to raping his twelve year old daughter for years in a sweetheart deal</a> that was eerily similar to the deal given to <a href="https://archive.is/cuzx8">Epstein</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot find the names of the principal or teacher who resigned from Janes Elementary over this incident, nor can I find the name of the criminal RUSD teacher mentioned by the anonymous comment above. It would be very interesting to find out what organizations these nameless individuals may be affiliated with. Could we get a &quot;help dig&quot; flair on this?</p>',

            Billion-Dollar Schools Referendum Passed By 4 Votes After Recount (April 27, 2020)
           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             RACINE COUNTY, WI — After a week-long recount that left voters wondering whether the Racine Unified School District's 30-year, billion-dollar referendum would hold up on a five-vote margin, district officials said they're relieved after officials confirmed the referendum's passage by a total of four votes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The official results indicated that Unified's referendum passed with 16,715 votes in favor, and 16,711 votes against. Voters took to the polls in Racine County amid the coronavirus public health emergency, as poll workers and voters alike risked exposure to the virus.
            </p>
            <p>
             "We are pleased that the recount confirmed election day results. I want to sincerely thank our community for your support. We are ready to get to work and put our long-range facilities plan into action,"
             <strong>
              district superintendent Eric Gallien said in a statement.
             </strong>
             "This plan will
             <strong>
              transform Racine Unified and impact every school and every student for years to come. Our teachers will finally be able to teach in 21st century learning environments with the tools necessary to support student success.

           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Now's the time to execute that plan, and it's needed," said Eric Gallien, superintendent of the Racine Unified School District.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over the last year, administrators hit the books, studying each of the nearly 30 district buildings -- and said they found plenty.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eric Gallien"This plan will actually give us an opportunity to touch each one of our buildings, do some renovations, build some new buildings, and do some consolidation of schools," said Superintendent Gallien.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gallien said the school district needs money to pay for heating and air conditioning updates, roof replacement, and security upgrades -- among the $598 million in future projects.
            </p>
            <p>
             "We're asking the community to make a long-term investment over the next 30 years, and we're able to do it without raising the tax rate," said Gallien.

             United Way of Racine County has been helping local families since 1922, when a group of Racine business leaders, headed by H.F Johnson of S.C. Johnson and Son, Inc., gathered to discuss the idea of consolidating all charitable drives in Racine. The Racine Community Welfare Fund was born, with the first combined drive raising $75,000.
             <strong>
              Those funds were distributed to the Central Association (now Family Service), Boy Scouts, YMCA, YWCA, American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and the Junior League. United Way still funds most of these organizations today.

             I am pretty sure this referendum was rigged. Since when has a local school referendum been publicly endorsed by presidential candidates? I've never heard of that before but both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders endorsed this referendum

             For some bizarre reason one of the largest allocations of this money is going to Starbuck IB Middle School, where it will be used to expand the school into a K-8. IB schools are supposed to be for high performing students, but this school is a failure on a level that is hard to believe.

              Yes it was rigged. Only passed by a few votes AFTER they did a revote/recount. Sounds like they threatened or bribed a few "nays". Eric has been a major lobbyist for this effort  as well as Black Lives Matter efforts- so he is likley in Soros and the globalists pocket. I think we are getting a glimpse into what the NW0 / Google would like the future of schooling to look like.

                I feel bad leaving this review, but after 2 years of donating here I HAD to. This is a very uncomfortable place to donate. Donors and  SOME employees have no respect for others. Constant swearing, racist comments thrown out,

                I asked an employee if they were hiring they said yes and told me it was easy that there is no drug test so I didn’t have to worry about it

                And proceeded to tell me how poorly management is and how you can get away with anything.She had me all wrong and judged me on my appearance.   Unfortunately I couldn’t donate I was told my level was to low. It was for the best I had bad vibes there and the introduction Should of told me to walk out..

                I was shocked... I spoke to someone who said was management just as unprofessional as there staff rude and uneducated. I found out I was not wrong about that either  from a donor that was there. The only professional person there was the medical nurse who took a basic physical.

                Lady that took my screaning made a computer error my vitals were fine last step she clicked the wrong button and got me permamently defered aka "Banned from CSL" So the manager gave me my money anyways told me try again and i thought nah im never going here again you get your typical drug addicts here. there was some girl smoking while she was donating. As for the woman that made the error nothing happened they really dont care what goes on  some just have really bad attitude problems and stuck up.

                This place is a damn joke. I swear their blood pressure machines are not calibrated correctly. They play favorites with people when they are high blood pressure they get retakes that don't count against them. Which is why i know their machines aren't ran right. They just keep running it until their friends get thru. Unless you know someone go to Kenosha they pay ALOT more anyways

             The Clinton model for Community Policing has resulted in the worst area in the nation for black men including extreme infant mortality rates and the highest incarceration rates in the world. That is where the Butler comes in with the second chance programs and prison labor reform.

             What is the prep for the 21st century and who controls the private and public schools? What are the higher expectations and what is the vision for the greater community? Why are a young Russian adoptee being groomed for mayor and a new Bauer being groomed for Governor? How is the new mayor connected to eugenics and New York? Why was he brought in ahead of schedule?

            , I'm not seeing where Johnson "raped his daughter". The articles you've linked do not say he is related to the victim. Please correct this unsourced claim per Rule 2.

              Samuel Curtis “S. C.” Johnson III, the 59-year-old billionaire heir to the S. C. Johnson &amp; Sons (formerly Johnson’s Wax) fortune, who
              <strong>

              </strong>
              , has received an prison sentence of only four months from Racine County Circuit Justice Eugene Gasiorkiewicz, citing the Johnson family’s importance in the community.
             </p>
             <p>
              Johnson pled guilty to mere misdemeanor charges of fourth-degree sexual assault and disorderly conduct instead of felony sexual assault on a minor child. The victim told police Johnson was “a sex addict” and touched her inappropriately 15 to 20 times beginning when she was 12 years old.

                That's weird. I definitely removed the flair last night. Or at least attempted to. Voat kept going to the "under maintenance" screen for me. Removing again, now.

                I generally give the "Help" flair to posts that have a clear investigative direction, on newly relevant material. This submission lacks a clear focus. Most of it deals with an incident involving kindergartners in one classroom molesting each other that is from years ago and involves sealed records none of us will ever gain access to. It wasn't teachers abusing students, which would be pizzagate related. You've mixed this with material about Curtis Johnson, which
                <em>
                 is
                </em>
                pizzagate related, but is also years old and offers no clear investigative direction for people to help with. While vetting this, I noticed the Johnson foundation Wingspread program seemed pretty intriguing and definitely connected to the Operation Mockingbird branch of pizzagate, but that is not the focus of this submission and is not even clearly connected to either incident you've dived into. If you'd like to do a submission on Wingspread, that might be worth a "Help!" flair, if it's accurate.

            if you dig further, you will find this is very common in the area, and one of many similar incidents that have been reported and covered up. There was another incident reported where educational assistants were sexually assaulting elementary school students including those with disabilities over a long period of time that was covered up after being reported by many others on multiple occurrences. It is no wonder why they burned down some of the old buildings like what happened in Chappaqua. Homes and buildings don’t start on fire by themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been many reports that this same activity was happening in many other schools, including young children being threatened of rape by other elementary school students. There were also reports of an open prostitution ring involving very young students at one of the high schools that had been going over for an entire school year in the building. At least one middle school had similar open activities in addition to gang activities, weapons on school grounds, and cover ups by paying and moving staff to other schools and areas. Everything is covered up by the same groups and the newspaper that is owned by Lee Enterprises and controlled by Warren Buffett. There are rampant affairs and encounters reported in many of the school buildings.
           </p>
           <p>
            What are the higher expectations for that area and why do those who are connected get no bid contracts for cleaning supplies in the millions of dollars? What is the “vision” for the area?
           </p>
           <p>
            The same groups allowed families with convicted pedophiles to open community pools for children. Epstein visited this town many times and is tightly connected with the Podestas, Obama, Clintons and Emanuels in Chicago and Illinois. If you look at the Fight to End Exploitation you will find the sponsors are connected with the same groups that have covered up abuse in that area that is one of the main routes for trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Joe Biden endorsed a referendum there for a billion dollars and the election was rigged for it to pass with the school system and juvenile detention systems reorganized for the Wisconn Valley deals and smart city programs, there is a lot more behind this than you could imagine. It all lined up with flipping the state to blue and both Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus leaving their positions. If you look further it is true that many of the mayors, attorneys, judges and other officials follow similar patterns of abuse, cover ups, resignations, suicides and sudden position changes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some might claim this pattern of abuse and cover ups happens everywhere, but billion dollar referendums endorsed by Joe Biden in such a small city that is a model for smart cities, community policing and largest foreign Greenland investment deals that are so secretive and unknown simply do not happen anywhere but there. If you check into the community foundation you will see the Rothschilds actually live there too.

             It seems they are trying to recreate in Racine the same control structures that currently exist in the UK around the monarchy, that cover all aspects of legal and illegal activities. They want full control of governance, energy, food, education, health and media in that city so once the hierarchical and institutional template is proven to work they will probably try to apply it in other cities and eventually the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the reason they are moving their operations to the USA is because the UK monarchy was infiltrated and is currently crumbling, and they know this. More and more people are being exposed in the UK and it's not safe anymore to live there. Racine was probably planned to be the next global headquarters.
            </p>
            <p>
             It takes a lot of cockiness to try something of this scale, especially when you have to deal with the archetype of Judas at all levels of the operation, also you have to consider that fear is the only means of control without the existence of true loyalty so all people involved cannot trust each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have to be really disillusioned not to see how fundamentally flawed this whole plan is, I mean even if all things go your way and you do manage to transfer the reigns of power to Racine, what next, how do you keep it all together when you are surrounded by power hungry murderers and criminals? It will end in a blood bath, but the sooner it ends the fewer civilians are going to be affected.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason why the Monarchy lasted for so long, given the same means of operation and corruption, was because they were giving the top position (king/queen) as inheritance through clear and strict laws, linked to the family bloodline. But in this case, in Racine, there is no clear dominant bloodline that should be in charge, they are all like stray dogs wanting to be kings, but there can only be one king, so one can only imagine what will happen when they turn on eachother.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh well, we'll just have to wait and see.

              I agree, it seems certain to fail in the long run. The only question is how many people have to get hurt on their way down.

               That's the thing, none of these control structures ever functioned and never will, they only ended up in disaster for both the ones in power and for the ones being governed by them, but it's the ONLY thing they know and can do. As Jesus said:
              </p>
              <p>
               Luke 23:34 Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”
              </p>
              <p>
               The control structures they are trying to recreate are a broken and corrupt representation of the divine hierarchy and the roles associated to it. The problem appears from the fact that the divine hierarchy is based on the trinity, God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, each with well defined roles. But the control structures they are trying to create (out of sheer ignorance) are based on duality (religious and political power without truth/love). That means that the control structures they can create will never have natural balance and will always have intrinsic inner conflict, as we all know a house divided against itself cannot stand. A table with 3 legs can stand with no problem, while a table with 2 legs will always fall.
              </p>

               If you want to really understand who we are dealing with, think about this using common sense: let's say you have a goal you want to achieve, but instead of actually planning and putting work and effort in achieving your goal you instead consider (and believe) that killing a child and drinking his blood will help you achieve that goal, without any effort or work on your part. Do you think this kind of thinking implies intelligence, or love, or wisdom, or common sense? I say definitely not. These are the kind of people that are responsible for all the chaos that's currently affecting the world (disease, wars, famine, etc) and want to 'rule' the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               But even so it's still worth understanding how we got to where we are, where these wicked people come from and where they are trying to go (even though since the beginning of time they are literally spinning in place, like a snake that eats its own tail, slowly but surely heading to complete self destruction), and for this reading the Bible helps a lot, but read it with the intent of finding God so you can truly understand/feel the Truth. Don't settle for what people are telling you about God online, investigate the Bible for yourself just like you investigate these conspiracy theories.
              </p>
              <p>
               I say don't worry about the rest, it will take care of itself. God already put everything in place so that anyone that looks for Him sincerely and with all their heart will be saved and will inherit the Earth.

               13 But the Lord just laughs, for he sees their day of judgment coming.

             I was there during the Obama bailout. They got more than billions. 1.7 million was what I heard at the time. It also disappeared in a month. Right next to Janes is a middle school. When I was there we referred to that section as Kenosha/ Racine due to the Chicago influence. It was also explained to me that the main employer was Johnson and they were threatening to move facilities to Mexico because they were hiring people for less than full employed to avoid obamacare, (even though the town is probably 41% Mexican). Johnson was partnering with a few other employers to keep the best working, but those people might work in 3 companies for less pay with no benefits. The lazier were happy to work a few hours a week and collect checks from the government. I had never lived in a place like that so I thought it all very strange, and kept mental notes.

              Yeah, Racine even looks strange. We were Sunday driving this past weekend and made our way thru Kenosha and then to Racine. It’s always been a strange vibe sorta town, that’s for sure.

               This is why Jared Kushner corrected Kanye West when he misspoke about the 8th Wonder of the World in his meeting with Trump where he praised Apple, and he is directly connected with community policing and the second chance programs with Kim Kardashian, Caron Butler and Mark Wahlberg. Everyone is a prisoner in the “new normal”. Some more than others.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jared is Evil. Kanye is Evil and called himself a god. Kim is Evil. Elon is Evil. They are all playing roles.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jared Kushner is connected with the Knights of Pythias. Trump is playing 5D chess against The People. JFK Jr. is not alive and is not Q Anon. Q is being used to target dissent as Facebook is now proving to everyone.
              </p>

               When will everyone realize they are being deceived? What is The Truth they cannot allow The World to Know?

             That is a different person but the groups are all connected through the same networks. He is from Milwaukee and is used to connect Education with Community Policing, Community Health and mental health, and the school to slave or prison pipeline, or cradle to career to grave pathway. The United way is closely connected, as they are given titles and overlapping roles for themselves and their relatives, and they use those positions in related organizations for control. The Academies are for the employers including the new ones as part of the 8th Wonder deal.  Who are the “heroes for health”?
