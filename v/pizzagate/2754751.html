<p>2) it  was riddled with humanistic encounters, sensitivity training.</p>
<p>Author of group encounter theory: Kurt Lewin German Marxist Jew immigrated in the 1930s to US, professor at Cornell, expert in child psychology and director of group dynamics research at MIT funded by wealthy Marshall Field III  (Lowell Sun, Mass 3/9/1945) who also funded Saul Alinsky. Lewin  was also affiliated with OSS (CIA forerunner) and Tavistock. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Lewin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Lewin</a> </p>
<p>Author of humanistic psychology was Abraham Maslow of Jewish parentage. In his last article, published after his death, he wrote:I share with many other scholars and scientists a great uneasiness over some trends (or rather misuses) in Esalen-type education [intensive encounter group experience]. For instance ... I see trends toward anti-intellectualism, anti-science, anti-rationality, anti-discipline, anti-hard work, etc </p>

<p>By the 1970s most Protestant churches had subscribed to staff training in these theories, Roman Catholic were just starting in but significantly </p>
<p>Jewish congregations had nothing to do with it,(Long Beach,CA 3/28/1970 “showing virtually no interest in the movement” Independent Press Telegram ) Maybe they knew something we didn’t?</p>
<p>In La Jolla, Ca in  1963 Carl Rogers, building on Kurt Lewin’s previous research, set up shop. Western Behavioral Sciences Institute (WBSI) at La Jolla; Coulson joined him there .They began attracting nuns and priests to the workshops.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1967 Rogers and Coulson began their first large-scale encounter project with a parochial school system in Los Angeles consisting of a college, two high schools, and some 60 elementary school
The results of the experiment were disastrous. As Coulson describes it, “The entire school system began to crumble under the weight of too much feeling expression.” . The institution didn’t survive.” He explained that when you look at the fruits of what they did, they are so uniformly rotten that you have to think that a Satanic spirit had entered the group. </p>
<p>After so many truth labs, discipline disappeared, nuns were running around in miniskirts., giving up their vocations.</p>
<p>Coulson later realized that sensitivity training was faulty:</p>
<p>Dr.William Coulson: 
Western Behavioral Science Institute (WBSI) in La Jolla, California
Our biggest single vocational group coming for facilitator training for a number of years, into the late 1970s was Catholic priests and nuns and teaching brothers, all of whom thought that Rogers’ methods of non-directive therapy applied to group work would be a very useful vehicle for making deeper contact with their students, and for helping them to become better Catholics.</p>
<p>What it helped them do in actuality, he added, was to become non-Catholics. (In fact, most of the priests who came to the program later dropped out of the priesthood.) These nuns and priests, who were among the “experts” who would later wreak havoc in seminaries, colleges, and novitiates, were trained to lead sessions of truth-telling and ice-breaking group exercises that break down social inhibition, foster an illusory sense of intimacy, and open the way for the engineering of consent through small-group peer pressure. </p>
<p>To repeat: consent through small group peer pressure.</p>
<p>He also stated in 1994 that Rogerian theories destroyed St. Anthony Seminary, run by the Franciscans in Santa Barbara. The Franciscan province in California had recently concluded an inquiry into a major sex scandal at the seminary, one that warranted front-page treatment in the New York Times on December 1, 1993.  Thirty-four high school-age boys were said to have been molested over a 23-year period; the scandal involved nearly one-fourth of the faculty members.</p>
