             George Webb Sweigert, is a Israeli/ CIA disinfo agent, he  gives himself away here:

             "i am a berniecrat, and jewish and always rooting for mossad"
            </p>
            <p>
             It doesn't come more libtard than a BERNIE supporter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Notice, he doesn't say he's an American and he is rooting for the USA.. NO, first and foremost he is JEWISH and he is "ALWAYS ROOTING For MOSSAD"
Do you think a hardcore zionist socialist jew like George Webb Sweigert, is going to say anything bad about Israel and their involvement in the US government??
            </p>
            <p>
             All of his "research" is carefully constructed to divert attention from AIPAC / Israel's involvement in the corrupt US government, and in organ, women and child trafficking

            Seriously? It wasn't the lack of evidence, lack of relevance, or the fact they had been talking impeachment since before he took office? It wasn't the fact that they were taken with Trump Derangement Syndrome and rage and went out of their way to look like communists out to murder or incarcerate the president because they lost? Also, nobody told Maxine Waters to back away.

            I think Seth Rich leaked and that he was murdered for it. That's how the Clinton machine works. But the way they react is to bury and laugh, and never to run scared. The DNC has dug itself a hole that entertainers have taken a backhoe to, and only as advertisers balk and voters turn their backs have they begin to realize the polarizing PR disaster they've poured over themselves and lit on fire. This isn't cabal-level neurolinguists. This is clinically-

             I think what that person means is that since the Seth Rich murder is being investigated so much now and has reached the mainstream media, shits getting real. What Podesta said about making an example out of a leaker and it getting out that Donna Brazille is the one that called the police when the private investigator was trying to gather evidence and tried shutting that down has been exposed. All these connections are being made where hospital staff and the police had ties with politians is coming out.

            <p>
             The libtards democrats and some republicans lied and will try desperately to get President Trump impeached for the stupidest reasons. They are making themselves look like fools. The mainstream media is trying to make it look like these freaks have tons of supporters behind them wanting to have Trump impeached and some are even sick enough to publicly say on social media that he should be killed. But, in real life, I think these people have made such fools of themselves and the world sees it. I think they are going to be surprised next time there is an election because they are making people sick and they're switching sides.

             So, I think the person who said that they are backing off their talk of impeachment, that is what they mean. I have noticed them backing off. All of this evidence coming out and being spread all over social media and even some news stations picking up the Seth Rich murder has them backing off hoping this won't be pushed further. Or hopefully, they have some on the inside threatening them saying we have something over you (because they know more than us and can access more) and that if they don't stop all this impeachment crap that their going to regret it.

             It makes me so happy every time these bastards try something to make Trump look bad. Because, from the beginning, it always turns around and bites them in the ass!!! I'm loving it because nothing is working! The only thing that concerns me about this tho is that Trump succeeding AND going after them to bring them down will make these corrupt elite get more and more desperate to the point that, if all else fails they may have him killed.
