"One of the principal proselytizers of the PizzaGate conspiracy appears to be David Seaman, a one-time unpaid Huffington Post contributor and author of Dirty Little Secrets of Buzz: How to Attract Massive Attention for Your Business, Your Product, or Yourself. Seaman's personal YouTube channel has been viewed over 6 million times since October 2016, when he began writing about PizzaGate."

           <p>
            Edgar Welch's sister walks into a bar looking for her friend Gary:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/U8XrE0FSQv4?t=21">
             https://youtu.be/U8XrE0FSQv4?t=21
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is obviously a joke but it's CRUCIAL to put this false flag in context. The generally accepted story is Edgar Welch went into CPP looking for children being held against there will there. Why on Earth then would he fire an assault rifle into a lock to open the closet door?
           </p>
           <p>
            As it is the bullet went through the lock and embedded in a stand alone PC tower which, ding ding ding, is about the same size as a child possibly crouching down in fear while they're hidden in the very same closet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wouldn't Edgar have just asked James Alefantis to unlock the closet door? Edgar did have an assault rifle after all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole story is absurd and points to it being a totally manufactured false flag attack to further marginalize "Pizzagaters" by associating them with "nut cases" like Edgar Welch.

             A joke included... I wonder if it would be good publicity or bad publicity. Jokes gain audience, which is good, but might reduce the quality (trustworth) which is again bad. Not sure. But I agree with all the rest, your points add value to the publishing. Have an up from here.

              Nothing could be further from the truth. Just ask John Stewart. If a story made it's way onto John Stewart's show it was never good for the people he was making fun of.
             </p>
             <p>
              The tragedy here is that Team America clip is EXACTLY what John Stewart would have wanted to do but couldn't for obvious reasons besides he doesn't even have a show anymore.

               "but might reduce the quality (trustworth)" please. Adding a comic, in my eyes, would make a meme or post more fun and less trustworthy. Would be nice to have a few others joining this discussion, as we obviously have two opinions in argue.

                That's my point. The "meme or post" is that Edgar Welch is the real deal. That's absurd. So a joke would be the perfect way to accentuate the absurdity of what Edgar Welch did.

            You're hyping this pretty hard.  Career?  As an actor?      The one thing you have that raises questions is the camera everything else is a reach.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the guy's entire credits.  He's been involved in a few low budget movies in NC.  This is hardly a career.

 2011 Mute (Short)     This was a short film he did in college.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has one acting credit and he plays an unamed character and was not listed in the credits of the movie, see uncredited.  In the IMDB page for The Bleeding, he is not listed with the regular cast.   This reads to me like he was an extra.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's fair to say, he was involved in movies and acted on screen in one 7 years before he walked into Comet Ping Pong.   However this is hardly a career.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no idea why you list his "short film" about a pizzeria.  He was not involved in any way in that movie which was produced in Europe.  That was someone just editing his IMDB page after the CPP incident.

            This is just silly.  This happens all the time.  Web publishing is very quick and easy.  How long did it take to have articles up about the London attack.  The convention on breaking news is to publish quickly to the web and then update the article as more info is confirmed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lots of reporters were on the scene by the time he was arrested.   News reporters listen to police scanners.  I looked this claim up on the day happened. No news reports preceded the incident. The WP had a brief sketch of an article up about a half hour after the initial police activity.

            He entered CPP just after 3PM.  People starting tweeting immediately

            Local charges were dropped. The same day federal charges were filed.   He is being tried in federal court.  This is a nothingburger.  As for prosecutor pressing for maximum penalty.  Happens all the time as leverage to get to a plea bargain.

What does this have to do with price of tea in China?  This was a local activist claiming that if bands were allowed to play at night in the neighborhood it would cause rapes and murders.   The guy claiming this was a  well-known crank and his prediction proved to be false.

              Career --&gt; experience. You're right on this one. Still the same regarding value as proof of false flag.

              MSM has rarely been so quick, so widely, on a food bar shooting. Either this bar was under special surveillance or the attack was already known. The lenght of the first posts, in several medias, doesn't support quick breaking news posts but instead prepared articles. They had even the statement of Welch included.
             </li>
             <li>
              I've updated the charge-issue by another earlire comment. Case to be checked further. Line drops one of the proofs, unless there is a non-trial deal which would return that proof value.
             </li>
             <li>
              I disagree with you on the 8y old stuff, it does have value, not that much hence putting it as last. "Well known crank" might have been just a claim by media to reduce his trustworth. We are talking about accusations said to a friend of a president, remember?
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             I hope we discuss objectively, aiming for a result if there's enough of proof for a false flag. IMO there is.

              You have zero proof of a false flag.  You have suspicion of a false flag.

             <p>
              Think about what proof actually entails.  You have no evidence whatsoever, that Edgar Maddison Welch did anything but act on his own.   I think you can objectively see this is true.

              These are not the only two options. 
Another option would be Comet Ping Pong was already in the news.  So a gunman going there is big story as opposed to a gunman going to Harry's bar. It really doesn't take much in a city with a local desk.  You hear the police activity, you go out there.   While he's still inside you talk to the cops and then call your editor.  Look for the next big breaking story in a major city and see how long it take for reporters to respond.

             <p>
              --4  I don't see any value in this whatsoever. It surely doesn't prove anything about a false flag. And for what it's worth, he was described as a local crank at the time 8 years ago.  Way before any of this happened.

               I'm sorry, but I don't see you discussing objectively. Let's end this "zero proof" discussion. Next time, elsewhere, please consider how you approach. You seem to be a shill not really trying to help the children out there being fucked. I hope you don't take money for what you seemingly do against them.

                But if you have proof a false flag lay it out.  Proof is a high standard, a bunch of connections is not proof, it's a pile of circumstantial evidence that may prove something or it may proof nothing.
               </p>
               <p>
                For each item you laid out, you still need to go at least one step further to actually show a false flag.
               </p>
               <p>
                What does each of these prove?

               </p>
               <p>
                Man accused Comet Ping Pong for "encouraging murders and rapes" 8 years ago!   this is completely irrelevant to anything, but in particular to the claim of a false flag.
               </p>
               <p>
                So Objectively, you have a pile of things you think are suspicious.  What you do not have is proof. Every step you mention requires more for it to proof.   If you can explain how any of the items above constitute proof, I'll give it a listen.
               </p>
               <p>
                What would proof be?  Some connection at all to Comet Ping Pong would be nice  Something that shows EMW didn't decide to do this on his own.  Nothing you point out actually pokes holes in the story laid out in the charging documents.  EMW became interested in pizzagate online.  He decided to investigate/rescue.  He contacted some friends to see if they would join him, but eventually set out on his own, drove from NC to DC, entered CPP with a gun and investigated.
               </p>
               <p>
                The truth is it's entirely possible for EMW to be an actor AND to commit this crime on his own due to a sincere belief in pizzagate.

                 Playing a similar role earlier would add to the credibility on scene. Currently we don't know really know if he played on this or not. If it turns out that this shortie was actually made having him in, and info on that removed from IMDB after the attack, it would provide further proof on false flag.

                 Child trafficking in Haiti is a well known problem. EMW connected to Haiti suggests he's at least aware of this, possibly even connected to the trafficking either as a trafficker or as a victim. Father having kids on horror movies produced in Haiti supports this partially. Webpage removed for even a while would support this partially too (unfortunately I didn't find that link). However, looking at this from the other side suggests that EMW would have a reason to trust to pizzagate more than someone else. These are all interesting points which should be further studied. These are currently dismissed (seemingly, according to EMW's statement and all the court documents) which is odd, considering they would further bring some light to the motives of EMW. One can suspect that these are dismissed in purpose.

                 Already discussed a bit, but let's get a bit further. Your earlier comment suggest that article was written while EMW still inside CPP. His statement would not have made it to the article in this case.Your earlier comment also suggests that CPP might have news value, speeding up the process. My suggestion is that having important news value would have made it slower (article checked in higher levels before publishing). Adding the quick spreading of the news to several MSM's, the process was very different compared to other similar news. You should share an example of similar speed and awareness from some other similar case instead just claiming "this is routine".

                 Fox, fixed. Attorney, not mentioned and not needed. FBI Agent gave the statement on why this would be a federal crime. ...and? We really don't know yet. A non-trial would support the false flag theory, time in jail would support crime theory. According to MSM this is a crime. Should we just take that as such? IMO No.

                 Proof is indeed a too strong word from me at this point, sorry about that. We have two theories, lines by FBI/Welch/MSM supporting one, our findings supporting the other. The case is: Are our findings strong enough to make this suspicious enough? IMO yes.

                 That would be one line more to support our theory. Should we work to find one?

            Thanks, will check. And let's discuss for a while: Do you have a comment for all the lines? Are there more facts all together supporting attack or more supporting false flag attack? Should this have been investigated as a possible false flag by the prosecutor?

            Thanks, editing in a link. It was down according to another post here which I can't find, now up then (or all the time up and that was a false claim earlier). Actually might be better to remove that line, not needed as a falseflag evidence anyway.

              Dear PizzaDestroyer, I would take that as part of OBJECTIVE news, and if the other issues mentioned were visible in the MSM news that would be fair too. However, in this case we are pushing OPPOSITE NEWS to create balance to deliver understanding on the truth. Tactic used all the time by the media controlled by left and right parties, so I think we have a fair reason to do the same. In overall I'd love to see objective news both in WashingtonPost and on InfoWars, but the world isn't like that. Yet.

               Sorry - I don't think I understand what you're saying.  Is "opposite news" supposed to be the opposite of objective news?  Or are you saying that we should be objective, and mentioning Edgar Welch's auto accident would not be objective?

                We should aim for the public to have an objective point of view. MSM has already shared the other side of the story, including that accident, we should share another side, all the pieces not told by MSM. That means we're not objective on this, but we cause objectivity. Instead of having this discussion, should we start doing something? Is there more to check on the content, or is that enough for ppl to use? What's your goal on this?

                 Addding the accident to the list, you both have valid points so why should we dismiss it only because I had an opinion. Thanks both of you.

                 I guess I really don't have anything else pertinent to add to this thread topic, and I am not trying to derail anyone away from the main topic.  However, since you asked, my main goal in this is simply to inform people about pizzagate in a truthful and objective way.  And I don't think it makes sense to avoid mentioning something because it's been talked about by MSM.  Should we avoid talking about the Podesta's creepy art because the Washington Post published a story talking about it?  No.  I think you have some connotations about the word "objective" that most people here probably don't agree with, but really it's not that important as long as you're not trying to intentionally mislead people in order to get your point across.
                 <br/>
                 I will not be in the least offended if you don't want to continue this discussion because there are better things to do, and I only intended on contributing to your original compilation of questionable points about Edgar Welch.  Great job compiling that info.

             I would like to add that Alex Jones purposefully jumbles fiction with reality, revealing what propaganda is most important to his corporate owners. His take on 9/11 is astounding to say the least.

               Sandy Hook was a faked event aimed at taking weapons away from the population. All crisis actors. No deaths. It could have been a ceremonial remembrance (Freemasonry) of the British school attack of the same name from 100 years before. You will have a tough time searching for that one.
