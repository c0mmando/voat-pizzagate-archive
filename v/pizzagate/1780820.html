<p>&quot;This ring is alleged to have exploited young males with mental health issues by delivering them to wealthy \'clients\' throughout Connecticut for the purpose of [having] sex for money,&quot; Danbury police said in a press release Thursday.&quot;
Bruce J. Bemer, 63, of Glastonbury and William Trefzger, 71, of Westport were arraigned Thursday in Superior Court in Danbury after they were charged with patronizing a trafficked person, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bemer owns the New London-Waterford Speedbowl and Bemer Petroleum Corp., 210 Commerce St., in Glastonbury. He admitted to investigators that he had been paying &quot;boys&quot; for sex for up to a quarter of a century, according to court documents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Robert King of Danbury was previously arrested in connection with the ring and charged with promoting prostitution and tampering with a witness, police said. The ring, which operated out of Danbury, reached other towns and cities, they said.&quot;</p>

<p>NASCAR’s Home Tracks announced on its verified Twitter account: “NASCAR has terminated the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series sanction and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour race sanction with the New London-Waterford Speedbowl, effective immediately.”</p>
<p>I want to point out here that the perpetrators are NOT the people with in the Whelen All-American Series/Whelen Modified Tour. It was the local track owner. NASCAR was just doing the right thing by disassociating its organization from this slimy, sick bastard.</p>
<p>Bruce Bemer is the owner/president of the following: Bemer Aviation and Petrolium Inc. Bemer Petrolium Corp, Bemers Gas and Welding Supply and BA Group LLC</p>

<p>So far 15 victims have been identified with more arrests forthcoming. While some were over the age of 18, they are reported to have severe psychological disabilities.</p>
<p>&quot;the arrest warrant affidavit said King &quot;sought out young men with varying degrees of psychological disabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;King would fraudulently befriend these young males, offer them work, money, food and other fake inducements, exploit weakness which is often drug based, and provide them with illegal drugs to the point they were financially indebted to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The man, as well as a second victim, was being cared for at Abilities Beyond on Cleveland Street in Danbury, which has a contract to run group homes with the state. The facility cares for individuals with significant mental health needs and psychological disorders.</p>
<p>I don\'t have time now, but I\'ll look into Abilities Beyond on Cleveland street. I surely hope they didn\'t know what was being done to their residents. It\'s hard to fathom and believe they didn\'t know. I\'m betting when I look into it that Bemer was a &quot;wonderful contributor&quot; to their facility. Oh, and since Bemer owns an aviation company, I wonder what other wealthy people were supplied with these kids.</p>',

            It is rather curious no news accounts are available. It's not everyday a helicopter crash lands in a shopping center parking lot. Considering the account from the victim that overdosed and was driven miles away before it was reported, one has to wonder who was in the helicopter they don't want reported. 
 It seemed as if he used a helicopter ride as a lure. The one victim said he thought he might get a ride but didn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reading the account of the young man that died in the car crash made me break down in tears. The pain in his words was just wrenching. I had to shut down my computer and walk away. I realized in reading through your information  many were 18 and older; but, that doesn't change the fact that they are someone's child!
           </p>
           <p>
            After watching the YT video I couldn't believe he was an owner/promoter that just won the court case to own the track. The interviewer had to drag the information out of him. Most promoters will talk your ear off about their track and experience. Also most short track owners were once racing at their local short tracks. It really makes me wonder if it wasn't really just a front for something else. Thank goodness one of the victims spoke up and was believed.

            I think it important to track and catalog cases where victims statements are available in order to counter the arguments of pro-pedophile groups and so called experts that such relationships are not harmful and can in fact benefit the minor child. Often times such evidence is shielded in the name of protecting the victim or as a result of pretrial settlements.

             Thank you, I'm friends with a former owner/promoter that posted the article on his FB page. It opened the opportunity to bring this horrible issue to a large community that didn't know anything about pg. It's given me the idea to start scouring small town newspaper sites for more accounts of these predators. Again, many thanks to exposethecriminals.

            Thank you, thank you, thank you for the tremendous follow up to the story. I knew in my gut a close tie to some major players would be discovered.  It makes me ill to think of the countless disabled kids he has abused over the years.  The statement by his lawyer is reprehnsible given his confession to the police. In addition to the vile abuse of children, he has hurt a lot of others with his actions. I was involved on the inside of short track racing in the past and it breaks my heart for the track employees, race teams and spectators.
