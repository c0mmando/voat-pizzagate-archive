<p>Here are some crazy stats:</p>
<p>• Out of the 371 missing children in Virginia, 49 of them are Children missing from Fairfax!</p>
<p>• Fairfax has a population of only 22,000. That is 0.28% of the Virginia population.</p>
<p>• Yet it has 13% of all missing children. That is almost <strong>50 TIMES</strong> the rate it should have.</p>
<p>• Virginia Beach has a population of 437,000 which is 20 times Fairfax, yet it only has 20 missing children compared to Fairfax 49.</p>
<p>• If we assume that under 23% of all people are &quot;under 18&quot; (close to national average) then that means there are 5,060 of them living in Fairfax.</p>
<p>• That means that around 1 in 100 people under 18 in Fairfax are currently missing.</p>

            Great find, this is really substantial in terms of finding something that needs to be investigated. The locals in Fairfax need to know, they need to take up the fight to get some answers too. Wonder if it's possible to locate any of the parents for an interview..

            Where could you have possibly have gotten that information (22,000 as a population)? It is the most populous county in the state with more than a million people living there.

            I think you are confusing the City of Fairfax 25-30k with the county.  If you factor in the population adjustment I suspect it will be higher still than much of the state (I-95 Corridor) but not nearly as alarming as you are purporting.  I know Virginia has an elevated missing children rate but please fix this.

             But if you go to the link, they list "Fairfax, VA" and "Fairfax County" separately... It is actually impossible to tell if they are referring to the town or the county. It needs looking into.

              The Missing Children link only refers to Fairfax, Va, US.  That's it doc, they are separate entities but in the sake of naming a last known region for a missing person its expedient to bundle them together as one as the city is encompassed by the county.  As such they cannot be separated, nearest I can tell, such that you have both bundled together for missing children yet this post is only showing the population for the city.  So all the home grown stats are fucked until you adjust the population.
