            Yes, you are right to fight for the just version of the church you love.  Your statement reminds me that "catholic" means universal in Greek (so they say).  For sure the early architects of the church were ambitious and some might say presumptuous!  I hear there is no evidence that Jesus himself wanted there to be a church build around his persona.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, apparently there is a "no information" period of like 10 years in Jesus' life.  Perhaps from ages 20 to 30.  Some believe that he went to India during those years and was influenced by eastern philosophy, and India is where his more forgiving and peace loving "turn the other cheek" philosophy was inspired.  This was in contrast to the more vengeful, thunderbolts, "sacrifice your children to me" version of god that the Jews of Jesus' day practiced.  Apparently, the shipping routes between Palestine and India in Jesus' day were heavily used and it would not have been hard for him to go there.

            thanks for the insight.  I think you have you are very awake and that's good.  You are very generous and charitable vis. a vis the church despite all the evil it has committed (in addition to the good)

            Thanks.  Can I ask, are you Catholic?  How do you feel about the church aiding and abetting pedo's in their upper ranks?  Does that reduce your faith in the church? (I'm not equating god with the church, btw).

            Take one day per week to totally disconnect from this madness. Go for a walk in the park, see a new movie, go to a new restaurant, hang with your SO.

            This is horrible, yes, this is the worst thing in human history, yes. But it was also happening way, way before you started researching it, and while our efforts may bring an end to it in this lifetime, we must bring a life with us through the madness and into the new world where we are woken.

            Me too.  I pray that god will move the spirits of those people who can put a stop to this relatively "easily" (i.e. without leading to a full-on bloody civil war).  We need any people of honor in the FBI, local law enforcement, the security state, and similar positions to have the courage and inspiration to arrest the guilty and put them on trial.  And of course we will really need the new White House administration to act morally on this issue.  If they do not, what else is left but revolution?

            Yes, I feel sick...it's all I've been doing outside of my normal workday -- reading and researching this evil. I pray constantly. Everything "normal" feels like a facade. And I can't talk to my family about it. The either don't believe or don't care enough to let the reality disrupt their tidy lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's Christmas in about 2 weeks &amp; I don't even want to participate. Even that is a lie after all the reading I've done to learn about paganism/satanism. All this evil going on and people around me are oblivious. I feel alone, but then feel ashamed that I feel that way when I think of those children &amp; what they're going through.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for posting this, it helps me feel less alone.

            You're informed enough. Stop reading up on it every day and just wait, this is only the beginning and its off to a good start. Come back after new years unless you have something to contribute.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly this topic has been fucking with my head aswell. Too real and too depressing. But really as far as investigating there isn't anything most of us can do. So it's best for us to just lay off and focus on something else.

            Why are you sad about this info!? The podesta emails are the smoking gun the truther community has needed for so long to even have a shot to bring these sick people to justice.  We all knew this shit was going on for awhile with the elites, now we have proof.  Justice can be served and you should be happy that with our hard work as well as others and maybe the FBI doing their jobs we will see retribution.

            Thanks for your post. Yeah bit all over the place I'm pretty distant with people have tried explaining this stuff to those in my life but they don't get it or I have lost more of my sense of reality that I care to admit.

            This has been a journey over the past few months and I shared it with many people none of whom I know.

            I just want to thank you all for not dismissing this investigation as so many have done. The circumstantial evidence combined with the just outright strange amount of "shilling" trying to off course the investigation is what makes this so real.  Why the hell are they trying so hard to censor everything? Even blatant stuff like the Norway ring disappearing from 3 news papers in one day.

            I shut down on Sept 11 2001. I was blocks away, lost people, lived in a mausoleum for a year. Then I recovered only to learn that it was an inside job.
            <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org">
             Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth
            </a>
            .  The one good thing that came out of that experience was that the experience mentally prepared me for subsequent black flags, the truth about global power, the election, MSM cartel and certainly PG. I have been looking into this for a very long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, I had a total breakdown 2 wks ago. I don't remember what the trigger was but it hit me and I crashed, hard. I walked away from my computer and let the grief wash over me. Recovered as best as I could and got back online. You HAVE to allow yourself to experience this and move through it however you need to. But this is not for everyone and it is very much life-altering. You will never be the same again. I, personally, am grateful yet I have not yet acclimated to how lonely it is. But I am committed. If you are not able to commit - you do not have to.
           </p>
           <p>
            ETA:  What also keeps me going is that the children we are fighting so hard for --- what they endure is far worse than ANYTHING we can even imagine. In many ways, it's unconscionable for us to avoid the truth if these children can't escape it.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're willing to live this alternate life, do whatever is necessary to keep fighting. And always remember that you are not alone.

            I am reminded of being in mourning. I am somber, and respectful of the gravity of the situation.  I am burdened with the magnitude of the very real possibility that our world is controlled by global luciferian pedofiles. Our government is instating a truth ministry and attempting to overthrow our election. The pope is talking about sex with excrement. The whole situation is surreal. I won't ignore the pain of these poor children. Life is not the same for me it carries more meaning now and every moment is precious. I am glad that more and more of us have the courage to face this ugly truth.  these unknown children need to be acknowledged somehow,  it is just and good that they are avenged.

            I'm not really the type to keep journals or anything, but whenever i feel conflicted or really need to do some soul-searching, I always have conversation with myself on page. I'll start with a broad topic but a specific question, like, "What do I expect to get out my current actions" or "What ideas constitute my identity?" Or obviously whatever else is on your mind. A plus to this is that you'll be able to keep track of changes in your thoughts over time.
           </p>

            Edit:
           </p>
           <p>
            On a bit of a side note, an image I can't help but think pf recently is the 'monster-hunter' trope. There's probably a real name for this written somewhere, but you know what I mean: there's the outcast hunter who specializes in hunting demons or monster or whatever; he has taken on demonic appearance/ aspects himself because of his craft, and the villagers who don't know any better are scared of him and group him in with the demons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Researching this stuff, you may have to become someone else, and if you don't think you can handle it I wouldn't recommend pursuing it. But if you can't help but think about, and there's something inside you that compels you to do it, then (fortunately or unfortunately) you might be cursed, and you'll have to follow the path in front of you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something to take with you: in my own identity crises, I've realized you change who you are with every passing moment. I'm not sure if there's some kernel which actually remains constant, but regardless, the question you have to ask is, "if something isn't unchanging, what's the value in holding on to it anyway?" And the cool things about things that change, is that they can always change back.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking back on this post, I feel sort of embarrassed writing it, but whatever, I'll hit save.

            As an interfaith minister who has studied the occult for years, my heart goes out to you all. I hope you will consider these words:
           </p>
           <p>
            Although there are truly dark forces on earth, from my research I've learned that above all, this universe was created by a loving, beneolvent force. Call it God, call it Life, call it whatever you want.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point, many would ask- why would a loving God allow this fucked up, horrific shit? The answer is Free Will. Why does your parent let you fall of the bike when learning to ride it? So you can learn.
           </p>
           <p>
            Life is a school, the lesson is love.
           </p>
           <p>
            These sad souls have strayed far from the path, and trust me, they will pay for what they've done.

             I can definitely understand how the lesson for us is love, but what is the lesson for the poor innocent victims of torture?  Most of them will not even have a chance to grow old enough to really exercise free will.  Are they just props for our school?  Like textbooks or chalk?

              If you believe in reincarnation, which I've come to do, then it means that we all choose the lives we enter into.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would someone choose a life that horrible? Possibly so they can learn certain things from that experience. Another possibility is that they were the abuser in a past life, so their karma is to be the abused in this life.
             </p>
             <p>
              This may sound like crap to you, but if you study various religions and other topics like near death experiences(people who have died and come back),  they all claim that reincarnation is real, and that we select our life circumstances before we enter into it.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's not easy for me to believe this, and I still have questions about it, but at least it makes a little more sense if you have knowledge about reincarnation and are open to it.

               I do believe in reincarnation and am fascinated by the testimony of NDE people.  I think your explanation makes sense.  In a strange way it makes me feel less worried about tortured children, as crazy as that sounds.  But still, these evil scum need to be stopped.

                It doesn't sound crazy, it helps me too. Not just cause it sounds better, but because there's evidence to support it. Glad to help, best to you.

            I've noticed that if I spend too much time with this stuff my brain literally starts to hurt, and I feel like a rush of bad chemicals. That's when I know I have to stop. I'm not doing anyone any good by harming myself. Got to spend time in nature, meditate. Even looking at nature videos on youtube is great for a break.

            I work in mental health and I am used to dealing with anxiety and depression, and even so this stuff does take a toll on me as well. I have to take breaks and clear my head. What makes this difficult is that no one around me wants to believe this stuff, my own family thinks I am crazy. So I mostly keep it to myself, which is a large burden to hold, but I am okay with it. I will snap back at anyone who calls me crazy, and I tell them they have no right to criticize me. I don't turn my back when I hear cries of help from suffering children. Ignorance may be bliss, but ignorance is selfish. We are not better than anyone else. It is a matter of chance what kind of life we are born into. Therefore it is our duty as humans to help each other out. The more flack I get for trying to do my part, the more I am motivated to keep going.

            This has happened with me, too. I don't look at anything the same way. Not even my child. I feel crushed inside because of what has to be happening to these victims. And I've been afraid to be in public lately with my child. I know none of this is healthy,  but I can't control it.

            i have stopped having fun, as much. I feel conspicuous laughing, or being too happy, so longs as i know many children are suffering.  This is not really a complaint. i  am glad, that I am not easily placated any more. I was NEVER really having fun, or happy, while this sad situation continues. i will be happy again. relatively, when there has been breakthrough in this case...

            Agreed....what I have been experiencing aside from all of the above, is that impending feeling that the other shoe is about to drop, but in a good/terrible way.   The info is gonna leak....the desperate machinations of the Clinton camp confirm that.  I'm just ready for the info dump and the subsequent swamp draining.

            I have been watching comedies and my favorite Youtube sailing videos as a pick me-up.  Here is one of my favorite Youtube vids...why Kendall is not in stand up, I have no idea.  And the language is totally NSFW.....

            For those of us who were sexually abused as children ourselves, this scandal really hits home. Many of us survivors never saw justice for ourselves. Reaching for a conclusion in pizzagate is kind of a form of closure.

            100% agree with you on everything...especially the part about social media being the wild card this time around.  Because this ain't the first Pizzagate.  I think this has hit critical mass and is not going away.  The gorgeous shit storm that occurred right after Molesta's tweet today only enforces this belief.

            I haven't been contributing with research, I'm not really smart enough for it, I don't think, but am supportive of civilians digging into things for a good cause (and there is no more justified cause than trying to protect children IMO). But that said, I have lived with this feeling my entire life, as I grew up in a town where covert and organized child abuse was happening, centered around a church. So even my developing childhood perceptions included watching many people turn a blind eye to things or shame victims into silence, in order to cover their own butts or in some cases to just not have to "deal with" the situation. They viewed their own anxiety having to "deal with" a reality of child abuse to be more significant than the suffering of the child victims. There hasn't been a day in my remembered, waking life when I wasn't aware of how such things tend to work and unfold.
           </p>
           <p>
            Best I can offer is to remember that if you are a mess psychologically and physiologically, then you won't be able to help much, even if you really want to. Make sure to get proper sleep and don't spend too many night too often awake until dawn, obsessing and losing sleep. Take an occasional day off and connect with someone in person whom you at least mostly trust, do something together you would normally enjoy, recuperate, basically. Those of us who have been victims and have been waiting for age of awareness and people giving shit, we have been waiting for a long time, many of us now grown old or passed away. If you need a couple days off to recuperate and be at the top of your game, then by all means, take the time to do so.

            Thank you very much, playitagainsam, i would recommend this one too. "Wherever you go..." contains lots of "soft" instructions (would rather say suggestions) on how to practice. But there a lots more of offers to get informed, ones for the more nitty-gritties, others for the theoretists, so everyone might find his own approach.

            I am just really fucking mad and sad about all of this.
            <br/>
            As a child my grandfather tried to molest me.  I would spend the night with my grandma and he would insist I sit on his lap while we watched Disney and fondle my crotch.  I refused to let him do it after the second attempt....but my grandma would tell me to sit on his lap.  I know he really had his way with my younger sister.  My mom would hear no part of it..as she always borrowed money from them.  He had bondage porn pictures hung all over in backyard shed  and magazines in the bathroom.
 I was older than my sister and stopped going over there....but my youngest sister experienced shit...she started acting out from it....got kicked out of school.  She then got into drugs, was homeless, tattooed herself all over, even her face...was involved in Hell's Angels porn....lost her children,  She tried though the years to deal with the pain, therapy, medication etc...but to no use.  She killed herself at 44 yrs old..  What these FUCKERS do is steal innocence and ruin lives.  I would love to chop their dicks off to be honest.   I am astounded how society has tolerated this crap.
            <br/>
            All I can do is pray...pray people wake up to the damage that is done by these DEVILS!!!   G

            Thanks for your post and honesty. It started for me as an investigation out of disbelief. After a couple hours it became an obsession which quickly led to panic. The main reason is because my wife is from Europe and goes back to visit her family once a year for a couple months with my two young daughters. I tried to rationalize it by remembering that they have been making this trip for years and nothing has really changed. That ultimately didn't help but I have found some peace in forcing myself to take regular breaks and meditating (which is something I never did routinely until now). I also have one friend I can talk to about this and my wife as long as I spare her the more graphic details. I think breaks are the most important but far be it for me to tell someone else what they should do. I wish you all the best.

            I try to focus on the now...for that is all we can do.  And the now is just SO fucked up.  It's nice to have this thread to vent.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've always used my studying of the occult as a way to center myself.  To pen spells and incantations, to place items upon my altar and focus on fixing my inner self.  Never did I study about the dark side of Magick, of ritual abuse and Satanism.  I was living in my own preconceived ideologies, my rose colored lenses so to speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't even been able to pick up an occult book for almost 4 months.  What I used to dive into before now turns my stomach.  EVERYTHING I held as faith or solidity has turned to sand between my fingers.  I just don't know what to believe anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do know one thing though...that Magick IS real.  I've witnessed it through the power of memes and the collective consciousness.  If there has been one continuing theme I have studied throughout the years, it's been the battle of Good vs. Evil, Light vs. Dark.  It seems we are on that precipice now.
           </p>
           <p>
            The path may be hard to follow, and we may lose some of our brothers and sisters along the way...but I do know that if we keep pushing forward, the momentum will hopefully expose these sick fucks and every disgusting fiber of their being for all to see.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the Bible had it right all along (as well as the Nag Hammadi Indexes)...that Hell is right here, on Earth, and we are living in it.   The Demiurge is alive and well, and we are seeing it all unfold before us.

            Before those signs and symbols were going into your subconscious without conscious filtering.  Which is the literal definition of hypnotism.

            What you are experiencing is a shift in your latent inhibition.

            I think many of us will have experienced PTSD, just learning about the trauma so many have suffered in such a cold blooded and systematic way, is extremely traumatic to a healthy psyche.
           </p>

            Being mobilised to action, naturally will shift our daily patterns.  It is imperative we remember to take care of ourselves and do not feel guilty about taking breaks where required.  Everyone needs to be on their mental and physical A game and that requires self-nourishment both physical and spiritual.  Remember all of the beauty which exists in this world still.  Wont it be sweet to hand over an even more beautiful world to the future.

            I think it's the the burden of wisdom.  This pizzagate hellhole really puts the mundane into perspective.  I am glad that more people are waking up,  are righteously angry, and digging.

            A german here, so bare with me and my language. I've always been a guy overthinking everything I see or experience. I'm highly sensitive to every feeling that's being spread around me. If that makes sense at all. I've always been into conspiracies. But not those BS ones like flat earth or lizard people. But everything with enough evidence behind it to alteast not put at immediatly aside. And this topic is nothing new, but there has never been this kind of waking up and realizing. So even though I knew this shit could have existed I always have been doubting it slightly or in other words I haven't been fully convinced because I wanted to protect myself from knowing how fucked up this world is. But now that every day more and more undeniably evidence is brought to light my mind is giving up it's fight to push this shit away. 
The sad thing is, back in september I've been diagnosed with a heavy depression co-existing with a social anxiety disorder. But I can't just stop and ignore this. I'm not that kind of person. 
So the only thing I can do besides spreading the word here in Germany, which most of the time doesn't work because no one seems to care enough, is, watch how all of this goes. 
And I'm scared this goes the wrong way. 90% of the people I'm trying to tell about this just completely block everything because it's just to much. to heavy. WAY to evil. People can't live with this in their mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            I love all of you fighting for justice, for love and unity. This world has been fucked up for waaaay to long. It's enough. It's overdue.

             Eath is a level plane.  We are not on a sphere, we are in one. The space theory was designed, to make us feel small and insignificant. To molest the world if you will. Most cultures have known this, since the beginning. The space theory is recent, and actually very isloated. Only some very indocrinated people still fall for it. And only a small group ever did. Please, if you are going to call something BS, makes sure you have some basis. Next thing you will believe the moon landings! They are impossible! A person can not even stand inside a vacuum here. for more than a second.  It was all made up, by the same types of people who maintain so many other illusions. We need to see through them, in order to really live. BTW, even if the globe you have believed in, were a hundred times bigger, you would notice a curve. spheres. always curve... NASA, the most sinisister organisation of them all,  has been a long time comet pizza fan...

             We love you, too...and we want justice, love and unity for all as well. That defines the people who have seen the evidence and know in their gut that the time is NOW if ever there was a time to change the course of humanity. I also feel changed by this, but cling to the thought that knowing...as full awareness as I can have, is better for me, my loved ones, and the good people here willing to fight this fight. I would just like to say "thank you" to the original person checking in our mental health and also that I'm with you, justice, love and unity...this is what we want, and we have to be willing to fight for it! Peace in your hearts, my friends, we are doing the right thing.

             Flat Earth is real. Lizard people, not so much. If you can debunk flat earth please show me how you did it. I've been trying to debunk it for over a year.

              So I just read up about some of the flat earther beliefs and I have some questions about it that I want you to answer.
-If the sun is a ball that hovers above the flat earth at all times, why does it appear to go below the horizon? If the earth is flat that should never happen.
-Gravity is the force of the earth constantly accelerating up according to your beliefs, so at what speed is the earth travelling at right now if its been accelerating since it formed? If it stops accelerating and travels at a constant speed then the gravity we feel from the acceleration would stop.

              Easy to debunk. 1. Buy/rent a telescope and point it towards Jupiter or Saturn and explain why the motions of their moons and rings differ to the flat earths model. 2. Look up the live tracking of the I.S.S and when you can see it fly over your area.

               Stars are not what you think they are. They are def not what NASA says they are.
Please before you say FE is easy to debunk, try researching the topic first.

                I wasn't talking about stars, I wad talking about planets and moons, which if flat earth were true then they also would be flat and their moons would have similar movements, yet they dont. This is something you can see with your own eyes.

                 Planets are nothing more than "wondering stars" They do not have to take the shape of the Earth. Does a pool table take the shape of the pool balls? 
Please take your own advice and buy yourself a decent telescope and point it at said planets. You will notice they look nothing like what pop culture/NASA depicts them to be. They are pulsating lights, even their "moons" are lights. Do more research.

                  As someone who has studied astronomy for years, flat earth can be debunked with a long exposure photograph of the stars. If you are standing on the equator, the trails of the stars will be a straight line parallel to the equator. However, if you are standing at the north or south pole, the trails of the stars in the photograph will create concentric circles.

                   Yet if we are hurtling through space at incredible speeds, in multiple contridictory directions, why haven't the stars moved positions in the millions of years since Earths formation? Why is polaris in the same position? Also unrelated: Why does NASA fake cgi pics and going to space? Why is the ISS a proven hoax?

             Die Leute reagieren so, weil kognitive Dissonanz extrem unangenehm ist. Einer der Wege, sie loszuwerden, ist die Fakten zu ignorieren, die gegen das bisherige Weltbild sprechen.

            <p>
             Versuch nicht, die Leute zu bekehren. Macht keinen Sinn.

             I've stopped trying to be an evangelist about the pizzagate.  At least in person.  I actually had a friend around the corner call me to come talk to one of their friends I've not met before last week.  They were seeking subject matter expertise.  I met the first person who knows as much about pizzagate as I do.  The word is out there.

              I agree I think a lot more people know than we realize, it's a taboo subject and hard to openly discuss. I actually came across someone too who knew as much as me.

             That is not a feeling you want.  That is what gives one anxiety attacks, at the least.  I won't tell you what you should do, so as not to be misconstrued as trying to be dissuasive.  Stay strong.

             Had I note been an avid redditor I would have never stumbled across #pizzagate. Unlike many millennials, I was pretty indifferent to the election, but I remember watching Trump give a speech on TV, and thought to myself he really didn't seem as crazy as the media would have you believe. Some of his ideas made a lot of sense.  Therefore, I went to reddit to read up on Trump and BAM...discovered pizzagate. Nothing has been the same since. I've told only one friend about it, but I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm crazy. I'm not dense, I know how it sounds to other people, but the circumstantial evidence is undeniable. I'm not a researcher, but I'm obsessed with getting to the truth. I constantly check in with gab and voat with the hope that some brave, intelligent soul has unlocked the clue that will connect everything, thereby confirming my suspicions that pizzagate is real. Conceptually, I always knew the world was a cruel place, but now that concept has all but vanished only to be replaced with the disturbing knowledge that evil has been masquerading itself as not just good, but altruistic. My friend tells me that it's not my place to worry about it, but I can't NOT worry about it. Like Edmund Burke said, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”

            I feel a little mixed up myself, on the one hand it feels rewarding to have a noble cause, on the other I can't shake the cognitive dissonance and if I do, I feel incredibly frightened by the people that rule us. We live under the assumption that they work for our common good for the most part, that their self interests at their worst are nothing of this magnitude. This reality is far more sinister and soul crushing, how do I go on living my normal life?...

             It is frightening, but we do have each other. And I know for a fact there are good people in government. There are people who still care about others and want to make the world a better place. When you realize what's been going on it's incredibly difficult to process and you think a lot. I'd say it's better late than never to have figured this out.
            </p>

             We have to keep on living our normal life because, well, we deserve it. I feel not doing so is letting them get the best of us, and I refuse to allow that to happen. This is a fight, yes, but one we can win if we unite the people and gather concise evidence, connections, etc. In fact, a lawyer has said that every little thing counts, no matter how small it may seem it could have a good impact.
I remind myself of the good that does exist in the world, and that there is good people in government. Trey Gowdy for instance, is good. You have people there that genuinely care about the people of the country, about people of other countries. 
We're doing good work and even though it is soul crushing and disgusting we cannot lose sight of that. My intuition tells me we will be successful, but we can't get cocky.

             I think that is the red pill fully settling in.  I'm not giving up on anything - I'm still going to retire, play golf, and complain about injuries and ailments.

            You are becoming focused. It is natural the a solemn demeanor comes over you where you are a male protector of the weak. It is your very nature to become tuned and focused on this. You are connecting with the world around you and becoming more aware.

            You should be thankful at this point that you have not yet seen what I have seen, I hope you never have to.

              Your true human nature is showing. You are a man and your job, your life's purpose is showing itself, you are a protector! Your instinct is to protect all those weaker than you whether it be woman, child, or animal.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is the most unique and primordial instinct on this planet and shared by almost all life forms on this planet.

            With this whole ongoing investigation, it has brought a feeling of immanence, like the momentum is becoming even heavier, and this information is seeping to the masses.
           </p>
           <p>
            I myself, personally, have always had a strong skepticism to everything that this society puts upon us. I question everything, and I live by that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am anarchist, I want everything to change, for the better. 
With Pizzagate in full swing, it is apparent that we are on the way to making some great changes, I hope.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all that being said, and the way you are feeing, continue your open mindedness, and give this a scroll through.

            I think despite all of the evil in the world, there is good. Look at what we're doing, this is good. We have to remember and think about the good in the world or the darkness could drag us down, which is dangerous. I'm really proud of everyone here doing this research. When united we are very strong, that's why they keep on race baiting. United we stand, divided we fall. And strength in numbers.

            I try to keep my mind from running too far ahead. I really do believe this is an international conspiracy. My biggest fear is that this fake news crap, the bullshit claims about voter fraud and now this Russian interference nonsense is laying the groundwork for the Electoral College to give the election to Hillary. I really am starting to worry about civil war in America. Am I crazy?

             You could be crazy, but I doubt it. the MSM is definitely crazy, and it does seem that they want the EC to pick Hillary, but I don't think that that will happen, it just a just a gut feeling, but Hill will not take the office.

            Meditate. Practice Mindfulness. It helps you winning back yourself, finding the richness of life again and get to the bottom of your values and what is relevant in life. Also want to add, that practicing mindfulness does not sedate you. You will see what you have to see.

            Yeah, I'm kinda at the same point.  I listen to my spouse go on about social things and think "why does this matter?"  Not in a "I've given up way", but in a "there are a lot more serious topics to discuss than this."
           </p>
           <p>
            I've had to curtail about 90% of my discussions about this topic, lest I am accused of "obsessing" about it.  Which I'm not.  It's a real-life Criminal Minds episode.  No series.  No...entire run of show.

            The shills are proof that this is real and that you are making a difference. Would you rather be ignored?  The more shills the better. As for your emotional state, finding out that you have been betrayed and that the world is not as it should is really shitty thing to have to experience. you would be a sociopath to not be upset. The truth is shining brighter everyday.

             Agree 100%.  I put the shill warning out there to deter real researchers with bad attitudes and stupid impulses from wrecking the sub.  Shills are gonna shill regardless.

            I can't say I'm in shock about 'pizzagate'. I am never 100 percent happy for forever cause I feel this hideousness is out there. I am, however, really relieved that people are talking about this and it's coming out. I sense it has been stuck down hard in our psyches for a long time.

             It does make one wonder, how long society has been aware of this and buried it into the subconscious as a defense mechanism.  This could be a millennia of the ruling elite doing what they want, the common person knowing, but unable to do anything.  What does any human do?  Suppress the horrors.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is implied, societal norms which have conditioned us to act and think a certain way.  No one has to tell a young kid not to mess with their sibling (sexually).  It is "known".  I'm not sure how, it just is.  There are a ton of other examples of societal "guidelines" which do not need to be taught or learned.  It's woven into our fabric, molded by generations of societal and cultural mores.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also the equivalent of a "mental blind spot".  The brain shuts out the concept of CP as unrecognizable for most, just as some people can be hypnotized while others cannot.

            Don't let this get you paranoid, if this is happening - it's been happening for years and years (fuck, could be centuries).

            At the end of the day, as selfish as it sounds - your own sanity is more important than this. Contribute and stay curious but I wouldn't put your wellbeing at risk.

             Thank Fox.  Actually, my state of mental health is just shy of excellent.  I posted this because I am so squared away mentally, and I see how this affects me.  I cannot imagine how it would affect someone not as mentally strong, which is not a negative.  Those people are usually more open-minded and empathetic than I am.  I do appreciate the concern.

              Yeah it could really send the wrong person off the deep end.. people with existing mental disorders.
             </p>
             <p>
              Or the seasoned conspiracy theorist.. this could be the straw that breaks the camels back.
             </p>
             <p>
              I get more charged up (pissed and disbelief) about how irresponsible and desperate the elite/media look right now with accusations towards Russia.. and the whole trump smear job.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's more "evidence" for pizzagate than there is for Russian hacking - and the White House is putting out statements.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, I think it makes anyone look at the world a bit differently if they believe even half of this stuff that's coming out / happening.
