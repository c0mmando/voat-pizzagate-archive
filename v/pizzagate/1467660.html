<p>Why keep records of this? Because it reveals a lot. </p>
<p>Were they innocent -- were all of this &quot;fake news&quot; -- they would simply address the details and show us that it\'s all some giant misunderstanding. </p>
<ul>
<li>They would show us why Denis Hastert didn\'t really molest any children. (Podesta calls him a &quot;nice, wonderful guy&quot;)</li>
<li>They would show us why James Alefantis doesn\'t really have an icon of pedophilia on his instagram avatar. </li>
<li>They would show us why Jeffrey Epstien isn\'t, in fact, a pedophile. </li>
<li>They would show us why over 100 pentagon employees weren\'t in fact caught with child porn on their computers</li>
<li>They would show us why CEO of New York Times Mark Thompson didn\'t, in fact, lie about arch pedophile Jimmy Saville. </li>
<li>They would show us why Amanda Kleinman (Comet Ping Pong associate) didn\'t really put photos of sexual mutilation and babies dressed as pizza outfits in her video</li>
<li>They would show us why FBI agent Ted Gunderson was not right about there being massive pedophilia within the US government. </li>
<li>They would show us why Podesta wasn\'t, in fact, found with pictures of abused and undressed minors in his home. </li>
<li>They would show us why pictures of men giving blow jobs to pizza and putting pizza on their genitals weren\'t really posted by friends of Comet Ping Pong</li>
<li>They would show us why Salon didn\'t, in fact, publish an article defending pedophiles (&quot;I\'m a pedophile, not a monster&quot;)</li>
<li>They would show us why the FBI documenting pedophile symbols didn\'t, in fact, document them. </li>
</ul>
<p>And so on, and so forth. </p>
<p>They aren\'t doing any of that. They won\'t even go near it, because it\'s all true and we\'ve all seen it with our own eyes. Instead, they have taken down evidence, censored us, scrubbed online footprints, and used their panicked media mouthpieces like New York Times and BBC and CNN to repeat &quot;fake news&quot; ad nauseum and hope their readers fall for it. </p>
<p>They are cornered sewer rats. </p>
<p>Which is frightening, because it\'s a tacit admission that this is our reality. Yes, this is our reality now. Children are <em>really</em> going through this. </p>
<p>The cries of the innocent are louder than their propaganda. These are the victims:</p>
