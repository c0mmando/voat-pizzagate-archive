            In 2012, Virgin Atlantic carried 5.4 million passengers, making it the seventh-largest UK airline in terms of passenger volume. On 31 December 2013, it reported a £51 million group pre-tax loss (approximately US$87 million), however, in the year to 31 December 2014 the airline reported a return to pre-tax profit of £14.4 million. In July 2017, Virgin Atlantic announced its intention to form a joint venture with Air France-KLM. Under the agreement, will acquire a 31% stake in Virgin Atlantic currently held by Virgin Group for £220 million The deal is scheduled to be completed in early 2019. Air France-KLM, a union of two of Europe’s most recognizable brands, one the leading carrier of the world’s most-visited country, spent three months in a leaderless stasis before finally appointing Ben Smith, Air Canada’s 46-year-old chief operating officer, on Aug. 16. What's it all aboot, is high criminal behavior. Dutch are not exactly German when reading the financial blogs as I am inclined to do. English, forget about it.

            <p>
             Millicom International Cellular SA is an international telecommunications and media company, founded by Shelby Bryan, Jan Stenbeck, Telma Sosa, and Olvin Galdamez. It offers a wide range of digital services to more than 51 million customers primarily under the Tigo brand in eleven markets in Africa and Latin America.
            </p>
            <p>
             Millicom originated as a company set up by Jan Stenbeck to operate voice and data distribution networks via cellular radio.[3][4] In Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.[5] it received one of three of the first cellular development licenses awarded by the FCC.
            </p>
            <p>
             After two years of planning, the company began operations when the founders completed a $131,000 share purchase in May 1982. The firm took over paging company, Meta Systems in October 1982 and then raised $9 million in its first round of financing, managed by Chief Executive Officer, Orhan Sadik-Khan and
             <strong>
              Kevin Kimberlin
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             In December 1989, Millicom set up Microtel Communications Ltd. by teaming up with Pacific Telesis and British Aerospace (later bought out by Hutchinson Telecom.)

            <p>
             Kevin Kimberlin is chairman of Spencer Trask &amp; Co. an advanced technology firm. Kimberlin has distinguished himself by partnering with or backing "obsessive missionaries" including Jonas Salk, Walter Gilbert, John Wennberg and Robert Langer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prior to its public offering, Kimberlin was the sole general partner of Next Level Communications, a broadband access leader, 20% owned by Kimberlin LLC and 80% owned by General Instrument Corporation.[15] Kimberlin guided Next Level through its IPO, achieving a market capitalization of $17 billion before it was acquired by Motorola in 2002.
            </p>
            <p>
             He then co-founded Myriad Genetics, the first human genome company, with Nobel Prize winner Dr. Walter Gilbert, Peter Meldrum, and Dr. Mark Skolnick, the scientist who, with several colleagues, devised the gene-mapping technique that catalyzed the Human Genome Project.[19] Myriad Genetics received international acclaim by discovering the breast cancer gene, BRCA1.[20]
            </p>
            <p>
             Osiris Therapeutics, also co-founded by Kevin Kimberlin, uses adult stem cells to bypass the ethical and moral controversy surrounding this scientific breakthrough. Osiris received the world's first regulatory approval for a stem cell-based therapy, and is recognized as a leader in regenerative medicine.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2014, Kimberlin was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".

             The original FB page post was deleted, not by the mods and not but the OP.  Reposted now, but also some kind of "glitch".

            My thoughts are: If real, holy shit. If fake, damn they're good.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously though, If real, I am glad to see some people with insider knowledge putting the puzzle pieces together. They will be the ones to bring this down. We have no proof and we live in a world which regards proof as the most important piece of the puzzle. (rightfully so)
