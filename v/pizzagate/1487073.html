            Need to keep the publics levels of disgust and outrage getting higher and higher, memes, good, visceral memes with concrete questions which are disturbing. Franklin only fizzled out because they avoided national exposure and local media and law enforcement harassed, scared and murdered the small amount of people willing to speak out, thereby intimidating every1 else. Very hard for them to do in this case when I'd imagine at least 100k already know damn well whats going on

             I completely agree with you, shocking images and stories will fan the flame for justice. The public out cry must be so loud it cannot be ignored or suppressed. I know if we learn from the past we can avoid mistakes that were made. We have a resource that people did not have before, social media and internet. The rabble needs to be incited to demand justice. :)  I had to throw that in there because these pedo elites think of us as trashy rabble.( Also I am not suggesting any form of violence either.)

            I say our drop dead date is around January 31, 2017.  I don't think I can't stand it much longer past that.  I say we continue telling all the people we can and we march on Washington.  We HAVE to do something!  I posted something to the FBI day before yesterday asking if they had pinned their post about hiring people because they were hiring people to serve as patriots and who maybe didn't have an Ivy League education.  That same day they posted this...

           <p>
            I think they are asking for help because they need it and I don't think they really care about physical fitness or education.  I think they want patriots!

            The Franklin Scandal fizzled because victims, witnesses, and investigators became frightened for their lives.  Victims changed their story after they saw what happened to teenager Alicia Owen for telling the truth... 9-25 year prison sentence for perjury.  Much of it in solitary confinement.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were also many mysterious deaths surrounding those willing to come forward with evidence.  Investigator Gary Caradori had incriminating photos and his plane exploded mid-air.  Troy Bonner's brother committed "suicide".  With a corrupt judicial system, police department, and local newspaper, victims had nowhere to turn.

             I was just about to type your entire post. Yes, people started talking/researching and then they were murdered - I think there are 20 or so deaths associated w/ Franklin case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, we have the internet - the most powerful tool the pedo cartel has in its arsenal and also its biggest liability. No one believed the Franklin story, believed the kids because these were still relatively unfamiliar crimes and no way would someone believe leaders in the community would be capable of these types of crimes. The general public knows better and is certainly learning th emore noise is made abut PG and references to prior cases here and abroad. Also, the MSM cartel is all-powerful but we are a swarm of angry bees.

              I lived in Omaha during the Franklin scandal and am intimately familiar with the details and truth.  I worked in the "Old Market" area and know many of the faces and places involved in the Franklin scandal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many people with personal knowledge of the Franklin cover up are alive today and still refuse to step forward out of fear.  The rabbit hole is deep.  Be careful out there.

            Keep the water filters clear of debris - swap drainage aint pretty. The people here cannot unsee whats been seen, there is a global awakening occurring right now in response to the globalist elite's attempt to pursue this by force, this is just the start.

             I agree 100 percent. There is a silent majority that are lurking here and in others sites. Our numbers are a threat to the powers that be on a global scale! Even the pope had to make a statement on the dangers of fake news.

              Love the reuters spun the headline before passing out the news article to make it seem like the fake news was everyone bar the media. Pope actually said if you read the full dialog that media was 'always wanting to cover scandals, covering nasty things, even if they are true' I took this as a vote of confidence from him but reuters sent it out with such a misleading title that few actually read what he said.

               I hope you are right! This whole thing has made me more spiritual yet the popes statement had me questioning my faith. I know if we don't give up we can get some of these children from the abyss. I really believe that!

                Heres an extract from a non US news source on the same news ... notice any differences? :) I dont recall many scandals involving social media covering them up.
               </p>
               <p>
                "No-one has a right to do this. It is a sin and it is hurtful," said Pope Francis, adding to the criticism of the media’s role in spreading false stories.
               </p>
               <p>
                "I think the media have to be very clear, very transparent, and not fall into – no offence intended – the sickness of coprophilia, that is, always wanting to cover scandals, covering nasty things, even if they are true," he said.
               </p>
               <p>
                Coincidentally, actor Denzel Washington shared the pope’s sentiments, using a red carpet event on Wednesday to criticize the media, claiming journalists were preferencing speed over accuracy.
               </p>
               <p>
                "If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you do read it, you're misinformed," Washington told journalists gathered at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC for the premier of his new film ‘Fences’.
               </p>
               <p>
                Washington said the effect of today’s mass news consumption is “too much information” which has led to the “need to be first, not even to be true anymore.”

            Call the NYPD public affairs and tell them you're waiting for accountability in these matters, and not just the low hanging fruit. As sick as it makes people, it's the ONLY thing that will restore the republic back to it's people. Start calling them, put the pressure on them. They gave it to the compromised himself director of FBI Comey!

             I think that is a good idea. I also read a thread a few minutes ago that some citizens in Norway have organized their own citizen investigative group. I think that  if we can learn from the franklin coverup law enforcement helps to cover this up. Should that be an option at some point?
