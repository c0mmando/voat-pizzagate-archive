<p>In July 1980, Epstein was featured as the magazine’s “Bachelor of the Month,” a tiny section advertising successful single men across the country. </p>
<p>At the time, he was a Bear Stearns trader and asked potential dates to write him at the investment bank\'s former headquarters in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p>The personals ad, which included a photo of Epstein in a suit, portrayed him as a “New York dynamo” seeking “a cute Texas girl.”</p>
<p>“Financial strategist Jeffrey Epstein, 27, talks only to people who make over a million a year!” the listing declared. “If you’re ‘a cute Texas girl,’ write this New York dynamo at 55 Water St., 49th floor, N.Y.C. 10041.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear if anyone met Epstein through the Cosmopolitan writeup. Media representatives for the magazine didn’t return messages left by The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>Interesting: The article says that the British *Mail on Sunday called Epstein a Mossad and CIA as early as 1992.</p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p>Also, Epstein has ties to the <strong>Stockholm School of Economics</strong> - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[in 2002], Epstein was even awarded “Best Male Support” at the conclusion of the Stockholm School of Economics’ “Female Economist of the Year” scholarship ceremony. </p>
<p>While the business school’s website doesn’t name Epstein, identifying the winner as “an important but for now anonymous Friend,” a Scandinavian magazine did recognize him. </p>
<p><em>Nordic Reach</em> quoted the scholarship’s founder, New York-based executive <strong>Barbro Ehnbom</strong>, who said the “Best Male Support” designation was created “to honor a specific Friend who was extra helpful and supportive during the previous year.” </p>
<p>The article then listed “New York City Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein” as the 2002 recipient. (IRS records for his charity, Epstein Interests, show a $25,000 donation to the school for the tax year beginning in June 2001 and ending in May 2002. His other nonprofit, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation, donated at least $125,000 to the school from 2005 to 2010, tax returns show.)</p>
<p>Hanna Flodmark, a spokeswoman for the Stockholm School of Economics, said Epstein’s donations were made to a fund run by Ehnbom, who is an alumna and “important patron of the school.” </p>
<p>Ehnbom’s scholarship is a “separate business” from SSE, though the school has administrated the funds for her in years past.</p>
