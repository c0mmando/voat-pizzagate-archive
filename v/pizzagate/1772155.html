<p>I was perusing the US Patent and Trademark site, and found a trademark called PEDO BURRITO, from Nov 1999.<br />
<a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75608331&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75608331&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch</a></p>

<p>Dental restraints.  Hmm…</p>
<p>Here’s the original application
<a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn75608331&amp;docId=SPE20091007162017#docIndex=9&amp;page=1">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn75608331&amp;docId=SPE20091007162017#docIndex=9&amp;page=1</a>. </p>
<p>The trademark was simply typed words in all caps.  It was sent in on a label, according to the paperwork.   Not real impressive for a company logo. (And there also exists the possibility that this company is a front.)</p>
<p>Meet Vacharee Peterson. She\'s listed as the trademark owner as an individual. There was also a former owner (same last name, and may have been a dentist), according to the paperwork. Husband or ex husband maybe?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cdentc.org/meet-the-cdc-team">http://www.cdentc.org/meet-the-cdc-team</a></p>
<p>Vacharee is the CEO of the Community Dental Care. It’s a dental clinic, which includes pediatric patient treatment. She trademarked the Pedo Burrito name for her safety restraint device for young dental patients in 1999.<br />
CDC is a big practice, with four dental office locations. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our multilingual and multicultural dentists and staff are gentle, kind and compassionate. They will try to make your dental experience easy, fast and pleasant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Philanthropic too. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Started in 2006 as a partnership with other area providers, Program to Improve Community Oral Health (PICOH), which is grounded in evidence-based practices and has received national recognition, provides in-clinic oral health prevention and education for children and pregnant women, outreach, and school-based preventive oral health programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PICOH has a very interesting logo too. <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/512bd43d9c/10479.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/512bd43d9c/10479.png</a></p>
<p>It looks like a butterfly, and is made up of two big people and one little person between them.  We’ve seen these same type of logo arrangements before.</p>
<p>I searched “Combination pediatric patient safety restraint and cushion for dental patients” and this was one result.  Just an interesting book called “Pediatric Dentistry for Special Child”
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8kuJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=Combination+pediatric+patient+safety+restraint+and+cushion+for+dental+patients.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wkz758B3i3&amp;sig=jJ6BW1Qzp2DuwV0Mujacm_-1XBA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRl_iMrY7TAhUFOCYKHR_xArgQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Combination%20pediatric%20patient%20safety%20restraint%20and%20cushion%20for%20dental%20patients.&amp;f=false">Google result</a> </p>
<p>Some interesting images came up in the search for pedo burrito <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/512bd43d9c/10480.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/512bd43d9c/10480.png</a></p>
<p>As I was looking though the dental images of kids strapped helplessly to boards, with their mouths pried open with metal hooks, sedated at the hands of a sadist, I just get sick to my stomach.</p>
<p>So I will just leave this here, if anyone is interested in pursuing it further.

<p>Dentistry plays a large role in trafficking somehow. Plenty of opportunities. There is stem cell harvesting.  Trackers can be inserted.  You can be injected with medications. You can be molested while you are unconscious. (My child went to a pediatric clinic once, and I was not pleased with the “no parents allowed in treatment room” policy.  We swapped to a family dentist instead.) Are low-income kids being funneled into the dental system with all this low-cost/free care?</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The US Patent and Trademark Office is a resource that has been overlooked, especially in regard to company trademarked logos.  You can break them down by the elements, such as swirls, curved lines, etc. I spent a lot of time there just looking around for the first time today.

            I remember Seinfeld Episode when he ends up drugged and molested in a dentist's chair run by a pervert dentist and her pervert assistant. I found it rather weird. Now I am wondering if they were hinting at something or simply rubbing it in!

            "Ped" as a prefix definitely just indicates "child", but "pedo" is another story

            There is a low income dental clinic in my city that routinely picks children up from school for the day to get dental care. Once, maybe 20 yeara ago they took my little brother out of school for the day without prior consent from our parents. We didnt think much of it at the time but, that clinic still operates the same way to this day. When i saw the dentist chair in Epsteins house my mind immediately went to that dental clinic.  There is really shady stuff going on there. I wonder how many clinics nationwide have this kind of "take the kids out of school"  policy.

             Having seen all of the things that they are doing to children now, and finding how prevalent it is, I now advise all my friends who have children and grand children to insist on being in the room at the doctor and dentist office.  At all times.  These perverts are so sick they would go through all the schooling and learning just to get their hands on these children.  Sick.
