             , you're making a claim here that we need to censor ourselves, hide our political affiliation in order to remain "credible", yet you provide no evidence supporting that claim per Rule 2.
            </p>
            <p>
             All you are offering here is the ridicule of the pedo-controlled propagandists who have tried to silence pizzagate from the beginning. Why would listening to them and shutting up be an effective redpilling strategy?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm giving this the 24 Hour Reprieve flair so you can try to find some actual support for the idea that throwing away our First Amendment rights will help bring down the Pedocracy. Good luck.

            All of it stems from abuse of power and partisan politics are a fog on the truth, if anything. This evil infects the media, religion, politics and every other major societal institution - it must all be dragged out into the light.

            There is substantial evidence that Trump is going after pedos.
There is abundant reasons for the pedo elite to drive apart any and all groups going after pedos.
Therefore, if Trump is going after pedos, the elites will seek to drive other groups that go after pedos, away from supporting Trump.
A way to drive anti-pedos against Trump is to use the tired old trope of "partisan politics"--- a term that has frankly lost all meaning.
So, OP is doing exactly what pedo elites would be doing IF Trump were going after pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's really easy to see what's going on. Everyone should be DEEPLY suspicious of ANY thread that is urging people to get divided. Very very very obvious why this would be so important. And it is very very obvious that all the shill resources of the elites are working nonstop, trying to stop investigation in anyway they can.

             You people really need to educate yourselves and learn to use vernacular and context. Trump could very well be 'going after the pedos', common street level human traffickers that trained with or learned their trade from the big boys. Trump is not going to go after the 'pedos' that have used children, their OWN CHILDREN AS WELL, to COMPROMISE and extort governments, drug cartels and LIBERTY MOVEMENTS LIKE THE IRA and have a foothold in EVERYTHING. TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO GO AFTER ANY OF THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE IS PART OF THE ORGANIZATION AT THE TOP THAT ORGANIZES THEM, plain and simple, he's a Chabad-Lubavitcher and most likely the proverbial false satan of the Bible. Really folks, this is a battle that has been waging for THOUSANDS of years and they are not going to let your petty belief systems get in the way of the grand plan, regardless if your atheist ass believes in the Bible or not, there are BILLIONS of people round the world that believe in one of the three abrahamic religions, it is THEY whom they have to convince that the entire saga is in some way real in order to create the necessary energy around what they are creating, so they are ENGINEERING the climax to make it appear as though it is as real as what the Bible predicted so that can slip in their modes of control to make the whole thing come off effortlessly, and that is the creation of the fourth temple to YHWH in Jerusalem, the future capitol of the world in religion and finance, the ultimate tribute to satan, lucifer, baal, enki and the annunaki.

Do you have an argument for this wild claim? If Trump makes a joke about HRC "taking a village in Haiti"-- does he do that to signal that he is protecting high level pedos? Or is it the opposite? If Trump is going after high level pedos, will boards like this be flooded with shills trying to divide support from him? Of course.

            I was going to try and interject last night but what I would have wrote would have turned into a novel. How can anyone cover over 100 years of conspiracy and have it make any sense to those that haven't been in it for a very long time and can understand how each side has fed and played off off each other from their inception. The different forms of  "Democrat' and 'Republican' that look nothing like what they were in the early years of this country, so much known and distorted history versus true history, and so many versions and interpretational distortions within one individual that a cohesive explanation would only just begin to cover it all, an impossible task trying to explain it to someone simply just trying to research Pizzagate. A pandora's box noone really truly understands fully.

            The confusion and chaos reign for a reason, the programming is strong precisely so people do not see it coming. Period.

             They have a whole internet to play political cheerleader in. I don't know why they can't do it there instead of alienating us to half the voting American public who will call us "right wing conspiracy tards" if we mix politics into this sub. Horrible marketing vision to say the least.

              Stop pretending "politics" is magically segregated from the rest of reality. If Trump is going after pedos, will the elites go after him? Of course they will... If Trump is going after pedos, and elites are therefore going after him, are you "playing politics" by defending Trump, or are you fighting pedos? It depends on whether or not you ACTUALLY care about stopping pedos, or if you want to derail stopping of pedos with absolute vague and worthless cant about politics-- wouldn't you agree?
             </p>
             <p>
              For the sake of argument, explain to me how to separate your "partisan politics" from the overall mission of fighting a massively elite power structure, when all power runs through the political process-- it seems to me this highlights the absolute deceptiveness of this particular propaganda angle, but please, be my guest... Imagine, for the sake of argument, that a president is going after pedos, and elites are going after him...Now what exactly, out of your response, is "politics", and what is fighting pedophilia? How do you make that distinction?

                I bet it is. I bet you can't make an argument, because there isn't one for you to make, because your position is so very weak here. But feel free to prove me wrong. Using sound and valid reasoning, rather than such an utterly feeble tactic as this post.

                What kind of childish nonsense is this, in lieu of discussion? If you can't admit that a president
                <em>
                 that calls out HRC for Haiti
                </em>
                MIGHT be going after pedos-- if you can't even allow that thought into discussion... then what is your agenda? You can't post like this and still pretend you're being objective here. If Trump were going after high level pedos, would there be shills trying to stop him? Yes or no? This is a crucial question. It must be addressed if we're being serious in any way.

                 Newbie I have been doing this for over 20 years and I have seen you sleep walk through this forum many times. We are dealing with a 6000 year old Babylonian child sacrifice cult that runs the entire world. A couple of snide remarks from Trump to Hillary about Haiti accomplished all of fuck all didn't it?

                 There are a lot of people who would believe in pizzagate, and help spread the word, but will refuse to help because they don't like Trump, Republicans, politics, etc....My message is common sense. If you give a lecture to a room full of people about child abuse the worst thing to do is spend half of their time blasting them with politics.

                 The listeners didn't come to your lecture to hear about politics. They came to learn about child abuse. duhhhh Half the people in this country don't like Trump and most of those people also hate child abuse and would help if people like you would leave your political soap box at home.

            , you're making a claim here that we need to censor ourselves, hide our political affiliation in order to remain "credible", yet you provide no evidence supporting that claim per Rule 2. All you are offering here is the ridicule of the pedo-controlled propagandists who have tried to silence pizzagate from the beginning. Why would listening to them and shutting up be an effective redpilling strategy?
           </p>

            I'm giving this the 24 Hour Reprieve flair so you can try to find some actual support for the idea that throwing away our First Amendment rights will help bring down the Pedocracy. Good luck.

             I am in opposition to this particular flair, I believe this thread is very important to the overall discussion of Pizzagate. The rprecussions of these revelations will not be entertained for anothr 70 years, NONE of this will be entertained for at least the next fifty years anyway after WWIII breaks out. So, what the fuck ever.

             By mixing pizzagate with politics you are exposing pizzagate to ridicule from half the American voting block who will not only ignore us but work against us. I keep preaching the destructiveness of mixing pizzagate with politics but for some reason it won't sink in with ya. I don't understand why you would expose us to ridicule by half of the voting American public and cause them to work against us and try to make us look stupid.

              I'm telling you, there is a deeper psyop regarding Jones followers than I can figure out at the moment. I've been following the memes ever since they started and of course Jones being the cointellpro that he is is feeding it. Jones is the lynchpin in helping take down the conspiracy community.

              You are setting up a false dichotomy, ES. And it's between two fake narratives. What about actual reality: Pizzagate is a multi-partisan investigation in which thousands of small government Libertarians, appalled liberals betrayed by their party, and conservatives disgusted with the moral decay of the nation have joined forces to stop the corruption and abuse of children and public institutions. You don't build an effective team by pretending everyone is motivated by the same things or has the same strengths and weaknesses.  You don't build an effective team by telling people their point of view is unacceptable and they should shut up. You build a team by developing a shared vision through discussion and collaboration.

               Exactly. Which is why when we try to convince an auditorium full of people that children are being raped by our government we don't play favorites during the presentation. When we address the audience with a speech about children being tortured and raped, we don't hand out Q biscuits and free Trumpy Bears. Because if we do that half of our audience will throw the Trumpy Bears and Q biscuits at us and leave in disgust. They will then go tell people that pizzagate is a far right conspiracy and they will actively work against us.

               They can't and won't discuss the details, especially about Rothschild's Zionism that Trump is the U.S. salesman and face for right now. The accusations usually go something like "you are just against Trump." Yawn...

                Yes, that's about it.  After the election I constantly said I did not vote for him but am willing to give him a chance and no remarks.  But as soon as I even hinted that he may be other than some may think, immediate retaliation.  We have lost so many to the Q subverse it is hard to do all the researching and when you ping them many do not respond or jump in and are gone.  I do not understand the Hopium, since they know that is what happened with BO, but now the forest seems to be too dense.  They cannot see the trees.

                  Ha.  Yes, many talk a good game that they are on to the fact there are not two parties, it does not take much to hit a nerve.  I remember  last year there was a huge effort to brand Bernie as a pedophile.  I don't know if he is or not, just being Jewish is just not enough.  But do not dare say anything about DT that he said this or that and you will be quickly taken down.  I have never intimated that about him.  Never.  That is a horrid label to hang on anyone.

                    Yes, well if they believe in Trump they believe in the 2 party system.  The same with Hillary or whoever they will run.  I don't know what to do about the election.  Do we vote or not vote, that is the question.  So we are left to wonder.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I never called for censorship. And what political affiliation? Everyone here in the comments doesn't even consider this investigation to lie anywhere on the stupid phony political spectrum. I'm stating if we truly want to maintain a non partisan appeal, we need to divorce ourselves from the "fake" left right paradigm and be weary to not be "merged" in with the extremist right pro-Trump nonsensical circus.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aren't you the guy who is obsessed with "Q" and thinks Donald Trump is actually taking down "deep state pedos"? I've seen actual Q posts stickied here on a sub about pedophiilia, pumping everyone full of trump hopium. Get that political leaning nonsense out of here, thats so naive. We don't need a political demagogue to take these people down, and it's possibly a trap anyway.

              It's so obvious they are using the Obama Hopium Op on the Right.  I fell for BO Hopium  and I have to admit it was a great feeling.  But what a Drop to the Bottom.  Just write in a comment in any thread that you don't believe the Q posts and you get attacked.  Well, that used to be the situation.  Now many of our people are over in the Q sub.  I was trying to help out someone with their post and I pinged a bunch of people.  Just a couple of answers and very short.  No help to research anymore.  This was and is the plan.  To divide us just like the country.

             <p>
              This relates to Pizzagate in the sense that promises from Q and Donald Trump are a ruse and are only attempting to stall the truth while making Trump look like he's doing something about it, Q somehow being highly relevant here in the pursuit of child trafficking and the subject of Pizzagate. The fact of the matter is that TOO MUCH TIME HAS PASSED SINCE HIS INAUGURATION AND THESE REVELATIONS. We could have been embroiled in a Third World War by now if it wasn't the actions of US OUT HERE, FUCK DONALD TRUMP HE IS DOING NOTHING AND IS ONE OF THEM.

               AN OVERVIEW OF THE OCCULTED POWERS
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Lurking behind the “Democratic Facade” (the so-called “democratic” governments that the public sees as the guiding hands in our world), are the Occulted Powers (OPs). The OPs are a criminal conglomerate of the local royal families throughout the world who are intermarried and/or interoperating with the global network of Jewish bankster families. Under this worldwide royal/Jew “elite,” there are a variety of secret societies (such as the Freemasons) and criminal gangs (such as the Triads) who recruit useful “commoners” into their conspiracy and run societies at the street level.
             </p>
             <p>
              As with any large gang of criminals, there is some degree of competition amongst the families as they compete for power, position and wealth within the syndicate, but they are all united in furthering their collective control and exploitation of the human race. They are the ones who have been pushing for ever more centralized control of humanity; they are the “globalists.”
             </p>
             <p>
              An interesting thing about these OPs is that they have their own system of spirituality, which can most accurately be called “the Mystery School.” Whether the gang leaders at the very top actually believe in the spiritual mumbo jumbo of the Mystery School, though, is unclear. There may be some sort of “spiritual” force feeding them their religion, or they may have simply made it up as a control mechanism for their underlings. Whether it’s real or made up, though, it plays a central role in everything they do.
             </p>
             <p>
              With this in mind, have a look at the Masonic art outside of the New Carrollton Federal Building in Lanham, Maryland…

               Left Hand Path and the Right Hand Path
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              …This sculpture depicts the Left Hand Path and the Right Hand Path of the OPs’ (Occulted Power) occultic spirituality. As you can see, the Left Hand (which sits on a black base) is pointing over to the open Right Hand (which sits upon a white base). This reflects the OPs’ practice of using the Left Hand (the “dark side,” which brings about destruction and chaos) to scare people into the open, welcoming Right Hand (the “light side,” which brings about construction and order).
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look upon the world situation now, you can see that the Anglo-American branch of the OPs are acting as the Left Hand (bringing terror, war, and theft that is destroying the existing world order and scaring humanity towards something new), and the BRICS branch of the OPs are acting as the Right Hand (“opposing” the actions of the Anglo-American axis and welcoming humanity into a “peaceful, fair” new world order that they are constructing). Once you understand this basic idea of how the Two Hands work together to control the world, everything you see around you starts making sense.

            The horror of pedogate, SRA and blackmail / entrapment via pedophile honeypot operations is worldwide. This is NOT a partisan issue. When the stories were breaking about call boys in the White House 30 years ago, it was a republican administration. Plenty of sickos on both sides of the political spectrum.

            I make the same point as often as possible. Mixing pizzagate with partisan politics will only dilute the pizzagate message and mush it up with D.C. political drama. I think the pizzagate message should remain pure. Both parties are crooks so why mix our message up with their crap?

             I'm kind of perplexed about this in many different ways. It's been so sickeningly obvious from the beginning that Trump was no different from most slobby businessman and in fact would live up to the exact stereotype that he has portrayed from the beginning of his television debut. He is the typical American product of excess and greed and CERTAIN American people cannot see past the misogyny that he truly represents, it truly is a psychological PHENOMENA. It is an INDICATOR at the level of INTENSE APATHY AND BLINDNESS to a condition that is TANTAMOUNT to APATHY AND EVIL.
            </p>
            <p>
             How in the FUCK could so many MILLIONS of people have this fat fucker standing there day in and day out saying 100% DISQUALIFYING statements during his presidency, not understanding the Constitution, wanting to change laws to protect HIMSELF against libel, and even just a HINT of a RUMOR that he has cheated on his wife with hookers let alone PEED on some of them is enough to have to step down, I mean, how far has the overton window slid on the American public that we have to even entertain this kind of trash in public office, AND THIS ISN'T EVEN THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIM. I don't want a SAINT or a FREAKY SAINT like Pence in there but damnit someone that doesn't make life absolutely crazy wondering what this PIG is up to.

             I DESPISE the Clinton regime, and anyone that knows my work knows that too, but I find that even though I make that PAINFULLY AND OBVIOUSLY CLEAR each and every time, I'm still accused of having some type of party affiliation. These retards just cant get away from t. Eventually you just have to settle on the fact that they truly are just mentally handicapped, and if you really look at ow truly deep the conditioning is in the world the reality is enough to make you insane because no matter how hard you fight it they will come back at you ten fold because they know you think they are retarded and like a retard want to get back at you somehow. It's a mind fuck and I'm getting pretty fucking fed up with it all, but thats what it was designed for too. We are dealing with powerful magic.

              I fail to see why a few people, particularly the people in control of this sub, want to alienate half of our customer base by playing politics. It opens up being "crazy right wing tards" by half the voting public. There is a whole internet to play assgrab with politics, but no, they insist on infecting this sub like a virus and alienating our customer base. duh...

            I don't know anyone I would call alt-right or alt-left. That means nothing to me or anyone I know. It is a made up term that someone cooked up to put people in one pot and then put the heat on to discredit anything the group says. Pizzagate should be and I think could be apolitical. Isn't our goal to out those who traffic, abuse and kill children for the elite? Some of those involved are politicians but most are business folks, royalty or just rich people.

              <strong>
               AN OVERVIEW OF THE OCCULTED POWERS
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Lurking behind the “Democratic Facade” (the so-called “democratic” governments that the public sees as the guiding hands in our world), are the Occulted Powers (OPs). The OPs are a criminal conglomerate of the local royal families throughout the world who are intermarried and/or interoperating with the global network of Jewish bankster families. Under this worldwide royal/Jew “elite,” there are a variety of secret societies (such as the Freemasons) and criminal gangs (such as the Triads) who recruit useful “commoners” into their conspiracy and run societies at the street level.
             </p>
             <p>
              As with any large gang of criminals, there is some degree of competition amongst the families as they compete for power, position and wealth within the syndicate, but they are all united in furthering their collective control and exploitation of the human race. They are the ones who have been pushing for ever more centralized control of humanity; they are the “globalists.”
             </p>
             <p>
              An interesting thing about these OPs is that they have their own system of spirituality, which can most accurately be called “the Mystery School.” Whether the gang leaders at the very top actually believe in the spiritual mumbo jumbo of the Mystery School, though, is unclear. There may be some sort of “spiritual” force feeding them their religion, or they may have simply made it up as a control mechanism for their underlings. Whether it’s real or made up, though, it plays a central role in everything they do.
             </p>
             <p>
              With this in mind, have a look at the Masonic art outside of the New Carrollton Federal Building in Lanham, Maryland…
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="http://redefininggod.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/masonicart.jpg">
               Left Hand Path and the Right Hand Path
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              …This sculpture depicts the Left Hand Path and the Right Hand Path of the OPs’ (Occulted Power) occultic spirituality. As you can see, the Left Hand (which sits on a black base) is pointing over to the open Right Hand (which sits upon a white base). This reflects the OPs’ practice of using the Left Hand (the “dark side,” which brings about destruction and chaos) to scare people into the open, welcoming Right Hand (the “light side,” which brings about construction and order).
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look upon the world situation now, you can see that the Anglo-American branch of the OPs are acting as the Left Hand (bringing terror, war, and theft that is destroying the existing world order and scaring humanity towards something new), and the BRICS branch of the OPs are acting as the Right Hand (“opposing” the actions of the Anglo-American axis and welcoming humanity into a “peaceful, fair” new world order that they are constructing). Once you understand this basic idea of how the Two Hands work together to control the world, everything you see around you starts making sense.

               Pizzagate people tend to have better sight than most. It escapes me why a few diehards don't see, or refuse to see this, because cheering for their favorite team, and our destruction, is just too much damn fun.

                 Yeah, and this morning a former (but still liberal!) magazine editor who's a friend of mine argued that Judicial Watch bringing up the fact that HRC still has not turned almost 700 emails is heavy acquisitions without any proof. That’s not the hallmark of serious journalism, she tells me.

                 The cognitive dissonance is 10 feet thick of steel reinforced concrete and I see it with my republican friends too. And that's with shit I don't even think is important compared to torturing and killing children or... nuclear war.

            True, though it should be duly noted that the bulk of the shills (namely KnightsOfHubris and the head shill Are_We_Sure) are leftists.

             Doesn't matter. Shills will always find a way to try and control the narrative, regardless of the party they represent. They get paid to "infiltrate".

             Not much neutrality on this board anymore.  Used to be when I started about 1 yr. ago.  Have to walk a tight wire.
