            These mass shooters are MKUltra victims. They drug people up with scopolamine and hypnotize them to murder people. Beltway snipers? Hypnosis victims. Look up Arcan Cetin. He was seeing a therapist before he went on his spree. They use psychiatric confessions to determine ideal candidates. If someone says "I'm a loner blah blah blah", that fast-tracks them for hypnosis, because their lack of connections to other people makes it easier, because there aren't any friends or acquaintances to establish a baseline for their behavior or mental state. They target loners. They use them for murder, including satanic ritual murder. If people had any idea of the darkness at the tip-top of society, they would take their own lives from despair. People have entrusted their lives to monsters! People have voted for these monsters!

             ‘Tracing The Evolution Of A Satanic Scare’

             In the Dominion 30th Mar 99, Alan Sampson discussed a paper on the background of satanic abuse in New Zealand titled: ‘Satan’s Excellent Adventure Down Under'(link) by Victoria University sociology Professor Michael Hill. The paper compares the bizarre claims of the Christchurch Civic Creche parent who initiated the hysteria to the writings of American satanic abuse hunter Pamela Hudson, who had identified 16 satanic indicators. The Christchurch mother not only identified all 16, but demanded at the depositions hearing that Hudson be brought to New Zealand as an expert witness.
            </p>
            <p>
             The mother proclaimed her son told of being "forced to kill a boy and animals", of visiting a church where children had been made to take part in a marriage ceremony and of visit to a graveyard, where he had been placed in a cage with a cat.
            </p>
            <p>
             ....
Sustained stalking and threats against one New Zealand therapist dealing with ritually abused clients culminated in an attack that left her with severe brain damage (S.H. 1998).

             </a>
             Consistency and prevalence: A survey of 98 social workers, psychologists and counselors based in Melbourne identified 153 cases of ritual abuse in the decade from 1985 to 1995 (Schmuttermaier and Veno 1999).
            </p>
            <p>
             Professionals report ritually abused clients from all around the world, including Canada, England, France, Holland, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa, Finland, Netherlands, Russia, Australia and New Zealand (The Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women 1993; Rockwell 1994; Jonker-Bakker and Jonker 1998; Pravda 2005; Helsingin Sanomat 2005).
            </p>
            <p>
             Increased attention is now being paid to ritual abuse in Nigeria, India, Ghana, Zimbabwe and Zambia and its role in the trafficking of women into Europe (International Organisation for Migration 2001; Commission on Human Rights 2002).

             No doubt, the more we learn, the more monstrous the story goes.  If we were told a story that a country x,y,z had imported war criminals from a war where the citizens of country were told they'd won the war and that the war criminals had faced justice, while in truth the war criminals were allowed by the government), to carry out atrocious secret experiments on country's own citizens, and that those war criminals were allowed to help start other vicious wars around the globe, in order to fund covert operations carried out by a part of government organized just for them, and that they created purposeful social degradation of society via all manners of sexual perversions and importing of drugs, and that they encouraged and endorsed sex with children, became involved in profiting off of sexual slavery and human trafficking and organ trafficking and globalized infanticide,  at what point would we think that such a country was beyond saving and needed a new government?

             Let's see if I can describe it without having pull all the links right away. It's more of a theory about  DS and what they were trying to do or rather, what they've been trying to cover up.  So it's not exactly within the more narrow topic of this thread (Podesta and the shooter etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider this from wikileaks:
             <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/john-podesta-discussed-alien-technology-with-former-nasa-astronaut/">
              https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/john-podesta-discussed-alien-technology-with-former-nasa-astronaut/
             </a>
             And I'm not referring to taking the words about aliens literally...I believe the whole 'alien' talk is code for CIA programs to help DS progressives get a military foothold in space via satellites and/or cyberspace.

             <p>
              The bleak truth is that a careful review of the activities of the CIA and the organizations from which it sprang reveals an intense preoccupation with the development of techniques of behavior control, brainwashing, and covert medical and psychic experimentation on unwitting subjects including religious sects, ethnic minorities, prisoners, mental patients, soldiers and the terminally ill. The rationale for such activities, the techniques and indeed the human subjects chosen show an extraordinary and chilling similarity to Nazi experiments.
             </p>
             <p>
              This similarity becomes less surprising when we trace the determined and often successful efforts of US intelligence officers to acquire the records of Nazi experiments, and in many cases to recruit the Nazi researchers themselves and put them to work, transferring the laboratories from Dachau, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Auschwitz and Buchenwald to Edgewood Arsenal, Fort Detrick, Huntsville Air Force Base, Ohio State, and the University of Washington.
             </p>
             <p>
              As Allied forces crossed the English Channel during the D-Day invasion of June 1944, some 10,000 intelligence officers known as T-Forces were right behind the advance battalions. Their mission: seize munitions experts, technicians, German scientists and their research materials, along with French scientists who had collaborated with the Nazis. Soon a substantial number of such scientists had been picked up and placed in an internment camp known as the Dustbin. In the original planning for the mission a prime factor was the view that German military equipment – tanks, jets, rocketry and so forth – was technically superior and that captured scientists, technicians and engineers could be swiftly debriefed in an effort by the Allies to catch up.

             BTW von Braun used to talk rocket science for hours on the phone with Jack Parsons back in the day and he was friends with Walt Disney

             Trivia:  The same director who directed the movie 'Eye of the Devil' starring Sharon Tate (total faggy hypnotist crap in that movie btw) also made a movie about Wernher von Braun.

             I don't have the link off hand for the following, but it was in a comment section somewhere and I pasted it:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              John Osborne
             </p>
             <p>
              The only part you left out was Von Braun's role (as the NASA chief of security) in the JFK assassination. Von Braun surrendered to Major Clay Shaw (the JFK assassination co-conspirator prosecuted by New Orleans DA Jim Garrison in 1967) in 1945 with 127 other Nazi rocket scientists. According to the evidence produced in the Grand Jury investigation, Von Braun was responsible for supervizing John Osborne, who ran the ranch in northern Mexico that trained and provided professional assassins (for governent and private purposes) and Ferenc Nagy, the exiled prime minister of fascist Hungary - who Garrison identified as the mysterious umbrella man who signaled when Kennedy's limousine came out from behind the freeway sign. In 1984 I provided professional services (I am a psychiatrist) to a Kennedy assassination witness who was being harassed - and my life has never been the same. I write about all this in my recent memoir THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACT: MEMOIR OF AN AMERICAN REFUGEE (www.stuartbramhall.com). I currently live in exile in New Zealand.

             So that's a mini kind of cultural backstory to the scope of the 'powers that be' in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider these quotes from the email to John Podesta as if they were code:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Because the War in Space race is heating up, I felt you should be aware of several factors as you and I schedule our Skype talk.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember, our nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to Earth. They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.
             </p>
             <p>
              The following information in italics was shared with me by my colleague Carol Rosin, who worked closely for several years with Wernher von Braun before his death.
             </p>
             <p>
              Carol and I have worked on the Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, attached for your convenience.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is urgent that we agree on a date and time to meet to discuss Disclosure and Zero Point Energy, at your earliest available after your departure.
             </p>
             <p>
              My Catholic colleague Terri Mansfield will be there too, to bring us up to date on the Vatican’s awareness of ETI [extraterrestrial intelligence].
             </p>
             <p>
              Another colleague is working on a new Space Treaty, citing involvement with Russia and China. However with Russia’s extreme interference in Ukraine, I believe we must pursue another route for peace in space and ZPE on Earth.
             </p>
             <p>
              I met with President Obama’s Honolulu childhood friend, US Ambassador Pamela Hamamoto on July 4 at the US Mission in Geneva, when I was able to tell her briefly about zero point energy.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe we can enlist her as a confidante and resource in our presentation for President Obama.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So if Podesta was a liaison in getting info about a so called " new Space Treaty" to Obama, involving both Russia and China, under the auspices of ETI of course, and then we review what has been happening the FB satellite SpaceX launch explosion "the rocket destroyed was bearing a satellite that Facebook intended to use to beam Internet access to developing nations." and in light of all the Q info regarding our government being compromised by traitors working with China... (not to mention the satanic crap)  it's kind of a crazy thing.  There's other leads too, but that's the just of it.

             Yes I did see that.  Thanks for the link.  He was also asked about PG which was interesting in the broader scheme of how the cabal like to preemptively 'debunk' anything they are doing or are planning to do by associating it with their 'debunked PG' definition.

            That's not a fish it's a rune. People need to stop blindly spreading something they've seen someone else post. Investigate the claims first, then post if it checks out. This doesn't.

            <p>
             What evidence there is to support that claim?
            </p>
            <p>
             No Victims/victims families/friends coming forward, no witnesses, no one coming out to speak against it, no physical evidence of any kind and the people being accused are not being investigated for such things.
            </p>
            <p>
             The people that frequent CPP don't seem to buy the story, they even rallied in support of CPP.
            </p>
            <p>
             How does mentioning things like taste in arts, avatar choices, photoshopping instagram comments from one picture to the other, speculating behind instagram comments and things like that prove the existence of a child sex ring operation?
            </p>
            <p>
             In regards to the things for which people like Alefantis and CPP staff have been accused/doxxed/harassed for, every piece of pizzagate "evidence" is a non sequitur.

              I have done work with runes and am very familiar with Norse and Anglo-Saxon subjects. It is definitely a rune, not a fish. There are some without the feet, but the feet are often used.

               huh? What "work" did you ever do with them? These were a big fad years ago and bestselling books were popular - they are icons drawn with stick  figures and no round shapes like the tattoo. Even replica sets stick to the stick figures. Hundreds of examples online

             I don't mind criticism, but you're missing the content and conversation that developed within this post.  So check that out, and then kindly contribute a pic of the rune you are thinking of, and whether or not it's relevant to Podesta's visit to NZ.  Within this post are elements that have led me already to find out very promising information about the Deepstate. Not about Podesta's hands per se, or proving anything about the meme, I happen to agree with people who have already pointed out issues with it.  I'm still working on putting that newly gleaned info together.  It took a lot of time to start putting those dots together, an area I would have never thought of doing had I not created this post.
            </p>
            <p>
             Collaborative conversations often end up with conclusions that lead far from the original title, and a lot of good info would be lost if everyone took your advice.  I struck through (not deleted) the quote from the meme and made an edit to the parent comment.

             B.S.  -- cannibal Podesta doesn't care  one whit about "sustainability".  Looks like the apologists had to stretch to find some fish symbol thingy to attack voat readers with. Very pathetic for this well fed group to come up with.

             <p>
              With of all of Podesta's works of art to chose from, pizzagaters still had to link him to works that he didn't own, and make up stories about another work being a Dahmer victim.

             <p>
              With of all of Podesta's works of art to chose from, pizzagaters still had to link him to works that he didn't own, and make up stories about another work being a Dahmer victim.

             NO it is Q faggotry that invaded and took over Pizzagate. They had a thread about it earlier and the "proof" that they have is that Q said it. Even though it is an Odal rune not a fish and the whole thing is bullshit

              No, he didn’t claim to be part of the Q Team. But, he pulled a Jerome Corsi. He was extremely pro-Trump. Then suddenly anti-Trump. He became part of the circle that would claim Q was no longer the same Q group and he got close to the extreme anti-Q Montagraph. Many people think Roy Potter is CIA or something.

            Is Q a joke or roleplay? QAnon Conspiracy - a whole other world of conspiracy, aka The Storm and Calm Before The Storm, is a conspiracy theory, popular meme which came from posts on 4chan in 2017. QAnon (AKA "Q") is a pseudonym for a person or group who has some connection to Trump or Trump's circle

            presumably American individual that may have later grown to include multiple individuals,claiming to have access to classified information involving the Trump administration and its opponents in the United States. Wikipedia Says : the user has falsely accused numerous liberal Hollywood actors, politicians, and high-ranking officials of engaging in an international child sex trafficking ring, and that Donald Trump feigned collusion with Russians to enlist Robert Mueller to join him in exposing the ring and preventing a coup d'état by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and George Soros. "Q" is a reference to the top-secret Q clearance.

             Did a song trigger this guy?  therapist referring to MK ultra ? SkyNews was pulled off the air? MI5 was last night investigating New Zealand gunman Brenton Tarrant over possible links to far-right extremists in Britain.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 28-year-old's travel across countries including Turkey and Bulgaria are today being probed as the aftermath of the Christchurch massacre continues.

             North Korea, Pakistan, Turkey, Eastern Europe, France and elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ankara on Friday said it was investigating Tarrant's multiple visits to Turkey, and who he might have met while he was there. The Bulgarian government has also said it was looking into Tarrant, who apparently visited the country late last year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tarrant's 74-page manifesto said he first began considering an attack in April and May of 2017 while travelling in France and elsewhere in Western Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             London's Independent newspaper said he allegedly met right-wing extremists during a visit to Europe that year and declared allegiance to a group he called Europeans. Tarrant also claimed he contacted an anti-immigration group called the reborn Knights Templar.
            </p>
            <p>
             He planned not only the two-site murder rampage but also the manifesto and a social media campaign, which included his newly created Twitter account, full of links to white supremacist and anti-immigration postings.
            </p>
            <p>
             The manifesto also said he chose to make his attack in New Zealand to show that nowhere in the world was safe.

             Tarrant had worked as a personal trainer, according to the Australian Broadcasting Company. The news organization reported the manager of a gym where Tarrant was employed said he began traveling overseas in 2011. Manager Tracy Gray said Tarrant traveled to Europe and Asia, including North Korea. A photo published online by ABC shows Tarrant in Pakistan in 2018.

             Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, appeared in Christchurch District Court on Saturday morning. He faced one murder charge, but police say more are likely.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tarrant was believed to have met extreme right-wing groups during a visit to Europe two years ago, security sources told UK paper The Independent.
            </p>
            <p>
             He reportedly started to travel about 2011 after the death of his father, heading to Turkey and Pakistan, as well as the Balkans.

             The gym's owner, Tracey Gray, described him as a hard-working trainer but said he appeared to have been changed by his travels in Europe and Asia - which social media posts suggested included trips as far afield as Pakistan and North Korea. Advertisement
            </p>
            <p>
             "I think something must have changed in him during the years he spent travelling overseas," Gray told national broadcaster ABC.

             "that vertical fish is one of the nazi symbols (less common than the swasticker, sure), and 14 is the white supremacist number (they have some 14 word slogan about securing the future of white people), as in '1488' = 14 word slogan plus HH = heil hitler"

            <p>
             "yes, Podesta seemed to be in NZ, and yes thats ... ahem ... Fishy ... - but I also think if you are part of a false flag its not like you're going to write on your assault rifle 'John Podesta rly made me do it' now, are you?"
            </p>
            <p>
             If the 14 and fish symbols on the gun is not anything to do with John Podesta's symbols as per the meme, then perhaps the questions that Q poses are more important regarding the NZ shooter:

             Is the John Podesta visit a diversion away from what is hidden? (I think that's along the lines of the point you were making on the other thread.

              Pretty much. I don't have an issue with anything other than that specific meme being broadcast because the 14/fish part can be easily explained and thus used to detract from the legitimate questions that deserve to be asked surrounding the curious timing of Podesta's visit.

                There's definitely something very 'fishy' going on there but comparing those two images is sending the wrong message as both sets of symbols are unrelated to each other. That doesn't mean that there isn't a deeper connection via Podesta and what he was up to there. It's just going to send people chasing down a false lead only for them to discover that they were being misled when they learn what those symbols mean and that is counter-productive and wastes people's time for no good reason.

                 <p>
                  An investigation and analysis by Disobedient Media indicates that Tarrant and the group he worked with likely have professional military connections, are part of the same cell that perpetrated a February 22nd break in of the North Korean embassy in Spain and potentially have intelligence ties to various agencies that cooperate under the UKUSA Agreement popularly known as Five Eyes (FVEY).
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Since Tarrant had at least one New Zealander acting as an accomplice, it is possible that there may have been other New Zealand nationals associated with his group. Outside of their collaboration through the FVEY framework, New Zealand's Special Air Service has been deployed to Afghanistan where they worked directly under the CIA at a base in Bamiyan province according to claims published in 2011.

                 <p>
                  The Australian also engaged in extensive travel abroad to a number of areas that should have raised red flags with intelligence services. Countries visited by Tarrant included Pakistan, North Korea, Turkey, parts of Africa, Portugal, Spain, France, Afghanistan and Xinjiang, China. The extensive travel and access to military grade firearms should have made detection by law enforcement and intelligence services nearly impossible to avoid.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Many of the countries visited by Tarrant play host to the operations of agencies with connections to FVEY. FVEY members include the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. FVEY also have a number of Tier B nations who participate in "focused cooperation" on computer network exploitation, including Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungry, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Outside of the UKUSA Agreement, FVEY members are known to cooperate with Tier B nations on their own. Great Britain has had a deep relationship with Spain since World War II, when Britain bought off the Spanish to remain neutral and then used the country as an escape route for downed Allied airmen. British agency GCHQ also collaborates independently with counterparts in Germany, France, Spain and Sweden. British-Russian double agent Sergei Skripal was also revealed to have been collaborating with Spanish intelligence officers in the years leading up to his poisoning in 2018.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Brenton Tarrant's travels to Turkey, France, Spain and Portugal raise questions about potential connections to intelligence services who collaborate loosely under the FVEY intelligence sharing agreement. Additionally, his time spent in Pakistan, a country with a long history of deep CIA involvement creates an even stronger possibility that Tarrant might have had ties to military or intelligence organizations.

                 <p>
                  In securing a getaway from the North Korean embassy, the attacking team of approximately ten individuals utilized two luxury vehicles. In the Christchurch attack, the suspects used two vehicles for transport in which live explosive devices were found. The similar number of vehicles used in both incidents points to a common number of participants.

                  Whether or not one believes that the Christchurch terror attacks have more to them than meets the eye, it is undeniable that the tragedy is now being exploited by various parties for personal gain. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has taken the opportunity to promote increased gun control with a total ban on semi-automatic weapons. Ardern formerly worked as a policy advisor to Tony Blair, who has himself been a willing collaborator with British intelligence services. Ardern has not yet commented on the fact that New Zealand security and emergency services caused the death toll to rise substantially higher than needed due to an incredibly slow response time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In addition to the debate about gun control, pundits have begun to harass President Donald Trump, accusing him of having some kind of ideological connection to Brenton Tarrant due to the suspect's fascist loyalties. These efforts only serve to intensify efforts to derail the ongoing crisis involving the Korean peace process.

                  Whew, this is a rabbit hole, indeed. I'm focused on something else at the moment but it certainly seems like something that's worth digging into. Just don't count on me to do so! I got my hands full already.

             The 14 as I hear is simply a white power slogan but some stuff has double meanings, more than one meaning for certain peoples there could be more numerology to it also Hitler, the Vril, the Thule, the Occult. This guy in NZ who came from Aus, he leaves 2011 to “travel overseas” ... sometimes the White Nationalist Fasicst thing adds up but there are big chunks of his life missing, photos of him are showing up in Turkey, in North Korea and in Pakistan. The Hotel owned by Shia muslims connected to an older cult and Nizari people, he might have connection to some Templar or Masonic thing in London or Aus. A lot of twists and turns in a small town in NZ, Jewish spy networks, same small town another kiwi teen was radicalized into a Jihadi  or plans terror or planned a mass killing before being arrested.

              Maybe the distraction is that WE as a country are broke.......there is increasing talk among some of debt jubilee/national currency. China used to be our # 1 lender....probably some deal worked out that WE would sell wal mart trinkets. Things aren't selling really great at wal mart and by our willingness as a country to just go bomb another  country without a decent false flag............looks like WE are in bad shape financially. I think stopping the federal govt paychecks was not over a wall but bankruptcy.
