<h2>The Keepers -- the Sister Cathy Cesnik murder</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=The+keepers&amp;s=Pizzagate&amp;u=&amp;d=&amp;b=on&amp;nsfw=off">Pizza-Pedogate-related murder of Sister Cathy Cesnick</a> documented in The Keepers, person of interest Billy Schmidt <strong>was terrified of the nun mannequin in his attic.  Maybe the mannequin was an idol to the \'death saint\' of human sacrifice,</strong> as in the Fox News article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he kept talking about “the woman in the attic,” Barbara remembers. He was terrified of her. He said the woman was “after” him. So Barbara says she decided to prove to him there was no woman in the attic.</p>
<p>Except there was — sort of.</p>
<p>She says she discovered a mannequin there, dressed in a blue and white nun’s habit.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least one man dressed as a nun in the Cathy Cesnik case in Baltimore, Maryland: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barbara says that one night around this time when she was driving home from work, she noticed a car following her. The car pulled up beside her at a stoplight, and she felt someone staring at her. She turned to look, and saw that the car was being driven by a nun.</p>
<p>A nun with a big, bushy mustache.</p>
<p>Barbara says she can’t swear that this was Skippy, but the mustache was similar, and both Skippy and Billy had a demonstrated obsession with the Catholic Church — even going so far as to dress in priest and pregnant-nun costumes on occasion.</p>

<h2>Possible tie-in to the Sister Margaret Ann Pahl Satanic murder in Ohio</h2>
<p>In 1980 in Toledo, Catholic nun Sister Margaret Ann Pahl was murdered.  The official story is she was ritually killed by a priest in a hospital chapel because she complained to him that he shortened a mass.  </p>
<p>Priest Gerald Robinson was convicted in 2006.  It doesn\'t seem to add up (but that\'s a whole other part of the story.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the case revealed that <strong>men in his parish were dressing as nuns</strong> as an innocent &quot;joke.&quot;  However  <strong>allegations were raised in 2003 that priests wore nun habits when they raped and murdered children in Satanic rituals in the basement of St. Adalbert Church.</strong></p>
<p>Wikipedia basic overview of the case:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Margaret_Ann_Pahl">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Margaret_Ann_Pahl</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The allegations in 2003 came from a CSA survivor of Gerald Robinson and others, who abused her between 1968-1975.</p>
<p>The cult called themselves The <strong>Sisters of Assumed Mary, or SAM.</strong>  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lIFeNpIob54C&amp;q=Semblance#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Book excerpt, beginning on p. 16</a> from:  <em>Forgive Me, Father: A True Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Brutal Murder</em> by John Glatt.</p>
<p>She reported they even screamed <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lIFeNpIob54C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Sam%20&amp;f=false"><strong>&quot;Son of SAM.&quot;</strong></a>  David Berkowitz the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; serial killer was arrested in 1977, and assuming her report is accurate, her abuse occurred prior.  So the cult did not lift &quot;SAM and Son of SAM&quot; from the headlines about Berkowitz.</p>
<p>(Several Toledo victims reported abuse by Robinson and others, including SRA. It was covered up by the police and <strong>the Toledo Diocese especially Michael Billian, who the Pope later promoted to Monsignor.  If anyone wants to dig into that.)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>There might be a connection between the Mexican nun-death-saint cult, Pizza-Pedogate as in The Keepers, and the CIA/its Process Church which is said to have been behind the Satanic cult Berkowitz was in.</p>

            No, the Catholic Church openly condemns Santa Muerte. The RCC is more closely linked to Saturn/Cronos (eg symbolic cannibalism and Saturnalia as Christmas festivities) than to overt death worship.

            I doubt it. Mexicans have worshipped
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coatlicue">
             the death goddess, Coatlicue,
            </a>
            and sacrificed people by the thousands to her since before any nun ever set foot in the Western Hemisphere. Creepily, there is a striking resemblence between her legend
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to Aztec legend, she was once magically impregnated by a ball of feathers that fell on her while she was sweeping a temple, and subsequently gave birth to the god Huitzilopochtli. Her daughter Coyolxauhqui then rallied Coatlicue's four hundred other children together and goaded them into attacking and decapitating their mother. The instant she was killed, the god Huitzilopochtli suddenly emerged from her womb fully grown and armed for battle.[2] He killed many of his brothers and sisters, including Coyolxauhqui, whose head he cut off and threw into the sky to become the moon. In one variation on this legend, Huitzilopochtli himself is the child conceived in the ball-of-feathers incident and is born just in time to save his mother from harm.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And the Book of Revelation:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <h1>
             The Woman and the Dragon
            </h1>
            <p>
             12 A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. 4 Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. 5 She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.”[a] And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne. 6 The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.

            This, along with the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Guadalupe">
             miraculous image of Mary that appeared on the cloak of an Aztec peasant
            </a>
            , caused the fast majority of Mexicans to convert to Christianity in just a few short years.

             No they converted to Roman Papacy, not Christianity. And I think it had a lot to do w/ fear and coercion more than anything. The superstition you mention worked well too cause it was the Roman Religion. Sorry I had to add my two cents.
