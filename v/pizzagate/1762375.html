<p>In honor of <strong>FUCK YOU, JAMES ALEFANTIS MONTH</strong>, I thought I’d kick it off by following through on a theory as to how Madeleine McCann was sold and how the police could find her. For me, there is no doubt that a pedophile ring was involved. Because of multiple sickos being complicit, the notion that the art world could be used for money laundering and other transactions such as these is viable. It’s such a perfect way to move large sums around without attracting too much of the wrong kind of attention. Since James Alefantis and the Pedostas are involved in both selling and buying art, the coincidence of them doing so sort of lends credence to this theory. Without a filthy underbelly, I can’t imagine why scum like this would even involve themselves in aesthetics. There’d almost have to be a crass motivation that would materially benefit them for them to take notice, but, hey, that’s me! Of course, in the pizzagate world, there are no answers, only greater mysteries. So I’m posting what I found, hoping it triggers one of you geniuses out there to ascend Mount Olympus and snag an actual truth. Anyway, here’s how the story goes … </p>
<p>A couple of months ago, a member of the forum posted about FBI anon … I don’t follow FBI anon so I’m not familiar with what s/he says, but the latest clue (at that time) was about following the cards? One of the suggestions was that the hint was directed at the Sotheby International Preferred Access cards. It stuck in my head because it tied in with this money laundering. For me, it also tied in with the kidnapping of Madeleine McCann. Why? Because: (1) that child was a prize that someone wanted to collect; (2) if a pedophile ring was involved (and it was), a child this beautiful is shared with others of the same ilk and not just killed; and (3) the masterminds behind the crime would need to be paid for the privilege of partaking. </p>
<p>Madeleine was born on May 12, 2003. She was abducted on May 3, 2007, just shy of her fourth birthday. Now in order for her to be passed around, she first needed to be abducted with the help of what I feel was an insider close to the McCann’s. After that was accomplished, it was then imperative to get the word out. It’s only logical. So first, the child is abducted. Then the invitations go out and time is given to letting the word spread that she is up for grabs. The word gets around, pedos get excited, and everybody wants to get in on having at this poor child. In other words, a bidding war is triggered. </p>
<p>I believe all this was executed through an art sale. To see if it were possible, I performed a search for May 2007 and found that not one, but TWO record art sales were conducted on two consecutive nights—May 15th and 16th. One auction was at Christie’s and the other at Sotheby’s. $384.6 million and $254.8 million were collected. Here’s the NYT article denoting both: </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/XtIzv">http://archive.is/XtIzv</a></p>
<p>Since the dates of May 15th and 16th were right in that pocket, I became VERY curious as to what produced such outrageous bidding. I saw that the big ticket item for Christie’s was Andy Warhol’s Green Car Crash. It was and I quote </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;a rare image of a photo from a 1963 issue of Newsweek showing a car that had crashed and its driver impaled on a telephone pole”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>REALLY?!!!! What a LOVELY keepsake to display in your home. Here’s the link (and I’d take a pic if I were you): </p>
<p><a href="http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-green-car-crash-4913707-details.aspx">http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-green-car-crash-4913707-details.aspx</a> </p>
<p>Note “the price realized” was USD 71,720,000. SEVENTY-ONE MILLION DOLLARS? For that piece of crap showing an impaled man?  
</p>
<p>Okay, I was hooked so I tracked down the Sotheby page for May 15th and found the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/w4GKI">http://archive.is/w4GKI</a> </p>
<p>There were no pics shown due to copyright violations, so I went in search of the “artwork” (and I use the term VERY loosely—so loosely that it belies the definition). I first found Jim Hodges NO ONE EVER LEAVES. It basically amounts to a black leather jacket and a spider web? Note that it keeps with this VICTIM theme:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/uGDEY">http://archive.is/uGDEY</a></p>
<p>Seriously, WTH? Is a jacket thrown on the ground with a stupid spider web worth millions? NO! So I went in search of another of the artwork that fetched such an astronomical amount. This time I went with Elizabeth Peyton’s CRAIG. It turned out to be a photo, but it didn’t stop there. The photograph turned up on Amazon under BOOKS?!!!!! </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/WxLTl">http://archive.is/WxLTl</a> </p>
<p>What the hell is it doing under books? Well, it seems Ms. Peyton interwove pics of her friend Craig with the pics of the British royal family during the time of Princess Diana’s death.</p>

<p>What a CHARMING idea? Is she going to follow up by doing one of the McCann family? But I wanted to know more so I did a search using the info given which was Walther Konig and Dashwood Books and came up with this: </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/mU2e2">http://archive.is/mU2e2</a> </p>
<p>There’s this guy Craig juxtapositioned in an identical pose with Princess Diana? The year Diana was murdered was 2007. The photo? Dated 2008 so this was done purposely, but again, why? I looked over what Dashwood BOOKS has to offer and found lots of spurious woman as objects and other smarmy titles. They have a whole collection devoted to smut. On their website, they give their hours. Now remember this is a “BOOK STORE” and yet it says: “ON MONDAYS BY APPOINTMENT ONLY”?!!!! What happens on Monday that you have to make an appointment? Maybe something that requires them doing a background check on you to make sure you’re not a fed or with Interpol. </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/m3v2F">http://archive.is/m3v2F</a></p>
<p>It’s just so curious that this piece of “art” was in this batch that fetched 254,874,000USD. It’s yet another victim-themed work with ties to the UK and a car crash now that I’m thinking about it … hmmmm … </p>
<p>I didn\'t bother tracking down every single piece of art, It\'s the timing for these two events that\'s just so damned curious. I’m not saying that either of these auctions is connected, but this is a way of doing it. And think about it, the actual owners of these places may not even be aware of something going on—if something is going on. After all, someone may group the invitees by predilection. Most are probably art collectors, but there might be a group with a taste for other things. </p>
<p>Anyway, this is my theory and I\'m sticking to it. If I were a cop, this is what I’d be looking for. Something like this where anonymous bidders spent millions on crap. They didn’t get this rich by doing that.</p>',

            You're probably on to something.  I did some reading on art and the biggest holder is Qatar sheikh who has bought some PG related artists like Koonswork for 9 digits, spent over a billion overall.  Warhol of course was a Queer and elite cultural icon.

             Didn't I put 97? Probably a typo ... thanks for pointing it out ... I will correct it. As for the McCann's being involved, absolutely not. How can I tell? They were excoriated and humiliated. Look at the treatment of the Pedo Cannibals. Do you see them tearing each other apart in the media? No you do not. Arul Savio Gaspar and his wife set the McCanns up. As for the trait, I'm not big on that. Not. I know that the Pedo Cannibals would be, but it's unimportant to me, but thanks for pointing it out.

              But the whole reason we know the McCanns name is because they had elites protecting them in media and govt.  Dont forget the woman who got suicided after speaking on Sky news against the McCanns.  Check my thread in my original banned account for a refresher on the mccanns, you're obviously smoking crack right now.

               The McCanns are rotten to the core--they convicted themselves in their own interviews. They are not whom they pretend to be at all.

               The elites aren't protecting them. The police made up lies and there was a bloody child's footprint in the apartment that led to their car. They wouldn't do that. And just because we have differing opinions doesn't mean I'm smoking anything. The Ramseys were involved in the murder of their daughter, but the McCann's.? No. I think this thread is getting lost in what opinion people hold about the McCanns. The theory doesn't really hinge on that. Whatever.
