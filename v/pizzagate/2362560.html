<p>He had a movie called &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; which had this as the postor. The girl is 16 year old Clare Shenstone </p>

<p>He owned &quot;The Factory&quot; a New York City studio where he would throw elite parties, where famous artists, Hollywood Elites, politicians, and all of the elite could come all the time to. We\'re told these were artist parties for his work and others. He had a movie called &quot;Blowjob&quot; where  DeVeren Bookwalter got a blowjob from &quot;five boys&quot; from the wiki page </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blow_Job_(film)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blow_Job_(film)</a></p>
<p>&quot;The identity of the person performing the act is disputed. Warhol states in his book Popism: The Warhol Sixties (1980) that five different boys performed the fellatio. In this book, Warhol writes that he originally asked Charles Rydell, the boyfriend of filmmaker Jerome Hill, to star in the film, promising that there would be &quot;five beautiful boys&quot; to perform the act.[2]</p>
<p>&quot;However, when Warhol set up the film shoot at The Factory on a Sunday, Rydell failed to show up. Warhol phoned Rydell at Hill\'s suite at the Algonquin Hotel and asked where Rydell was. Rydell replied that he thought Warhol was kidding, and had no intention of appearing in such a film. When he declined Andy used &quot;a good looking kid that happened to be hanging around the Factory that day&quot;, who was later identified as Bookwalter. By that time, the five boys had departed but Warhol\'s notoriously poor memory kept the five boys in place for the version given in the much later book POPism&quot; Not the word adult or males, but the word boys&quot;</p>
<p>All of this disturbing &quot;art&quot; and the elite parties and having a 16 year old on a sexually suggestive postor all leads to Andy Warhol being a pedo sicko.</p>',

            If you read through the comments on the "Baby Toss" scene, you can really get a glimpse into the mindset of the masses:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Aww, you cut it off before the best part!  When a mother on the street says to her little boy, "That's what I'm going to do to you if you don't SHUT UP!!!"  hahahaha﻿"
           </p>
           <p>
            "i CAN'T STAND BABIES EITHER!!! WELL DONE!!!﻿"
           </p>
           <p>
            "I love this scene﻿"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Art class...the BEST thing about school! Watch and learn from media like this!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Humanity is fucking finished.

                I know you feel like you're making a good point, but you're probably the same kind of person who would "respect" a Bible-burning event, or a piece of "art" like Piss-Christ. Just because some asshat slaps the label of "art" onto something, doesn't make it such. I'm not saying that I personally get to decide what is art, but
                <em>
                 I
                </em>
                do get to choose what
                <em>
                 I
                </em>
                consider to be art.

             At least a movie like
             <em>
              A Serbian Film
             </em>
             didn't present itself as a work of beautiful art. It was designed to be sick and wrong, and honestly a movie like
             <em>
              Serbian Film
             </em>
             at least sheds light on some of the sick activities practiced by these people. I've found that comparing what goes on behind the elites' closed doors to films like
             <em>
              Hostel
             </em>
             and
             <em>
              A Serbian Film
             </em>
             really helps to wake some people up.

             You dont see the movie postor for "Chelsea Girl" with the 16 year old on the front? His entourage included many young girls. Many underage girls to. That movie "Blowjob" we don't know who the five boys are, why call them boys and not five men for this film? What is their ages, who are they? Like I said the signs point to him being another Pedophile. Why direct a movie about baby killing for humor?

              Pedo=pre-puberty sex.  16=/=pedo.  Ultimately, the entire idea of pre-marital sex and the ideas surrounding these movies, it disgusts me in the sense that it strays away from what is right.  But I don't qualify this as pedo.  The age of consent in most of the world is WELL below 16 in most of the world.  Maybe you think it should be 25, I think the age is irrelevant, puberty and marriage is how it should be.  I am sure you'll call me a pedo, I'll just call you a Godless heathen and we will go on with our lives.
