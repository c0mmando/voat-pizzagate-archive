            As far as hip hop goes check out Lyor Cohen, a american-Iraeli evil evil prick who almost singlehandedly hi jacked the hip hop movement. Scumbag extraordinaire.Went about getting rid of artists with a message and replaced that with the big ass, bling shallow motherfuckers and encouraged or signed creeps slinging guns and killing raping, screwing each other in the ass etc. Lyor Cohen controls youtube now, the music end. Promotes death and destruction and discourages a heart beat or social conscience.If you live in a ghetto and wondered what happened look no farther than Lyor. Even putting this out there gives me chill as I put NOTHING past this scumbag. If I am dead in the morning it's him, Frank Giustra or Robert Lantos. Haha, not too worried death ain't the end. Love God with all your heart or at least try to. These scum do not want any of us to have that peace

            Didn't R Kelly marry 15-year-old Aliyah, who died in suspicious circumstances. CDAN did a blind saying she was killed when she got pregnant to Kelly.

            R. Kelly is a GEFFEN protected venture, why do you think that he has been able to get away with what he has for so long? GEFFEN is at the top of THIS pyramid and MANY others here at CDAN.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Pussycat Dolls is a R. Kelly, GEFFEN and Steve Antin production. Yeah, Steve Antin from The Goonies with Corey Feldman and Josh Brolin and we all know GEFFEN is at the top of THAT chain with Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell along with Dave Mathews Bands Leroi Moore. We also know that D(bag) GEFFEN is at the top of suspicion in the Mark Salling murder and GLEE/Ryan Murphy circles because he possessed child porn that was previously unknown to authorities of HAITIAN origin bringing us back FULL CIRCLE to the issue of PIZZAGATE and Clinton backed child abuse extortion rings run in and throughout government and entertainment to bring people and organizations into the Clinton Global Initiative.

             Excellent  dig you did there! Funny, I did a shitty film years ago(one of my first) and Steve Antin's sister was in it. I think she manages The Pussycat Dulls. I was young and sure I met her brother(who was gay) but I didn't really think anything about them.Now in retrospect it is sure a different take away

            Hes a monster. I think the reason this is getting so much attention now is #metoo.  Dan Schneider was fired, woody allen finally got some of what he deserved, kevin Spacey, etc. I know not everyone agrees, but i think #metoo has been a very good thing for PG.

            I suspect he’s being thrown under the bus to cover flr the rest of Pedowood’s crimes, especially their more heinous ones. Such as the crimes against Heather O’Rourke and Judith Barsi.

             That makes sense. No, in fact this is almost nothing compared to the baby killers and the torturers. Gotta get that adrenochrome. 
What a disgusting world we live in. Feel bad for all the young couples that got married and their favorite song was one of his. Makes you want to puke watching Ken and Barbie swing each other around on the dance floor, their parents watching. So captivated were they by his music. 
Yuck, the lie so big no one can believe it and yes, there is much worse. Maybe why John Legend went public and was interviewed for the 3 part series. Him and his candy floss plastic wife are busy slurping up adrenochrome

            He was initially arrested I think in 2002. Then it took til 2008 for the trial(by jury) He received a not guilty verdict despite there being a video tape(that one girl stole from him as she was in it as well) where it shows him with a 14 year old girl and him urinating on her after. I mean, WTF!!???So much must have gone on with jury tampering etc, buying off witnesses etc etc. and the record company claims they didn't know?? What?? Of course they knew. He probably called his PR and the record company the instant he was in trouble. They [probably knew in advance. Video was shot in 2000. And this was tape. Imagine the murders that happened that were never filmed. man, please help me to dig more on this. Just sickening but in a nut shell, it tells you everything about the entertainment industry, something I have personal experience with. They will do ANYTHING to cover for their 'stars'.But the 'stars', have to be sick to begin with. This is not a joke. Anyone coming to pizzagate for the first time, understand this is real! Those willing to abuse children in the most grotesque ways are rewarded. The evil ones, the record executives the studio heads,most probably come from generational ritual abuse families. They encourage this deviant sick behavior. One way to bring down the black community, on top of encouraging raping women and obviously snorting up piles of coke and smoking crack. Remember Free way Rickie? Not the rapper the one that finally went to jail. he was being supplied by the CIA which is why he kept getting off. They intentionally wanted the ghetto addicted to crack.
