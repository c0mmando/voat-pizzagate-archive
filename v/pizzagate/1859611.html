<p>Do the Goldberg\'s have a connection to Winthrop?</p>
<p>I found this..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Goldberg has been a private investor in both real estate and start-up companies and has provided consulting services to start-up companies since 1999. Mr. Goldberg\'s real estate experience includes serving as a member of the board of directors and the audit committees of Shelbourne Properties I, II and III, three affiliated real estate investment trusts, from August 2002 until their liquidation in April 2004.

<p>Nearly 800 like. It\'s history spans back more then 10 years yet their photo section is nonexistent.</p>
<p>The same notion can be applied with Jac\'s related accounts.</p>
<p>Although I did manage to retrieve a picture from google reviews, taken inside, posted sometime in January of late.</p>
<p>If you zoom in, to the back wall of the cafe. You can see a smoothie selection. The design of the menu and relating imagery to fruit is very sexual orientated and succeeds with it\'s attempt to play on words.</p>

<p>Evidence concerning another Jac\'s cafe, located in nearby Rockwood (connected?)</p>
<p>On April 23, 2016. Damien Posted a Picture on Yelp (review site) of his meal that had been ordered at Jac\'s cafe, Rockwood.</p>
<p><a href="https://s1.postimg.org/d4mgbw5yn/465656-7766.png">A steak bomb omelette served with a slice of toast which contains the child lover, heart in a heart logo</a>.</p>
<p>It appears, Damien even VALIDATES  the meaning of the logo in his toast with this CRYPTO review..</p>

           Evidence concerning another Jac's cafe, located in nearby Rockwood (connected?)
          </p>

          <p>
           It appears, Damien even VALIDATES  the meaning of the logo in his toast with this CRYPTO review..

            When I first read this, I thought it was a spoof but NorthernSoul appears serious! Let's start with the door. What is a small businessman supposed to do when he or she finds the perfect spot at the right price located between 31 Baker St. and 35 Baker St. Should the government eliminate such addresses like some elevators bypass the13th floor? The swimming pool belongs to the house behind the cafe on Hutchinson Street.
           </p>
           <p>
            The name Bergino is a bit unusual but is featured in the internet White Pages along with variations as to spelling. The word pleasure  on the menu is sexual??? Even so where's the connection with kids?  The cinnamon swirl is achieved by spreading butter and cinnamon on a square piece of dough, and rolliing it up like a beach towel, bake it where the outer layers swell first, then slice. Just like my grandma used to do and she was not a pedo. Your punishment for DISINFO: Please take 6 months worth of Podesta emails, study them and report back.

            Looking at at the comments here, this post is either disinfo or it has something in it making it important to be pushed down. I'm not taking either side here, but reminding that we have

             This has been posted before and I believe it to be disinfo. None of the links relate to eachother, or to child abuse, child porn, organ trafficking or any other crime. If you find anything suspicious or relating to pizzagate I would support it. There is no silver door, there is a pool in somebodies backyard and the cafe serves toast. So I'm not spending any more time on it or comments about it. I believe Northern Soul to be deliberately spreading disinfo or a shill. If I were a mod, I would ban NS, but I'm not so that's all I have to say.

              is not fact checking, and what I'm suggesting is fact checking, whenever needed. Can be done both to the posts like this and to any external post.

            , the first time you posted this we removed it because there was zero evidence. You have resubmitted again with zero evidence -- just the same silly string of breadcrumbs.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, rather than remove and ban you for disrespecting the submission rules, I am flairing this as "Disinfo". This is a terrific example for our users of a post that relies 100% on Confirmation Bias to hold up it's premise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since you are pushing this so hard, that makes you either someone too stupid to realize the frailty of your argument, or someone who is trying to manipulate pizzagate investigators. As you can see from the comments you have received, that isn't so easy. Either way, you've demonstrated you are not a trustworthy investigator.

             The whole block is suspicious. Crest Ave Pizza is the delivery (children). Jac's is the community hangout  and the door 33 is probably a secret passage to that FUCKING pool for the entertainment.
