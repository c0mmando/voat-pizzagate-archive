            Also to the california hater...i so did not vax on the official schedule and so broke up doses  and tripple checked thermerisol not be there.  so btw.  He the dad tried to get me for that meaning that was another motion against me,  but I explained to the court we were in line with shots. It's really creepy it's true so do hate but don't hate me. When over some lie to the court he won a temporary full custody order from Beverly Woods he went straight to the medical insurance and took the kid from mine put the kid on his, got free housing and a bunch of shit, and it was way after I had custody restored over that bullshit that I found out he had gone to the whole health and human services offices during the time of full custody order and lied to them. They hhs told me that what he did, was illegal in the state because the kid belongs on the medical paperwork @#^! That the first person made. That would be me. And they said I can sue. And I said how lovely, not.

            Ps PS our family stayed on the Shapiro ranch  in the 70s. Sylvia was the head of family court at some point in the 80s She wrote a letter for me in my case, in like 2008 or 9. (?) we thought it would help alot. Obviously not at all, she came from the child support angle as he was back due around 25 thousand or something astronomical and wasn't making payments. Well he turned that around on me, very sneaky, and im not that driven clever to be mad! He took me to child support court repeatedly to lower his amount. It was always hard. If I missed something like that he got it. Anyway, Gary is ancient if alive, in not sure if they are still in San anselmo. Any Marin county lawyer Sonoma county are not going to have a problem with more business. Shapiros these days are probably the kids of serious hippies.

            Ok AHh Im in .ca. I wish you guys could just see what I am dealing with. You are triggering me to laugh !!! I am from here. My kids dad...(Oh no the rant?) Yep...they got her,hiim with  them family court corrupt I wanna say sinners then I have to.point myself and call myself a sinner because I can't judge people like that, but sometimes they didn't seem human to me and particularly when Beverly woods turned around and walked away I thought I saw horns where her hip bones were, and I just have to trust my kid is ok. But oh yes indeed the school thing. My kids dad....yeah. He felt compelled to explain everything to her class room of 1st and 2nd graders. But since I heard about it first I tried to stop it this upco.ing transgender horrific surgery conversation. But this man would not hear no. And manipulated and gamed the teachers,  around me, and realized i had that particular ball well in my hand. He showed up during recess called the kids over began the talk. I was not there. My child was embarased. Two boys who were in the tight knit group of 6-8 kids present )all classmates since preschool start, that's 2&amp;1/2, ) laughed and teased, my kids dad about wearing make up and lipstick. The yard duty teacher had got the main teacher and they jpined in impromtu and shut down the conversation gracefully. This is how they expkained it to me only years later after they and i are all, if not friends, friendlier to eachother now. and they the teachers are  less fearfull of me and my angry reaction and the legal action i cpuld pursue against them. But the school thing went like that. alot  of that trust went out the window on both sides. And the tranny sort of won that battle which effectively estranged my kid from the classmates that had started preschool with and also remember he the dad, made us me and the court call him her!!! But where im sitting here now at least none  of that is here. And I miss my kid and that's the only thing.

            They made a law where anyone in the health field can be imprisoned if they don't identify their patients by the gender of their choice. So doctors aren't going to do any good.

            On top of all that, now they want to break away from the United States. Many conservatives want to leave California.

            This is why I hate California. There's a bunch of nutty liberals with crazy laws. Your children have to, BY LAW, get vaccinated.
