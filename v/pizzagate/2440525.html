<blockquote>
<p>And now we have reports from a Labour Party fund-raiser hosted last week by Fry, where the \'\'national treasure’’ stood in front of an audience that included Ed Miliband, and attacked Operation Yewtree, the country’s most high-profile inquiry into historic sex abuse. He said that \'\'fewer than half’’ of the people arrested had been convicted of the crimes (this is actually on a par with conviction rates for sexual offences generally, but never mind), and urged the audience to remember that “people are innocent until guilty”. He is said to have singled out Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions who was also present, for criticism, and apparently announced that the law should be toughened up to deter people from inventing claims about sex abuse. “It was all a bit awkward,” said a guest. “There was a smattering of applause, but mostly there was this deadly silence. And Ed looked as if he had swallowed a wasp.” </p>

            That article is about painter
            <strong>
             Lucian Freud
            </strong>
            , (elder brother of pedo Sir Clement Freud), so when I saw Charles Saatchi's name I searched it coupled with the term pedophile and found the essay. My next question is whether Tony Podesta runs in the same circles as Charles Saatchi and artists like the ones who show bare bottomed children wearing garter belts with fish net stockings.

            And now we have reports from a Labour Party fund-raiser hosted last week by Fry, where the ''national treasure’’ stood in front of an audience that included Ed Miliband, and attacked Operation Yewtree, the country’s most high-profile inquiry into historic sex abuse. He said that ''fewer than half’’ of the people arrested had been convicted of the crimes (this is actually on a par with conviction rates for sexual offences generally, but never mind), and urged the audience to remember that “people are innocent until guilty”. He is said to have singled out Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions who was also present, for criticism, and apparently announced that the law should be toughened up to deter people from inventing claims about sex abuse. “It was all a bit awkward,” said a guest. “There was a smattering of applause, but mostly there was this deadly silence. And Ed looked as if he had swallowed a wasp.”

            On Missing People's own website, the first thing you see is this large image of a man and a woman, and they are naked in silhouette, identity-less, and the only thing noticeable about them are their big, strong, hearts.  As in, missing people are being "recruited" for their organs?  Sick.
