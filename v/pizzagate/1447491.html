            Lilith was the first wife of Adam, however she was cast out of the garden of Eden for her sinful ways. In this tale, she was the first to eat of the fruit of knowledge and wanted to be either equal to or greater than Adam. After she left the garden of Eden, she attempted to create her own garden and became the consort of many different demons, including the fallen angel Samael, and bore many succubi known as the Lilim. Meanwhile Adam grew lonely, and beseeched God to forgive Lilith and return her to Eden. God told Lilith that if she did not return, he would punish her by taking away her children. She refused, her children were taken, and since that day she has become a demoness at war with the sons and daughters of Adam,
            <strong>
             targeting children in specific.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Another version of the story as told in the 'Midrash Abkier', is that after Cain's homicide brings death to the world, Adam separates from Eve and fasts for 130 years. When the demoness Lilith (also known as Pizna) saw his beauty, she instantly desired him, and took him by force by using his own sin against him. She bore him many demonic spirits known to be a plague to mankind.

             From your link regarding the mythological Lilith and child abduction:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Many incantations against her mention her status as a daughter of heaven and exercising her free will over infants.
The other demon, Gallu is of the Utukku group. Gallu’s name, like Utukku, was also used as a general term for multiple demons.[24] Later, Gallu appears as Gello, Gylo, or Gyllou in Greco-Byzantine mythology as a child stealing and child killing demon. This figure was, likewise, adapted by the Jews as Gilu and was also considered a secret name of Lilith’s.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Horace (De Arte Poetica liber, 340), Hieronymus of Cardia translated Lilith as Lamia, a witch who steals children, similar to the Breton Korrigan, in Greek mythology described as a Libyan queen who mated with Zeus. After Zeus abandoned Lamia, Hera stole Lamia's children, and Lamia took revenge by stealing other women's children.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             It should also be noted that Hillary Clinton is a witch and visited a coven in Los Angeles once or more per month. She also put a status of Lilith in the White House.
            </p>
            <p>
             It should also be noted that the Screech Owl is a symbol for Lilith. There are many building in the US with hidden owls in their architecture such as the Frost Building in Dallas
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_Bank_Tower">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_Bank_Tower
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             This may be why places like Bohemian Grove and other Pagan sites often have Owl status in Gardens like Lilith in the Garden of Eden.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is also an owl status on the Temple on Jeffrey Epstein's Pedo Island
             <a href="http://2static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/98/10/981013_6076462.jpg">

             This owl is often mistaken for Moloch which is actually a bull headed god with a man's body. It may be Minerva's owl but considering the context it is more likely the demon Lilith. Occultists like owls because they can see things in the dark which the uninitiated can't.

             This quote may be why these cultists seem to want to cause degeneration of the West through media such as porn and the music industry (Miley Cyrus, Beyounce, Lady Ga Ga, etc.)

             Lilith agreed with Yahweh to have one hundred of her children die every day for her disobedience to Adam. Accordingly, every day one hundred 'demons' perish, and for the same reason, Jews write the angels' names on the amulets of young children so they aren't mistaken for 'demons' (non-Jewish Children).

              Two primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lamia bore the title "child killer" and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith.

              Modern Luciferianism
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             In modern Luciferianism, Lilith is considered a consort of Lucifer and is identified with the figure of Babalon.
            </p>
            <p>
             She is said to come from the mud and dust, and is known as the Queen of the Succubi. When she and Lucifer mate, they form an androgynous being called "Baphomet" or the "Goat of Mendes," also known in Luciferianism as the "God of Witches."[66]
            </p>
            <p>
             Writings by Michael W. Ford, including The Foundations of the Luciferian Path, contend that Lilith forms a part of the "Luciferian Trinity" consisting of herself, Samael and Cain. Likewise, Lilith is said to have been Cain's actual mother, as opposed to Eve. (therefore it is Cain who kills Adam and Eve's son Abel)
            </p>
            <p>
             Lilith here is seen as a goddess of witches, the dark feminine principle, and is also known as the goddess Hecate.
            </p>
            <p>
             This shows beyond a shadow of a doubt the evil nature of the Jewish god, Lilith, Adam, and those who believe in them.

            Oddly it took me to a Spanish version of #Pizna on twitter. Looked up the meaning of Lilith and it means demon possessed woman? Also, Pizna I found to be eluding to "pizza" in the same manner as these sick bastards on twitter.
