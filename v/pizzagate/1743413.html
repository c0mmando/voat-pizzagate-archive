<p>I see a great opportunity in the missing girls from Washington DC and this post I just saw on here earlier; <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1743227">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1743227</a>
 I just posted this on Facebook along with The picture of the police chief and James Alefantis rubbing shoulders. This is my post:
&quot;Let\'s add this one also to things that make you go hmmmm
D.C police chief Peter Newsham, incriminated an 11-year-old rape victim while letting the perpetrators go free. Yes you heard that right incriminated the rape victim. And here he is seen rubbing shoulders with the owner of comet ping pong and reaping praise for &quot;protecting the restaurant&quot;. Say what you want but you are who you hang around with and he has proven that to us.&quot;
<a href="http://livingresistance.com/2017/02/06/dc-police-chief-mishandled-case-multiple-men-raping-11-yr-old-child/">http://livingresistance.com/2017/02/06/dc-police-chief-mishandled-case-multiple-men-raping-11-yr-old-child/</a></p>
<p>And then I decided to go ahead and post this in the comments on all the threads about the missing children. I must\'ve gotten only about two posts in when they started blocking me.  I have screenshots of the different screens and the warnings I got that for privacy reasons I prefer not to post them. It was instant so I know we hit a nerve. What the heck here they are
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/Tto4J">http://imgur.com/a/Tto4J</a>
Another thing that was different this time, was how hard they made it for me to block the people that are monitoring my posts. If you are not aware of this issue watch this brief video
<a href="https://youtu.be/b6D2-otj-_Q">https://youtu.be/b6D2-otj-_Q</a>
And I just want to add to this video I just type in Facebook now to search for people to block. But what was different this time around is when you find the person,you have to click on the name and you scroll to the bottom and click on block. That they had posted so much jibberish, it took me forever to be able to block these people.  These are whole new set of text to keep us from spreading information.  You can see it here for yourself
<a href="https://youtu.be/yWU32XEzf8o">https://youtu.be/yWU32XEzf8o</a></p>
<p>So basically what I\'m asking is everyone go ahead and share something similar to what I did and let\'s spread the news about this corrupt police chief, his connection to Alefantis and at the same time bring more attention to the missing children in DC. We have the public\' ear let\'s go for it.</p>',

            Where are the pedophiles off the map in the Megan's law either. gone. Scrubbed. Advocated for privacy I spupose. But that's so wrong. I used to be able to look at my town and unsurprisingly red lights pop up all over. Wouldn't give the picture of their face but would give the location on the earthveiw sans the house number. Now nothing at all. As if my town and whole surrounding area of mill valley is safe. When i know of at least one horrible convicted child rapist and pornographer connected by marriage to the Bush family. Paul Guerin who lives on hillside rd mill valley and in San Miguel De allende goes back and forth (?) It's online anyway and I put it on gab but his mill valley house does not come up at all on Megan's law website like houses of pedophiles used to when the site started. come on! Blank of red dots. Wtf?
