<p>But with that context in mind, it was pointed out that Madeiline McCann has an extremely rare genetic anomaly that maybe <s>only 1% or 2%</s> of children have (<strong>correction: it\'s actually much rarer; a researcher pointed out its incidence is LESS THAN 0.0001%</strong>).

<p>Folks I wish I were making this up, but you know the infant(s) that James Alefantis has been posting? Did it strike you as odd that some of these photos were very close to their faces?

<p>Listen, I\'m not going to conclude anything about this. Maybe it\'s just all an epic coincidence.

<p>Nevertheless, I felt I should post it so it\'s something we\'re aware of. I recommend keeping this discovery in-house until we have something more definitive to say about it, but do as you wish. </p>

<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> someone else has pointed out that Amanda Kleinman, a performer at Alefantis\'s Comet Pizza, made a creepy video in which pictures of the same eye deformity are used multiple times in rapid succession. So at the very least, it\'s safe to say these people find some significance in the eye deformity, or rather the underlying genetic condition that sometimes causes the eye deformity. Here is a screen capture of a frozen frame: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/4AVURV.png">https://i.sli.mg/4AVURV.png</a></p>
<p>Here\'s the video in full (it also includes pictures of children dressed as pizza and overt references to arch pedophile Baba Sathya Sai): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicUO0sz08c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicUO0sz08c</a></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> a researcher found a relevant link explaining the new science behind children\'s blood reversing the aging process that might be exciting to the political elite: <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2210909/plasma-from-the-blood-of-young-people-reverses-the-ageing-process/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2210909/plasma-from-the-blood-of-young-people-reverses-the-ageing-process/</a>. Evidently, the younger the child is, the more effective it is in reversing aging. So an ongoing supply of infants and toddlers, presumably, would be best. </p>
<p>Now Soros is clearly too old to be having kids of his own. Is it possible that he and others are paying for the blood of these children? Is it possible that Soros has his ... \'DNA\'...  in a cryobank? And different women are using it to have in vitro children as blood sources? This would explain why McCann was born in vitro, if she indeed was. </p>
<p>It would give us a testable prediction, as well. It would predict that the &quot;fathers&quot; of these children -- both McCann and Caris James -- are not biologically related. If it turns out they are not biologically related, it would be confirmation. (If it turns out that they share DNA with Soros or other political figures, it would be supreme confirmation.)</p>
<p>But aside from that confirmation, it <em>would</em> also explain, if true, why Alefantis makes sick jokes about Caris James and it doesn\'t seem to outrage the alleged father on instagram. We really hate to raise these questions about the parents if they are innocent, but our intention is purely to ensure the safety of the children. It certainly is odd that parents would NOT be outraged with Alefantis\'s references to &quot;loving butt&quot; and &quot;chickenlover&quot; about the child, <em>unless</em> the parents are not biologically related. And it would also explain the odd behavior of McCann\'s parents after the abduction.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> Someone in the comments notes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gene mutation that causes this condition is a PAX2 mutation. During embryonic development, the PAX2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is involved in the formation of the eye, ear, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), kidney, and genital tract. After birth, the PAX2 protein is thought to protect against cell death during periods of cellular stress. If someone were to be seeking a solution to cellular death, they would probably start with exploring the function of the PAX2 produced proteins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven\'t verified, but might be worth exploring.</p>',

            I do take issue with this:  "It certainly is odd that parents would NOT be outraged with Alefantis's references to "loving butt" and "chickenlover" about the child, unless the parents are not biologically related.

            Remember whom we are dealing with here!  They do NOT care about their own children the way WE do about ours (see children "available for entertainment in the hottub" email on Wikkileaks).  Projection is dangerous because it leads to erroneous assumptions.
           </p>

            So someone comments at the end of the article 
that a John Lowe has claimed that he is the father of Maddy and has the same dna. Well I am ready to believe almost anything at this point. The Soros coloboma match with Maddy is another reason to not doubt. The Gerry and the fake father of Caris may well be pedos since they seem pretty cold regarding these kids. Most pedos are rumored to hate children. There was a report on here about someone erasing CP from Gerrys computer. Somehow this stuff seems to be coming together.

            Coloboma means the outline of pupil is irregular and is caused by rare genetic defects, rarer tha OP pretends here, actually 2-14 per 100000 (0.00002 not 0.05)
What IS about 0.05 in prevalence is iris nevus, a usually darker spot on the iris, which still has a normal round pupil, and is shown by many of the persons OP names.

            Sorry to bust your vampire fantasies, even if they are fantasies shared with some of these sickos like Kleinman/apes etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Forgive me if anything more meaningful was hidden in the OPs wall of text, it seems a huge time waster.

            Maybe targeting children with genetic disorders for ritual abuse/sacrifice can be explained with something akin to the acknowledged belief (widespread in parts of Africa) that children with the genetic disorder of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism">
             albinism
            </a>
            can transmit magical powers (by being used in rituals and eaten) : see

             here
            </a>
            . Maybe their kabbalistic/hermetic beliefs hold something similar.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or maybe it's the opposite: these children lives have no value, it is a sin to have let them be born, somehow it is okay to do to them what they're doing. That kind of eugenicist thought is unfortunately

            Okay - so there are a few different PAX genes (there appear to be 9 from what I've researched). PAX2 has been associated with the Coloboma eyes. "PAX3 has been identified with ear, eye and facial development....Mutations in it can cause Waardenburg syndrome."

           <p>
            Now...go ahead and google "Waardenburg syndrome"

            Look at their faces! Look at the noses and bags under some of their eyes! Does this not look like the facial structures in the children tagged #Carisjames? (Could someone post a link to the instagram photos?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Now it gets a little weirder. I googled Caris and Waardenburg. Guess what came up as the first result:

            There are lots of images of all these people where you cannot clearly see a defect. I was shocked and appalled at first but is someone playing games with us and editing images? It's bizarre. I don't know what to make of it... anyone?

            "#themostexpensiveaccessory" funny how he mentions that on the close up of the baby with the eye disorder, are they making these kids in some sick experiment in order to have more of what ever this eye disorder creates?

            I don't think there is much strength in the correlation as the pineal glad calcifies in everybody. Further calcium build up around the pineal gland maybe attributable to Alzheimer's but as a separate issue.

            I do think this was self-deleted.  The person posted that he was out and posted an archive of a lot of work, including one on McCann's eye.  If I remember correctly it was the poster from Spain and happened about two days ago.

            The easiest answer is they are lying about their age. Since they [i.e correct gender reference for a trans] do not appear to be a birth female, Reality is: they are already taking on a persona of a different gender than the given by nature birth gender. Just sayn' I vote that they are lying about their age.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only person who appears comfortable at this fete is Nicole Kidman. I vote that Maria is trans and is lying about their age. [I have images of adam's apple and beard stubble], If they are mis-directing about gender they are likely mis-directing about age? Crowley was known as a master of lying. I think they pride themselves on misdirection, "fooling the sheeples" / Joker style. Alefantis resembles a "Joker" in his alt persona [a name taken from a real ID] "Amanda Kleinman"] - Maria's Fete Celebrity images [https://sli.mg/a/mdv0hG](https://sli.mg/a/mdv0hG -) Notice how the Assistant who raises up the "heart" for the camera, later appears to become  "victim"

            " It certainly is odd that parents would NOT be outraged with Alefantis's references to "loving butt" and "chickenlover" about the child, unless the parents are not biologically related. And it would also explain the odd behavior of McCann's parents after the abduction."
           </p>
           <p>
            Some parents kill their own children, so, the fact the alleged birth father makes no objections to sick jokes about the baby, who is not in his own possession but is at a children's clubhouse with pornographic images all around,  does not prove the alleged father is not biologically related.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since these kinky people are apparently in control of the alleged "Child Protection Agencies," it doesn't seem to matter in a practical sense; especially since the Authorities and the Media can not or will not admit anything "untoward" went on at the Clubhouse / Pizza joint.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not odd. It just means that they are sadists.

            LegionWill - Very interesting post and I think you may of found some incredible lead: The photo''s currently are to blurry for me to say either way...
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't want to add to much to this - but read your article and I thought very interesting:- I'm from the UK and have followed the mccann thing from day 1:- always been interested on how things in the media changed etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            This one caught my eye as I thought why would they change the appearance of Madeline's eye by photo shopping out a distinctive mark, one that would allow the child to be recognized - surely pointless? or to hide something....
           </p>
           <p>
            I vaguely remember Jerry Mcann being questioned about this, as the data and time stamps on the photo had obviously also changed,

            NB: have also done quite a lot of research  into DMT (Di-Methyl Tryptamine) -I pretty sure it gets released into you brain, once when your born and once when you die: taking it in between opens doors and you meet the little people.I've actually been trying to get hold of some for a while now -  but thqt's a different story.

            The benefit may be that their blood/glands/hormones are altered due to the Pax2 defect. It's very likely that whatever they are looking for may be in higher concentrations in those persons with this condition. That's the connection.

            Yeah that'll happen. My stomach is still doing little flips whenever I see or hear the word pizza. And very few symbols remain pure these days, if you look into the anhk enough, you're bound to find something you'll disagree with. It's why I have such a hard time thinking about what kind of tattoo I would even tolerate.

            That is a VERY interesting little tidbit! Do you have a source for that? It does NOT sound insignificant to the overall Clinton investigation...

            Some research I came across a while regarding one Robert Lanza MD and his research into cloning and spiders.  My sense is this has something to do with all of this but way over my head as a laymen.

            George Soros is too Hungarian. The Austrian-Hungary empire did border ancient Khazaria so that could be the psuedo-Jewish tie in. That is also a tie in with these people.

            The link between this disorder and the pineal gland (via PAX2) is super important. Pineal glands interact with electromagnetic fields, like your wifi cards in your laptop.

             This was published in 2002. Have there been any further publishings about this?

            <p>
             This is a reddit article discussing it -https://www.reddit.com/r/pinealgland/comments/4wco9v/lets_talk_piezoelectric_brain_sand/

             That is some pretty crazy stuff. If there is a link there, it would add some sense why this one particular child out of children they have access to all over the world was chosen to be kidnapped and why it looks like some of the children that JA posted on instagram have iris deformities.

             From this it sounds like you could make a torture device that attacks the pineal gland through infrared wave pulses.

            There is a Filipino lore that states that people with eye "moles" have spiritual powers of some sort. Strange Coincidence.

            Could this also be connected to the blood type of negative blood being purest and rarest only 7% of people? Hard to clone too. Most 13 blood lines elitist have RH neg blood.
            <a href="http://www.biotechnologyforums.com/thread-1950.html">

            </a>
            It has been observed that without RH protein, the cloned blood cell loses its required flexibility as well as the DNA strand is difficult to use after retrieving it. The root cause for this is related to the D antigen, its genetic makeup and receptors variations. In combination, all these factors make it difficult to clone RH negative blood cells and thus also in whole.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been estimated that 85 % of all humans’ beings are with RH Positive blood type. It means their red blood cells contain a substance called Rhesus (Blood factor). This protein can be traced to the Rhesus monkey. At the same time RH negative blood type is the purest blood known to mankind. Only 7 % of the people in the world have RH negative factor. The origin of RH negative blood type is yet unknown. A RH negative pregnant mother’s baby will show immunological reactions to mothers RH positive factor, this is because it consider that as a foreign entity.
People with Rh Negative blood type should donate blood. This will help in emergency situation and will meet the requirement of compatible blood for patients (with Rh Negative blood group) whenever they are in need, as this is a rare type.

            This post really seems to be going off the deep end, getting into crazy tinfoil.  I see Jeb's coloboma, but I couldn't really see the others.  You talk about how this could be used to discredit us, then you go talking about vampires.   ?
           </p>
           <p>
            I do find interesting the bit about the gene that connects to uveal coloboma being connected to pineal development.  The pineal gland has been theorized to be connected to psychic ability (e.g. all the references to the "third eye" in the occult art in Comet Ping Pong, Roberta's, etc).  I believe a lot of the people in "The Big Club" have psychic ability, based on a couple run-ins I've had with spooks, and based on some anecdotes that lead me to believe psychic ability is real.

            Henry Kissinger once joked with an author friend of mine that the screenplay for Chinatown, taught in film schools worldwide, really was the best ever written. I did not see what was so funny. The following is a quote from the Slate article, and notice a comment here reveals that Kissinger has the flaw as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            "There’s also an eccentric sensuality that runs through the film, with the characters getting turned on by strangeness. This cuts both ways, since the central discovery about Evelyn is both illicit and amoral. But that’s what gives the film its staying power—not just the shock of discovering those peculiar depths of humankind, but that slight intangible thrill of moving toward it. “There’s something black in the green part of your eye,” says Jake, right before he kisses Evelyn for the first time. She completes their odd seduction by referring to it as a flaw in the iris. While her revelation has become almost a joke in movie culture, with Nicholson slapping the truth out of Dunaway, her performance reaching the heights of hysteria, the moment retains its power in context. It’s forceful because in addition to the sick hunger of the villains, there’s also Jake’s hunger to understand."

            I don't buy that story of dogs signalling dead tissue in the room. First they wouldn't kill her in the room with her brothers sleeping just beside. Second even if they did kill her in the room they wouldn't keep her laying there for long so I really doubt any level of cell decomposition had the time to happen. Beside, even being alive, you are constantly shedding dead skin cells. How does the dog make a difference betwen the smell of someone who is dead and stayed 5mn in a bed, and someone who is alive but shed some dead skin cells? Cadaver dogs are meant to detect cadavers that had some level of decomposition going.

            If this theory is to hold any weight we need to find more missing children known to have the PAX2 mutation. With only 6000 potential victims this should stand out. Unfortunately they could  import from China or India where they have a far higher birthrate and the lack of record keeping.

            Have you guys filtered through the still images of first 20 seconds or so of the vid? the first second holds at least 10 images, a sickening, and possibly incriminating image between 7-10 not gonna go back to check and make sure honestly...Someone who is qualified and compiling should do so ASAP

            Your correction is off.  You now have it as 500X rarer than it actually is.  As I said previously, it's
            <strong>
             .005% to .022%
            </strong>
            .  You have it as .00001%.  We need to avoid overstating this.  There is still a possibility it's a coincidence and an example of confirmation bias.

            Edited to add: This link came up when I was searching colombo + illumanati. Someone look at this. I'm afraid to. It's in Italian (with some English). Has quotes from the Satanic Bible, and presents symbols from just about every corporation and entity in business I can think of and relates their corporate logos to the "all seeing eye (masonry)" or "sun" or "isis". Does anyone here speak Italian?

            Torture and even killing of children were accepted practices in the Catholic Church during medieval times and those that even had copies of the Bible in those days or even verses of the bible felt the wrath of the Church for centuries. Ten Centuries of death and destruction
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages">

            They had detailed records of the courts and the laws that effectively put anyone they wanted under the torture chambers and the death of innocents. They witnessed this evil first hand and thus recorded the sufferings in detail yet we have seen little to no records at all of these massive events yet I bet the elite have and still do research these documents/relics of torture spirit cooking and the taking and control of spirits/"SOUL"s. St. Nicholas of Myra turkey saved three children chopped up to be served as food to the public. A miracle by the catholic church by making them whole again
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas
            </a>
            Evil has been accepted by the elite no doubt about it! They most likely all wear robes and masks and most likely worship Moloch at the Bohemian Grove. I wonder were they are made and who sells them ha! Skull and Bones
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones

            like Kerry the one who's tongue is constantly sticking out like a lizard when he talks creepy as shit lusting for the blood of everlasting life these evil people need like a drug.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove
            </a>
            Thus the connection to Hollywood or Holywood for fire in my opinion. The time has come that our leadership of any Cult worship must come to an end as expressed by President John F Kennedy who was most likely aware of this evil cult throughout government.  We are Opposed around the World to secret societies and secret oaths we were warned years ago it must end now!

            This all feels real, snaps right into place. I can almost see the infrastructure that would have developed to  surround the organization. So the main aim of the operation isn't necessarily pedo, it's harvesting. That would be expensive. The Clinton Foundation???? Trump understands business. He is probably about 20 steps ahead and recognizes that the financial empire is for a purpose more elaborate than just pay for play.

            Ok if this is real let's be rational about it. People do actually create children for the sole purpose of organ harvesting. (see clinton appointed president of kosovo) Let's not jump into the 'they're all vampires' theory. Reality is dark enough already. Soros isn't a young man, he propably needs replacement parts.

            Also couldn't this also be an injury / result of abuse?

            Guaranteed your govt is in on it as well... they all are, the shit's everywhere. These are going to be some tough times for all of humanity coming up as they all wake up to the fact theyve been living in the matrix in a completely fake reality. Ive knows about this crap for over 20 years and have been trying to wake people up but just looked at like im nuts ... until recently...it still upsets me enough that im glued to this case as well. Im like most here,... i wont quit until something is done about this! This is not the kind of world any sane person wants to live in.

            If children with Coloboma are extremely desirable then a trend would show and we should see more missing children that have this condition; although it's a very rare condition, we might expect to see at least one or two others, right?  Check pictures of missing kids or recovered kids, do some have Coloboma?  My brief search of images of missing children didn't show anyone other than Madeline.  Many pictures I pulled up from missing children sights didn't always have a clear picture of the eyes though.

             Agreed. It's apparently noneffective in strengthening enamel/preventing cavities in newborns, too. Like has been said in other fluoride threads, it's a TOPICAL treatment, not for ingesting or injecting.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The authors also found only two studies since 1975 that looked at the effectiveness of reducing cavities in baby teeth, and found fluoridation to have no statistically significant impact here, either.
             </p>
             <p>
              The scientists also found “insufficient evidence” that fluoridation reduces tooth decay in adults (children excluded).
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             They only found seven worthy studies from prior to 1975. This makes me think that they just decided on a massive multinational scale based on a few studies that somehow showed positive results.

             Thankfully the word seems to be getting out, and people will begin to realize that the risk is far greater than the reward. Although we'll probably never hear an admission that fluoride was added for its neurotoxic effects rather than its supposed cavity preventative effects.

              I've always heard the narrative that fluoride was an industrial waste product that a few companies managed to market into some sort of snake oil for peddling to their local governments. Not sure how true the story is, but it seems highly believable to me.

            They have done experiment with mice where they transfuse the blood of younger mice into older mice, and the effect was dramatic. For example, memory was better and many more benefits. Google it I guess. I can definitely see these people playing vampires and drinking the blood of the innocent.

            wow.  thank you for this contribution to our questioning knowledge.
           </p>

            All of this stuff and reading down the comments brings back the mention of the words "bloodlines" that you always hear in association with Illuminati.  Illuminati bloodlines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the pineal gland represents psychic abilities - to open the third eye is to open up omniscience and psychic senses.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this seems to point to some kind of ongoing, methodical human harvest.
           </p>
           <p>
            After reading down I have to add this -  there was a whole collection of art more or less from the victims point of view, showing black figures on top of small figures, some of them tied down, and with "ghosts" floating - this was representing the victim dissociating during extreme trauma.  (some is on this page under the name "Ria Pratt" an alter

             Pratt art
            </a>
            The phenomenon is widely discussed in relation to MK Ultra as one of the main goals because the dissociation of the personality allows a handler to program alternate personalities into the mind of the victim.  Read here if unfamiliar

             mind control systems
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if trauma and dissociation "activates" the pineal, excreting the special fluids which would be rare and highly valued.  Creating a special kind of blood...if the victim was killed at that moment?

             There's definitely something to the release of adrenaline by extreme fear and harvesting of the pineal for some spiritual satanic potion. These are real life freaking vampires man. Probably drinking the blood of innocents keeps them alive but also makes them ever more evil and insane.

            Cadaver dogs brought to WHAT room?  The hotel room in Portugal?  Not that this would mean anything, as hotels are obviously home to countless individuals over time, but I've never seen anything regarding this despite the many hours of investigation I've done into the matter.  Also, cadaver dogs wouldn't be brought in on an investigation for what was a missing person/kidnapping at first - and has never been changed to a murder investigation as there's never been any solid indication that she's dead despite what anyone may assume.  Additionally, cadaver dogs wouldn't be brought into the hotel room because a) it's quite clear that there was no body in the room for  -- the police were called and immediately arrived upon scene and clearly no body was found, otherwise we wouldn't be talking about it not to mention b) there's differentiation amongst police dogs that have them trained in different groups - they typically don't track for live smells like a person's scent tied to a piece of clothing as well as the smell left by decomposing human tissue - so I think that this is misinformation.

            Dogs can and are successfully cloned regularly in South Korea - Seoul is the global epicenter of the global commercial/legitimately scientific cloning industry (well, outside of the more "underground" type stuff going on in places like China).  My parents had our dog cloned recently - it cost them around $75k USD - which is down from around $250-500k just a year or two ago.  There's lots of videos on YouTube.

            The flawed pupil/iris was a trait of the sister/mother in the film Chinatown. Her father raped her and she passed the trait to her daughter/sister. Maybe it holds fetish value, the connection with the famous film.

            Is a secret eugenics program plausible?
I've been stuck in a rabbit hole and the world seems to get weirder and weirder. Real or red herring this topic got me thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems, from this thread, that Kate McCann is likely a surrogate mother. With Madelein's abduction and the information uncovered, it leads me to wonder if elites/globalists are operating a eugenics program. They seek out these ultra rare features for the program to study. I can't imagine what their real intent is, or maybe I don't want to know.  Could there be more surrogates??

             This interview is with Dr. Joseph Ferrell who posits that a cabal of leftover Nazi EUGENISISTS regrouped and infiltrated much of the government.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The two delve deeply into Farrell's newly-released book, 'Hidden Finance, Rogue Networks and Secret Sorcery', which covers the role of an international Fascist syndicate in the events of 9/11. Farrell asserts that this group is in possession of advanced Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) that were used to collapse the World Trade Center Towers.
Farrell outlines 9/11 as a three-level operation comprised of 1). The infamous "19 hijackers", who were used as patsies by elements inside the 2). National Security State (the group that is commonly the focus of non-mainstream 9/11 research) and 3). A coalition of forces, which developed after the defeat of Germany in World War II, which is a powerful but clandestine remnant of the eugenicist Nazi Party. This group is global and not relegated solely to Germany, by any means.
            </p>
            <p>
             After WWII, this group continued to work behind the scenes, involving themselves in secretive, criminal activities, from drug-running to the development of the The Bilderberg Group, to a secret system of finance, which laundered the proceeds from the sale of stolen Nazi assets. Today, it functions to processes the black market-derived income that funds their activities."  Dark Jouralist (

             )
            </p>
            <p>
             NO DERAIL - It isn't important to bring 911 into this discussion, I just put this in here for the overall picture of money laundering global enterprises, human trafficking could certainly be among them, as well as other similarities to the group we seem to be discussing.

            agree. This also reminded me of the planned parenthood videos that uncovered Planned Parenthood openly discussing selling aborted foetuses and body parts to 'laboratories'. I am sure all this depravity is linked

            So they're really blood-sucking undead creatures.... Not only do they run or deeply influence government, they're protected by legions of compromised mercenaries, paramilitaries, all that good shit, who are "legitimately" on government payroll...
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a test, go to a couple of "NSFW" subverses around here, follow a link or two, any number of them will put you few clicks away from CP, the shit is everywhere..... And who do you report it to? The government is loaded with pedophiles who almost never get prosecuted, especially when they get rank and are in office, or still employed with the government.

             IDK about that...not doubting you and really don't want to be linked to 'proof' otherwise, but I've been online for a loooong time and haven't been exposed to something like cp on any normal/regular sites or porn sites in fact.

Pre symbolic of drinking the blood of your own kids.

            Last week I called these fucks out as vampires trying to extend their lives with the blood of children, and I got bitch slapped for being off the rails. (there was also a misused word and I was discredited for that as if that has shit to do with the validity of the statement itself) this mess runs deep, and if it can be corrected it's going to change the world, likely for the better oveall.  Grab a battle buddy because they'll talk about how offensive you are and while you're defending your opinion their people are behind you with a gun to your head pulling the trigger.  In all aspects they have created banking, political, social, and religious laws and they follow none of them, and while you're chasing your tail trying to figure out how to play by these rules they're writing the check for their victory pedo party.

              Lol you obviously have never heard of conjecture and think you have a detective badge.  How the fuck do you think group thought works?  All caps means you're extra serious?   Lol it's an idea dipshit.   Read  it,  think,  add constructive input,  and or move on.  You've added nothing but waisting your and my time.  I know what mine is worth.  I'll wait for you to look up conjecture.  ;-)

               I think research of the blood transfusion and verification of Soros' eye based on reliable sources was important and is more worth, than the brabbling of thousands of kids like you, who don't even understand the difference between verifiable facts and personal opinion.

                Yes I believe the research into this subject is quite important also, I find the reading of the subject informative and useful.  If however you believe the motivation (religious sacrifice, longevity, perversion),  time line, or other factors for these actions are unimportant to figuring out why, how and who/whom they're doing it with, then you're honesty part of the problem and need to move aside.  If I have misspelled or misused a word, wonderful,  pop your feathers and move on, otherwise take your hands off the keyboard, take a deep breath and realize we're focused on the same goal, helping these kids.  And like every major issue in human history everyone involved has an opinion on how to handle it.  Do us all a favor pick a thread dedicated to yours, let those obviously interested in your view know what it is put a smile on your face,  tell mom to cut the crust off your grilled cheese (that's me being a shit) and let the rest of us share our opinions.  In a setting like this friend, they lied to you when they said it takes all kinds.

              Wouldn't it be interesting to find out how long they've been doing it?   I'm going to go out on a limb and guess it's been going on for hundreds of years.

                Glad someone else said it.  I think these pukes have now used science to validate what they've been doing for centuries to try and gloss over the negatives of how they've been doing it.  Smoke and mirrors my friends, smoke and mirrors.

              As long as the blood group is compatible, if an old person was plugged into a young person, he /she would be able to hijack the younger more vital persons immune system for the time they were plugged in. It would wear the younger person down faster but they would tend to recover , but if it continued to long it might hasten ageing in the young person.

               Yes and Saudis have a massive spike in Type two diabetes, because they lounge around and eat a lot of modern crap, if you had a little pet you could plug into it would drop your blood sugar really fast, without the need of insulin and the problem that it causes.

              Yes obviously they're not actually Hollywood vampires, but...  They're parasites sucking the life out of children (at least they seem to think they are) through the use of their blood and possibly organ harvesting.  I would say they're closer to being vampires than we are detectives.

            This thread does help justify my belief that's what's involved in Pizzagate is not merely child trafficking. There's a whole lot more going on.

            Not sure if this has been brought up already but I was just watching a pizzagate investigation video and noticed something possibly related. At the end of the video they are talking about Politics and Prose. How it's on the same street and there is a skull and crossbones on the sidewalk out front. Then they show the inside and how the childrens books are located in a basement,  which they found odd. Well, I noticed on the sign that said "Sale Books" both the O's had lines coming off the bottom, like the eye defect being discussed in this thread. Start at the 8:09 mark

              Doesn't mean that it could be an indentifier. Perhaps searching for other stores with same font might lead to connection back to these circles. (Yes some stores are bound to use this accidentally but other...just might be a front)

             Fuck that video and its author. They start out with the most obviously falsified disinfo bullshit (it's been posted here too and thankfully pointed out as fake) and it gives the rest of the video a bad taste. Also they call out "shills" in their comments (even if they support pizzagate as a whole) for pointing that out. It's clear he's just pandering to sensationality for the YT views, and since it puts a bad light on the investigation I don't see Google stepping in to remove it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, from their disclaimer:

             Anyway here's a screenshot of what you're talking about so that we don't have to give that fucker any more money.

             I think they're supposed to be balloons? Or... monocles? Crying eyes (QQ)? Regardless, in this context it's pretty sketchy.

              Like both Coloboma and ping pong paddles. Maybe the ping pong theme is a signal that they can find their blood meal there. I can't believe I just typed that.

            This all sounded very familiar to me. Havent watched this since it was released so am not sure how much this resembles the current goings on but maybe look into this.

             That video is out there. Interesting the talk about Reptilian entities, Carl Sagan reptilian brains and the various pics of reptile eyes. Then this whole thread talking about common traits in the eyes DNA...possibly reptilian DNA?

             David Icke is great to listen to,... anyone will tell you that most all of his stuff is 100% legit except his reptilian theories but after looking at that picture of Soros up above...my god man,... maybe he is right about that too!

              its about now David Icke has a) heart attack (b) dies in a car crash (c) suicide. 
One thing about the reptilian ruling class is that they are not very creative... but they are tenacious.

              The abnormally shaped pupil

             Features - a pupil should be round. Deviation from this suggests abnormalities.
Differential diagnosis - congenital defects (eg, coloboma), iris inflammation or trauma, Argyll Robertson pupils. A fixed oval pupil in association with severe pain, a red eye, a cloudy cornea and systemic malaise suggests acute angle-closure glaucoma which warrants immediate referral.

               Yup, ^ this.
When main stream reporters look into #pizzagate and 90% of posts will be unrelated .jpgs of pagan gods and irrelevant pizza places across the globe, we will look like a bunch of lunatics. There is some very convincing circumstancial evidence (code language in e-mails for example) - let's stick to that.

                You can stick to whatever you want, but everyone who is investigating the Podesta emails and follow your advice will discover the following:
Podesta emails - pizzagate - pedophilia - childcare and child adoption organizations involved in human trafficking - Podesta brothers looking like eFits of Madeleine McCann - Madeleine with Coloboma defect (1 in 10000) - George Soros with same eye defect - Soros huge Clinton donor and mastermind behind color revolutions
also from Podesta emails: Wyss corporation - Wyss huge donor to CF - human experiments with at least five dead ppl - Wyss corp close to Dupont Circle (and Portugese Embassy).
That's only the result if someone follows the Podesta emails like you suggest...
               </p>
               <p>
                And the positive effect of young blood is also something one must know:

                 No offense man but 
1) the eFits are two sketches OF THE SAME MAN according to Wiki:
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann">
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann
                 </a>
                 2) the Micro and Anophthalmic Children's Society (Macs) says Coloboma occurs in about 0.007% :
                 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7256513.stm">
                  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7256513.stm
                 </a>
                 3) pupillary abnormalities can be caused by causes other than coloboma
                 <a href="http://patient.info/doctor/pupillary-abnormalities">
                  http://patient.info/doctor/pupillary-abnormalities
                 </a>
                 4) young blood plasma reversing aging has been observed in MICE. If anything that was observed in mice would work for humans - we would have solved cancer like 5000 times already

                  Wikipedia also claims, Pizzagate was debunked.
Also the claim, that the eFits would show only one man - has been discussed here and is absolutely ridiculous, because there is no prove of only one man.
And you obviously didn't even read the articles about the blood plasma research!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  All your claims are old and have been thouroughly discussed and debunked here.
Lots of very good info here.
Search, read and learn!

            great post. seems very plausible. I wanted to write this on a few links but this could be the right one. When people have quoted James A and the tomatoes and harvesting I have thought it very weird and immediately though of blood harvesting. Anyways thought Id put it out there.

             I also thought of blood in the tomato sauce, mostly because Disgusting Amanda Ape made one of her lame jokes about something bad in the pizza sauce - even she doesn't like it apparently.

            Speaking of eyes, I think evil/psychopathy is visible in eyes. During the election I made a lot of memes. One was an experiment. I took Hillary, Bernie and Trumps eyes and cut it so that all you could see was their iris and pupil. In comparison I saw differences. Trumps eye looked forward, almost as if it had big dreams. Bernies eye looked determined and focused. Then Hillaries eye... it looked like a vacuum. I couldn't feel anything. Just my 2 cents. Try it out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: also 90% of the comments guessed which eye belonged to who correctly.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is an example of what I described. This is just a random iris on google:

            Are we sure they are girls. I know it sounds stupid and I'm on a phone so I can't tell how similar the eyes are but cloning was the first thing that came to mind. I don't know if bio children would necessarily inherit the exact same deformity.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've often wondered about cloning a younger body for myself and transplanting my brain. Cost and ethics would stop this fantasy for me but not for everyone. It might be easy to clone for the blood but I'm probably way off track and making the whole thread sound crazy. I'm just throwing it out there because everything seems possible these days.

            I would like to point out that it is always the right eye. This seems like a stretch/very bizarre connection, but interesting nonetheless.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also noticed that there are many people linked to my research on this topic that I have been noticing with deformed or distinct right eyes.

            I'm not sure if it means anything, but it is rather fascinating to think about. If anyone can find any other examples of this I'd love to see them.

             Thinking about this, I have something to add - it's the whole "one eye" Illuminati thing.  Apparently people signal "belonging" to the elite by covering or obstructing one eye, (usually the right I believe)  and it is done all the time in pop culture magazines, music videos, entertainment media etc...It is so common that this websites illustrates the latest examples every month.

              I was also going to mention that but I forgot. I was trying to find a correlation to see if it was consistently the right or left eye that they are covering, but it seems to be both.

            I remember a while back on reddit that people first thought the littler girl with her arms taped down was Madeleine Mccann. Someone ran the pictures through a website (twin something???) and it came back a 100% match. I don't know if this was archived before reddit took down pizzagate.

             Well, they are not real twins no matter what since they have a difference mother. At the very best they are semi-identical twins if the very same father gamete was somehow duplicated (I don't even think it's possible). But most likely they are just half-sisters.

            I had a thought along the same line, but with a slight twist...
one of comets instagrams shows a baby with a comment saying #looks like you.
            <br/>
            The baby does indeed look like Elephantis.
Do you have a closeup of that particular baby compared to a closeup of Alefantis eyes?
Does it show a similar iris mark or no?
I noticed that odd mark on Madelaine's eye immediately.
I'm voting for a 3rd party investigator  (not Sweden, their in it up to their eyeballs)  collect  the children in the photos  along with  dna testing.
            <br/>
            I'd like an investigation  to see if they're  using their own sperm to breed babies?   The hashtag does make me wonder because it does in fact look like Alefantis.   A lot of the babies look alike.

              That's for all such eye anomalies.  An eye with a mishaped pupil is less likely, and this specific deviation is even rarer.

               Not that common, but what is the interesting and disturbing fact here is that a child with the anomaly has gone missing, with supposed questionable and most likely involved in abhorrent behavior (my judgement) may have been involved in her disappearance (Podestas), and someone who they are connected to may have posted pics of a baby with the same anomality and is engaged in the same abhorrent behavior. Lastly that someone who is a "God" to these people, rich, powerful and without empathy has the same condition. There may or may not be a connection, and there is yes, wild speculation, however, I personally think no possible connection or clue should be left without inquiry. Thinking out of the box is important both in discovery and solving problems.

             alfred has been covering these topics for years its no secret, the other thread you are speaking of only makes a connection to alfred  from pictures of his brothers (3 of them in total) at a big lobbying party in DC with alefantis, podesta, and soros among others.  i simply googled anyone in the past prior to 2015 who has ever made any connections to coloboma and this was on the first google search result page.  Im not going to say anything about these people other than the facts.

Uploading without source is like crying to reasearchers: IGNORE ME.

            $Millions seems like too much.  Drawing blood is a normal medical procedure, not abusive if not done too heavily.  He could father a child and get plasma from his child's blood.  Then father another child a few years later because it's supposed to be most effective with a young child's blood according to
            <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2210909/plasma-from-the-blood-of-young-people-reverses-the-ageing-process/">

            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole thing doesn't seem to be worth paying that much for it.  Granted I don't know how the plasma is used or how much is needed.  But I don't see the need to imprison other people's children for the purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            And maybe it's not that expensive.  But it can explain relatively large numbers of kids and adult involved.

             There are quite a few references to eastern (Hinduism).
at :06 a pic of a baby walking pizza.
             <br/>
             at :09 a pic of a baby wearing a dress saying,  delicious candy coated milk covered sugar babies
:09  a rabbit next to a basket containing - are those penises?    Easter egg is an important reference to Babylonian Queen Semaramis and I wouldn't be surprised to see symbolic reference to egg/easter in an artistic or graphic manner.
            </p>
            <p>
             :09 is a pic of a woman (Asian?)  sexually tortured. Reference the torture to a UK survivor who claimed that the abusers liked to use objects to torture, in her case a claw hammer.
            </p>
            <p>
             at :10 and other spots on the vid show writing... is it Japanese?  Didn't Hastert allegedly hide out in a Japanese island?   This is global.
            </p>
            <p>
             at :10  a man chained and tortured.  Do they damage the soles of the feet so the victim can't walk/escape? they'd see a blood  trace of where they went if they did escape?
            </p>
            <p>
             at :14 another pic of a man tortured over a bed
            </p>
            <p>
             at :15 what appears to be another photo of a coloboma eye 
along with a man bound and  tortured in the same frame.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the first 2 seconds I found what I think was a pic of a chuck e cheese  mascot, but I can't find it now to confirm.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps a really important find  (for me at least) is the many  photo's references to Hinduism.
Aside from  Sai Baba, whom many westerners and easterners came forward stating that he was a pedophile,  there's a fairly recent    guru from India, who is making his name in North America, and around the western world.
            </p>
            <p>
             His name is  Sadhu Nithyananda.  I'll explain why this is important in context with the topic of the cannablism aspect of pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=sadhu+nithyananda+in+america&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=sadhu+nithyananda+in+america&amp;sc=0-28&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=283E414958B644CF8CD80DF9C557BE28">
              https://www.bing.com/search?q=sadhu+nithyananda+in+america&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=sadhu+nithyananda+in+america&amp;sc=0-28&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=283E414958B644CF8CD80DF9C557BE28
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Nithyananda is based in   Bengalaru in the province of Tamil, in India.  He's actually a member of the sect that goes by the name of  Agori.    The Agori have a large group that has its base in an Indian city called  Varanasi.   This group has anciently been accepted by the country, although many have anciently and currently  been driven    out; they have relative freedom in Varanasi, which is known as the city of the dead.   Varanasi has the largest cremation burning pits and people traditionally bring their dead to the city for burial.  They use the dead person floating down the river, or in a left over creamation, or pay the cremation man for a dead body.
             <br/>
             They are cannibals, although not exclusively, and they allegedly use bodies that are already dead.
            </p>
            <p>
             The thing is, that the Agori are known for performing any type of activity that would be considered vile or despicable to common people.  They believe that it will cause them to confront the worst   and detach from it, eventually enabling them to  transcend duality (duality/non-duality  is part of their belief system.)
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the features of Agori is that they use the dead corpses  in rituals and also eat them.
             <br/>
             They aren't entirely  cannibals,  but engage in cannibalism and body part rituals especially in connection with specific rituals.   There are a few youtubes on Agoris and stories about them online.

             I don't mean to de-rail this thread,  but it's important to know that  Nithyananda has a following in North America as well as Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             His beliefs claim that he uses  dream rituals to communicate with people and open them to his teachings.   The Agori believe that if they do a ritual on a dead body they gain the spirit of the body and it will do the Agori's bidding.  Nithyananda has wanted fame and money, which he's getting plenty of, the foundational claim being that the  spirits help him.
             <br/>
             He's open about being Agori, however I have no idea how much  of the traditional cannibalistic or body ritual information he teaches his public followers, if any.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do know that the police in Bengalaru have an open hotline if anyone notices anything that appears to be of a criminal nature performed by their group.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not sure if this video  is only referencing  Sai Baba   only  in terms of pedophilia,  and I have no information connecting  Sai Baba to the Agori sect.
            </p>
            <pre><code>But, there are   Agori followers in north america and Europe, although they may not even be aware that their guru Sadhu Nithyananda is one.  
</code></pre>
            <p>
             Again, this isn't meant to derail, because it's not really applicable to pedophilia,  but many westerners are following a guru who is Agori (cannibalism and dead body rituals are a necessary part of their structure) and I'm not sure if they're aware of it.  This is education toward the potential (?)   cannibalistic aspect of pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm just bringing this up as a heads up, because if you don't know what you're looking for it could be right under your nose in one form or another.... for example the photos of Sai Baba who was not only a pedophile but also a murderer.

               I just saw this now.
              </p>
              <p>
               From another thread on voat:
               <a href="http://www.topinfopost.com/2014/06/17/european-royals-killing-naked-children">
                http://www.topinfopost.com/2014/06/17/european-royals-killing-naked-children
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Quote:  “Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace.”
              </p>
              <p>
               My inner feeling told me that they cut off penis’s as a trophy, and now here’s an eyewitness saying this is something they do.     I thought there was something that looked like a penis in there, but perhaps it’s been ‘’’artistically”” photo-shopped  to make one look like a penis, cause I tell you that one in the front looked like it was meant to be a penis.  You know they like their   “”art’’ hidden in plane sight.

               I've never seen a newborn rabbit,  but I have seen a penis, and I put a magnifying glass to the screen at the pink  one up front and I tell ya if that's  not a  joke on a shopped up  penis then I'll eat a shoe.  Really.     ...well.. actually, no I won't eat a shoe.    The dude putting out the video is  really disturbed so it's hard to see.  I'd have to click that photo and enlarge it and inspect it,  and it doesn't seem too relevant compared to the other pure torture pics they've put up.
              </p>
              <p>
               one of the pics inside a frame shows a shot of a boy putting his head up to a large headed cartoon-like ''statue''.    I'm not sure if that was chuck e cheese's or not as I couldn't get back into it,  but an interesting thing is that the act of going into the large mouth of the god =  sacrificing to the god is an ancient practice.  The dude putting on this video seemed to specifically put up pics in reference to its  lifestyle.

               I'm doing some deeper linking of people and associations, so this was kind of a break from that...  a bit of a distraction because oh my god this can be nauseating stuff.

               If I ever get as psycho as these shitheads I hope cancer consumes me,  because I don't want to be that level of a mouthbreather useless waste    of oxygen.

              You should know that duality is a big part of "Illuminati" Mind Control and is symbolized all over the place in logos and art with a black and white checkerboard pattern.
              <br/>
              Confronting the worst and transcending - well maybe that's what they tell people to get them to accept child killing, rape, blood sacrifice, consuming "light cake" etc...
             </p>
             <p>
              I could see how people would want to excuse their filthy actions by using a far eastern religious framework to make it all make sense.

               I wonder if there is a link with red feet/red shoes?
              </p>
              <p>
               I remember early on when #PizzaGate first came out, there was also a picture of a little boy with just a towel on and what looked like blood on his foot. Someone had found this pic while taking screen shots from Rachel Chandler Instagram. Not sure where all that info went after Reddit closed down and many Twitter account sharing photos were banned.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's the link for red shoes

            This is incredible information. #Pizzagate just gets weirder and weirder. It was only yesterday that I found that Marina Abramovich (The spirit cooker) is 70 years old! I thought she was in her 40s.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does this look like a 70 year old woman?

            <p>
             The reason I bring this up is because it was one of the few videos that ApesDC's (video in OP --

            <p>
             Tack on another coincidence.  It's just too weird; if there's really only a several thousand of these "deformed iris people" in the world, why does this band seem to be attracted to it as well?

              The person may not be telling the truth about their age. Also, although members of the Abramovic family were prominent in the Christian, Church [Eastern, Serbian] the name is Jewish. And the person 100% has a Jewish look . FWIW.. In history we are told of Jews who change their name [in this case they didn't even bother?] and who join the Christian Church .

             This incredible information... gets us... where exactly? This is all far out non-sense until we link everything. This is so far out in the stratosphere of relevance right now. 122 upvotes for what? What does this do for us right now? And before down voting this. Just seriously ask yourself... why? What is this doing for the big picture case. It's so far out there right now... some one who hasn't read shit sees this and thinks we are fucking whacked out of our minds.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is this being upvoted. - Is there not other shit that should be looked in to right now?  It's such a far stretch. Get them under custody and do a DNA test. Then come with this. Right now it's pointless bull shit that makes us look like crazy conspiracy theorists when there is actually shit going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             And you continue to ask why the MSM won't touch this? My fuck.

              You asked several times so I'll try to provide an answer - you have to think like they do to understand the big picture and better capture them. If there is a spiritual or pseudo-spiritual element to this stuff, it has to be looked at.  Simple as that.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, I have no doubt that even as this is explored, most will stick to the business of nailing down more grounded evidence and connections.

             I know quite a few women in LA who look like that right after seeing a few surgeons and dermatologists. It will wear off. it looks like botox and facelifts... but if not I need some blood.

             A gene involved in the eye defect (coloboma) is also involved in the early development of the pineal gland. The gene is OTX2. Don't know if that's relevant, but earlier I saw talk of the pineal gland being important to weird satanic cannibal types, that they like to eat it. So wondered if the coloboma could be a marker for some kind of anomaly in the pineal gland? Could be nothing but thought I'd post it here just in case it means something to someone.

            <p>
             Oh and also Andrew Sorkin, pro Clinton journalist who said that Snowden and Greenwald should be arrested, also has a coloboma.

              Pineal gland? What the fuck! I know this might make me sound dumb, but I still watch MTV's Teen Wolf (which is in its final season) and the villan on that show goes around eating people's pineal glands to try and gain a soul because he doesn't have one. That is one spooky ass coincidence. Holy shit.

              In the New Age religions the pineal gland is the source of the 3rd eye supposedly. The reason that these Satanists want to eat it is because it is supposed to give you magical powers that the normal common man may not necessarily have. They got this from the followers of the Kabbalah.

              Pineal gland has piezoelectric crystals in it. This means it can convert between electrical and kinetic energy. It suggests a mechanism by which the human brain can interact non-thermally with electromagnetic fields...

              The pineal gland is the third eye connection to the spiritual realm. Perhaps people with these traits have psychic abilities or some other special powers. These satanists know stuff they have kept hidden from the rest of us for thousands of years. I have read about them consuming or sucking the juice from the pineal glands of victims to give them some rush, maybe its provides a spiritual experience of some kind that helps them connect to the other side.

              The pineal gland is mentioned frequently in the Bible. I'm not saying it has any special function but I can see how certain people obsessed with occult symbolism and magic might still see it as something symbolic.
             </p>
             <p>
              Genesis 32:30New International Version (NIV)
             </p>
             <p>
              30 So Jacob called the place Peniel,[a] saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The pineal gland is also called the seat of the soul and the epiphysis cerebri....
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland">
               https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              The results of various scientific research in evolutionary biology, comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, have explained the phylogeny of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species. From the point of view of biological evolution, the pineal gland represents a kind of atrophied photoreceptor. In the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles, it is linked to a vestigial organ, known as the parietal eye which is also called the third eye.[6]
             </p>
             <p>
              René Descartes believed the pineal gland to be the "principal seat of the soul". Academic philosophy among his contemporaries considered the pineal gland as a neuroanatomical structure without special metaphysical qualities; science studied it as one endocrine gland among many. However, the pineal gland continues to have an exalted status in the realm of pseudoscience.[7]
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              Situated at the anatomical center of our brain lies a mysterious gland that may be the intermediary gate that bridges our physical and spiritual experiences here on Earth. Seventeenth-Century French philosopher René Descartes coined this organ, called the pineal gland, as the “seat of the soul,” as he believed it provided people with a medium from which our soul could be expressed through our physicality.
             </p>
             <p>
              The pineal gland has been a topic of great debate over the past couple of decades as the science community is still trying to discover its complete biological function. Dr. Rick Strassman, M.D., author of DMT: The Spirit Molecule, has dedicated years of research to the pineal gland as he suggests that this gland is the factory for a powerful brain chemical called DMT (Di-Methyl Tryptamine) which when produced induces a person into a psychedelic and mystical experience.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many different cultures talk about our “third eye,” and modern theories suggest that this may be a reference to the pineal. Even more peculiar is the fact that pineal gland symbology can be traced to many civilizations such as the Romans, Mexicans, Egyptians, Babylonians and the Greeks. It is interesting to note that even the Catholic Church displays pineal gland imagery, as the Vatican Square contains the largest pineal-like statue in the world. So what could all of this mean? Is there ancient knowledge of this gland that previous cultures had access to? Furthermore, what role does the pineal gland play in our spiritual experiences and how can we explain this in physiological terms?

              Also the pineal gland is seen as the seat of the soul in occultism, and there's lots of talk about "activating" it through meditation leading to visualisation and eventually full-color imagery in thought. Tesla claimed to think in imagery like this, but I don't recall him ever talking about meditation or the pineal gland.

              <a href="https://archive.org/details/godmanwordmadefl00carerich">
               1920 book
              </a>
              called God-man: Word Made Flesh that basically tries to interpret the Bible and other holy books as ancient alchemical guides to the operations of the body - coded and hidden to avoid persecution and preserve knowledge hierarchy.
             </p>
             <p>
              It describes the pineal gland as follows (PDF page 19):
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The Pineal is cone shaped, and secretes a yellow or golden fluid. The Pituitary Body, opposite it, is ellipsoid in shape, and contains a whitish secretion, like milk.
              </p>
              <p>
               The fluids that are found in both these bodies comes from the same source, namely, the Claustrum, which means "barrier" or "cloister," and is referred to as cloister for the very good reason that a precious and holy thing is secreted or secluded there. Saint Claus, or Santa Claus, is another term for this precious fluid, which is indeed a holy gift in the body of each one of us.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              It goes on to make connections between the Pineal/Pituitary glands and Male/Female, Joseph/Mary, the Honey/Milk from the Bible. It's an interesting read, but notably, the Pineal gland is
              <strong>

                Psychedelics are deemed too powerful for the mainstream public, probably because of how easily one can reverse the "programming" absorbed through daily TV-watching.

                Dr. Timothy Leary studied recidivism rates after doing psilocybin-catalysed psychotherapy with a group of 32 inmates (he was determined to be a productive healer, even while in prison). The predicted rate of recidivism was 64%, or 20.5/32. After treatment, though:

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 after six months, only 25 per cent of those on parole had returned, six for technical parole violations and two for new offenses.

                So down to 8/32. Pretty good work! Though sadly that wiki page needs a citation to support that claim.

                As an aside, Tim Leary was sentenced to

                </strong>
                in prison for claiming possession of the supposed "3 ounces" of pot in his daughter's "silver snuffbox" .... 3 ounces can't fit in any snuffbox, no matter how ground up it is. The story is hilarious and it outlines just how much they wanted to shut this guy up.

               ya the pineal gland has importance in psychedelia and buddhism. "The Third Eye". Even the ancient Egyptians believed the pineal gland to be sacred. The Eye of Horus is shaped exactly like that part of the brain:
               <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/mediadrop/uploads/2013/38/d39eedb8fb82baf38d3e00a5df7469db651fc742.jpg">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               The pineal gland is also the source of dimethyltriptamine, the most powerful hallucinogenic known to man.  I could link you to so many scientific research papers on the pineal gland and DMT if you don't believe me. Excess DMT is actually known to cause schizophrenia, and can be found in a schizophrenic's urine. And yea, theres this idea that a person can tap into their pineal gland through meditation, its apparently super difficult though.

                Just as a random fact as you're speaking about drugs; Diazepam (DZP), which doc choc was walking around behind Hillary, with has an inhibitory effect on the pineal gland's production of melatonin.  I know the gland creates other chemicals, but seriously I wonder if she has an issue with her gland because she was sleeping through most of the election cycle.

                I remember reading that it's in everyone's urine, just higher in concentration in schizophrenics. ...And probably lower in people who live in areas with high water fluoridation.

              One of the OG conspiracy theories says that fluoride (or a few other toxins) does massive damage to the pineal gland. Some come at it from the spiritual "3rd eye" angle, others (like myself) look at it as an environmental poison resulting in a decrease of certain sex hormones.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of those is follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which plays a big role in a bunch of vital functions in men and women.
             </p>
             <p>
              Without regurgitating everything from the wiki pages I skimmed, here are some bullet points:
             </p>
             <p>
              I gather that if you could protect against or medicate for damaged pineal tissue, the net result would be fertility into old age, well beyond the normal.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is also some preliminary research suggesting FSH could be valuable in treating solid tumors, through vascularization.
             </p>
             <p>
              Extreme levels of FSH have been linked to female infertility.

               Peter Thiel invested in a startup company that sells young blood for that exact purpose:

               :
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Given Thiel’s obsession with warding off death, it comes as no surprise that the Silicon Valley billionaire is interested in at least one radical way of doing it: injecting himself with a young person’s blood. On Monday, Jeff Bercovici of Inc. magazine published part of a year-old interview with Thiel, in which the venture-capitalist explains that he’s interested in parabiosis, which includes the practice of getting transfusions of blood from a younger person, as a means of improving health and potentially reversing aging.
               </p>

               He says:

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                “I'm looking into parabiosis stuff, which I think is really interesting. This is where they did the young blood into older mice and they found that had a massive rejuvenating effect,” he said. “And so that’s . . . that is one that . . . again, it’s one of these very odd things where people had done these studies in the 1950s and then it got dropped altogether. I think there are a lot of these things that have been strangely under-explored.”

               I remember during the campaign Alex Jones had speculated that's how Hillary Clinton endured the debates despite her grave health problems.

                Well, I'd argue they're illegal because pharma companies sent lobbyists to DC after they realized that certain chemicals like these cure a wide range of mental disorders, which completely undercuts their trillion dollar model of pushing pills that cause the problems they promise to treat.

                I suppose it could be either one though.

                  That is a really interesting question right there... To bad about HIPAA and all that, medical records are nigh impossible to research. We would have to look for public statements made by the parents, which would probably be rare.

                   I wonder if the MaCann parents would talk.

                   Police theories pre-meditated abduction. Seems to me this maybe supporting to our theory. Because if that is the case, they maybe selecting these, or at least some of these victims before birth. If it is related to some sort of ritual satanism or bio research.

                  <p>
                   If you look at the police sketches in this first news article, do any of them, apart from the Podesta brothers, look like any of the pizza/ping pong dudes?

                    If so, that would suggest that someone inside of one of these fertility clinics might be leaking the source of the male genetics in these pregnancies... If we can find another solid lead like the McCann IVF case, it might be enough context to narrow the companies involved down to just one or two. From there we could dig up employment records, and easily cross reference names with a basic google search. Find a connection there it would be circumstantial evidence, but it would still be a damn solid addition to the collection.

                   <p>
                    I haven't been following the investigation the past few days, is anyone else digging around on this lead yet?

                     It has happened before where there was convictions or at least malpractice suits against doctors providing the sperm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Though, in this case, I think it is a much larger scale and has more to do with blood and organ harvesting than pedophilia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     For example: George Soros is getting older as we all do, if he wants future organ transplants with matching blood type and even supporting DNA, he would supply the sperm for the clinic, they would perform the IVF and after a few years, abduct the child, use it, abuse it, make some extra $$ and gain some more blackmale power and when the child is mature enough and you want to upgrade an organ before it gets too bad. Bam! You got already.

                      Sounds more and more like there are 2 or 3 classes of child traffickers involved with this stuff. Medical (organ/blood transplant) motivations, sexual motivations, and a 3rd group more concerned with trading these kids for money (or what they view as power, via occult ritual).

                  The aesthetic appearance of hands usually reflects care (manicures, lotions, avoiding sun, hot water and harsh chemicals, etc.).  Surely you guys have heard of "wash-woman hands?"  "Ladies of prestige" have historically have had young-looking, soft, "delicate" hands because they don't do any kind of manual labor (including housework and laundry).

            Was having the same thought in regards to McCann. Cat-eye (or sometimes referred to as snake-in-the-eye) is a very rare anomaly, and these people might find certain significance in these children. Probably to be groomed for some particular purpose.

            this makes sense to me
after 20 years
during the war in Yugoslavia in the 90's
every other person had this kind of eyes
it looked like as if people had two or more pupils

            I was going to post exactly the same thing. Now i see those 3 kids are really the same kid. Can we conclude now that Alefantis is related to a kid with Coloboma? The same defect that had mccan and that has soros?
           </p>
           <p>
            Can something like this be a coincidence nowing the allegations?

             Alefantis claimed in a recent news report where he is complaining about being a victim, that he is the godfather of that kids.  So not related, but connected of course, if we take him at his word.  Wonder why the whole family got themselves away to Oregon, about as far away from DC as possible I'd say.

             Maybe Soros donates jizz to fertility clinics and has fathered thousands of coloboma kids as part of some genetic experiment.

             Yes, my very first though was cloning but I can't tell if abnormality is an exact replica.

            <p>
             Edit: It is not an exact replica. Ignore my comments on cloning.

             That eye anomaly has an incidence of less than 0.0001%, the fact that three separate people have it and have cropped up in this investigation therefore seems very unlikely to be coincidental, right?

              That's because with my scientific background I try to make people aware, what they have to do, that information can be accepted for further investigation. Uploading pics without naming the source in the best case is idiotic, in the worse it is sabotage, to make good info look bad.

               It is possible to provide constructive feedback without causing a commotion, and it would benefit and facilitate the communication between everyone here if that were adhered to. There's absolutely no reason to be barking at each other and trying to sound smart when our goal is to be cooperating.

                I told him in the previous thread about this topic already. My friendly pleas have been ignored.
The lead to medical research is to precious, as that it can be allowed to be discredited by uploading pics no rationale person will accept!

               <p>
                The best arguments can easily be discredited, just by presenting them in an inapproriate way.
And that's what uploading photos or videos without naming a verifiable source does.
Bravo.

               You are absolutely correct. If it something is presented as evidence, it MUST be sourced. Photo shop can do wonders. I am not saying these pics are photoshopped...but we need original source links.

              There's definately something there, just not as pronounced as Madeleine's. (or it could be a reflection?)

              According to both coloboma links, the frequency is not 1% or 2% but 1 in 10,000. That is 1% of 1%. All these children having coloboma by random chance is extremely unlikely. Three babies picked at random all having coloboma has the likelihood of 1/10^12 or 1 in a trillion. But Soros and Madeleine McCann have the condition too, which makes the situation even more unlikely and significant.

               Glad about a rationale voice!
Sadly there are only very few who apply rationality while the vast majority is just instinct driven.
For example take your factual comment, which is important to understand that it's almost impossible to have only coincidences: buried below David Icke fact free religious followers...

               Two sordid possibilities comes to mind. One is to use the stolen babies with the genetic defect to breed a new race that is visibly distinguishable from the rest of the population. These children's children being raised to be the elite of the elite. Groomed from birth like kings of old.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other is for sacrifice. The more precious the sacrifice, the pleasing it is to Moloch. To offer a goat or lamb is the bare minimum. A stolen child or vagabond is better. To sacrifice your own child is better still. To offer your most beloved child is even more pleasing. To offer to Moloch someone so rare as you must search the earth with great diligence? That makes Moloch most pleased. Lest not forget. Much of the lesson is not just in the sacrifice and ritual, but also in the preparations leading up to it's culmination. More lessons are learned through offering the unobtainable than through offering some low hanging fruit. Years of preparations. Years of planning and scheming. All culminate in the deathly screams of the sacrifice as they are carved up for Moloch's plate.

                 Cannibalizing children falls under Moloch (by whatever name) worship. Eating people or specific human organs, or specific parts of specific organ at specific times and under specific conditions... that is as old as mankind. It really is just Moloch worship. There is no elixir of youth, though it has been pondered on for thousands of years.

                 You REALLY want to know why the elite look so young? It comes from a life of privilege. I grew up in the elite. Not world level elite, but like local rich. Local elite. The secret is good health care. Good mental health maintenance. Good nutrition. Never being exposed to the plethora of pathogens that innocuously plague the masses. One in three Americans have had a prolonged infestation of intestinal parasites. That is just one tiny cut of thousands that shorten the lives of the masses. The great security the elite have in their homes, careers, health etc do not wreck a toll on them like on the masses. And then on top of that, you have plastic surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But hey, think it is some secret mojo if that gets your knickers knocking. The reality is they do not have the stressors that are killing common Americans. It is the product of their better environment. That is why I passed for 20 in my late 30s. That is why I am mid 40s and have no gray hair or even a wrinkle. AT the other extreme, look at how old homeless people look.  Look at how meth addicts can age a decade in months.

                     Yes, yes I am. That's nice. It isn't why the elite look so young. I never claimed people don't do such things. I am claiming it isn't something that ubiquitous among the elite. The things I mention are though.

                    <p>
                     The masses are chattel for the elite to exploit. Whether that exploitation is for money, pedophilia, torture, exotic foods, prostitutes, exotic spas using plasma and serous fluid, leaded water, hunting down people as the ultimate game... it is all about exploitation of the masses. These children are not taken JUST for fluids, organs, perverted things, rituals, food, or any other particular niche. You are looking at one tree in a forest. Look around, the trees are countless.
