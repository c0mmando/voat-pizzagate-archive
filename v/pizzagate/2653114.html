<p>GUA MUSTANG, Malaysia — Norazila and Ayu were best friends and they shared everything that girls do: sleepovers, selfies, musings about cute boys.</p>
<p>But their friendship, which had blossomed in their placid hamlet in northern Malaysia, was destroyed late last month when Norazila, 14, discovered that Ayu, 11, had secretly become her father’s third wife.</p>
<p>“My best friend is my stepmother now,” said Norazila, whose family name is Che Abdul Karim, as she scrolled through her Facebook page filled with posts of the girls posing with adolescent pouts and fingers forming peace signs. “It doesn’t make any sense.”</p>
<p>Ayu’s marriage to Che Abdul Karim Che Abdul Hamid, a 41-year-old rubber trader with a prominent role at his mosque and a fleet of fancy cars, has reignited debate in Malaysia about the persistence of conservative Islamic traditions in this modern, multiethnic democracy.</p>
<p>But an effort to outlaw underage unions for all Malaysians amid the toughening of child sex crime legislation failed in Parliament. Arguing against the ban, Shabudin Yahaya, a legislator from what was then the governing party, said that a girl as young as 9 could be ready for marriage if she had gone through puberty.</p>
<p>“Their body is already akin to them being 18 years old,” Mr. Shabudin, a former Shariah court judge, said in a parliamentary session. “So physically and spiritually, it is not a barrier for the girl to marry.”</p>
<p>Many child marriages in Malaysia are informal pairings that are not legally recognized by any court. But couples who do try to register their marriages find little resistance. A study by the Malaysia office of Unicef found that of 2,143 child marriage applications made to Shariah courts in seven Malaysian states from 2012 to 2016, 10 were refused.</p>
<p>In some instances, girls have ended up married to men charged with raping them. In 2015, a man from the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak was charged with the statutory rape of a 14-year-old girl. But the case was dropped after he married her with permission from a Shariah court. Marital rape is not a crime in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Mohamad Amar Nik Abdullah, Kelantan’s deputy chief minister and vice president of the Malaysian Islamic Party, stressed that child marriage was legal in Islam and said the country had more pressing social issues to address.</p>
<p>Liberal Malays have questioned whether child marriage is truly an Islamic tradition or simply an outdated cultural practice. They have challenged the notion that the Prophet Muhammad married one of his wives when she was 6, saying that she was, in fact, much older.</p>
<p>“We cannot use a historical error about the Prophet Muhammad to condone child marriage,” said Ms. Latheefa, the human rights lawyer. “That’s sickening.”</p>
<p>This month, Malaysia’s Islamic affairs minister, Mujahid Yusof Rawa, said that his ministry had begun efforts to prohibit child marriage for Muslims, even as he cautioned that putting such a ban into effect would take time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Che Abdul Karim’s first two wives have banded together.   “We have said to him, it is us or that girl,” said Siti Noor Azila, Mr. Che Abdul Karim’s second wife. “We said, you choose. You cannot have all three of us.”</p>
<p>Malaysia follows general Islamic custom by allowing Muslim men up to four wives.</p>
<p>Ms. Siti Noor said her husband never gave her enough money to care for their four children, including one with spina bifida. She works as a baker to pay her bills.</p>
<p>“He is so stingy with us, but he has enough money to get married to Ayu and take her on holiday,” Ms. Siti Noor said, referring to a trip to a hill retreat that Mr. Che Abdul Karim posted about on social media. Ayu, she said, was the only one of the wives allowed to ride in their husband’s Mazda sports car.</p>
<p>“Their father never takes care of them,” she said. “He doesn’t even like children.”</p>
<p>Ms. Siti Noor corrected herself. “Except one,” she said. “That Ayu.”</p>
<p>We know that Pedophilia and Child Sex Trafficking runs rampant in Malaysia. Let\'s hope this fight movies in the right direction.</p>',

             I think most of those that are older believe in such archaic beliefs. Younger ones are quite different if they come from larger cities.  The countries that are pure Muslim those are the problems. There is no other influence there.  Plus we have the elite cabal trying to push the beliefs as well.  Not good.

               Someone on here said that he lives in a suburb outside of Chicago.  Far enough from me, but when someone is that full of hate and anger no amount of distance is too far..  That person said they would dox him if he makes a direct threat to someone  I think he has toned it down, but it's still inside.  We put our lives on the line everyday on here really.  We have no idea what can be accessed by those we are trying to out and hopefully lock up.

                Good to know! Yes, it was awhile ago he was saying that so you're right about him calming down. Either way he's a stick person and should stay away from all children!

                    Did you see my comment about his ex wife's movie "lollilove"? I stumbled upon that recently. He has an uncredited part in the movie even though from the synopsis it looks like he has a fairly substantial part. I haven't seen it, but the name caught my attention.

                     Yes I saw your comment.  He is a strange one and his personality did not just happen overnight.  There has to be some sketchy stuff in there.  It would go over a normie's head for sure.

             Yes!  That guy has either brainwashed himself into believing he has the right to a 9 yr old or he is an old one that has followed the radical Muslim teachings. I think when people have those inclinations, they will believe anything that meets their needs.

             Look at this one.  OMG. This seems to be increasing across the globe not only in India

             As someone says in the article, the next step is a human.  I think these possessed perverts will grab anything near them.  Lord help Our Children and Our Animals.

                I know. It makes me so sad to read these things. Just like things that are written about here showing how children are abused.  Heart breaking. People that do this do not deserve to exist in society or anywhere.

                 I don't know how we do it day after day.  It is so disheartening.  No they do not deserve to breath in our air for one more moment.  I guess it would be wrong to pray for their demise.  Wording may need to be changed on that one.

                  We all want to see this abuse of children stopped. It is difficult to read or research. I am so sick of PG still being described as a conspiracy theory about Hillary running a pedophile ring in a basement of a pizza place. I just wish this sub could get the credit it deserves. This site has uncovered more than journalists ever could.

                   Exactamundo.  We are the new journalists now.  The others are tainted and have been bought for decades.  You have my permission to crow loudly.   Yes, I too just saw the same running story too.  Hillary CPP Shooting, etc.  People are so dumb.

                    (They Live) in their echo chamber. That movie has so much meaning now. It's just unbelievable how people are so willing to believe everything that is being fed to them without questioning it. I have seen many blame the boomers for this. Thing is the internet wasn't around for boomers for many years.  Everyone has the ability now to do their own research.

                      Exactly. I find myself going to original sources (local news) on many articles I read. The best information can be found there. Alternative sites can be a good source too if you know which ones are trust worthy. Many are disinfo and just there for the clicks.

                       The best way I also think is to compare stories.  Checks and balances.  And yes, I too check my local news.  Actually more than one site and the papers.  Backup.

                        Comparing is an excellent way of doing it. I check the local news of where ever the story originates from. The local news stations are not tampered with as much as a MSM article would be.  Although, I imagine it can occur locally too if they have players being paid off not to report or distort portions of a story.

                         Yes, small towns can sometimes be pretty compromised as well.  But they usually do not have a local station.  Can you imagine what comes over the waves in Racine?  Yes, I guess it depends on where you live really.

                           Agreed. We have done a good job of red pilling many but I believe they are stepping up their game exponentially. They panicked I believe because of all the memes etc. and now are going forward with this huge push of normalization and sexualizing Our Children by the arts and entertainment communities.  We have much work ahead of us.

            But an effort to outlaw underage unions for all Malaysians amid the toughening of child sex crime legislation failed in Parliament. Arguing against the ban, Shabudin Yahaya, a legislator from what was then the governing party, said that a girl as young as 9 could be ready for marriage if she had gone through puberty.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Their body is already akin to them being 18 years old,” Mr. Shabudin, a former Shariah court judge, said in a parliamentary session. “So physically and spiritually, it is not a barrier for the girl to marry.”
           </p>
           <p>
            9 is Akin to Being 18?  That's half the age.  Its called Grooming of one's self.  Time for a Big Change.
