            I have been reading up and following and I haven't finished this thread yet but I will. I never post but here goes..... I have been researching the whole pizzagate thing for many years now before it was known as pizzagate. To make a long story short, I became suspicious of the FLDS when they were busted several years ago for abusing their children/marrying the girls as young as 12 to pedophiles. They made the news and over 400 children were removed and placed into care from their sprawling 1,700 acre Yearning For Zion ranch in Eldorado, Texas.

           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone remember? The women and little girls wore 19th century style prairie dresses and hairdos seemingly color coded in some strange way. The women and mothers took to mainstream television pleading for the return of their children very timidly and eerily in a robotic manner as if severely brainwashed. They all sounded exactly the same pleading for the return of their children and refused to answer any questions. The men or husbands rather, were never seen. Mind you many women have escaped before and after this even and have since were interviewed many times with their stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            Children were reportedly found often with broken bones and young girls as young as age 8 were being secretly married to older men. Reading up on survivors of MKUltra and SRA they usually mention one of many sources perpetrators get their baby 'sacrifices' are from 'breeders', women held in captivity who give birth just for this sole purpose. The FLDS would be perfect candidates for this. Why? Because this particular group YFZ are in the middle of nowhere. If anyone tried to escape it would be such a challenge since they are literally miles from nowhere for one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another strange thing often mentioned associated with the FLDS is the 'Lost Boys' where male children are sent away and made homeless because the older men look at them as competition when obtaining multiple wives, but I am not buying that story. Where are all those men today speaking about being involved with the FLDS and sent off? Like I mentioned before, there are many young women and girls who have left and spoke out. I have a strong feeling the 'boys' are sold off for sex slavery or sacrificed. I hope I am wrong about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Warren Jeffs was and still is the leader or 'prophet' of this cult and has been jailed for sexual abuse of minor children of YFZ ranch. Apparently, another man by the name of Winston Blackmore with his 27 wives split off to another FLDS community in Bountiful, BC because of Jeff's conviction. Interesting the name Bountiful same as in Utah (bountiful as in procreating?). Anyway, have a gander at this interview.

            </a>
            Skip to 26:30 for the juicy part where the interviewer asks a surprise question of his involvement with trafficking children and he acts completely weird and guilty
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe their is much more than meets the eye with the FLDS. I just wanted to share my two coppers on the matter since it has been discussed here. I also think that the Turpins couple in California may have been using their daughters as breeders and maybe that is where they received funding all those years. Don't be surprised if they discover that some of those girls gave birth before. Hope that isn't the case though.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently a wife that was married to Warren Jeffs is still missing.

            I was raised mormon till i was 17 years old. NOT fundamentalist, but just regular ol' LDS. Like a commenter before, I don't want to stop you from investigating, but I think there are bigger leads to pursue. The church is not systemically raping its children..at least not in the Stake that i was a part of.

             Does the Mormon Church Conceal Child Sexual Abuse and Give Sanctuary to Known Sexual Predators? Franklyn Richard Curtis – High Priest, Primary Teacher, Blazer Leader, Home Teacher and for fifteen years known to the First Presidency to be a Predatory Child Molester. Curtis sexually abused dozens of Mormon children in five states. Yet he represents just the ‘Tip of the Iceberg.’ Curtis was undoubtedly a sick individual. But what can you say about an organization that covered up for his crimes over and over for eighteen years?   Parents  Beware! This Church’s Policies and Practices Make it a Haven for Child Molesters

              I can't remember the details as it was some time back.  She married a friends son and we didn't have much contact after that.  It might have even had something to do with her father.  What sticks with me is how emotionally messed up she seemed by it.  She was sick a lot and died young.

            Do I think they are associated with the elite? No. But at this rate what messed up group isn't associated with pizzagate? Personally, I think there are bigger leads out there but if you would like to investigate by all means don't let me stop you.
