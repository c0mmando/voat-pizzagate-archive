<p>Isabel Hayes</p>
<p>April 16 2018 3:54 PM</p>
<p>A RETIRED senior civil servant in the Department of Health and Children, who was caught in possession of nearly 60,000 child pornography images and videos, has avoided jail.</p>
<p><strong>Brendan Phelan (66) was today given a suspended three-year sentence</strong> in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court <strong>after he pleaded guilty to one count of possessing child pornography</strong> at his home on March 26, 2013.</p>
<p>Phelan, with an address in Merrion Grove, Stillorgan Road, Blackrock, Co Dublin, admitted to gardaí that he had a “fair bit” of child pornography relating to young boys when his home was raided five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>He is a retired principal officer with the Department of Health and Children</strong>, the court heard.</p>
<p>Most of the images and clips were “naturist”, the court heard, but others showed <strong>pre-pubescent boys engaged in sexual behaviour</strong>.</p>
<p>Sentencing Phelan, <strong>Judge Martin Nolan noted that there was an “unfortunate delay” in bringing the case to court</strong> due to a lack of resources within the garda unit. As a result, Phelan was only charged last year.</p>
<p>Since his home was raided in 2013, he has attended counselling and rehabilitated himself, with a report handed into court showing he is at a low risk of re-offending.</p>
<p><strong>Handing down the suspended sentence, Judge Nolan said the conviction would bring shame on Phelan and his family. He noted he would be on the sex offenders register.</strong></p>
<p>The judge took into account a number of mitigating factors, including the nature of the images - the majority of which were placed in the lowest category of seriousness by gardaí - his cooperation and the fact that Phelan did not produce or distribute the material elsewhere.</p>
<p>Garda Peter Woods told Eoin Lawlor BL, prosecuting, that gardaí received a <strong>tip-off from Canadian officials</strong> in relation to clients who had bought child porn from a website under their investigation.</p>
<p>As a result, gardaí raided Phelan\'s home in March 2013, where they seized his computer, a laptop and five external hard drives, among other equipment. A suitcase of DVDs found in Phelan\'s bedroom was also seized.</p>
<p>When the material was eventually examined four years later, gardaí discovered 58,585 child pornography images and 1,046 movies.</p>
<p><strong>The majority of these files were “naturist” and concentrated on young boys\' genitalia</strong>, Gda Woods said. <strong>Others were of a more serious nature.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phelan readily admitted to gardaí that he had started looking at child pornography “a long time ago”.</strong></p>
<p>He has no previous convictions.</p>
<p>Defence counsel, Philipp Rahn BL, said his client referred himself to psychological services in the aftermath of the garda raid. He has now rehabilitated.</p>
<p>Mr Rahn said his client, who is originally from a large family in Waterford, went to university and had a good career. He said Phelan does not appear to have had any romantic or sexual relationships throughout his life.</p>
<p>Phelan is extremely remorseful for his behaviour. He used the images only for himself and did not produce any or send them on to anyone else, defence counsel added.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>So the case was &quot;delayed&quot; (slow-walked?), and JUDGE MARTIN NOLAN decided that SHAME and being a registered sex offender was punishment enough.</strong></p>',
