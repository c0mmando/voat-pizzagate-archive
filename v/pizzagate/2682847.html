<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Victim of organized pedophilia at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England seeks treatment years after Satanist abuse. The hospital was where Jimmy Savile committed many of his abuses.</li>
<li>One of these \'Stoke Mandeville\' pedophiles, Michael Salmon, turns out to be friends with banking heiress and scientist Miriam Rothschild, so much so that she wrote a preface for his book after he was convicted. </li>
<li>Salmon helps run Dreamflight program out of hospital, a charity that ships hundreds of disabled children to amusement parks around the world. Jimmy Savile, Rolf Harris involved. Jill Dando, royalty photographed at events. </li>
<li>Victim, at only 14 years old, gets taken in by Tavistock Clinic for extended studies</li>
<li>Victim (Kim Noble) exhibits symptoms of Monarch mind control in her paintings, as well as dissociative identity disorder. Her identity splitting is so strong that, even as a non-artist, she manages to paint in 13 different artistic styles. Tavistock tries to cover up the doctor\'s work. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, pedophile and Miriam Rothschild collaborate on &quot;art brut&quot; and butterfly collection at Rothschild estate. Art Brut\'s headquarters are at The Chateau Beaulieu in Lausanne, Switzerland, which was actually once a seat of the Illuminati in Switzerland, as well as museum in Baltimore with ties to Transformer Gallery in Washington, DC. </li>
<li>Tavistock is the world\'s best knowledge source for Dissociative Identity Disorder at this point.</li>
<li>Through ties to sister organization called The Wellcome Trust, <strong>key funding source for mental health research at clinic turns out to be...Miriam Rothschild.</strong></li>
<li>Art Brut expert <strong>Micheline Klagsbrun, a Tavistock-educated psychiatrist who studied the art therapy practices of Tavistock at Tavistock, runs the CrossCurrents foundation, one of the primary funders of the Transformer Gallery in Washington DC, run by local restaurateur James Alefantis.</strong> <a href="http://www.transformerdc.org/documents/tg-auctCAT15F3.pdf">She is on the board of the gallery</a>.</li>
<li>Tavistock is linked to both Stoke Mandeville and the Comet Ping Pong ring, on top of other links to Anglo-Amerian establishments through Folger, Sackler families.</li>
</ul>
<p>Miriam Rothschild, noted entomologist, apparent World War II Hero and heir to the British wing of the Rothschild family, worked closely with Michael Salmon, a doctor from Stoke Mandeville hospital who was convicted of child abuse on multiple occasions. To be more specific, Miriam penned an introduction for a book called <a href="https://pictures.abebooks.com/MWBOOKS1/3831167585.jpg">The Aurelian Legacy</a>, written by Salmon over a decade after his conviction, a book about the history of butterfly catching in England. Further investigation into the matter reveals that Miriam Rothschild, now deceased, was a central figure in (1) Britain\'s shadowy Tavistock program, (2) The OSS (CIA precursor) as well as (3) The Stoke Mandeville VIP set (ie Tony Blair, Thatcher cabinet ministers, Savile). Per the Hemel Hempstead Gazette: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pervert Michael Salmon, who was once praised by Princess Diana for his charity work with sick children, reinvented himself as a butterfly expert when he was released from prison after serving time for sexually abusing girls as young as 12 years. The former doctor published The Aurelian Legacy in 2001, described as a \'fascinating account of the men and women who have made valuable contributions to our knowledge of British butterflies\'.</p>
<p>Blurbs describe Salmon, now aged 80 years, as an \'amateur lepidopterist\' with a \'passion\' for butterflies, saying: &quot;Although Michael Salmon trained and practised as a doctor and is the author of two medical textbooks, his passion from the age of eleven has been butterflies.&quot; <strong>His long-standing interest in wildlife even saw Salmon travel to Zambia in September 1984 with the BBC Natural History Unit.</strong> A younger Salmon had focussed on a career in medicine, first coming to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, the site of many of the allegations made against him, in 1961, for a paediatric secondment, lasting six months. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same article details that Salmon did not know Jimmy Saville, yet this ridiculous assertion has been proven false by the appearance of his son on Jim\'ll Fix-it. </p>
<p><strong>On top of these three key links, the museum collection where pedophile Michael Salmon worked contained one of the world\'s largest collections of Art Brut, a type of &quot;trauma art&quot; that Tony Podesta and James Alefantis are collectors and patrons of. In short, the Rothschild\'s owned one of the largest collections of trauma art in the world, some of it highly-suggestive of Monarch programming.</strong></p>
<p>Miriam Rothschild was not as famous as some of her other family members, but she gained a reputation as one of the world experts on the flea. But even as a rich girl living on her father\'s estate in rural England, she experienced major moments of history first-hand, including the signing of the Balfour Declaration. She was also recruited as a codebreaker for the Allies during World War II, and was apparently one of the people who helped Alan Turing crack german submarine codes and turn the war effort around. Of course, <strong>whenever the Rothschild\'s insert themselves into history, you always need to take things with a grain of salt, because it actually shows that not one but two Rothschild\'s were employed by the OSS (the CIA precursor) <strong>during World War II. Not only that, but her husband, George Lanyi, held private, high-level negotiations with Rommel</strong> and helped send hundreds of orphaned Jewish children to their own estate</strong>, where they would live under the auspices of a makeshift Air Force base on their property. One thing you don\'t learn about World War II is that the Rothschild\'s had their own airbase.</p>
<p>All these details are important for one big reason: <strong>The development of the OSS was actually done for the most part by the Tavistock Clinic and its charitable affiliates at University College London, and confirms that the CIA and Tavistock are not disparate parts of an international conspiracy, but generally run by the same group of people. In short,  this network extends to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, and by extension to the politically-connected pedophile rings of Washington DC.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now, I want to reiterate that Savile\'s abuse at Stoke Mandeville included serialized ritual abuse, including the inducement of dissociative identity disorder within children. This is important because it has served as a helpful marker for identifying the global pedophile ring as distinct from isolated celebrity abuses. Dreamflight, the charity that chartered flights to Disneyworld for disabled children, was one of the programs run by Salmon, where he took sick Stoke Mandeville children to Disney World. The star-studded launch event included others who would later be identified as possible child abusers, including Cliff Richard. Jill Dando was also there. Not beyond the realm of speculation to think that she knew about all of this going on.</strong></p>
<p>So after the war, when Miriam Rothschild continued her career in entomology, she continued to work in the shadows of the Tavistock clinic for a group called the Wellcome Trust. Painstaking investigation suggests that an international occult group with ties to the DC pedophile ring is linked to this organization, which was at once the largest nonprofit in the world, and has been the recipient of Rothschild/Rockefeller support for decades. <strong>These details are the basis for providing a model for a global ring run quietly by major aristocratic figures within nonprofit institutions, but they also help us understand why the Stoke Mandeville scandal is far bigger than just Jimmy Savile.</strong></p>',

            Excellent! I'm gonna have to repost this on another subverse, this needs to be read. I have known about Tavistock and their connections to Monarch for close to 2 decades. Back then people thought you were crazy and you would get permabanned from forums just for mentioning their names. I"m gonna keep an eye on your blog. I would also suggest checking out Aangirfan. He's hit and miss, but when it's a hit, it's out of the park. Nobody was covering the Roy Cohn/Donald Trump connection many moons ago like he was., and he did a superb job on the Marc Dutroix/ Saville cases.

            Upvote for a brilliant thread.  Art Brut is all the rage with the elite, and it comes from the top down.  Go to Monaco, Monte Carlo and look at the fashionable art at the moment--it revolves around monarch butterflies, children, occult symbolism, allusions to MKUltra and violence against children.  Galleries in San Tropez selling works (some hundreds of thousands of dollars) by some of the most famous artists like Banksy feature the pedo swirls, satan's single eye and illuminati symbols. Most of it is ugly and gross.  Ugly is in vogue.

            Great post.. The global pedo investigation is moving up the ladder from local cops and teachers to the real elite and is now buzzing heads of state.

            Trumps executive orders are equally international. Any nexus with USA provides jurisdiction and freezing of assests can take place anywhere in the world that the US govt can lawfully reach.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully we start seeing some action on those 45,000 sealed indictments after the mid-term elections. ( The 45,000 sealed orders are not just indictments from what Im reading but include indictments, arrest warrants, search warrants and asset seizure warrants.)

I said “Hey listen albino, this ain't 1972
So stub out your King Edward and get that small boy off your knee, melt down your finger ware and get yourself off my TV”

            a number of elite families are heavily into Tavistock. Alexander or Alex Von Furstenberg even put links to it on his social media then quickly removed it after it was talked about on MSM. Also remember that these families do this to their own kids who knows where that goes. Also, Switzerland is the home of the Illuminati and is the base of all things occult and evil. They hide under the guise of being a neutral country but they are anything but, they hide in plain sight.

              There was an apparent friendship between them. Some have suggested she was killed because she had found out about a paedophile network and wanted to expose.

            The pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome is British and associated with Tavisstock.

             Wikipedia states the pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome is out of GB, but also has HQ in the piedmont of NC.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is close to Ft Bragg, known for MKUltra programming, Duke University and hospital, also mentioned. and close to 3 large state mental institutions. Have read that Comet Ping Pong had two doors one with Well and the other Come written on them.

             A FEW QUOTES:
"The project was given to Lords Rothmere and Northcliffe and their mandate was to produce an organization capable of manipulating public opinion and directing that manufactured opinion down the desired pathway to support for a declaration of war by Great Britain against Germany.
Funding was provided by the British royal family, and later by the Rothschilds to whom Lord Northcliffe was related through marriage. Arnold Toynbee was selected as Director of Future Studies. Two Americans, Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays were appointed to handle the manipulation of American public opinion in preparation for the entry of the United States into WWI, and to brief and direct President Woodrow Wilson."
            </p>
            <p>
             "From a somewhat crude beginning at Wellington House, grew an organization that was to shape the destiny of Germany, Britain and more especially the United States in manner that became a highly sophisticated organization to manipulate and create public opinion, what is commonly termed, "mass brainwashing.""
            </p>
            <p>
             "Previously, Wellington House board members Rothmere, Northcliffe, Lippmann, and Bernays had read and proposed as a guide the writings of Correa Moylan Walsh, in particular, the book The Climax of Civilization (1917) as corresponding closely to conditions that had to be created before a New World Order in a One World Government could be ushered in."

             Regarding your full article and back-history of Madame de Stael's Paris Salon....
            </p>
            <p>
             OMG! SEPTIMA SEXTA'S BROTHER, JOHN IZARD MIDDLETON, WAS A MEMBER OF Madame de Stael's inner circle called Groupe de Coppett. Septima and John's father was Arthur Middleton, South Carolina's Signer of the Declaration of Independence.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Archaeologist, Author and Artist. He was the son of Arthur Middleton a signer of the Declaration of Independence and was educated at Cambridge, England the same school as his father. Middleton's water color painting of the "Roman Remains" painted about 1825 sold at auction in 2009 for a new world record price of $100,800.00 for a watercolor painting. His work as an archaeologist on the Grecian Remains in Italy and other locations was the first contribution made by an American to the knowledge of classical antiquity. He was the husband of Eliza Augusta de Palazieux Falconet (from Italy) who died in Europe in 1832 and was buried there."
             <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/John-Izard-Middleton/6000000003040912659">

             </a>
             The Middleton's were major slave holders during this period. They ran huge rice plantations and exported to England. It is believed that Sir Thomas Myddelton, Elizabethan merchant and investor in the first English East India Company, was their ancestor. He wrote the first pamphlet  on Mercantilism.

             "The Groupe de Coppet is possibly the most influential network of writers, philosophers, politicians, scientists and artists in the early 19th century - centered around Madame de Staël and Benjamin Constant. This project aims to trace all the visitors to the Château de Coppet and thus the people that were directly within the group's sphere of influence. An estimated 600 people came to Coppet for a short or longer stay, in the 1803-1817 timeframe (from Mme. de Staël's exile from Paris til her death). Stendhal called this informal group the "states-general of European opinion" (états généraux de l’opinion européenne)."

               A bit of a crap source, but here's more info to go with, this time related to the DuPont family:
              </a>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Pierre Samuel DuPont’s mother dies when he is 16. Pierre no longer had a parent in the family who could understand him, and after getting one of his frequent beatings from his father, he ran away, and was spared near starvation by his Uncle Pierre de Monchantin. Initially, Pierre was a watchmaker. But within a short time he attracted the attention of several top Illuminati for his ability to write good tracts, and articles that advocated various economic and political views that they wanted promoted. Pierre Joined the Freemasons, and at some point was illuminized, as most of the French lodges became. Although Pierre went through severe financial difficulties after the French Revolution, he regularly made payments to Masonic organizations in France. Besides being friends with all the famous Masons of the time, one Mason brother of his, worthy of note is the French astronomer Lalande, who helped hide him during the revolution.
              </p>
              <p>
               Someone very powerful protected Pierre Samuel during the French Revolution, this is hinted at by historian Pierre Jolly, although Jolly never gives his protector’s name. I believe he was protected because DuPont was part of the Inner Satanic hierarchy. He was also protected by the daughter of Swiss financier Jacques Necker. This daughter was Madame Germalne de Stael.
               <strong>
                The Madame was a close friend of Pierre Samuel and she operated a famous SALON/CATHOUSE.
               </strong>
               Madame de Stael was nothing less than an intimate friend of St. Simon. She shared his occult revolutionary ideas. Henri de St. Simon was a student and friend of Jacques Rigomer Bazin who was associated with the Inner circle of several occult based revolutionary groups during Pierre DuPont’s time in France.
               <strong>
                St. Simon was the author of The New Christianity which foreshadowed the creation of international communism.
               </strong>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Now how do we know the DuPont's, assets to the largest secret global revolution of all time, are a protected family? Well...

               I looked into it and did not find an immediate connection. However, her father's family ancestors were in the wool trade- the big industry in the past, and the main staple originally traded by the East India company. The early Middleton's were prolific in the 1600's and it is possible that Kate's family was part of the English branch. Thomas Myddelton was part Welsh and descended from the original Princes of Wales. An ancestor married into the English Middletons and the surname was adopted.It is spelled both "Middleton" and "Myddelton."

             The fact that Rolf Harris, Jimmy Savile and royals were involved in astounding. I'm starting to think they put the Jimmy Savile scandal into overdrive to hide the fact of a network being active within the hospitals/charities.

              I agree.  And I think they also emphasized Savile's perpetration of sexual abuse to hide his apparently powerful other roles --   in reading about him over the years, and "reading between" the lines including those below, I'm guessing Savile was also a handler of 'elites,' child trafficker, important high priest, intelligence operative, and a blackmailer.

            It is interesting that they are calling it a dream flight and using the rainbow colors on the jet. The rainbow colors are triggers for mind control victims and having them all on that jet is either symbolic or it's there to reinforce the programming. Think of all the creepy stuff we learned about the different trigger colors from Elsagate investigations.

            Shipping disabled children around the world, to amusement parks, yeah that's no big deal / not Pizzagatey at all. I imagine the Rothschilds must think those types of kids are easier to experiment on because no one will EVER believe them if they cry abuse and any symptoms they exhibit will be written off as a part of their diseases and disorders.

             Yes, exactly these opportunistic bastards won't prey on a rich person's child; they prey on the kids who have no one to defend them and fight for them--the kids for whom no one bats an eye when they disappear.  They choose their prey.

            Guys that would tie Jimmy Saville et al and Yewtree into that.

            Saville had the run of Stoke Mandeville. Literally. A set of keys and no supervision. This is well publicised fact.

             At one of the hospitals, kids were advised, if Jimmy comes around, pretend to be asleep.
            </p>
            <p>
             Saville said he preferred hospitals to nightclubs, since they were open 24 hours.

              Man the way Jimmy worked it wouldnt have mattered much if you were awake
              <em>
               or
              </em>
              asleep.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can actually remember my ex just like most of the rest of the country worshipped him
              <em>
               while i was living
              </em>
              in the UK. it was only just before i left all that shit went public. everyone loved 'Jim'll Fix It' from what ive told.
             </p>
             <p>
              thats the thing about pedos, the most dangerous ones are the charismatic as fucked ones. they dont need to hide, they charm people into disbelieving the victims or choose the kinds of kids no one will believe anyway...
