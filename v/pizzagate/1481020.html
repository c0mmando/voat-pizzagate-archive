            CIA is running the drug flow as well, am I right?
           </p>
           <p>
            On vigilance: it is encouraged, and practically anyone can do something, including gangsters and thugs. That does not mean I recommend street wars or any sort or violence. Given the right incentive, when word hits the street, I imagine repercussions follow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Problem is there is no proper incentive. Nobody gains anything from waltzing into places rounding everyone up It's probably a delay in their infrastructure which to them is a minor ditraction, and for the one taking the action it's a suicide mission.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am completely with you, I wish people to unite, work together, in all layers of society so that a silent faction can start using their eyes and ears, and be the resistance the covertly fascist regime asks for. For the children, they can not have peace. Why does anyone deserve to be in peace knowing what is going on?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there is a minor crisis that is bordering on war, a war on truth, a political war, a civil war, and potential world war. That must be avoided at all cost. The enemy, the ones that belong in lifelong isolation cells, they are never surrendering. They can't have a war either, since it would affect their territory. They have more power than we realize, and  lots of their options are so simple you don't even realize something happened. They might flee oversees.
           </p>

            Hitler did so too, and lived well into the 80's. The nazis were never defeated, they went covert.

             CIA, drugs, all of its there just look at Mena airport in the 80s. I completely understand I'm in no way hinting at taking things to a street level. This goes way beyond guys settling beefs over terrirtory and cash. When it comes to knowing peace, that concept has long since passed in my life just as I've had to see 29 friends be laid to rest. One that has haunted me to this day was the death of my friends son at a day care center. When we lowered the casket into the ground I'll never forget the sound of the roses that hit the top of that tiny coffin. Since then when I finally left the bullshit behind I've made it my life's mission to help others. Especially children who have been abused. I won't stop my research into this subject just like I documented every bit of information I could find in regards to the Franklin cover up. It is upsetting at times but I've been in some very evil places and I've survived. I know the evil that people are capable of very well; I've seen death I've seen a lot. I am in a state of limbo so to speak. Knowing the underworld like I do, I imagine it would be of some significance in this unfortunately the computer skills required are not in my tool box. That's something that I have said many times...the Nazis didn't lose the war they got a plane ticket from uncle Sam via Operation Paperclip.
