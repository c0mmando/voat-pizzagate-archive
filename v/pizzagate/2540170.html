            “Pope Francis’ embrace [of these victims] serves as an example for the Church as it confronts accusations of abuse of conscience, sexual abuse and any other abuse of power that may have occurred in our communities,” the conference said.
           </p>

            Embrace of these victims?  What a laugh.  He will make the sign of the cross over them and honor them for their courage.  He has nothing to worry about with the SOL being what they are.  I am hoping that they will be changed as is they outcry, but this has happened before.  Horrible things happen, the people cry out and beg and plead.  Words from the pope and then......nothing. Chile is a very Catholic country.  Will they accept this again?  I hope not.
