And I don\'t know if he mentioned <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> but I got the impression the FBI has been monitoring <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> because of the obvious hammering by Russian bots in support of pizzagate. Once again Comey doesn\'t appear concerned about CTR which has done even more than the Russian bots. In other words Comey isn\'t being consistent and that\'s not good. Here are the two options:</p>
<p>1) James Comey was asked by Trump to be a double agent. In other words to appear as if he was on the side of the CIA/Clinton Foundation all the while binding his time until he could strike.</p>
<p>2) James Comey was bought off long ago and is doing everything he can to appear objective but has no desire to bring the child rapist, organ harvesting, drun running perps in this cluster fuck to justice.</p>

<p>If 2) above is correct and Comey will continue to slow walk any investigation then the immediate question everyone in the U.S. should be asking themselves: how could the director of the FBI ignore blatant evidence of child trafficking, drug running, organ harvesting, money laundering and charity fraud.</p>
<p>Well I didn\'t want to &quot;go there&quot; but we now have to actually &quot;go there&quot;. As anyone here knows I am the first to attack anyone who tries to blame this cluster fuck on &quot;The Jews(tm)&quot;. I as a Christian don\'t want to be blamed for the sins of Georege H.W. Bush. Blaming entire religions is wrong. The problem are the various sects WITHIN a religion can drive off the rails. 2000 years ago in Judea it was the Jewish Zealots who fucked things up by thinking they could kick the Roman out by force. Today it\'s ISIS is currently doing a grave disservice to Islam. </p>
<p>Well within the vast and elaborate tent of Christianity there lurks a few sinister groups. One needs to get called out here because everything is pointing to it as a rational IF INDEED Comey is ignore the heinous crimes of the CIA and Clinton Foundation. You all know the group\'s name. And no doubt 99.9% of that group isn\'t completely innocent. But if Comey is guilty then it explains the 0.01% circle jerk going on between Andrew McCabe and James Comey at the FBI.</p>

<p>They\'re innocent until proven guilty but the following are INEXCUSABLE CRIMES:</p>
<p>1) Stealing poor throwaway children from Haiti to fuel international Brownstone Operations.</p>
<p>2) Stealing organs from poor black people and any ugly\'s from item 1) above.</p>

<p>Ephesians 6:10-18 New International Version (NIV)</p>
<p>The Armor of God</p>
<p>10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</p>
<p>18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.</p>',

            A great many Catholics are concerned about the current Pope, that is a fact. This is not the first time there have been two popes and it seemed like the world had irredeemably gone to shit. However, here's a little
            <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2015/06/napoleon-and-christianity/">
             anecdote
            </a>
            from a previous turn around the merry-go-round:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Napoleon bragged, “Your eminence, are you not aware that I have the power to destroy the Church?” The cardinal shot back: “Your majesty, we, the clergy, have done our best to destroy the church for the last 1,800 years. We have not succeeded, and neither will you.”
Indeed, Christians of all persuasions can be heartened that despite external persecution and its own internal sins and shortcomings, the Church has yet to meet its . . . Waterloo.
            </p>

            <p>
             That is a great point and it's very useful in disarming the CTR bigotry counter attack that would be thrown at criticizing the Catholic Church. There have been two popes before. And I bet you knew this already but the entire papacy has moved out of Rome on occasion:

            <p>
             Pope Francis was closely tied to Juan Peron and that ain't good:

            <p>
             Far from reforming the Catholic Church may have elected a full on Fascist as its leader. And that ain't good because the last one, Pope Benedict a.k.a. "Der Panzer Kardinal", had his own checkered past and problems distinguishing right from wrong.

            I too had hoped he was on the right side of the 16 layered chess game, but wasn't sure. Then, when I saw one of Webb's videos which detailed Comey's long and sordid history with the likes of HRC and pals. After that, I figured it was a Hail Mary to hope he was secretly one of the good guys. After God's wishes are carried out, we'll look back on Pizzagate/pedogate and realize it was the key to figuring out how messed up our planet has actually been, on so many levels, and for so long.

            Think of it in terms of Freemasonry.  They will cover for each other.  I am willing to bet that Comey is a Freemason, and he is covering for other Freemasons.

            What if these practices (and cover-ups) have less to do with religion than with secret oaths of Freemasonry? The broken Masonic "oath of silence" comes with a death penalty, according to this post on Reddit; featuring VIDEO of hand-signal threats to Comey during a hearing last summer.

              Not sure about Comey, but many high-level US leaders practice Freemasonry in secret -- there's a Lodge near the White House (connected by an underground tunnel)!  It makes sense that those at the top prefer working with death-oath-taking cronies who are more easily controlled.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's Newt Gingrich explaining how Trump being "uninitiated" is a big reason the establishment fears and reviles him:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgnAWY0RoeE">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgnAWY0RoeE
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Also: George HW Bush gave the Masonic throat-slitting gesture to Trump at a Presidential debate. Apparently Trump had been too vocal in his speculation about perpetrators of 911 (which, as many speculate, included the Bush Crime family):

             </p>
             <p>
              I'm inclined to agree with the original You-Tuber who suggested Comey might (at least in part) be bound by a fraternal death-oath of silence. Freemasons are fiercely bound to protect each other, but of course I have no way of proving that's what's going on here.

              I never claimed to be a wizard, but I have been researching this stuff for YEARS.  I have two books in the works on the Secret History of America so am considered "expert" in that area.

              It's not rocket science, either.  Just think.  If you want to control an opposing group, that is spread over several continents, back in time before TV, radio, etc. how would you do it?
             </p>
             <p>
              RELIGION. Religion IS mind control.  Control the religion, and you control all adherents of that religion.

               I know David Icke is shunned as the "Lizard Guy," especially here on Voat, but I'm reading The Biggest Secret and he does a great job of explaining what he believes are the real truths behind the creation of every religion. Like you said, it has everything to do with controlling the people. If he's right and we ever get full disclosure, there will be a shit ton of stunned people on this plant, for a whole long list of reasons-- even among the most diehard and dedicated pedogate investigators.

               That is great you are writing two books about this.  I am thinking they both heavily involve Freemasonry.

                Why are you trying to skirt the fact that I refuted all of your "points?"  Do you have no debate skills?  A concession would be nice.  (Prolly too much to ask of ignorami on here, though.)

                 What if I did have a time traveler? Or maybe had one or more? What if your research is flawed? Love to debate there will be no concession do not need nor want your approval. Challenge you to think you are not the only genius in the world but seem to be a smart one that needs to be right nonetheless.

                 Ha!  I knew it.  No class, so no concession of points.  In fact, it appears that "she" has abandoned the thread.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, as usual, NO refutation of ANY of my points.  That's because my points are all SOLID and the results of a LOT of historical research.

                   Now you specifically say "she" in quotes. Since there is more than one contributing on this account, but you seem to allegedly possess some secret knowledge by "she" Will ask the Mods to address you personally.

            JEWS created the Vatican.  (That is why EVERY single pope has been a bloodline JEW.)  The Vatican created Istam.

            Yes, they are different, but JEWS created both of them.  Christianity was created to mind-enslave the 'goyim" and also to conquer the WEST.

            Washington - Freemason, founder of Order of Cinncinnatus, called the "Reincarnation of Tammuz", best friend was Marquis de Lafayette, a PRACTICING OCCULTIST, stole MILLIONS of acres of U.S. land /
Jefferson - Illuminatus, has obelisk on grave, publicly defended Adam Weishaupt in letter /
