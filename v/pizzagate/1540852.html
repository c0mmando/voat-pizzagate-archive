<p>Having watched the video, begin it again and notice throughout some of the thinly veiled allusions to sexual impropriety at Comet Ping Pong.

<p>Notice the number of downvotes. Notice comments are disabled.<br />
Notice at 0:12 the two children playing ping pong next to &quot;cages,&quot; ostensibly supply storage.<br />
Notice at 0:17 the camera pans over &quot;Besta Pizza&quot; as the narrator draws our attention to nearby local businesses.<br />
Notice at 0:45 the distinctly <em>uncomfortable</em> interview with the employee.<br />
Notice at 0:58 the narrator appears before the camera in the ping pong area. In a harsh tone of voice she says the following, &quot;Behind me are one of the three tables that customers use for their enjoyment... <strong>But ping pong isn\'t the only thing people come here to love</strong>,&quot; finishing the sentence with a provocative gesture with the ping pong paddle. <br />
Notice at 1:11 the ping pong paddle symbols that have widely interpreted by pizzagate investigators as one of several well-known coded symbols.<br />
Notice the isolated quote from the manager at 1:38 about the trust that exists between him and his customers. That he looks out for them and &quot;in response, they look out for us.&quot; Is there any interpretation of that quote or his fidgety mannerisms while stating it that doesn\'t raise alarm bells in your head?<br />
Notice the final image at 1:58, where an unaccompanied adult man is playing ping pong with a toddler alone in the restaurant.

<p>I find the entire video to recapitulate many of the suspicions we have raised during the course of this investigation. I find it even more damning that the video was published an entire year before the Podesta Emails leaked. This implies that the reporter has her own sources for the allegations of impropriety at Comet Ping Pong.  
</p>
<p>Please don\'t do anything that could compromise the investigation, especially reaching out to her directly as a result of my post. This may violate so-called &quot;witch-hunting rules&quot; on doxing and so forth. Instead, we need a discussion and analysis of the video and ideas on what if anything to do next. Also, how do we archive it?</p>',

            that's no ordinary "Howard University student reporter", in fact several of us here believe it's none other than Patience Carter, THE Patience Carter of Pulse Nightclub fame, the buck reporter from PA / NYC / Orlando . and now, DC?... see this thread for full details:

           <p>
            Believe me, we have not yet begun to SCRATCH THE SURFACE if this is, in fact, Ms. "Patience Carter". Read the entire thread, I sat in an office less than 20' away from household names at a big 3-letter news agency... I can spot a buck reporter (but especially one that has trouble with her cues) from 50 paces, eyes closed... contrast and compare, and then we can get into some of the "deeper implications".

               she's a really bad actor. I recognized her by voice, not face - she's totes done up as Patience Carter (especially in the "hospital" video, Orlando), and totes done "down" everywhere else... check the shaved eyebrows if you don't believe me, it's her.

             I'm to believe Comet rotated art and went through other periods of blank walls? This post was recently brought up again and that was my question too. I think this is fake and disinformation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The art a CPP was elaborate and pricey. I doubt they rotated art as a gallery would, but this is the only explanation that could match the blank walls to this timeline.

            My find in regards to the issue of "trust" was deleted earlier by mods. But in the Podesta leaks a man named Ulrich Boser sends Podesta a copy of his book on entitled "The Leap: The Science of Trust and Why It Matters". In the introduction the author cites how the act of cannibalism brought a group of people close together and became a sacred act. Check it out... just go look for his name in the Podesta Leaks. I think one theory that is possible is that the act of pedofile a and cannibalism creates a system and culture of both blackmail and trust.

              Yeah she is definitely alluding to something else, it also looks like she gives a furtive glance across the room as if to check if anyone's watching when she says that bit. Also, the bit where she says, he didn't share their secret pizza recipe, but he did tell us this.. before the bit where he says it's about trusting the customers and looking out for them and knowing they'll look out for Comet Ping Pong. That is such a weird thing to say about working in a restaurant, as though knowing whether you can trust your local restaurant is a big deal to most people and it's not weird at all to announce 'as a customer here, you can trust us, we'll look out for you..' about your restaurant. It made me think of that guy's interaction with Alefantis, and how he kept saying 'it's your culture' to him. It's almost like the manager guy lives in a world where it's totally normal to need to trust and 'look out for' people you don't necessarily even know as part of his job. Which kind of implies he's been in it a long time and probably doesn't know much about the way things are outside, to not know that saying that comes off as extremely weird in that context.

              They probably all get told as kids, "now we can't tell anyone else about this or do this with anyone else because this is OUR special culture, and other people have their own culture, and their culture thinks our culture is bad, but it's not bad, it's all relative... etc" I can totally see that being part of the indoctrination.

             Yes, the video strikes me as a kind of thinly veiled expose. That's what I find fascinating. She seems to know much more than she lets on, but it's subtle enough to keep the undertones just beneath the awareness of the disinterested observer. May I ask what you made of her, "But ping pong isn't the only thing people come here to love," remark? To me, that's the most flagrant "wink to the camera," of the whole video.

               There are a few possibilities.
               <br/>
               1.) We're reading too much into this.
2.) She knows and can prove what's going on but isn't saying anything (perhaps keeping it as blackmail or life insurance)
3.) She knows but cannot prove it and is publishing this as a "tell." (i.e. "I want you to know that I know something fishy is going on.")
              </p>
              <p>
               Are there other possibilities that come to mind?

                I just thought, could she be in on it with them, be advertising for them, to the pedophiles? She could be putting the video out there with these subtle cues that pedophiles might know of or pick up on, but anyone else wouldn't consider unless they already knew or had suspicions. Like showing the businesses outside shows you the Besta logo, she shows you some of the kids, establishes that while it
                <em>
                 says
                </em>
                it's family friendly, it actually has a 'grown up vibe.' Advertises that they take the matter of trust importantly and build relationships with their 'customers' and look out for them in return for their silence/business/cover-up and lie if needed.
               </p>
               <p>
                Is there any way of telling where the girl comes from, perhaps she has grown up as a part of the PG circle and is now working for it? Just another possibility to put out there. It is definitely not a normal video made by someone for a school project.

                 I also have this thought. At first I thought it weird about the nervousness of the guy she interviewed buy now it makes perfect sense he was talking to customers and it was a script and he was naturally nervous about not screwing up his lines and I misread it the first time.

              THOSE WORDS have meaning with regards to pizza... not "empowerment" or "trust". If I don't TRUST a restaurant? I don't EAT there. It's THAT SIMPLE.

              Gaydar status is the LEAST of his problems... I was served last night by a cis-gendered person, whom was nice as she/he could be. That caused me nothing more than a second's worth of discomfort, simply because I didn't know the person, so I decided right away to keep the entire 5-10 minute long interaction gender neutral... and that worked fine, diffused the "situation" immediately (if there was any situation at all).
             </p>
             <p>
              So really, being gay has NOTHING to do with "trusting" a restaurant... nothing at all. Either you LIKE a restaurant, or you never return again. I've just never in my life heard a pie-tosser talk about "trust", ever. It's so out-of-place, he might as well have worn a dildo on head head at the counter while taking orders, or even during the interview... yeah, "trust"... and then, I CERTAINLY wouldn't "trust" the restaurant, I would simply walk out without ordering and never return. Ever. And tell everyone I know to AVOID IT.
             </p>
             <p>
              I didn't come there for dildos or trust... I went there for food. If you can't offer that, I don't want your "trust".

                Yeah familiar with this so in the back is the back but also according to this accord people disappear when they enter the back as if they have special access to some hidden room don't know where this would be located but certainly of noteworthy importance.

            This video has been floating around from the beginning, because of the creepy managers comments, there're many backups. Get yourself the YouTube video downloader and you can have your own copy. It's free.

              It was only discussed because of the managers creepy comments. This is the first time I've heard your angle on it. I don't believe she had a clue, I think it was just an easy out for a school project. That said, I've been wrong plenty of times.

               Thanks for the speedy response. Can I ask you one small favor before you file this one away in your mind? Please click the video again and just watch the snippet at 0:58 where she says that "Ping pong isn't the
               <em>
                only
               </em>
               thing people come here to love." When I watch that, I detect a certain contempt in her voice and expression, which leads me to speculate that she knows more than she's letting on (even if she can't prove it). What are your thoughts on that moment in particular?
