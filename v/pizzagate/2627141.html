             I did that with that thread because I thought you had posted it...that amonymous was your alt. We had a hard time understanding what all it was about, but I figured you were in a hurry and didn't have time to organize your research sufficiently. I think this was when a bunch of other stuff was breaking -- NXIVM and the Arizona trafficker camp. LOL...lesson learned. I will go back and flair that thread Disinfo.

            EYJP, you are not the first PG researcher to get into marriage trouble over PG, but this is not quite the way to approach this. You need to step back a few paces and look at this from the point of view of the average

            reader, who is asking WTF does this have to do with child rape by the global elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            I get that you see this as a disinfo campaign in which someone has taken advantage of PG for their own personal vendetta -- that is a legit Rule 1 concern. But you haven't put together a post that actually explains why your personal experience is relevant to other researchers or the investigation as a whole. You also reference something happening on Twitter that really hasn't been happening here, so far as I know. If he's used Voat, please provide the evidence of that here in the thread -- with links to the Voat posts he made. If you are saying amonymous is his account, provide that evidence here in this thread. It's not really respectful of the community to make them go to your Steemit page to read about your divorce. Give enough info in this thread -- explaining why it's relevant to everyone -- to let people decide whether they want to look further into this drama. Otherwise, you are wasting people's time.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Voat has been used as one of the forums to post this in the past, tag me and post torture videos, but I'm providing the evidence of who is behind it so people will stop trying to investigate it because it's fake.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You need to provide evidence here in this thread that Voat has been used to in this manner. I will give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit.

             In the past I didn't know who was stalking me and the threats seemed to be coming from various places. I mostly ignored this aspect of it because I knew it was my ex, but there were other threats that seemed unrelated to him. I also didn't tell people about this because I had no proof. I feel bad asking anyone here to help me figure out who was stalking me now that I realize it was him. I found the evidence and decided to let you guys know that all that time I was thinking pedos were targeting me it was really just my ex, and also because I noticed that people were still posting this garbage on this forum and acting like it was pizzagate related. The most recent post that I'm referring to which someone made references this dumb twitter account is still up and was archived, but some of them have been deleted. Here's the link to the most recent thread. Sorry it wasn't included in the original article, I'll update the post.

             As for your claim that things weren't happening on Twitter, Bryon made his account private and you probably can't see it but he posted in his articles the stuff that people had sent him from that page. Also, some of the convos I didn't provide screenshots of because there was so much involved, but some of them were in Twitter private messaging groups.

             Law is so annoying, I don't know why I ever wanted to get into it in the first place. It is not what people make it out to be. And most people expect free services, you're right.

              I don't think any of us care one way or the other about Zeaux_CXT; it's certainly not on my radar screen. Your trials and tribulations regarding your ex  do not belong here, try Pizzagate Whatever.  I try hard not to be rude but.......

             It's not spam. If you take the time to read the article, you'll see that someone here on Voat likes to post this Zeaux_CXT stuff and tag me in it with references to torture videos and children being dipped in acid baths. This goes back a long way. Sorry if it's confusing for you.

              My ONLY interest in the entire thing was the fact that whoever your ex is he used an order of the eastern star cookbook in this "larp". I also saw masonic cyphers used in some of the other posts made by you in your initial mixup. I posted what was being dug in the /pol/ investigations sticky on 8chan. My god the video what with all of  the other stuff like the eastern star cookbook piqued my interest. I already explained to a researcher on pelzer

              I primarily look and research into masonic ties and because this zeaux fella used a masonic order of the eastern star cookbook in his youtube esacapades. I was interested in possible masonic connections.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said I remember the initial posts and the imagur full of facebook screenshots of very strange people messaging

              </a>
              . So its no wonder she is on the defensive my god some of the accounts stalking her where downright creepy. But Someone on 8chan introduced the eastern star pelzer connection and I paraphrased  that into the thread that people are mentioning. I did not repeatedly mention zeaux honestly I was just interested in the eastern star connection and of course the spooky youtube videos that all this was associated with.

               I don't have the desire to investigate anything related to any torture video nor the cyber forensic capability to track or trace all of those accounts. Are you seriously claiming that you aren't referring to the Zeaux CXT twitter page? ok. Have at it, whatever the satanists send you on, hopefully you're strong enough to endure watching those but as for me, I have zero desire to engage in a debate about something that clearly contains my ex's handwriting. The amount of looking I did in the beginning was next to zero because I instantly recognized his handwriting, it only took me some time to come to terms with how the others were most likely him as well, as my shelter advocate told me. And as far as what resulted from the incident, I know my ex did receive my question on the text and fail to respond to it, I know that he is behind the terrorizing or attempts to terrorize and I know that he usually does it right before I'm supposed to do something important in order to upset and screw with me.

               He could be a secretive "mason" for all I know, his fraternity Kappa Sigma uses the skull and crossbones on their crest, and his secret frat boy name in college was Zeus if I am not mistaken. I'm not supposed to know that, but I'm pretty sure that is what I heard him say or I read it in one of his journals. Anyway, have a great day.

                I thought you meant that I directly posted examples of his handwriting. Of course it related to the twitter page.The reason I watched the video and even made the post was because (mute the videos if you do watch them because half of the shock part of them is the loud noises) there is strange occult sigil type of markings like a logo at the end of it and all of this has to be a part of a secret society. The frat sounds like its one that you secretly are given masonic oaths and a lot of frats are like that. Thats the thing when you have people going around like the joker and doing shit like this there is usually nothing but cultists and satanic sort of masonic people doing it.in this case you have obviously shown a clear underbelly of bizarre people and that is exactly how it works. Some of them are alts and some of them are cultists but the fact that this guy has a journal even who has a journal? This is a cultist and keep yourself safe because whatever is going on with all of this is no good. The fact that he even shows actual torture videos that are seemingly original and not something someone pieced together with spooky photos is strange. The usage of ciphers and all of that suggests some sort of operative thing and this could be ritualistic and absolutely menacing so along with physical safety of yourself and love ones also ensure you can keep a peace of mind. Good luck and I hope you can get away from all of this stalking and harassment.

               Again, I'm just letting people know to stop following a fake story that regularly gets posted here where they try to lure people in with comparisons of the Zeaux CXT twitter page to the Finders and the Podesta Fatherhood web video. Ordinarily that would be something people are interested in, and the post gets hundreds of upvoats it doesn't deserve because it's coming from a fake account

              If it were not for you we would not have known about Elsagate, Lisa or Doyle Mills.  I remember Doyle Mills.  A trafficker if there ever was one.  I checked a while and he was still posting pics.  They never stop.
