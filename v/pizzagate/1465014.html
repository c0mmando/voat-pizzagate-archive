<p>Now we need a spot to organize and we already have that here on Voat. We should agree on a backup site in case Voat gets taken down. </p>
<p>From this point on I\'m going to lay out the basic conceptual framework of a decentralized public intelligence agency.This is a really simplified breakdown. I\'m not going into all the intricate details and explaining how every action should be performed.  This isn\'t a manual, it\'s just a basic breakdown.  I\'ll soon write a very detailed step by step codebook which will explain how to literally do everything down to the most minute detail.</p>
<p>Now how do we get boots on the ground? </p>
<p>Like I said before, we need to  crowd source private investigators which essentially makes them &quot;agents&quot;.  This would  give us the ability to be anywhere at anytime.  There are private investigators all around the world that can be hired anonymously over the Internet at anytime.  They\'re basically hired goons that will go where we tell them go and talk to who we tell them to talk to, and they\'ll even wear hidden cameras to document everything too.  Another thing we\'d have to do is hire  agents  to investigate each other  so we\'d be able to keep an eye on them.  Have the watchers watch themselves too. </p>
<p>We need to start seeing submissions that read        &quot;Need 1200$ to investigate  XYZ&quot;  with a link to a Go-Fund-Me page.  You shouldn\'t get into the details too much because all the information will be publicly accessible and so you don\'t want to give the people you\'re investigating  a heads up. </p>
<p>Now we obviously don\'t want to throw money at strangers and simply hope they don\'t rip us off right? , correct, so how do we ensure that we\'re giving money to trustworthy people?  First of all they\'d have to provide the name of the private investigator so that way we\'d be able to contact him and confirm that he was indeed being procured to do a job for us. This way we could hire another private investigator to investigate him should we choose to. </p>
<p>People would naturally learn which people\'s Go-Fund-Me campaigns were yielding the better results and eventually everybody would know who the reputable people were and they\'d donate to them.  
</p>
<p>Another problem would be people feeding us misinformation.  That\'d be the number one threat, which is why our &quot; agents&quot;  would be best used a drones.  Instead of letting them roam free autonomously doing their own thing it\'d be best to have them follow a specific series of instructions such as &quot; go park X and film everybody that walks into Y&quot;  or &quot; go talk to X and ask him Y&quot; , things like that.  Use them as eyes and ears.  Tell them what to do and have it all documented with a hidden camera.  Use them as field agents to gather Intel and that\'s it.  Our job is to collectively analyze the information, not theirs.  
</p>
<p>Another problem is that all the information obtained by the PIs would be publicly available and so the people investigating us would know what we\'d know.  Well at that point it would be too late and any changes in their behaviour will be indicative of guilt.  We\'ll be putting the heat down and watching to see who squirms.  Whoever squirms from the pressure becomes a focal point of the investigation.  Obviously making information publicly available will impede our effectiveness as an intelligence agency, however that\'s one of the disadvantages to operating publicly like this.  
</p>
<p>Now the beauty about all this is that it\'s also a very powerful psychological weapon and just the thought of having a decentralized public intelligence agency with an army of agents up their ass will make them sweat.  
</p>
<p>There\'s a lot more to this and I\'m prepared to write a step by step guide, basically a codebook explaining how to do everything, and I mean absolutely everything.  You won\'t even need to know how to think for yourself if you don\'t want to. You don\'t have to follow the code either, but If we all did we\'d all be working as one despite remaining decentralized and compartmentalized. </p>
<p>We don\'t want to give our organization any focal point for them to attack. We don\'t want to give it a head for them to cut off.  We don\'t want any centralized leadership at all. </p>

            I'll just add one thing because I skimmed through your post (i'm at work so not as thorough as i would like to) and I agree with what I saw, i'll just add one thing. We are a fucking butch of thousands of people, most likely we have different nationalities represented here, we should take this opportunity to strike big.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd say first step is to dissociate ourselves from the fucker who went armed to the CPP, I know he was most likely a shill intending a false flag but we still have to dissociate ourselves from these actions (I'd go as far as saying this should be our sticky)...Then we should focus on 3/4 "strategic areas" where we focus our actions. By strategic area I mean country, for instance we need a MSM look alike platform (it is uber important to respect the visual codes of the MSM in order to gain credibility from the public) that publishes our best articles (provided we have someone to write our articles). Then we should have a "country leader" that decides the best strategy to divulgue our information to the public (maybe French people are less critical minded than UK people so the divulgation strategy needs to take this into account). We have to opportunity to have a worldwide intelligence agency and, I think we are not taking the opportunity. We also need - and i cannot stress this enough - a debunking team that will debunk every finding we have before we go public.
           </p>
           <p>
            All in all, I have experience in strategy and organizational design, I worked for majore "corporations", I learnt a lot from them and their strategy and I am ready to use all the insight i gain against them...Also, I am not a US citizen, I dont live in the US so I can "organize" something in my country if we go this route.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll be more than willing to help anyone researching this, just feel free to contact me, I feel we should have a separate place to talk about this as, vert is too decentralized to have an ongoing discussion on one particular topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            One last thing, English is not my native language and i am trying not to show my coworkers what i spend my time on, so I apologize if my message is not crystal clear for you guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a nutshell, we need to have a proper organizational structure and, we need it faster than ever now that we are witnessing false flags and mass misinformation (just look at MIC Facebook posts...)

             your english is perfect, dont worry.
            </p>
            <p>
             I very much agree with you, but my main concern is the problematic of needing very horizontal power structures. The danger of infiltration and sabotage is not only real, it is to be expected, and vertical systems that force line of command issues or allow power abuse just make it easier.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even while we need organisation it's my honest opinion, that the decentralisation is our biggest strength. It allows basically limitless scalability, and is really resistant towards sabotage, and other intelligence attempts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Looking at for example wikipedia, the most concerning issue are the admins. The rest is handled by a meritocratic system, that filters out misinformation relatively easily. Every time misinformation is actually allowed to stay there its because of someone who worked up the line of command and abuses his power to manipulate the discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
             What does that mean for possible structures? The best idea I can currently think of is cells. Little work groups that produce content and push it to every other group. Once this happened the other groups can verify of falsify that content, and false negatives and false positives can relatively fast be cross checked and peer reviewed.
            </p>
            <p>
             This allows for the actual redundant grow of information that is uncorrupted. (if you handle it with PGP keys n stuff).
            </p>
            <p>
             Everytime one group sees the necessity to investigate it could just push the request to the others.
            </p>
            <p>
             The biggest risk I see here is corruption by flooding the channels, though we most probably would have to keep it open talk.

            I saw a video last night of someone who sat at Comet for a few hours and just watched, took some photos etc. Very valuable intel if you make note of all the comings and goings, how long each person is there, who they are with, which room they are in etc. Tracking movements and patterns is very very valuable and will give us an idea what really goes on at Comet day to day. Although i suspect that wont be happening anymore now that they've cleaned the place out and no doubt suspended their "side business". But this method would still work for other places we've looked at.

            This is dangerous in that it requires the private investigators to divulge their identity to other investigators. If one of the wrong folks ends up among us, it would be easy to take out the most effective amongst us.

            Some initial thoughts:
(1) everything would likely need to be 100% public
(2) big investigations (global pedophile ring) are broken up into small investigations (comet pizza) that are broken down further into micro investigations (James alefantis) that are broken down into tiny questions (who are James alefantis' closest three friends?) -- essentially taking a big question and separating it into thousands of tiny questions that can be pieced together later
(3) people post questions in a stream
(4) people choose questions they wish to hunt down answers to
(5) if successful, the investigator posts the answer
(6) people string together many tiny answers into more substantial cases
(7) The platform doesn't require accounts or security since it doesn't store any data (I.e. Each operative treats every session on the site the same way Ethan Hunt treats his new mission briefings - as if it's the last time they'd see it)
(8) after some time, people will refine their ability to present organized, conclusive reports that can be anonymously turned over to all global law enforcement agencies simultaneously (letting them decide how to proceed)
           </p>
           <p>
            Apologize in advance if this list is naive or reflects too closely to existing intelligence models (e.g using Reddit/4chan etc the same way - only difference is this would be more deliberate and would be universally crowdsourced and contains absolutely no discussion) besides... discussion is not investigating and investigating is not the debrief it's the part between the discussion and the debrief.

            I have all the time in the world to investigate any lead and any thing. I would love to travel from the Carolinas to DC but have no transportation, sadly. I'm cashless, but if it can be researched on the web or in proximity of me, I am here to be a part of this. I have nothing to hide and nothing to lose, truly.

            i agree. There is an untapped power, in using combined mental power, that could give this struggle the edge it needs. I hope we will see the authorities that do care, acknowledge some of the work that is being done here. it is everyone's concern, and if they are really serious about stopping it, and doing what can be done, then they  surely need to make consideration of this more than considerable resource. The attempts so far, to downplay this, are a real insult to people's intelligence, and bound to backfire. It only takes a quick look at the reasons behind this , and it is plain to see, it is real. There is a lot we can do, about matters, that make us each feel helpless alone, if we can come together in this way ...But first, we need some breakthrough results in this case!

            I hadn't thought about the hiring PI side of things. But I think it would be possible and very useful to have some kind of hybrid wikipedia - wikileaks organization. Have people submit info on scandals, peer review and verify, and officially post it once it's confirmed by many sources. Do everything possible to keep a trustworthy reputation. Imagine if we had the facts on every politician's scandals available on a single public platform, crowdsourced and therefore as un-biased as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, as nice as it would be to see people go to jail for their crimes, public opinion alone should be enough to keep the worst people out of office.

             the problem is how vulnerable this is. First you have to have a server somewhere. Most probably in a country that welcomes free speech like Iceland. This is physically vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then you need persons that have administrative control over the platform, these persons can be corrupted or dissappeared.
            </p>
            <p>
             The software side itself is also vulnerable: it's not just about removing or corrupting information, peer review and crosschecking and redundancy can handle that. There also is the possiblity to just ddos such a website into not working at all, or planting malware / man in the middle attacks, to identify the most important contributors and mute / dissappear them.
            </p>
            <p>
             I sincerely have no idea how to handle such a platform, youve seen what happened to Wikileaks, although I agree to the sentiment that we need SOMETHING

              Yeah, I have no knowledge about what would be needed for security. But, the beauty of the internet is there's many people out there who do. I'm sure there are enough tech security experts that some of them would be willing to lend their skills to the cause.

             This could be one hell of a start. I like this idea a lot. Politicians, people in power and celebrities will have to accept that being in the public eye, literally means "in the public eye". There is nowhere to hide.

              It would also be good for people to anonymously report things that aren't immediately obvious to the public. Theres always inside lower-level people who know things that they'd like to spill, but wouldn't if they had to reveal their identity for the sake of job security or reputation.

              We have to make this the defining moment of the information age. The moment when people realize that the collaborative power of the internet gives average citizens the chance to hold politicians accountable. We can't let this just be a single event, or it'll happen again. We have a new responsibility to always keep watch.

               Well we'd need to create incentives, like cash rewards for information that leads to an arrest or something.  Maybe buy footage taken from hidden cameras.. We want to document as much as we can.

                People don't need incentives to contribute to wikipedia, they just contribute to whatever they're interested in. Just like they are for Pizzagate.

                  Well, Snowden and whoever leaked the Podesta emails did it without incentive, and at great risk. There's gotta be plenty of people with moderately important info that they want to leak, but don't know where to leak it to.

            Blockchain communication and bounties sound like the perfect decentralized, market-based economy for this. Hardest issue will be validating how verifiable the info is, since you will be fighting with disinfo both malignant (subterfuge, counter-intel) and non-malignant (scammers just out for the bounty).
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the "entrance fee" requirement and total secrecy through decentralization is the key. It's basically making an "information bounty hunter" network.

             Document everything.  Have the private investigator document everything he does with a hidden camera and when the investigation is complete release  all the raw footage.  Then we scrutinize the PI and talk to him and ask him whatever we want.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only way they could scam us is if the PI and the guy behind the Go-Fund-Me campaign were both in on it ( or the same person),  but this way they'd have to fake all the raw footage as well.  It would be a pretty sophisticated scam to pull off.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's a few other layers of protection we could use to protect ourselves against misinformation as well, but there's not a full proof method. All we can do is put as many barriers in front of the disinformation agents as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also think people would eventually learn which Go-Fund-Me campaigns were producing the best results, and so they'd judge people based on their performance and direct their funds towards them.

            Need a basic list of directives for the agent to follow in order for them to execute their tasks effectively and anonymously. Ones that can be used interchangeably from one task to the next, from location to location, different circumstance to different circumstance. As I type, I am immediately overwhelmed by the understanding that there are agencies who have these structures in place and have manuals with all sorts of strategies. We need them. Any and all. Reminds me of when I first started waking up to all this shite. I started downloading all those files from snowden and feverishly learning of these new strategies being employed against their own people and others. Strategies are key. Conceptual strategies such as ones which are used against us as peoples. Hegemonic strategies. Think of Marxism or critical theory; how these simple concepts can be used for or against. Little rant there, I'll clarify... 1. list of directives for agent 2. Manuals or strategies from the alphabet gangs (so we're not on the learning curve of reinventing the wheel) 3. Conceptual strategies for us as well as agents (for us that would be; war with media -- just like they're using on us, fake news and the like (hoax or whatever this gunman b.s. is), using false dialectics to achieve our goals (thesis is opposed by anti-thesis which is resolved in synthesis), etc.. for the agents; Socratic method of discussion to get the perpetrator or whoever it is to self incriminate ( this requires the agent to be intelligent or at least to follow specific rules of interviewing), use fallacies, or propaganda such as false news articles designed to induce confession (this technique would have to be explored further but basic idea), etc.

            This is a much better suggestion than your other post, I can get behind this. Just be careful about using terms like 'boots on the ground' considering recent events at Comet Ping Pong.

            Great idea, though it has already been done before. William Milton Cooper, who ran a radio show "Hour of the Time" from 1992 till the day he was murdered in 2001, had created two very successful civilian intelligence agencies that worked for him and his program (keep in mind, this was before the Internet really took off). One was called CAJI (The Citizens' Agency for Joint Intelligence), which provided general research and investigation on a wide variety of NWO-related topics, while the other one was called IS (Intelligence Service) and focused specifically on providing relevant intel to militia groups. In order to become a volunteer agent, one had to pay a fee (about $100 dollars - that alone will separate a lot of chaff), take a notarized oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and finally be willing to undergo a thorough background check. Once accepted into one of the agencies, a researcher would be assigned to an experienced local "station chief", who decided what the agents in his particular area of the country should concentrate their research on; he would also collect all incoming reports, analyze them, fact-check and then submit  final reports to Bill Cooper who would then read the results of these thorough investigations on air to millions of listeners world-wide. That was his model, but there are many ways that we can improve it. Your suggestion of monetary incentives is a great one - it should be very easy to reward dedicated researchers with crowd funds in this day and age. Thanks for making the post.

             I can't believe I don't know about any of that. That's fucking incredible. The problem with Bill Copper's model was Bill Copper though, and I mean that in the sense that he was the head of the organization.  We need to structure it like a religion in the sense that we will be operating independently, yet as one. There's probably no perfect system, but what I can do is design a system  and then try to break it.  I'll deliberately try to exploit it and then reinforce the weak points I find. Hard to explain, but basically what I'll do is try to find holes in my own design and then patch up any weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trust me, I can create something lasting. It's just a matter of getting it going, because once it gets going the system will continue to propel itself.

              Oh, I totally agree that it needs to be decentralized. They offed Cooper and his intelligence agencies died with him, which is unfortunate. That being said, we still need some structure and assignment of duties based on talents and skills, as well as a way of secure communication, so as not to reveal your plans to the enemies before a move is even made. The last problem is the hardest one to solve.

               Unfortunately, we're it right now.  And we're here.  And it's prob compromised already.  Just like the last place.

               And the wild west frontier we need exists and is full of awful anons and pedos and run by questionable people.

               The 92 model is great to know about.  We need better. And sadly, even as a Trump fanboy, we need it good enough to sink him if he does wrong too.

               Drifting towards and normalizing the deep dark corners of the internet is natural, but this election has shown that to be questionable and possibly insufficient.

             There are problems with simple answers to this question. 1) extremely large amounts of available information. 2) divergent viewpoints (TOR or VPN? Is both a good idea or not.) 3) economics. (Buy a new computer never let windows touch it) 4) technical skill level (Browsing with Lynx/w3m over TOR) etc. 
If you run windows (botnet): get virtualbox and create a Ubuntu (assuming low skill) VM with full disk encryption. Then decide on using a paid VPN or TOR. Use firefox with uMatrix (spoof referers on etc) Ghostery, HTTPS everywhere.

              Let's be realistic. the average joe has no clue what most of this stuff is, and certainly can't afford another computer for this purpose (I can't - I have a laptop with windows). If we really want a nice, concerted effort with security measures, we need easy(er), or at least well-guided solutions for anonymity.

               If you are not running a linux vm on top of your Windows install at a bare minimum you would only be deluding yourself into thinking you have any security.

               Well, once you get used to it it becomes natural. You just have to care. TBH I just use a pretty standard linux distro, VPN normally and the plugins I mentioned. But yeah you are right: still not completely safe, thats impossible.

              Best thing ive heard is to rent a configured TOR bridge (obfs or w.e) from a paid service, and pay anonymously (bitcoin if they accept) . Havnt done it but this seems the best way to browse dn. They cant see TOR traffic or know your even using it

            You need to remember that people are lazy and busy. I don't know if people have the time to spend triple checking every detail. If we do not have thousands of people doing it then security becomes a real concern. It needs to be done so that ordinary people with MAX 1 hour per day can participate.
