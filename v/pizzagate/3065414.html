<p>Now, I will try another stab at the mystery, but I am not the first mentioning this theory. It has been discussed piecemeal in the past on Steemit, Redditt, Twitter, and elsewhere.  
</p>
<p>Enter Caris Life Sciences, Inc. (CLS)</p>
<p>Founded in 1987, based in Irving, TX, with additional offices in Phoenix, AZ, and Basel, Switzerland. Serving customers through distributors in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and internationally.   
</p>
<p>CLS operates as a bioscience company, engaging in the developments and commercialization of anatomic pathology, drug development and delivery, molecular profiling, and blood based diagnostic technologies in the fields of oncology, dermatopathology, hematopathology, gastrointestinal pathology, and urologic pathology.   
</p>
<p>It also offers advanced molecular analyses of patient samples through prognostic testing services and genomic, ADAPT Biotargeting System, Caris Molecular Intelligence, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling.  Do I understand all of this?  No.  
</p>
<p>Dr. David D. Halbert, age 62, is the Chairman and CEO.  
</p>
<p>This company is HUGE.</p>
<p><a href="http://20www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.aspundefined">http://20www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.aspundefined</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.carislifesciences.com/about/">https://www.carislifesciences.com/about/</a></p>
<p>About David Halbert - He graduated from Abilene Christian University in 1978 with a BS in business administration.  Prior to founding CLS, he founded AdvancePCS, a leading pharmacy benefits management company, where he served as Chairman and CEO until it was sold to CareMark in 2004 for $7.5 billion.  Under Halbert, the small, privately-owned AdvancePCS, grew into a publicly traded Fortune 250 corporation with over $15 billion in annual revenue.  When AdvancePCS was sold, it returned 31 times its initial IPO value, 150 times the venture capital investment, and 227 times the original investor\'s money.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Halbert formed Caris Capital in 2005 and has sold over $1.2 billion in assets.  He also acquired Pathology Partners, Inc., in 2005, based in Irving, TX, which was later renamed Caris Diagnostics.  He served as Chairman of the Nutrition and Scientific Advisory Boards of Herbalife International of America, Inc., and as Independent Director of Herbalife Ltd. from March 2006 to May 2007.  In 2008, he acquired Molecular Profiling Institute (MPI), a molecular life sciences company.  In 2011, Caris Diagnostics was sold to Miraca Life Sciences for $725 million.</p>
<p>CLS explains itself as being exclusively focused on fulfilling the promise of personalized medicine, and by using sophisticated disease profiling technologies along with advanced bioinformatics capabilities, they are pioneering a new era in precision medicine.</p>

<p><a href="http://20www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.aspundefined">http://20www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.aspundefined</a></p>
<p>Halbert and his family also solely support the Caris Foundation, a non-profit, private foundation established in 2002, that aids impoverished people by implementing solutions that are culturally relevant and sustainable across Africa and Haiti.  The foundation primarily operates in Kenya and Haiti and employs more than 167 people.  It also funds relief efforts in Haiti, Guatemala, Peru, Kenya, Indonesia, the Philippines, and China, with a focus on preventing and treating pediatric HIV and other life-threatening diseases.</p>

<p>On December 5, 2017, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) announced their selection of Caris Foundation International to lead a consortium of partners to bolster Haiti\'s health system and expand essential healthcare for up to 4.2 million people - spending $98.5 million over 4 years.</p>

<p>How did Dr. David Halbert, with only a bachelor\'s degree in business administration from Abilene Christian University, become so successful and wealthy?  According to Forbes, Abilene U. ranks #463 in Top Colleges, #305 in Private Colleges, and #95 in the South.  I found no evidence whatsoever that he continued his education beyond an undergraduate level, earning the title of &quot;Doctor.&quot; </p>
<p>David D. Halbert\'s grandfather had become rich on Texas oil, and his father was a prominent Abilene physician who led the building of one of the city\'s hospitals.  After completing his degree in business administration, he began working in the oil and gas industry, as did his younger brother, Jon.  In the mid-1980\'s, both David and Jon took an interest in the rising trend of home healthcare and began looking for investors to start a mail order pharmacy, whcih they called Advance Paradigm and later became AdvancePCS.   One of the original investors in Advance Paradigm was George W. Biush.  Halbert\'s career took off.</p>
<p>In 2001, then President George W. Bush came under fire for his business connections with Halbert in the mid-1990\'s.  Halbert and his family had contributed funds to several of Bush\'s campaigns.  Bush had sold off his stocks in Halbert\'s Advance Paradigm in 1998 to avoid a conflict of interest.  The two had remained friends, however, and Bush approached Halbert in 2001 to help write a controversial proposal to offer drug discount cards to seniors.  Many felt the move was inappropriate because AdvancePCS stood to benefit from the program if Medicare endorsed the company to issue the cards.  The Medicare Prescription Drug Discount Card Program was enacted into law on December 8, 2003.</p>

<p>Caris Life Sciences and all of its many subsidiaries is about precision medicine, and precision medicine flunks the test of clinical utility.  There have been great achievements in identifying and characterizing the genetic underpinnings for many diseases. which has resulted in a much deeper understanding of many diseases.  In the broader sense, however, the application of genetic information has not yet been shown to be helpful, despite all the hype suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p>Now, a new study gives strong evidence that broad scale general use of genetic information will have very little value in guiding health decisions and even has the potential to cause far more harm than good.  In particular, the study shows that &quot;incidental&quot; findings from genetic screening strategies have a very long way to go before living up to the hype of precision medicine advocates.  The ethical implications are huge.  The study &quot;provided de facto evidence of a high false-positive rate for variant interpretation.&quot;</p>

<p>In August of 2016, Caris Life Sciences announced that it had surpassed 100,000 clinical trials with its tumor profiling offering.  And the money never stops. In October 2018, CLS announced that it had raised $150 million in growth capital in the form of secured debt and convertible notes from TPG Sixth Street Partners (TSSP), the global credit investment platform with $25 billion in assets under management.  Caris will use the proceeds (in part) to continue development of &quot;Next Generation Profiling.&quot;</p>

<p>This is just one more deep, deep rabbit hole with so many companies, corporations, and people involved.  It\'s very difficult to determine how many companies are affiliated with, managed by, or owned by David D. Halbert.   I believe it is fair to say that very little, if anything, of what Halbert does is for the goodness of mankind. </p>
<p>So, is #carisjames in any way connected to Caris Life Sciences? Is Caris Life Sciences connected in any way to #carisjames?  I believe it\'s fair to say that we still don\'t know.</p>',

            We need more investigation and research.  CARIS is extremely deep-rooted medical research, particularly cancer research.  They are not out to help anybody.  They more than likely are killing people.  This is horrific, and it's making me ill.

            This is so bizarre. This guy doesn't have an MD, a PhD, a JD, an MBA, or even an MPH. His father, who has the same name as him, is a physician with an MD. You're right OP, how on earth did this guy get to be the CEO of this weird biomedical company? I worked at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and
            <em>
             everyone
            </em>
            had a Masters in Public Health (MPH), even the low level marketing people who worked in the communications department, (it was basically a requirement to work there). I have also never even heard of Caris Life Sciences and apparently they only do cancer research.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is him:
            <a href="https://www.acu.edu/via/kathy-and-david-halbert.html">
             https://www.acu.edu/via/kathy-and-david-halbert.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He gave $15 million to Abilene Christian University.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a lot of small companies with "Caris" in the name, if you read all of the employee bios:
            <a href="https://www.carislifesciences.com/about/caris-management/">
             https://www.carislifesciences.com/about/caris-management/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            They sound like shell companies.
           </p>
           <p>
            This woman was his administrative assistant:
            <a href="https://www.carislifesciences.com/bio/stephanie-thomas/">
             https://www.carislifesciences.com/bio/stephanie-thomas/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            and then:
"Thereafter, Ms. Thomas served as a Partner of Caris Ltd. I, L.P., which managed Caris Capital®, formed in 2005 by Mr. Halbert."
           </p>
           <p>
            So Caris Ltd, managing Caris Capital, for Caris Life Sciences, which works with the Caris Foundation.

             USAID says it all. Alphabet. This is how NWO gains financial control of 3rd world countries and their natural resources. A guy who worked in this as an "economist" wrote CONFESSIONS OF AN ECONOMIC HIT MAN and The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man. By John Perkins:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Economic hit men are the shock troops of what Perkins calls the corporatocracy, a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments, and the rich and powerful people tied to them. If the EHMs can’t maintain the corrupt status quo through nonviolent coercion, the jackal assassins swoop in. The heart of this book is a completely new section, over 100 pages long, that exposes the fact that all the EHM and jackal tools—false economics, false promises, threats, bribes, extortion, debt, deception, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power—are used around the world today exponentially more than during the era Perkins exposed over a decade ago."

             Exactly.  There is much more to Caris Life Sciences and Halbert than meets the eye.  It deserves more digging and research.  I just wanted to get the name out here on Voat, as there has been questioning and speculation for quite some time that there is another meaning or something more needs to be discovered pertaining to the Alefantis/little girl #CarisJames photos.  So far, however, nothing has panned out.

              It could be that the kid is named after this place, or maybe it's not her real name and "Caris" is just another coded meaning. There is literally no way to prove that that is her real name unless someone knows these people in person.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is really bizarre to me that this tiny, nobody "foundation" got $98 million from the government, and it's run by some rich, unknown non-doctor who has connections to Bush, and who runs a biomedical company that as far as I can tell does genetic testing and experimentation. Throw in the Clinton Foundation's connections to Haiti and it's all suspicious.

            Just because Caris would be her name it doesn't mean that it wasn't referring to island also. James Alefantis used picture from a Instagram account which used #rachelchandler hashtag, the same account used #cometpingpong hashtag. Rachel Chandler or Ray.Chandler is a girl who was with Bill Clinton on one picture and pictures posted by her on social media had clear motives of child abuse and satanism. Check this out:

             Consider also, Madeline McCann had the same rare eye defect [coloboma] as the baby in Alefantis picture. I believe these children were bred, or taken, for research and sacrifice. Is that baby still alive? Something about the eye.

            I think it's time to put this matter to permanent rest.  Caris is Caris is Caris.  It's a name, that's all it is.  And a pretty name.  It is a Greek name which means grace, kindness.  Actually, it's a 
very nice name for a little girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, that doesn't leave David D. Halbert and Caris Health Sciences innocent.

            The same reason for debunking the ridiculous island angle should also be used for this. Relatives that were not well known to pizzagate researchers have named her on their own Facebook pages as Caris. That should be enough. The kids name is Caris. Why people are trying to make other links is beyond me. I can only think misinfo shilling.

             Lighten-up.  It was a final stab at it, nothing more.  So quick to think the worst.  Yes, it's time to put the matter to rest.  BUT,  at least additional info and research is out there that will be helpful in other ways.

            Caris is Welsh name meaning "Love".  It surged in popularity in US from around 2002 onwards.
It is possible that this girl really is just called Caris and she had bags under her eyes that no child of her age ought to have.  It implies abuse.  Was her father the makingmahnightcheeze label?  The guy who made kiddy coffins and passed them off as tables??
James Alefantis said himself that he hates kids.  It's transcribed from that time he threatened that Youtuber who found Pegasus Musuem's "killroom" (hashtag).  So dont bother trying to pass Jame's off as someone who just loves his god-daughter.. He's a child hating ultra-gay who posts SM implied pseudo sexual imagery involving pizzas and children on his twitter account.  There is nothing 'innocent' about that satanic imagery (and it is satanic, they believe it is)
But I believe you're going down a wrong rabbit hole with Caris Life Sciences. Caris is a welsh name menaing Love.

            Albeit.. most druidic families come from Wales and child abuse is rampant amougst them.. mostly boy rape though..

            Perhaps, James is the godfather of Caris Cummings, a close friend's little girl, who's in the picture. He loves that little girl a lot and dodes on her. He creates a hashtag, called, #carisjames, to broadcast all the crazy things him and the little girl do together. Innocent enough so far.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever other story you want, I feel pretty certain, it's a combination of his name and her name #together. Get it? You decide how it got that way from there.

                   There's a lot of research on the caris meaning. There is a genetic defect that is connected to pineal gland in relation to the colobomas Madeline McCann, Caris James, Soros, Prince Philip, Jacob Rothschild, Kissinger, ect ALL have the same defect in the eye. Caris is an acronym related to coloboma.

              Well, I think we may have just found a link between Epstein Island and Comet Ping Pong. I was digging around and came across an old /pol/ thread about the various pizzagate art and social media accounts. I posted it over in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/think-">
               @think-
              </a>
              's subverse
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagateart">
               v/pizzagateart
              </a>
              , and she spotted that an anon had pointed out the Comet Sign has occult symbols at it's four points and occult rituals involve invoking the cardinal directions. Which made me remember that Q mentioned the cardinal directions being important on Epstein Island. Here's
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagateart/3066901/17077050/0/">
               the link to that convo

              .
             </p>
             <p>
              So, there may in fact BE a connection. I honestly don't know how we'd establish this definitively at this point, though.

            I posted this a while back:

            Jeffrey Epstein. There is a luxury estate on the Island and it is often used for conferences held by the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, which sponsors cutting-edge science and medical research. Recent conferences have included topics such as gravity, language evolution and global threats to the Earth. Many notable scientists have attended the conferences, including Marvin Minsky, Gerard 't Hooft and Stephen Hawking.[2]
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation is a private science foundation known for establishing the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University with a $30 million gift to the university.[1] The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics is considered the first department of its kind to study the evolution of molecular biology with the sole use of mathematics. It is also one of the first departments to develop mathematical models of how human cancer cells evolve as well as infectious bacteria and viruses such as HIV.[2]
Little St. James Island appears to be somewhat of a gathering place and is a well desired hangout among key figureheads, actors, and royalty to the likes of former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and even Prince Andrew.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the people attending the lavish residence are likely not there to discuss “cutting edge scientific and medical research” as the Epstein VI Foundation would like you to believe, but rather experience full-on sexual encounters with underage girls as young as fourteen.
That’s right, just like a scene out of the Hollywood blockbuster film Eyes Wide Shut, starring Tom Cruise, from wild parties to prostitution, orgies, and even underage sex, Little St. James has it all, seemingly a gathering point frequented by prominent jet-setters, and it’s all being exposed. The cat is out of the bag so to speak.

            The question is if the two are financially or socially connected. If so, we probably have our answer.
