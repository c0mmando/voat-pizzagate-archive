            Interesting article.  Can't be sure how much of it is accurate.  I do believe the part about CIA drug-running is true.  And controlling politicians through pedo-blackmail.

            Not true.  'Satan' is Hebrew for "enemy."  The etymology of 'Saturn' is unclear, but it doesn't share a root with 'Satan.'

            We really have very little evidence of this.  It's possible the whole "Satanism" thing is a cover to make the whole thing unbelievable.  It's also possible that it's real.  Let's focus on the evidence, though.

           <p>
            We don't have evidence of this, either.  Not saying it doesn't happen, though.

             Yes. Satan is a figure described by the Hebrews, the accuser or enemy. The term is from Job, probably the oldest book in the Hebrew Bible. Although I have no doubt that many followers of Satan today might believe this is actually derived from Saturn. They are misled in many ways (the serpent is a deceiver, but he claims to offer wisdom and knowledge).
            </p>
            <p>
             The Saturn myth is later. It is also not original, but he is a type that goes back further to Babylon, Egypt, and elsewhere.
