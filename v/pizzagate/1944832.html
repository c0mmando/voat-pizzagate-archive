            It's loony tunes to think the murder rate in America skyrocketed over the last 8 years.  In fact, we had two straight years, where the murder rate was lower than any year since 1960 when modern records began being kept.  We have have had a slight uptick from these historic lows, but every year under Obama will still have a lower murder rate than the lowest of the Bush years (and Bush's  8 years were safer than Clinton's 8 years).
           </p>
           <p>
            In New York, to reach the number of murders in a single year at its peak, you have add up the last 6 years together to surpass that single year.

            Even if you just look at the top 30 cities, your claim doesn't stand up.  There are big spikes in certain cities.   (My guess is these are the cities that serve as Opiate distribution centers and there's a war between gangs going on.)
From June 2017, based on the latest data.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Based on new year-end data collected from police departments in the 30 largest cities,
             <strong>
              crime in 2016 remained at historic lows across the country. Although there are some troubling increases in murder in specific cities,
             </strong>
             these trends do not signal the start of a new national crime wave. What’s more startling, this analysis finds that the increase in murders is even more concentrated than initially expected. Chicago now accounts for more than 55.1 percent of the total increase in urban murders — up from an earlier projection of 43.7 percent.
Final Year-End Findings:
The overall crime rate in the 30 largest cities in 2016 remained largely unchanged from last year. Specifically, overall crime rose by 0.9 percent, essentially remaining stable.
The murder rate rose in this group of cities last year by 13.1 percent.
             <br/>
             Alarmingly, Chicago accounted for 55.1 percent of the total increase in urban murders — more than preliminary data suggested.
A similar phenomenon occurred in 2015, when three cities — Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. — accounted for more than half (53.5 percent) of the increase in murders.
Some cities are experiencing an increase in murder while other forms of crime remain relatively low. Concerns about a national crime wave are premature, but these trends suggest a need to understand how and why murder is increasing in these cities.
Violent crime rates rose slightly. The 4.2 percent increase was driven by Chicago (16.5 percent) and Baltimore (18.6 percent). Violent crime still remains near the bottom of the nation’s 30-year downward trend
