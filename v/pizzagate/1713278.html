            Excerpt from first post which an email from some idiot that can't spell "article" while claiming to have written several:
           </p>
           <p>
            I recommended testing for ability/maturity as a way to "emancipate" children regardless of age, licencing/training for boylovers to help the system adapt and monitor our progress, supporting parental-involvement/responsibility in man/boy pairing/relationships much as the ancient greeks did, and encouraging stability via nurturing making love OVER casual playful sex due to the addictive qualities of "junk sex" (like junk food).
           </p>
           <p>
            That's whAt's coming. Child rights! As Hillary famously said to much applause, " women's rights are human rights."
           </p>
           <p>
            No society denies women's rights beczuse men and women do not exist in competition. They may differ on what thse rights are but that's not for some other country halfway around the world to decide.  Do women have a right to drive? Nobody has a right to drive the govt gives licenses as they please including to illegals although that's outrageous.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this dudes email he casts himself as a persecuted homosexual who wanted to file a suit against the government LMAO in a "backward traditionsl" society he wouldn't dare speak a word and he'd probably just Jack off like everyoje else instead of resorting to rape.
