<p>•	UK Prime Minister, Theresa May (About to win a landslide election victory) – Swirl Broach &amp; note red outfit – <a href="http://imgur.com/a/u8TC5">http://imgur.com/a/u8TC5</a></p>
<p>•	Ex UK Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher – Butterfly broach (Unfair?) – <a href="http://imgur.com/a/9zN0W">http://imgur.com/a/9zN0W</a></p>
<p>•	The Queen &amp; her nurse – butterfly broach, red outfit and note pentagram and freemason symbol on nurses belt – <a href="http://imgur.com/a/5dtlA">http://imgur.com/a/5dtlA</a></p>
<p>•	Queen of Spain – Swirl broach, red outfit – <a href="http://imgur.com/a/T1T2A">http://imgur.com/a/T1T2A</a></p>
<p>•	Baroness Rothschild – Clearly Satanic necklace with swirl horns, and swirl ear rings - <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TLdF7">http://imgur.com/a/TLdF7</a></p>
<p>•	BBC One Idents – Swirl and terminology “oneness” - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOfOGOPaTPc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOfOGOPaTPc</a></p>
<p>This blatant symbolism could be coincidence but given the prolific history of the BBC and the UK government involvement in satanic paedophile rings I think these serve as more than valid indicators of complicity.</p>
<p>Briefly analysing the symbolism can tell us something about the potential belief system. As we know the swirl keeps popping up all over the place, found in almost every ancient civilisation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.messagetoeagle.com/secrets-spiral-symbol-left-ancient-civilizations/">http://www.messagetoeagle.com/secrets-spiral-symbol-left-ancient-civilizations/</a></p>
<p>It clearly has ancient spiritual meaning. As we know the Fibonacci golden ratio and spiral occurs all around us throughout nature: the milky way; particle physics; in the arrangement of branches along the stems of plants and the veins in leaves; the skeletons of animals and humans and the branching of their veins and nerves.  It can even be seen in the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of crystals.</p>
<p><a href="http://gnosticwarrior.com/golden-spiral.html">http://gnosticwarrior.com/golden-spiral.html</a></p>
<p>This spiritual potential arises because of the way the spiral shape resembles growth patterns observed in nature and its proportions are reminiscent of those in human bodies. Thus, these simple spirals suggest the presence of a universal order underlying the world, were thereby dubbed “golden” or “divine”. A pretty mind blowing documentary that illustrates the ancient peoples understanding of this mathematical principal amongst other advanced concepts such as the speed of light which was posted on this board can be viewed at the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fS9ixfQ_no">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fS9ixfQ_no</a></p>
<p>Also recommend anything by Graham Hancock for this area of research.</p>
<p>The Egyptians thought that the golden ratio was sacred.  Therefore, it was very important in their religion as well as the pyramid construction as illustrated. Great buildings from the Parthenon to the Great Mosque of Kairouan and all the way through to modern landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and the National Gallery in London share this concept.</p>
<p>As a result of the unique properties of this golden proportion, many view the ratio as sacred or divine and as a door to a deeper understanding of beauty and spirituality in life, unveiling a hidden harmony or connectedness in so much of what we see.</p>
<p>This symbol can be linked with darker beliefs. Linking golden ratio with the number of the beast, 666:</p>

<p>It can also be seen as representing the the nine circles of hell and dante’s inferno. Each of the levels seems to match with the activities conducted by these groups under investigation.</p>

<p>The amount of further areas of symbolism throughout our culture and in unknown ancient cultures is mind-boggling.</p>
<p>Circling back to the BBC ident, is this part of the subliminal messaging we are seeing all over the media? Or am I paranoid?</p>
<p>What is the general consensus of the belief system of the people in question and what is their ultimate goal? Total enslavement, perpetual suffering and destruction of humanity?</p>
<p>Is it the ninth circle belief system? Where did it originate? How are we supposed to fight it?</p>
<p>Also for awareness and a good link to red pill people, if nobody has seen this yet, basically confirmation from somebody who was on the inside (8000 of these people in total):</p>

            My tentative view is that the spiral of PG is th3 kundalini coiled snake at th3 base of the spine and they penetrate tj3 all seeing browneye to stimulate this.  Connects to pinneal gland etc.
