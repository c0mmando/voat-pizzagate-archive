As the title suggests, the state of Massachusetts is considering legislation which would prohibit parents seeking therapy for their children who exhibit same sex attraction or gender confusion.  The bill would classify such therapy as \'child abuse\' and allow the state to forcibly remove children from parents who seek such help.  So while it is perfectly acceptable for homosexuals and transsexuals to openly groom very young children in primary/nursery schools, parents seeking to undo the pernicious effects of this LGBTP grooming are the ones to be labelled \'child abusers\'.  This prospective legislation is, in my view, in furtherance of the LGBTP agenda to sexualise children, the ultimate aim of which is to legalise/normalise child rape (text of and link to article below).</p>
<p>Massachusetts lawmakers are considering a therapy ban that would not only make it illegal to counsel children about unwanted same-sex attraction or gender confusion, but also punish parents who allow it by taking custody of their children.</p>
<p>Andrew Beckwith, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, told CBN News that the bill “categorizes the treatment itself as child abuse.”</p>
<p>It appears that Massachusetts is the first state to consider defining such therapy as abusive and allow for the option of taking away parental custody.</p>
<p>“This is a bill that would allow the state to take, for example, your daughter, and make her someone else’s son,” Beckwith said.</p>
<p>According to the Human Rights Campaign, a powerful LGBTQ advocacy organization, 15 states and Washington, DC have already passed therapy bans for youth. Beckwith says Massachusetts could be the first to add the abuse definition. Lawmakers in Maine and Colorado are also considering therapy bans for youth right now. LGBTQ advocates have argued for years that therapy that allows youth to discuss their concerns about unwanted same-sex desires or gender identity issues is harmful.</p>
<p>Massachusetts lawmakers first introduced a youth therapy ban bill in 2013. Beckwith says proponents appear to have an “aggressive timeline” right now, because last year lawmakers couldn’t agree on the abuse provision and delayed a vote until the end of the session in June.</p>
<p>This year, according to Beckwith, they’re already taking action. Lawmakers held a hearing on March 5 to consider testimony from those the measure would impact.</p>
<p>Parental custody is already an issue in transgender cases involving children across the country. Recently, Ohio officials stripped parental rights from a couple that opposed medical treatment for their teenage daughter who wanted to become a boy. In Texas, a divorced father and mother are fighting over medical treatment for their 6-year-old son. The mother says he identifies as a girl and wants to pursue medical treatments to help him change. The father says the boy identifies as a boy and opposes the treatments.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Senate’s bill S.70, titled “Relative to abusive practices to change sexual orientation and gender identity,” was reported favorably by committee Monday, March 11, and referred to the committee on Senate Rules.</p>
<p>Hearings on Massachusetts House Bill H.110, “An Act banning conversion therapy,” was extended for additional testimony. A new date for the extended hearings has not been set.

            <p>
             Massachusetts lawmakers are considering a therapy ban that would not only make it illegal to counsel children about unwanted same-sex attraction or gender confusion, but also punish parents who allow it by taking custody of their children.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This sucks. Because many survivors who have been raped/abused by someone of the same sex are confused by same sex attractions. They don't know whether it's due to the abuse experience that they feel attracted to the same sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if this would be made illegal, it would be a huge pushback.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it's self-evident that gender dysphoria needs to be addressed in therapy if it bothers a child.
           </p>

             In Texas, a divorced father and mother are fighting over medical treatment for their 6-year-old son. The mother says he identifies as a girl and wants to pursue medical treatments to help him change.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            A six-year-old. It's child abuse to even consider medical treatment in a case like this.

             Yeah, especially if the
             <em>
              "medical treatment"
             </em>
             amounts to reassignment surgery, which I personally find contemptible at any age.
            </p>
            <p>
             Are there any instances where conversion therapy has actually worked? Is this even testable? Forgive my ignorance, as everyone else seems solidly dogmatic on the issue with their collective gay-bashing, but wouldn't regular psychological or psychoanalytical therapy be more appropriate at getting to the core of this? What exactly does conversion therapy offer that these others don't? And is it collectively agreed here that all gender dysphoria, homosexuality &amp; paraphilia are caused by child abuse, neglect or subliminal brainwashing? If not, is conversion therapy proposed to work for all cases regardless?
            </p>
            <p>
             In case it needs to be said, I'm not trolling, homosexual or advocating anything to the contrary, just asking for info.

              As far as I know, conversion therapy isn't working, it only leads to self-hatred. But I wasn't talking about conversion therapy anyway, I was talking about offering therapy for teenagers who might have been abused, and feel confusion about their sexual orientation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Counselling them wouldn't
              <em>
               be
              </em>
              'conversion therapy', but might become illegal, although it would be a normal therapy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Personally, I don't think that homosexuality is always caused by sexual abuse, but there seems to be a strong correlation (and I am basically gay friendly).
             </p>
             <p>
              Pedophilia (= people who are only attracted to children) has a strong correlation to sexual abuse; most pedophiles who are only attracted to children have been abused when they were children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gender dysphoria seems to have a correlation to child abuse too, although nobody dares to do studies about it (only my impression), and to mental illness.

               Hey, thanks so much for clearing that up. Pretty much my own sense of the issue, although my attempts to learn further have been difficult, as the literature is highly saturated with personal &amp; political ideologies.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know if it's so much what you'd classify as
               <em>
                "child abuse"
               </em>
               as it is neglect. Not that parenting has always been great, but perhaps there's instability in other areas, like emotional or self identification. My sister is well read and highly critical of postmodernism, feminism, etc; she believes the lack of or substitute for breastmilk, of all things, is a large reason why people are growing up less mentally developed. On top of everything else, food &amp; health, pollution, tech, economy, generational differences &amp; existential confusion, societies seem to cyclically push the boundaries of their class or egalitarian structure to an eventual collapse and
               <em>
                (hopefully)
               </em>
               rebirth.

             According to the Human Rights Campaign, a powerful LGBTQ advocacy organization, 15 states and Washington, DC have already passed therapy bans for youth. Beckwith says Massachusetts could be the first to add the abuse definition. Lawmakers in Maine and Colorado are also considering therapy bans for youth right now. LGBTQ advocates have argued for years that therapy that allows youth to discuss their concerns about unwanted same-sex desires or gender identity issues is harmful.

            This is just appalling. I'm surprised no one has managed to get this to the Supreme Court yet. Kind of glad, though, since we've still got Ginsberg allegedly hanging around.
