            If this comes to pass we will all be the better for it.  The truth shall set us free, except for those that lied about it.  I and others that I know have been praying for JA safe being.  Let's hope he is in a good hiding place to save is life.  I will be sitting in front of my lap top tomorrow evening waiting.

            "With the release of this website as well as the information that is soon to be published many people are going to start asking questions. I am going to take a minute to address a few questions but will not follow up with anything more after this.
           </p>
           <p>
            (snip)
           </p>
           <p>
            A facebook group was created called "Where is Julian Assange?" from said group a number of people involved started investigating very heavily into all of the details surrounding Assange's disappearance as well as the information that was being tampered with on Wikileaks file system. During their investigation, they were able to extract 15,000 John Podesta emails that were never published as well as discovered the passwords to two of the WikiLeaks Insurance files when one member successfully broke into the email system used by the original members of Wikileaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lead person running the investigation decided what they had found was too risky to release, if Assange was still alive and these were the only things keeping him alive, he would surely be killed as well as had concerns for his own safety.
           </p>
           <p>
            They immediately stopped investigating any further after only having a chance to review less than 1/5th of the contents and decided it was best to let the professional activists do what they do best to avoid becoming targets themselves by these very dangerous people.
           </p>
           <p>
            As time progressed we reached the point we are at today, The US Government is continuing to engage in pushing this very false information and the truth must be exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lead member of the investigation from the Facebook group has decided to move forward with releasing all of the information uncovered as if Assange was around he would want nothing more than to protect the safety of the people of the United States but also the entire world from these dangerous politically motivated actions these people are about to make on false information and the free spread of information under freedom of the press.
           </p>
           <p>
            This brings us to today the very early morning of December the 13th, when this site is now live. Everything has been put in place to ensure the distribution of this information is successful and the world will soon know the truth about all the dirty actions of Obama's Administration, the Clintons and the rest of their group of "elites". The information uncovered will be published here at FindingAssange.com for download as well as emailed to 125 unbiased journalists personal email addresses and another 50 media outlets as well as copies of everything have been provided to 15 activists to ensure its release.

             Biggest hole I see in this story is that the E-mails were hacked out of Wikileaks by Facebook users, fucking lol. Anybody with the ability to do that would not incriminate themselves using cuckbook.

              I was really excited about this but am thinking it over.  I will have egg on my face for I just read this whole thing to a friend.  ARGH!!!   Usually I am more skeptical but this was such good news.  Lord we all could use some really good news about this whole mess right now.  I am hoping and waiting for a really good Christmas present for all of us.
