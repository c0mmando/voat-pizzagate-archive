            No, comet pizza has always erroneously maintained that they were "family friendly," which is very different than an "all-ages" show.

            Pizzagape, while it seems this is not what one might first imagine, thank you for posting it, anyway.  Better to put things out there than not doing so and missing something.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might want to drill down a bit here, anyway. Even if this poster isn't the same as "family friendly," it doesn't mean there are pedos wrapped up in this somewhere.

            All ages does not mean "family friendly." It means people who are under 21 can come as they will separate the alcohol area from the show/stage.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you've never been to a rock show at an all-ages venue, you really should not join the conversation because you sound like a really stupid fuck.

            All ages for a show at a bar
            <strong>
             is normal
            </strong>
            .  I'm floored that this comes up so often.
            <br/>
            And now the website has noticed all the traffic, called pizzagate alt-right, and altered the page. Embarrassing!
            <br/>
            For those of you thay have never attended a concert at a bar: All Ages means you do not have to be 21 + to attend the show, as you would usually need to be to enter the bar. Period. No pedo code.
            <br/>
            It is a way to let underage kids know they can see the show. Anyone too young would still be turned away, like any concert. This is a dead, retarded end.

             Edit: I wrote this analysis and after a bit of thinking about it... is it just me or are there seemingly a comparatively large amount of Satanistic themed bands in the fucking DC area? I'm not certain what the ambient amount would be for such a city, but I doubt other cities of comparative size have such a thriving Satanistic scene that they're putting on concerts on the reg. Especially given how large the black population in DC is, and how stratified the city is, socioeconomically.
            </p>
            <p>
             I typically see something more along the lines of:
            </p>
            <p>
             "under 21 must wear a wristband" or "18 plus" rather than just "all ages"... just because it's more descriptive.
            </p>
            <p>
             IDK what the bar laws are in DC, but there are plenty of states where it's absolutely can be illegal to have people of "all ages" at a
             <em>
              bar
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't
             <em>
              know
             </em>
             the legal status of an unaccompanied 12-15 year old at an establishement that contains a bar, especially around the time that the concert would be happening.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, legal or not, it doesn't seem like it would advisable to suggest that you're cool with it happening in your bar.

            You guys have obtained neofag levels of retardation with this thread. You are looking from an outsider perspective of the metal/punk/thrash subcultures.
           </p>

            "All Ages" because a lot of the people going to the shows are under age. They can not drink. And are going to a bar. Which means it has to be an "all ages" night. Often times a band will have members (quick look at Red Death and they look like they could be under) that are underage also. For them to legally play the show it must be "all ages".
           </p>
           <p>
            As  for the satanic iconography, its meant to bother normies. It has nothing to do with pedos. Punk and metal are often anti-religious, defaulting to being offensive as a first attack to tell people to fuck off (kinda like voat is with SJWs) if they can't deal with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a punk who has been going to shows since I was 14, this shit is hilarious. Thanks for the tunes though.

             The problem is there seems to be some people that are taking it well beyond satire, trolling, or making some other politically tinged statement that obstinately has some rationale behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
             When people start making their lives and careers about getting deep into the woods with Satanistic branding, I think it's fair to revisit the assumptions that they're doing it to "raise awareness" or "stir shit up".
            </p>
            <p>
             Many may have been 30 years ago when it was sort of vogue. But now we have every right to start asking questions like:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               why do you put so much time into this particular form of branding (Satanism), when literally almost zero people of faith have made a big deal about it in decades.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               If this is all a big "fuck you" message, isn't there easier and louder ways to say that than to spend large portions of your career/life imitating a cult?
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Who could you reasonably believe cares that you formed another offensive band that would justify the effort? There's got to be better ways to piss off your family than this...
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Basically, people are starting to question whether these are actually just "trolls" of if they're really more akin to "effort posts" in some way.
            </p>
            <p>
             The main problem though, with telling people to look the other way, is that that's what the proliferation of this degeneracy makes people do. It creates a smoke screen through which it's impossible to detect real bad motives from the mundane. I refuse to believe that this is just some historical accident, where we just happen to wake up in [current year] and be inundated with fucking would be pretend satanists.

            I don't really get why all ages needs to be put on there. If there wasn't an age restriction you wouldn't need to specify? Unless of course you knew how adult the flyers looked or meant something else.

            I've been to Black Cat on many occasions.  There is nothing "pedo" I've seen/sensed about the place.  There is nothing there of interest to children.  An "all ages" show on Thursday, December 8th, 2016 is a bit strange from a show/gig standpoint.

            Oh shit... the symbols on this one. We got the creepy screaming demon mask with the big eyes and circle mouth... an adult with a crying child... oozing wounds, negative standards.... BBC (hardcore), and a hand holding 3 lightning bolts... but that gets into MK territory.

             It's not FOR kids, you fucking idiot. It's for all ages, which does not mean they're targeting fucking toddlers. It's a show at a bar and typically 16-20 year olds will go since they can't go to non all-ages shows.

              Oi!! chill the fuck out... did you not see my response to the person who responded rationally explaining the same point??

             <p>
              I'm not american and live in Europe so the concept of needing to explicitly say the bar and stage are separate is both foreign and retarded to me you fucking ass wipe. grow some fucking manners!!

               That's what you get for developing an opinion based on not knowing what the fuck you're talking about.

                I've been on pizzagate since the end of october. I helped archive Alefantis's insta before it went private back on 4chan and have been digging at this shit non stop since cuz I've been chasing the elite pedo network  since before Savile died. I've fought off shills galore but you [clearly not a shill] have put me right off. Great way to keep the community support going.

                 Be less of a knee-jerk dipshit and you'll do just fine. The shit you posted in this sub makes this investigation look like a fucking joke, so I think you're probably breaking even with any contributions you may have made.
