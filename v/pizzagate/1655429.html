<p>The Article mentions she isnt the only gov official moving to the social media business. Chris Lehane, who has worked with top democratic officials from Kerry, to the Clintons, Goldman Sachs offiials and Gore along with a bunch of Hollywood celebs has been working with AirBnB. I looked more into Lehane and saw that he \'Crisis control Expert\' that coined the term \'Right-wing conspiracy theory\' and co authored the book &quot;Masters of Disaster: The 10 Commandments of Damage Control&quot;. Now back about 10 years ago, Madonna hired this guy, Lehane, as her PR guy when her Charity in Malawi, Africa called Raising Malawi was outed as a scam when they found out that over $3 million was unaccounted for by the manager at the time Philippe van den Bossche, who was Madonnas personal trainer. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/25/madonna-malawi-charity-squandered-millions">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/25/madonna-malawi-charity-squandered-millions</a> <a href="http://www.showbiz411.com/2011/03/25/madonna-kabbalah-center-hires-masters-of-disaster-pr-firm-to-protect-image">http://www.showbiz411.com/2011/03/25/madonna-kabbalah-center-hires-masters-of-disaster-pr-firm-to-protect-image</a>    
</p>
<p>Now, Charity was set up by Madonna and the Kabbalah Center of Los Angeles. Kabbalah is a religion practiced by many elites with weird connections of devil worship. There are even pictures of Madonna and Ashton Kutcher with Yehuda Berg (he is the founder of Kabbalah\'s son who has been charged of sexual assault ).  
</p>
<p>Raising Malawi is a school for young orphans there but Madonna wanted to adopt which led her to run into some problems.. <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/madonna-malawi-2011-5/index2.html">http://nymag.com/news/features/madonna-malawi-2011-5/index2.html</a>  Here is a snippet of the article: &quot;By 2006, she had also decided that she wanted to adopt kids from Malawi, too. For most of us, this would have presented a problem: Malawi does not allow international adoptions to prospective parents who have not lived in the country for at least 24 months, fearing that its vulnerable children might be exploited by child traffickers. After much wrangling, a judge ruled that Madonna’s role as a charitable giver in Malawi made her a special kind of personage, one to whom the laws of the land did not apply.&quot;  
</p>
<p>I say we do some more digging into these names and see if we can find some more connections with the podestas and also check into this sketchy charity. I dont know helpful this is but I am going to keep digging some more.  <a href="http://www.raisingmalawi.org/">http://www.raisingmalawi.org/</a></p>

            Yes, I hope everyone keeps chugging along, as well. Even to the extent of investigating every state CPS office, and every suspicious adoption agency. Every child is important, and we might as well work to hold everyone accountable for the work they are supposed to be doing on behalf of the safety and welfare of children, or their shit needs to be shut down! Peace, my friend! Godspeed to you and fellow citizen investigators working to uncover the truth!

            The problem with the weird religions is that they invites anyone and everyone, especially if they are famous.  Philip Berg, who is dead now, was a former insurance salesman who turned into a scholar of Kabbalah in just a short time.  Scholars take years and years to study whatever it is they are studying and they don't pass it on so easily.   Kutcher is no different than any other snottywood slime...no different.  He is also idolized by god knows who, his acting is mediocre at best, which is interesting why he was picked to make this presentation.  He doesn't have much clout with the masses....or does he?

            The Shadow Gov is at work guiding the narrative with breadcrumbs. Keeping people engaged, thus controlled.That's what they think. It feels like there's a cosmic unraveling going on. Unraveling in a good way, like unknotting. One of these IC characters in a recent interview brought up Nixon, how he was setup with Watergate because he was trying to stop the CIA Deep State, or Bankers or both. I don't remember. But that before they could do that they had to get his VP, Spiro Agnew, out of the way otherwise he would have carried on the Nixon agenda. Now we meet this wholly dissociative Cathy Agne providing loads of bread crumb leads. I think some personal power inserted herein would be a big plus to move the narrative to what you want not what someone else' s good idea that you then adopt wants.

            Thank you. I, for one, am not as tech savvy as others, but I've learned new skills just working on trying to save the children. And, I appreciate anyone who appreciates even the smallest nugget of information that either ties up loose ends, or ends up pointing us in a different direction. I sincerely appreciate your appreciation for everyone's efforts, when they are sincere, of course. Shills don't count for fucking anything. And, over-zealous mods suck.

            Guess who was hired for a lobbyist job at SNAPCHAT: Heather Podesta + Partners. January 2014
           </p>
           <p>
            The startup has enlisted lobbyist firm Heather Podesta + Partners to help with communications. Snapchat will work with the firm toward "educating policymakers regarding the application's operation and practice," according to its lobbying disclosure.
Snapchat's hiring of lobbyists comes as privacy experts called for an investigation from the Federal Trade Commission, which could levy fines.

            Pokemon Go developer hires Heather Podesta
Posted by Keturah Hetrick on Oct. 13, 2016
As the company faces controversy over Pokemon Go security updates, Niantic, the software-development company behind the popular app, has hired Heather Podesta + Partners to lobby on its behalf.
According to a lobbying disclosure, Niantic is lobbying on "issues related to privacy, data security, copyright and intellectual property." The company has generated controversy over a Pokemon Go security issue involving access to its in-game maps.
As of June, Heather Podesta + Partners firm founder Heather Podesta had reportedly raised nearly $350,000 for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. She is the ex-wife of lobbyist Tony Podesta and ex-sister-in-law of John Podesta, chair of Clinton's campaign.

            Look at this headline: “After Aa Powerful Lobbyist Intervenes, EPA Reverses Stance on Polluting Texas County's Water.” That's a story from the news organizations ProPublica reporting that a big energy company wants permission from Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, for a large-scale mining project in Texas that would pollute a pristine supply of drinking water.
So the EPA says no, can't have it. The big company hires Heather Podesta who's a big time lobbyist, a big time fundraiser for Democrats who was married at the time to another big Washington Democratic fixer named Tony Podesta, who used to be president of the liberal organization People for the American Way.
Through their connections these two have become the king and queen of influence peddling. Lo and behold, some months after the industry hires Heather Podesta, EPA reverses itself and the company gets an exemption and is allowed to pollute the aquifer. To hell with the public health. This is routine, isn't it?
DANIELLE BRIAN: And it's exactly what you're talking about with the pay to play. So it's, in this case you have companies that have the money and the resources to hire the lobbyists or the lawyers who will go to battle for their clients endlessly. I mean, those of us who are working on the other side in the public interest realize that when we have our wins which we get industry is going to be there and they're going to keep going and fighting because they have those endless resources to keep battling back. TL;DR.

            Well, there is Kabbalah with its 10 circles, but then there is the Qliphoth, which is like the left-hand path version, based on death.  This page specifically calls out Skull and Bones society and the Bohemian grove:
            <a href="http://miriadic.wikia.com/wiki/Qliphoth">

            There is this huge text file which describes ceremonies and all kinds of nutty stuff.   One of the themes is that you can get some kind of magical power over other people, which is the kind of thing that I think the Podestas etc may be into.
           </p>

            Sounds a lot like Spirit Cooking:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Twenty-two members of the group entered the room, all dressed in 
robes of black, blue and dark purple. A circle was formed consisting of thir- 
teen men and women in robes while the remaining nine members disrobed 
and formed a square of three rows within the circle. In a solemn manner 
they all consumed what was termed the ‘Wine of the Sabbath’ — I was not in- 
vited to participate in the sacrament. I later found out the wine consisted of 
red wine, menstrual/vaginal secretions, semen, black pepper, juniper — and 
possibly some form of hallucinogen, though no one would confirm this last 
ingredient. 
The naked mem- 
bers were performing sexual acts on themselves including masturbation, the 
insertion of what looked like soapstone effigies of various totems into their 
vaginas and anuses, removing said effigies and sucking on them and wiping 
them across their bodies.

we channel the powers of Death to favor us in every way.

             There is a sharp increase in killings of people with albinism in Malawi, according to a report by Amnesty International released on June 7, as the group called on authorities to do more to protect albinos.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The report shows that people with albinism are being killed for their body parts that are then used in ritual practices. Amnesty says the attacks against albinos has surged over the past 2 years. Four people and a baby were killed in April this year alone.

            I was involved with this center when I lived in LA... all they wanted was money money money... it was a cult and the people who went needed serious attention and they were very "hipster weird." If I was told that half were pedophiles I wouldn't have had a second thought believing it

             Scientology, Catholicism, Kabbalah, Mormons all use the mind against its followers. All to varying degrees. It's like an MK Ultra offshoot w Scientology and Kabbalah in particular. Think about the comparison to "confession" in the Catholic Church and "auditing" in Scientology. It's a mind fuck. Obviously a book could be written about all of this but main point is that in each instance their are an upper echelon where the "rules" don't apply, who work to subvert their members and get their money.

            This is a huge important area for everyone to investigate. Kabbalist are the corruption of Judaism. One of the reasons people are so misinformed is this historical misinterpretation where Old Testament doctrine was copied by evil and knew doctrine was created. Research these historical truths about the Torah "Old Testament" bloodline. The crucifiction and resurrection "sacrifice" and who copied or made evil or demonizezes this one historical/spiritual figure.
