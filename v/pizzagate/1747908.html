<p>It is shocking for many to find out that the United States of America is a corporation ruled from abroad. Its original name was the Virginia Company and it was owned by the British Crown (it should not be mistaken for the Queen, which functions largely in a ceremonial capacity only).</p>
<p>The British Crown donated the company to the Vatican, which gave the exploitation rights back to the Crown. The US Presidents are appointed CEOs and their business is to make money for the British Crown and the Vatican, who take their share of the profits every year.</p>
<p>The British Crown covertly rules the world from the 677-acre, independent sovereign state, know as The City of London. This other Crown is comprised of a committee of 12 banks headed by the Bank of England. Guess who is controlling the Bank of England? Yup, the Rothschilds!</p>

            That's really scary to think that the Vatican is tangled up with all of these Satanic elites. No wonder so many priests molest little boys. So, Catholics are being fooled? Because, from what I've seen on tv, it's like they worship the ground the pope walks on. It's all so confusing because the Illuminati hates Christianity, so you would think they would be enemies.  I guess that's their trick.

            It's important because it explains some of the protection he's been receiving and adds another known satainst to the Rothschild's family.

            Hey- you are missing one of the best pieces of interesting evidence about this.
            <strong>
             Remember the video showing that the Rothschilds formerly owned a property where Alefantis was a registered voter?
            </strong>
            (And also that he had 5 or so voter registrations)   Here is the video, watch the whole thing once but the rothschild thing is at 1:20.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peKiUksSCKc&amp;t=186s">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Isn't that a pretty striking coincidence?  I thought that sealed it pretty well above and beyond the family resemblance.

            Alefantis has been groomed for his current job his entire life. He was born into a satanic pedophile family he was obviously abused as a kid and taught that it's perfectly normal and natural to do those things. He is surely a CIA asset he's being protected by very powerful people but at some point they are going to realize it's easier and cheaper to get rid of him to suicide him. He's damaged goods and I am shocked he's still alive. Hopefully not for much longer.

             The photo is really the main reason for this post, and all that matters. an earlier post about this photo get deleted, so I had to kind of beef this up to get it past the mods &lt;eyeroll&gt;

             It was the space between the smile and the cheek that got me - from there you look at the forehead, and everything else, and there is nothing but similarity. I don't look this similar on any point in my face to ANY of my blood relatives. So if they aren't very much related, i need someone to explain this to me.

Same wide eyes.
Similar wide smile.

            It's right in front of everybody.  Of course he is the DNA of the Rothschild line.  What else could explain the blanket MSM false narrative? This is not about covering for any particular person, such as Podesta, Hillary, Alefantis... It's about keeping the financial structure of the planet intact and preventing the masses from realizing they are generational slaves to Satanists.

            Money is the root of all evil.  These clowns have used Sabbetean Money Magic bullshit to corrupt the whole world.  They have to be driven out.  I say pick one fairly large Island and isolate them there.  Madagascar is a hell hole.  Put them all there and keep them at a pre electical level.  No computers no phones no TV or cameras.  Just plenty of knives and see who survives in ten years.....then give them a Soviet style show trial and dispatch the one who are left.

            For sure. I do think it would be worth investigating further. We've been frustrated to no end by the lack of action on this case. If he is a Rothschild, and if we study what that family is actually about, it would answer so many questions. The fact that it would answer so many lingering questions and anomalies makes me think there's something to this.
