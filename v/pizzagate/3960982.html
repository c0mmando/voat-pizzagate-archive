<p>This post is an update to the Ed Buck arrest thread from last year. Four additional felonies have been added.</p>
<p>“LOS ANGELES – A federal grand jury today returned a superseding indictment charging Edward Buck with four additional felonies, including that he allegedly enticed victims – including a man who died at his West Hollywood apartment after he administered drugs to him – to travel interstate to engage in prostitution.</p>
<pre><code>      Buck, 65, was arrested in September 2019 after being charged in United States District Court with providing methamphetamine to a man who died after receiving the drug intravenously. Since that time, federal authorities have continued to investigate Buck for additional crimes.

      The four additional counts charged today – bringing the total number of charges in this case to nine counts – include one count alleging that Buck knowingly enticed 26-year-old Gemmel Moore to travel to the Los Angeles area to engage in prostitution. Buck allegedly provided methamphetamine to Moore, who overdosed on the drug and died on July 27, 2017.

      Buck also is charged with another count of enticing another man to travel with the intent of engaging in prostitution.

      The superseding indictment also charges Buck with one count of knowingly and intentionally distributing methamphetamine, and one count of using his residence for the purpose of distributing narcotics such as methamphetamine, and the sedatives gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and clonazepam.

      Last year, a federal grand jury returned a five-count indictment charging that Buck “engaged in a pattern of soliciting men to consume drugs that Buck provided and perform sexual acts at Buck’s apartment,” which is a practice described as “party and play.” Buck allegedly solicited victims on social media platforms, including a gay dating website, and used a recruiter to scout and proposition men.

      Once the men were at his apartment, Buck allegedly prepared syringes containing methamphetamine, sometimes personally injecting the victims with or without their consent, according to the indictment. Buck also allegedly injected victims with more narcotics than they expected and sometimes injected victims while they were unconscious.

      Another victim, Timothy Dean also suffered a fatal overdose in Buck’s apartment, on January 7, 2019, the indictment alleges.

      Buck is scheduled to go to trial in this matter on January 19, 2021. His arraignment on the first superseding indictment is expected in the coming weeks.

      An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in court.

      Each of the charges alleging the distribution of narcotics resulting in death carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison and a maximum penalty of life without parole. The four new charges carry a statutory maximum sentence of 60 years in federal prison.

      Buck also faces charges, including operating a drug house, that were filed last year by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office. Buck is currently being held in federal custody without bond, and the federal case is expected to proceed first.

      The federal case is being investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the FBI. The investigation is being conducted with the support of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.

      This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Chelsea C. Norell and Brittney M. Harris of the International Narcotics, Money Laundering, and Racketeering Section.“

             Guaranteed there are many more bodies in Ed Buck's past. Serial killers don't suddenly start doing their thing when they are in their 50s or 60s. More likely their 20s, so there would be a long trail of ODed corpses. He made a good choice of victims in selecting disadvantaged, gay Black men. Much less chance of families or friends pressuring police for an arrest.

            So the cops never investigated (or couldn't find proof) of the allegations of two additional murders against Ed Buck in Charlotte, North Carolina, site of the Democratic National Convention, back around 2012 as hinted at on CDAN:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "SATURDAY, JANUARY 12, 2019  Blind Item #4
            </p>
            <p>
             This serial killer, because lets face it, that is what he is now despite always being referred to as a campaign donor should be asked about the two deaths about six or seven years ago in Charlotte under the same circumstances. The only difference was they occurred a few days apart and in hotel rooms."
            </p>
