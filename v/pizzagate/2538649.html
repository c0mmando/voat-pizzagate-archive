<p>In September 2015, Ng Lap Seng was charged in Manhattan Federal Court lying about why he brought $4.5 mln in cash to the US. He said it was for &quot;art, real estate, and gambling.&quot; However, his interpreter later admitted the cash was for &quot;illegal purposes&quot; -- but, those purposes remain secret.</p>
<p>According to the reports, Ng was visiting a very wealth Chinese businessman on Long Island. This person, I believe, is Qin Fei, who is also believed to be a Chinese intelligence agent: <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-bribery-probe-uncovers-suspected-chinese-agent-1471621609">http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-bribery-probe-uncovers-suspected-chinese-agent-1471621609</a>
It seems this Fei guy is like Ng\'s handler.</p>
<p>Here\'s where it gets interesting. Fei and Ng were caught trying to bribe Former UN General Assembly President John Ashe, of the twin Caribbean Nations of Antigua &amp; Barbuda. These two countries are HOT BEDS for trafficking. The U.S Dept of State calls it a &quot;destination &amp; transit country of men, women, children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor&quot;

<p>Some may recall that just a day before Ashe was set to testify in the bribery case, he was found dead with a barbell on his neck: <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/07/un-official-accidentally-crushes-throat-testifying-hillary-clinton/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/07/un-official-accidentally-crushes-throat-testifying-hillary-clinton/</a></p>
<p>That\'s the &quot;indirect link&quot; to trafficking. One of Ng\'s Chinese hotels, Fortuna, was linked to organized crime and trafficking:

            Ng was sentenced on Fri., May 11, to 4 years, forfeiture of $1.5 million, and restitution of $302,000:

            "Federal sentencing guidelines called for a 20-year sentence. Prosecutors urged Broderick to imprison Ng for at least 6 years, arguing that he was interested in profits, not philanthropy, and whatever good the case did in spurring UN reform would be lost if Ng got a slap on the wrist."

            I did a post on NG over a year ago. He goes way back to at least Chinagate with the Clinton crime family, just ignore the Bahara stuff because I was wrong and he's most likely one of them.

            Was checking to see if you are still around and in your comment history saw you just commented on this very subject with Molly and Seth and John in Great Awakenings.  Could you please copy your comments into our thread here.  I don't like doing that without asking.  It is so very relevant since the sentencing of Ng Lap Seng is coming up soon.  TY.  You are amazing.

                According to Town Hall, Rich had previously worked on the U.S. Senate campaign for Nebraska businessman Scott Kleeb. “The Clinton Global Initiative provided funds for a clean energy business started by Kleeb, which had come under investigation after losing $300,000 in 2010 and another $300,000 in 2011 despite the subsidies,” asserted Town Hall, adding that “Rich was also previously employed at a data firm that had worked with the Clintons.”

            Some may recall that just a day before Ashe was set to testify in the bribery case, he was found dead with a barbell on his neck:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I have always felt that Ashe's death was also connected to Molly MacCauley and Seth Rich.   I believe somehow the knew each other.  MacCauley knew Ashe and possibly Rich knew MacCauley.

              FBI Memo-  The official story is that the laptop was retrieved by the police and has since stayed in their custody. My source says that is true, but he says there is a twist. The Police couldn’t unlock the laptop and called the FBI for assistance to unlock it so a Tech was sent out to unlock the laptop and during that time the FBI retrieved the information off of Rich’s computer. There they found 44,055 emails and 17,764 attachments. Why has no one until now come forward with this info?   WHOA!

              Wow!  Everything you listed is like going back in time for me.  Back to reddit Remember those deaths Jones, Ratner and McFadyen who were all connected to Assange.  Is not Amal Clooney a Human Rights Lawyer too?  Just had to, sorry.  In the case of Lucas there is the Perkins Coi law firm also connected.  I also remember that former Amb. Craig Murray claimed he was the one Seth Rich passed the emails to in the park.  Some tried to attack that but I think Murray is a crackerjack and I have read his blog.  Yes, John Jones.  Supposed to have jumped in front of a train.  I read the whole case.  Amazing.  Victor Thorn shot himself on his Birthday.  Yeah sure.

                Ah, finally I may understand what happened to a college classmate of mine. She was murdered the weekend before the Seth Rich murder. She was a satellite expert who lived in an upscale Baltimore neighborhood. Stabbed to death, while walking her dog. She was a big supporter of HRC and, just maybe, she stumbled across something satellite related that got her Arkansided? Maybe this was it or did she realize that cell towers are being used for more than phones and texting? I am almost afraid to even write about this. She is the closest person I have known who ended up dead under shady circumstances. (Before going to work with satellites, she was a big public policy wonk).
