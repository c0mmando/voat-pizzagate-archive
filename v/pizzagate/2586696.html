There’s no doubt the city has been harmed by illegal immigration, that illegal immigration is all too often <em>human smuggling</em>, and that this kind of criminal activity benefits the drug trade.  
</p>
<p>If there is child sex trafficking in Tucson, my hunch is that it\'s tied into the overall illegal immigration issue.  I think some discussion of why this is happening and who’s helping it is important.  This is, imo, a situation where the supply chains exist for other reasons, and if something’s going on, it’s because those supply chains can be exploited and/or directed to bring in.</p>
<p>The Sonora Desert is dry, high, exposed, and miserable.  It’s not easy country to cross in the best of conditions, and even though Tucson is about an hour’s drive from the border, crossing that land on foot can be a death sentence.  It’s not a prime crossing location, or at least, it shouldn’t be.  However, Arizona sees HALF of all illegal crossings along the entire southern border (<a href="https://www.fairus.org/issue/societal-impact/immigration-arizona">https://www.fairus.org/issue/societal-impact/immigration-arizona</a>).  
</p>
<p>This started in the early 2000s.  I’m not sure why, as there seem to be a number of theories (Border Patrol crackdowns on cites, California tightening its own border security, etc).  I might go as far as to say that this might have been an intentional ploy to “blue” up the hard-red state of Arizona through the same kind of demographic change that California is experiencing.  Whatever the cause, Tucson saw all kinds of activists move in or step up to deal with the “crisis”.</p>
<p>I propose we look at these organizations.  There are a few that provide direct aid in the form of watering stations and supplies along the border. It’s high-profile; in 2007, two of these organizations signed an kind of agreement with Mexico allowing them to provide aid south of the border (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070427125921/http">https://web.archive.org/web/20070427125921/http</a>://www.azstarnet.com/sn/border/137512).  At the very least, it’s a place to start.</p>
<p>Humane Borders:
<a href="https://humaneborders.org/">https://humaneborders.org/</a> Humane Border puts out water stations in the Sonoran desert. While well-meaning, what this does is help create easier routes to major population centers. It looks like they have some former Washington DC denizens on their board of directors. They were founded in 2000 by a Rev Robin Hoover (<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2002/07/thirst-justice/">https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2002/07/thirst-justice/</a>), who was the pastor of the First Christian Church in Tucson. They are a 501(c)3 organization, and while they claim to do nothing illegal, Border Patrol has arrested their members on occasion for transporting illegals.  
</p>
<p>Also, they put out a report on their website claiming around $65K in yearly donations, but do not mention that they receive grant money from Pima County.   I found this in an article from 2006 (<a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/635196270/Volunteers-fight-arrests-for-aiding-illegals.html">https://www.deseretnews.com/article/635196270/Volunteers-fight-arrests-for-aiding-illegals.html</a>) but amounts of $22-25K show up on the 990s as recently as 2014.  The 2014 report on their website does not report this amount.  This grant money was possibly approved under this guy: <a href="http://webcms.pima.gov/government/board_of_supervisors/supervisor_richard_elias_district_5/">http://webcms.pima.gov/government/board_of_supervisors/supervisor_richard_elias_district_5/</a>, but I can’t definitively verify that.  I find this weird; where did that money go and why wouldn’t they put it in their newsletter?</p>
<p>Another thing I found highly interesting is their Migrant Death Map.  They publish this in connection with the Pima County Medical Examiner\'s office.  Since 2000, they\'ve recorded over 2300 deaths.  Of those, 149 were minors (under the age of 18).  Of those, most died of exposure, but 22 died from blunt force trauma.  Most of these have their location listed as &quot;vague,&quot; meaning the exact place of death is unknown.  I\'d be interested to know either a) if there is a discernible pattern in those deaths and b) if things have been under-reported, altered, or bodies moved.</p>
<p>No More Deaths:
 <a href="http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/en/">http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/en/</a> They offer legal services in addition to water stations, and are connected to the Tucson Unitarian Church.  They also have members who have been arrested for aiding illegals (<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/eight-humanitarian-volunteers-no-more-deaths-charges">https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/eight-humanitarian-volunteers-no-more-deaths-charges</a>).  That last article also suggests that Border Patrol has been previously tolerant of their activities; this would indicate to me that perhaps orders were coming down from higher up to not interfere with the organization under the last administration.  Their list of allied organizations can be found at this link: <a href="http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/allied-organizations/">http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/allied-organizations/</a></p>
<p>On the surface, none of this appears to be intentionally connected to child trafficking.  And yes, nobody wants to see people die in the desert regardless of national origin.  I’m sure most volunteers are well-meaning.  It could even be a resource to do further research into other things.  However, there may be some connections via affiliates, sponsors, volunteers, board members, or political allies that could be using these (and similarly-minded advocacy groups) for the sake of control.  I do find strange that in a city where the medical and educational systems are stretched near to the point of failure by illegal immigration, grants are provided to organizations that facilitate it.  
</p>
<p>That’s my two cents.  There are camps and bodies scattered everywhere out in the desert.  People die, people are left to die, and people are straight-up murdered out there to the tune of hundreds a year.  One camp can’t be the only starting point, as this is <em>not an anomaly</em>.  I would find it very strange to discover that while many organizations that are intended, on paper, to fight human trafficking facilitate it, while organizations that make it easier are perfectly clean.  The two above organizations make absolutely NO attempt to even address the idea that human trafficking even exists.  I just think it merits further research, or maybe there are connections to be made off existing information.</p>

            Clearly ignoring the facts and just claiming you grew up in Tucson is shill territory. Since everyones so spergy like "Esoteric" claiming proof has to be given show me you driver's license, BC, I want 3 witnesses and all your addresses 10 years in the past to make sure you are legit. Also Everything just said if you were a Tucson resident is false. Thousands testify to that, abductions and trafficking outside the us at staging points happened all the time. Also human smuggling is a concealed way its done. You trying to mix "illegal" aliens" aka finance slaves and sex slaves for the cartels fits right in too as on behalf of their partners Cemex they do child sex trafficking in the tens of thousands all over. Congrats on pretending the illegal alien issue is somehow different, when in reality its the same thing being much of the IA stuff and sex abuse that occurs is all the same operation apart of a bigger nest of operations. When you say illegal alien what you mean to say is sextrafficking, child sex trafficking, and economic slave trafficking. Which is in reality 70% of the traffick into and out of the US on the South Border. Nice try guy, Nice try.

             Naturally there are things left there by the families. He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absolutely no evidence, that "this is a place where children are being kept prisoner." He then proceeds to go around the local area telling people living in the desert that these are "child trafficking" nests.

             Illegal immigrants, dope smugglers, and human traffickers are using some the same trails and same waypoints. They probably encounter each other on a regular basis. Everybody has to get across that desert alive and they probably use some of the same trails just like people have used the same trails across the wilderness for centuries.

             I think this guy found his 15 minutes of fame, the donations are pouring in, and he is milking it for all its worth. I have watched over 30 of his videos and sometimes he has the "crazy eyes" and rants like a meth head. "his God is coming to kill all the evil people" etc...

            <hr/>
            <p>
             No doubt there is some terrible shit happening out there but this guy is a nut case that brands anything he finds as "child trafficking" whether it is or not..

              Your smears and uneducated garbage rambling as given you not answered a SINGLE THING I have shown to be true shows how creepy, immoral, you are. There is whole fucking group down there of real people. And you obsessed with baseless character assassination. The video you speak off is clearly legit as it him documenting the facts of the hold locations as demonstrated by this Youtuber who unlike is convinced of the sick shit and hasn't even SEEN the trafficking child sex site.

              We are two days into arguing and you refuse to stop sperging. I worked with Border Patrol, I helped train them on gear, I went out with them. You are clearly not paying attention and have no idea what you are talking about, straw grasper....even the the straws you grasp at are gigantic telephone poles stikikng in your eye saying child sex trafficking. 2,000 DOLLAR SEPTIC TANK BURIED IN THE GROUND CONCLEAED and the newer construction they were doing seen by homeless that reported it to VOP....pathetic. "Abandoned" no being used for sick shit, "Homeless" NO hardcore criminal operators with rich estates and loads of money and vehicles. You are the one that started this by engaging in falsehoods you and the other low information types fanboying bullshit faked low IQ shill YT vids from feds, Shareblue and etc. Wise up. That cemex site was used for DRUGS, SLAVE, AND CHILD/HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING, that fucking base was a child holding area for vehicles going to Mexico and headed to the Interior. The books, docs, and map proves it. Also ol' cowboy sperging, but you continue to deny reality. Show your true colors.

            Very cogent analysis and thank you for taking the time to write this. I pulled this nugget from what you wrote.

             Of those, most died of exposure, but 22 died from blunt force trauma. Most of these have their location listed as "vague," meaning the exact place of death is unknown.
             <strong>
              I'd be interested to know either a) if there is a discernible pattern in those deaths and b) if things have been under-reported, altered, or bodies moved.

            Me too. If we mapped those on a mapping program, and there is a cluster in a small geographic area, that would mean we have menace in that area.

            You couldn't be more a shill if you tried.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing of what you said jibes with any known patterns of frontal cortex processing. Let's see if I get this right:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             I live in Virginia.
            </li>
            <li>
             There's a huge percentage of children that are disappearing from Virginia.
            </li>
            <li>
             There are children disappearing because they run away from home.
            </li>
            <li>
             I've never personally seen a child actually disappear or run away from home.
            </li>
            <li>
             Therefore, the kids disappearing from Virginia are part of the overall pattern of runaways.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Is that about it?
           </p>
           <p>
            All I can say is:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             I've been on Voat since the beginning of pizzagate.
            </li>
            <li>
             I witnessed the HUGE pushback when members began to question Comet Pizza.
            </li>
            <li>
             The pushback is nothing compared to the pushback on what VOP found.
            </li>
            <li>
             There's something HUGE going down in Tucson.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            P.S. to the narrative writers: PLEASE come up with better narratives than this!!! I know the phony Russia collusion fantasy is still going, but only because the people who believe it are half-asleep. If you're going to try to win us over, I insist you come up with better scripts. Thank you.

argue that this transformation is the result of several linked factors, including the 
waning  of  Marxism  in  the  social  sciences  after  the  1970s,  the  so-called  ‘cultural
            <br/>
            turn’  in  academia,  and  a  growing  emphasis  on  micro-  and  meso-level  analysis
            <br/>
            –  including  framing  and  network  analysis  –  in  social  movement  studies  proper.
            <br/>
            (It  is  also  possible  that  some  scholars  in  the  USA  have  avoided  the  conceptual
            <br/>
            vocabulary,  if  not  the  concerns,  of  Marxist  political  economy  for  fear  of  not
            <br/>
            being  published  or  tenured.)  Our  aim,  here,  is  not  to  criticise  cultural,  framing,
            <br/>
            or    network  analysis,  but  simply  to  point  out  that  these  have  efffectively  –  and
            <br/>
            unnecessarily 
–  ‘crowded  out’  a  concern  with  political  economy  in  the  fĳield.  As
            <br/>
            a  result,  a  number  of  promising  causal  mechanisms  linked  to  the  dynamics  of
            <br/>
            capitalism  are  no  longer  even  considered  worthy  of  attention  by  movement-
scholars."
