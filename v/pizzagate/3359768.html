<p>I was looking for german connections to Pizzagate and went through Epsteins Black Book. I looked at the phone numbers, +49 being the country code for Germany.</p>
<p>The following 2 connections arose:</p>
<p>-Heinrich and Milana Furstenberg (Full name &quot;Von Fürstenberg&quot;, they are Princes)</p>
<p>-Astrid Kohl (apparently ex. german chancellor Helmut Kohl\'s niece)</p>
<p>I started looking for Astrid Kohl but could only find a doctor. Since a phone number for Paris was listed I searched &quot;Astrid Kohl Paris&quot; and found that she is now Princess Astrid of Liechtenstein who has a home in Paris.</p>
<p>The Fürstenbergs have a website with their family but not too much info.</p>
<p>Looking for a connection I stumbled on a royal gossip forum: Getty, Astrid Kohl and Fürstenberg Connection</p>
<p>Funny how good marriages can run in the family. Take Marie-Chantal\'s sisters: Pia Getty,28, who recently married Christopher, the son of Ronald Getty; and Alexandra,22, who has just announced her engagement to Prince Alexander von Furstenberg, the achingly handsome son of Diane and Prince Edward Egon von Furstenberg. \'They\'re not very interested in Americans,\'a \'friend\' was quoted as saying in American W, in whose pages the Miller sisters are a permanent fixture: \'No title, no accent, no play.\'</p>
<p>Friends include Prince Dmitri of Yugoslavia, Alex Nicolai, Anna-Louise Herrera (daughter of designer Caroline), Alessandro Corsini and his wife Michelle (nee Kwaitkowski) and Astrid Kohl, the niece of Helmut and the sort who, it was once commented, \'buys Renoirs when she is depressed.\'</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia Prince Alexander von Furstenberg is related to Heinrich Furstenberg. I just can\'t find the exact relation.</p>
<p>So Astrid Kohl is/was friends with Marie Chantel Miller whose younger sister is married to a Furstenberg, and whose other sister is married to a Getty.</p>
<p>Here is an older voat post about the getty museum in Los Angeles. [<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2925239">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2925239</a>]</p>
<p>I know this is incomplete but I can\'t figure out any other connections right now. Might come back to it later or maybe someone has some info that fits in as to why Astrid Kohl, now a princess and the Princes of Furstenberg are listed in Epsteins Black Book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here\'s what else I just found:</p>
<p>Junkermann was in a relationship for a long long time with Patrick Graf von Faber Castell from the pencil empire.</p>
<p>Here are some pics of him, looks like he could be related to Epstein, almost a brother? I might just be retarded though.</p>

<p>-&gt;Nicole attended a party from Helmut Kohl with Patrick. That\'s the second time I have found a connection to Germanys ex-chancellor Kohl.</p>
<p>I read elsewhere that she still manages one of their I believe French business together and she was bridesmaid at Patrick\'s new wedding. Weird</p>',

            About the Junkermann Group, which he founded together with his then fiancée Nicole Brachetti-Peretti, the Family Office was a silent partner in Infront Sports Media. This involvement earned him much negative media attention, as his business partner Robert Louis-Dreyfus allegedly abused the company for bribes to FIFA officials.[2] Infront was sold to private equity firm Bridepoint in 2011 by the consortium of shareholders for approximately 600 million euros.

            Your sources are old and outdated on the Duty Free heir Miller sisters as they are well into their late 40s early 50s now and 2/3 sisters are divorced. Pia Getty is divorced and has 4 entitled do nothing but write comic books and paint shitty art, sing and travel brats in their early 20s. Another son openly called Londoners on the streets vermin, how charming. Alexandra Von Furstenberg was cheated on and divorced by the time her second kid was born by playboy loser Alexander Von Furstenberg son of Diane. This son (who has an addiction to young models) more recently went to the White House thinking he could fix the financial crisis by making people pay more tax on their income that will go into a future retirement fund for them upon turning of age so the government won’t have to contribute but the question everyone is asking is which of his Jewish banker friends is going to have their hands all over this money and how much of a cut is Alexander getting from this (this man boy is EVIL). Alexandra Miller has two children in their 20s who do absolutely nothing but vacation constantly. The snooty daughter has a small overpriced fashion line made in China and claims its sustainable. Alexandra remarried and none of the family really accept her interior designer husband being a common man from California. Most delusional of all is Marie Chantal who is married to Pavlos of Greece but they are not Princes and Princesses like they want you to think. They have 5 kids eldest age 23 youngest around 12 all they do is permanent vacation on yachts and estates totally out of touch with reality. Pavlos thinks he works as a banker and claims to have made $450million last year alone in investments, think about that. Recently the entire family went to Japan with Astrid Von Liechtenstein and her teenage daughter who runs GreenTeen teenagers helping green the world while the family flies around in private planes and helicopters. Her husband, Alex Von Liechtenstein runs a pharmaceutical company. They reside in Milan now. Astrid is frightening looking, think Mothers of Darkness. Interesting that it’s been well speculated that Marie Chantal and Astrid suddenly became close the last few months.

            <p>
             ..This year, Barad is one of four women at the conference speaking on a panel titled "Women and Business," along with Washington Post Chairwoman Katherine Graham, former Disney/ABC Cable Networks President Geraldine Laybourne, and fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg. ABC's Prime Time Live co-host Diane Sawyer will moderate. (Pleasant T. Rowland, who just sold her doll company to Mattel in a $700-million deal engineered by Allen &amp; Co., is the other female executive guest, though she will not be on the panel).

           <p>
            Graham, Laybourne and Von Furstenberg also have been executive guests at the conference before.
            <strong>
             Von Furstenberg runs in media circles
            </strong>
            as a close friend of Barry Diller. And it helps to be an Allen &amp; Co. client. The investment bank is actively raising money for Laybourne, who recently started her own production company with her former lawyer--Lisa Hall, who left her practice--to serve the quickly converging Internet and television worlds...

            She runs in Cult of Medea circles too.. wish I could remember where I saw the phtoto which really ties her in with the Eurotrash circle..

            This takes us straight back to all the connections on the side of Junkermann's husband Ferdinando Brachetti Peretti and also the House of Borromeo:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Prince Heinrich zu Fürstenberg was born in 1950 at Heilingenberg Castle in Seeheim-Jugenheim, Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1985 their second child, Prince Antonius, was born.[1] In 2010 his eldest son married Jeannette Griesel.[5]
             <strong>
              His younger son married Matilde dei Principi Borromeo Arese Taverna in 2011

            Here's a tip : Getty Images to find connections of these Eurotrash... and also the Grimaldi family .. the royal family of Monaco look to connections there...

            Pity, I was just looking through all of them a couple of days ago.  I should have saved the connections.  The aristocratic Italian families.

            Getty Museum also supports the Vatican.  I was going to do another post but am afraid it might crash Voat again.

            Something else to look at, Princess Caroline of Monaco runs an international charity for underpriveleged children called AMADE.  They focus on Africa.  They work with the RED CROSS.
