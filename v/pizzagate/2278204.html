<p>Today\'s Blind Items - The Web
Ever wonder why one widow looks like she is grieving every day, all day, and the other looks like she is getting ready to party all the time? Well, lets go back in time a bit to the first widow. We all know she is a black widow who only cares about herself and her survival. Right up there with that is how much she loves money and fame. So, when a couple of people came to her and offered her a great deal of money to make some of her past crimes and foibles go away, she was all ears. When they offered her a chance at her own reality show down the road, she really listened. When they told her that her A- list (PJ) celebrity husband was going to divorce her and enforce that prenup, she was 100% on board.
They provided her with drugs that were much stronger versions of the ones her husband used to take. Her job was to get him hooked again. They told her exactly what to do, and how to do it every step of the way. When that first wire transfer hit a relative’s bank, she was the most enthusiastic helper ever. She might not have been there to commit the actual crime, but she was part of the conspiracy to kill him and she has had no problems with the money and fame she has received after his death. She is so greedy and so concerned with herself that she never even asked more than a few questions about why anyone would want her husband dead.
Contrast her situation with another widow. A widow who became one not that long after the first. She was married to an A- lister (RJ) herself. She would never have done anything to harm her husband. Nothing. Someone could have offered her millions of dollars and she would say no. Every day she grieves for her dead husband. She grieves for her family. She also grieves for the people that her husband and the other A- lister were trying to help.
Her husband was an inspiration to so many troubled youth and teens. Naturally those people reached out to the A- lister when they struggled. About a year or so before his death he was told by one of the teens that he had been sexually abused. The teen talked about others who had all been abused at the hands of the same group of people. The teen named some names and our A- lister knew who some of the people were. In fact, he knew one of them really well. That one is a permanent A+ lister who has been known in the past to make his problems go away permanently. When our A- lister approached him, the A+ lister advised him to not pursue things any further and to let the matter drop. It was shortly after that conversation that our A- lister talked to his friend PJ and told him what the teens had said and his conversation with the A+ lister. At that point, PJ and RJ went and spoke to the A+ lister. This time, they were warned more strongly and threats were made about their careers which the A+ lister could destroy.
PJ and RJ started interviewing the teens and recording the interviews. No one knows how that information got back to the A+ lister. Did PJ or RJ or both send him a video? Howv</p>',

            Almost everyone agreed it was Cornell Bennington and Geffen.  Geffen has the money and the power to pull this off.  Btw, we have talked about how Geffen may be behind R. Kelley's operation and I just heard this morning on the news that all of Kelley's belongings were stolen or taken out of his Georgia Mansion while he was away.  Yeah, just all "stolen" and taken away in a huge truck.  Wow.

             comments on that blind are saying Bennington was J. Podesta's son??   They do bear an uncanny resemblance.
            </p>
            <p>
             The link here to the Podesta's is really bizzare, but the CD&amp;N folks know their stuff.

              I  remember so many posts on here discussing Chris Cornell's death and a couple times we discussed his involvement with some priest in either Oregon or Wash. state and it was a place for troubled teens. So right away I thought Bingo!  This is about Chris and Chester.  Yes after reading all the posts about their backgrounds and family life there is no other answer.  I remember shills on here also trying to hang he pedo name on Chris or Chester as well.  Knowing Geffen, that sounds like his MO.  Yeah, the answer has to be Cornell, Bennington and Geffen

               What do you think of the theory that Bennington is J. Podesta's son?  A side-by-side image search comparison is eerie.  There are complete theories about this out there that are new to me.

                I think the likeness is uncanny.  If there ever was a Spitting Image Situation, this is it.  Did you see the post about Marlon Brando and Michael Jackson and the idea that MJ might have had one in his circle of friends donate sperm for a child?  So, really the subject also came up with bringing in different blood lines, etc  It really is kind of Kooky when you think about it.  But whatever the answer, these people have been doing all kinds of bazaar things as we are finding out.  Yes, Podesta could very well be Chester's father.  His mother did have an affair with him while she was married to Chester's stepfather.  Basically what came out on CDAN is that allegedly Geffen had Cornell and Bennington (the son of JP) killed. Nothing matters when Power and Money get in the way. Wow.

              He may just have.  Also there are 3 others that were mentioned. These fires in Cali are very telling.  Very.  Murdoch's house burned down.  I am waiting to hear more news.  Many have been forced to leave their homes.  Paris Hilton is one.  Waiting for Getty Museum.  Everyone keep your Eyes and Ears Open.

                  It is all slowly coming out.  There are now Accusers and also people that seem to want to print the truth, for whatever reason.  We have CDAN taking the lead, so we have to make sure as we are today to keep posting about it whenever there are names put out there.  People come on here everyday checking us out.  This is where they will find the truth.  Our truth is constant and honest.  Most people can tell who is real and who is not.  We have to keep putting the word out there where we can.  That is our Judicial System for now.  We cannot trust those in the courts to do the right think right now.  Many courts and judges have been infiltrated by the Deep State.  We do the best we can.
