<p>Susan Kleinberg\'s ?&quot;Kairos,&quot; ?at the Alliance Francaise for the opening of the 2013 Venice Biennale, derives from work with the scientific team of the Louvre over the past year. ?It is a landscape of possibilities in deep migration.

These images were filmed through the Louvre\'s Hirox microscope from elements related to an enigmatic Mesopotamian figure. ?They are an avalanche of the possible, microcosm and immense in space, from the center of what we don\'t know to the implications of imagination. ?Slowly unraveling beyond descriptive, they reach to an almost undulating, disequilibrating atomic level, in deep color.?</p>
<p>This Mesopotamian figure, Ishtar, is a major goddess, rubies from Burma in her eyes and navel, with her palm outstretched in the classic gesture of offering, an invitation into the work. ?The unraveling images are an excavation through borders, an essential comment on location of perspective. ?

<p>Ishtar - According to Enciclopedia Britannica</p>
<p>&quot; Ishtar’s primary legacy from the Sumerian tradition is the role of fertility figure; she evolved, however, into a more complex character, surrounded in myth by death and disaster, a goddess of contradictory connotations and forces—fire and fire-quenching, rejoicing and tears, fair play and enmity. The Akkadian Ishtar is also, to a greater extent, an astral deity, associated with the planet Venus. With Shamash, the sun god, and Sin, the moon god, she forms a secondary astral triad. In this manifestation her symbol is a star with 6, 8, or 16 rays within a circle. As goddess of Venus, delighting in bodily love, Ishtar was the protectress of prostitutes and the patroness of the alehouse. Part of her cult worship probably included temple prostitution. Her popularity was universal in the ancient Middle East, and in many centres of worship she probably subsumed numerous local goddesses. In later myth she was known as Queen of the Universe, taking on the powers of An, Enlil, and Enki.&quot;</p>
