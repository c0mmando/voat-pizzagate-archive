</p>
<p>Lord has been on the City of London Court of Common Council since February 2001. He is now chair of the City\'s Establishment Committee, leading on workforce and <strong>inclusion policy</strong>.  His idea of \'inclusion\' is ensuring that men who don some lipstick can access women\'s bathrooms, toilets and refuges. </p>
<p><a href="https://edwardlord.org/blog/">This</a> is his blog, in which he says he\'s a freemason member of many masonic lodges. His call for inclusiveness and gender diversity is restricted to places designed to keep women safe; it clearly doesn\'t extend and apply to exclusive men\'s clubs. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/l5K5msW">This</a> is his tweet championing Professor Plummer, PIE member, and current sociology professor at the University of Essex. Plummer in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/10948796/Paedophilia-is-natural-and-normal-for-males.html">this</a> stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. “The isolation, secrecy, guilt and anguish of many paedophiles,” he wrote in Perspectives on Paedophilia, “are not intrinsic to the phenomen[on] but are derived from the extreme social repression placed on minorities …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plummer is saying that we are repressing little children by not allowing them to have sex with adults. Poor pedos are \'anguished\'.  He goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Paedophiles are told they are the seducers and rapists of children; they know their experiences are often loving and tender ones. They are told that children are pure and innocent, devoid of sexuality; they know both from their own experiences of childhood and from the children they meet that this is not the case.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, he\'s saying that children are \'sexual\' and NOT pure and innocent. Plummer advocates \'male intergenerational intimacy\', which is incest between fathers and sons. The article continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recently as 2012, Prof Plummer published on his personal blog a chapter he wrote in another book, Male Intergenerational Intimacy, in 1991. “As homosexuality has become slightly less open to sustained moral panic, the new pariah of \'child molester’ has become the latest folk devil,” he wrote. “Many adult paedophiles say that boys actively seek out sex partners … \'childhood’ itself is not a biological given but an historically produced social object.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/paedophilia-in-academia-ken-plummer-university-of-essex/">Plumber was member no. 236 of PIE</a></p>
<p>Sociologists, psychologists and psychotherapists such as Pat Califa, Dr. Meg John Barker and Gayle Rubin, are proponents of Judith Butler\'s Queer Theory. Rubin claims that restricting child abuse videos is oppression of a valid sexual orientation. Queer Theory Queer promotes pedophilia as a transgression, as an inter-generational romance and as sexual diversity. This is our future folks.</p>',

             Pope Francis has been influenced by The Pedagogy of the Oppressed, a book that sought to spread Marxism among the peasants of Latin America. The Alinskyite left in America regards that book as a classic. The author of the book is the late Paulo Freire and Pope Francis has made a point of visiting with Freire’s widow. The meeting was set up by Cardinal Hummes, the Brazilian whom Francis credits with inspiring him to name himself after St. Francis. Pope Francis “considered the meeting with me because of the writings of Paulo, because of the importance of Paulo for the education of oppressed people, poor people, black people, for women, for minorities,” Ana Freire said.

             Dr. Barker has drawn and celebrated Rubin in her 'Queer: A Graphic History'. Alongside Rubin, Dr. Barker has found Pat Califia's work particularly helpful. Califia was in a sadomasochistic relationship with Rubin and celebrated being published in paedophile journals

             Wow, Polydallas is clearly the pedo logo. They invite people who are into kink/bdsm, and anybody who's 'sex positive'. This means those of us against pedophilia will now be labelled 'sex-negative' and we'll be told we're 'kink shaming'.

                A BRAZILIAN witch doctor has said that Peter Mandelson once held a chicken while he cut off its head as a sacrifice to a pagan god in the Candomble cult. Later the voodoo practitioner was, it appears, asked by Mr Mandelson's friend Reinaldo Avila da Silva to do something to make Charlie Whelan "who is always trying to harm Peter" disappear from politics. The magic man was sent a photograph of Mr Whelan, and - hey presto! - his bad vibes evaporated and Mr Mandelson was restored to the Cabinet.

               The British Association for Counselling grew from the Standing Conference for the Advancement of Counselling, a grouping of organisations inaugurated in 1970 at the instigation of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Membership was extended to include individuals when in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the Home Office Voluntary Service Unit, the British Association for Counselling was founded.

               Derek William Draper (born 15 August 1967) is an English former lobbyist. As a political advisor he was involved in two political scandals, "Lobbygate" in 1998, and again in 2009 while Draper was editor of the LabourList website. He has worked as a psychotherapist.
              </p>
              <p>
               Draper began his political career in 1990, when he became the constituency secretary for Nick Brown. In 1992, he left this job and went to work as a researcher for MP for Hartlepool Peter Mandelson.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                In 1998, while still working as a director at GPC Market Access, Draper was caught on tape, with Jonathan Mendelsohn, boasting to Greg Palast – an undercover reporter from The Observer posing as a businessman – about how they could sell access to government ministers and create tax breaks for their clients.
               </p>
               <p>
                Palast later stated that the subsequent media coverage got his original story wrong, and that it was not primarily about boastful lobbyists: "the real story was about Tony Blair and his inner circle".

                But the biggest scandal associated with Thomson just might be the one that's connected to her husband, Roger Liddle: Lobbygate. In this political scandal of 1998 in which lobbyists Derek Draper and Jonathan Mendelsohn were secretly recorded boasting that they could sell access to government ministers and create tax breaks for their clients, British political figures including Liddle and Tony Blair were exposed as little more than puppets of the lobbying industry an a cabal of 17 elites. Sound familiar? Their organization was informally known as "The Circle".

               Mandelson was also involved in NSPC, which is an organization to protect children. Cheri founded the Matrix chamber, which primarily focuses on human rights, sex trafficking, etc. Ironic, in light of what you posted above about Cheri. I think we can assume attorneys from Matrix chamber working on UN sex trafficking etc are there to give the impression to the public something is being done, while slow walking anything that could really damage all involved...

               Yesterday I ran my training session on kink/BDSM (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadomasochism) to a group of sex and relationship therapists and it reminded me that I’ve been meaning to blog about the exercise I use in these sessions. ..

                An individual gets a rush out of being put in terrifying situations which makes him scream and cry out in fear. He engages other people to put him in a special device which will result in these effects. When his time in the device is up, his face is white and he has tears in his eyes, but he begs them to let him go through it again...

               Finally, it is worth pointing out that many of the activities mentioned are far more risky and non-consensual than the many of the most common kink activities (spanking and bondage, for example). In the training session we go on to explore the evidence against various common myths about kink being inherently dangerous, pathological and abusive.

               Kink and BDSM are straight out of the porn handbook.  Some men get turned on by seeing women in pain. That's why BDSM exists.  If you go to any BDSM  'education' evening (and yes they exist) it's a bunch of dirty old men telling young, curious women that pain is good, and how enjoyable it is to be tied up and tortured.  And some young women fall for it. imho, they are lost and probably have had a traumatic childhood.  They teach men how to tie up women, hang them from the ceiling, sometimes upside down.  They tell women how exciting this is.   I've seen photos of what they do to women. It's sadistic and it's dangerous. They have 'safe words' but I've seen women using the safe word, and the torture not stopping.
              </p>
              <p>
               The proponents of BDSM/kink are evil, as are the supporters of 'sex work'. They propagate the exploitation and abuse of women.  I know Suzzan Blac.  She does amazing work and she knows how sick these people are.

            Also, you need a statement of whatever your Pizzagate thesis is, here. Are you saying he is a pedophile hiding in plain sight? Or that he is actively working to normalize pedophelia through his engagement in politics and sports? Or that this is evidence of a freemason project to corrupt society by normalizing pedophelia and incest? It's not clear why you are putting him forward as a person of interest.

             The nexus is pretty clear:  here we have someone in a position of authority and influence in one of the world's most influential cities, London, lauding and championing a self-proclaimed (and probably practising) pedophile and former PIE member, Professor Plummer of Essex University. This is evidence not only that there are people in positions of power, the elite, those running the show, who espouse 'man-boy love' and would not turn a blind eye but obviously encourage it and most probably partake, but also that it's only a matter of time before the scourge of pedophilia of legalized.
