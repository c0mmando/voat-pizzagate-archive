            This is a pretty good summary of recent Euro pedo scandals. He does reprimand people for saying PG is true - but also tells people who think pedo torture ring aren't happening to shut the fuck up.

             It's fair though; I've been looking at PG since day 1, never have I told anyone online/real life that with 100% certainty there is a DNC/elitist pedophile ring. That being said, I urge people to look at the evidence with the background knowledge that these elitist rings aren't out of the ordinary.

              It's interesting - I don't think there is irrefutable evidence in the PG discoveries - yet. However, the behavior of these DC elites is clearly and convincingly suspect. Placed within the context of the pedo torture and trafficking crimes that HAVE been proved (court docs, admissions, victim accts) and the other crimes that have been committed in DC and covered up and not covered up, the calculated takeover of the media cartel, highly suspect geopolitical activity, the unconscionable waste of public funds, blatant discard of public trust, colossal embarrassment nearly ALL in DC bring to this country, they are either very guilty of or pretending to be acting out sex crimes or they are being framed.
