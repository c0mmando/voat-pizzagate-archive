<p>-The case has all the hallmarks of what we are investigating every day - &quot;The Kellers had sacrificed babies; they held ceremonies in a local graveyard; they put blood in the children’s Kool-Aid; Fran cut off the arm of a gorilla in a local park; they flew the children to Mexico to be sexually assaulted by military officials.&quot; All of which was proven to be true to Austin officials, but now is no longer true, in part because the orginal report &quot;was an ALL-CAPS, run-on-sentence fever dream full of breathless accusations...&quot; and local citizens were accused of being in on it.</p>
<p>-Use the words &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; and the events, child\'s testimony and physical evidence is all laughable rubbish.</p>
<p>-The &quot;victims&quot; of the Satanic Panic will recieve millions in compensation from the state, effectively muzzling the atmosphere of law enforcement investigations into SRA and pedophilia incidents for fear of reprisal, mockery and institutionally programed failure.</p>

            Can you please help with more info on this case? I read the full police report you posted but it starts on page 28 and I can't find the rest. The linked report is mostly  police overview of interviews and investigations. I don't see any reference to search warrants or evidence and I'm wondering what they had.

             I can tell you that after all the investigating and all the info in the police report, the only physical evidence they went to court with was the Dr.'s testimony on sexual assault because of the state of Christina's hymen.  I don't think they issued search warrants but I don't know that for sure.  the Kellers moved very quickly once they knew they were suspected and left the day care house behind.

             I have been working on a post since that one rregarding the many many errors and ommisssions in Jordan Smiths article and it is so dense and compicated I have done 2 drafts and it is still not good enough to post and 16 word.doc pages long!  I was supposed to work on it today but couldn't .   I may be able to post it by the end of the week. But all the sources I have are just things anyone can find on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hope that is in some way a helpful answer.   I am very alarmed by how this case exhoneration has been treated in the media and i have a lot of evidence of media malfeasance in my opinion anyway.    I think that at the time some of this evidence seemed so clear and overwhelming to the police investigating that they felt it was a case of "this is true and real" and they didn't present more physical evidence when they could have.  the young boy who the parents felt had been drugged and came home with rings under his eyes for example, and the many many parents who said their children's clothes were swapped, and they did find hotspots in the graveyard for example.   But over time the pushback has been too persistent and what I'd really like to know is about associations.  I have had so much to look at I haven't been able to look and it is not my strength to look at associations but that defense attorney's association - have they donated to or accepted money from the Clinton Foundation?  Any orphanage defenses?  I found a couople of defenses of pedos but not a huge amount.  Any connections to art dealers? boat owners, Epstein, etc.    and that Doctor.  I read somewhere that he said he would never touch a case like this again with a 10 foot pole.  I think he got real shaken professionally.   Leaned on.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will put something out by the end of the week.   maybe honed down.  If you have any interest in looking up associations of some of the DA, Defense attorneys, Jordan Smith, let me know.   This has been a whitewash and there must have been someone behind some of it.   cheers - VB

I will look into key people this week and let you know what I find.
I'm also going to try to keep looking for the first few pages of that police report as well as any reports on searches. I'll let you know.

               awesome.   I'm so glad you noticed the missing front of the police report - I missed that. Smith made a big point about how hard they worked to get the police report full and unredacted, she accuses the police of trying to keep it secret - then she doesn't reveal 1/3 of it?

               I am working today to try to streamline and focus - your enthusiasm gave me a lift.

            If it was a while ago, you may have to scroll back through several pages of PG Retard alts that have been banned; we have several of those a day, every day. Robert Robinson, our resident house-pedo, is quite obsessed. It's the onerous submission rules that allow us to delete his bullshit posts -- but require us to do the same for all. And it's the Voat User Agreement rules about respecting subverse submission rules that allow us to ban his new alts so he can't accumulate enough CPP to downvoat legit posts and cause real damage -- but require us to do the same to everyone who fails to stick to the submission guidelines. All to preserve free speech and prevent censorship.

             is Robert Robinson an alt name or the real person?  i know you can't dox but just the way it was written it sounded like a person who has been identified as a known pedo.  .

            I have been noticing exactly what you described. I saw a post in the hot section the other day that was REALLY old. Bit, it's happening often right now. I don't know how this works. But, is it the mods that control that sort of thing? Do they have the choice of moving threads around like this?

            Do you have proof of this? It would mean MF is a secretly a Voat admin, which I very highly doubt. A subverse ban -- which is all he can do -- is not "deleting an account". Your comment and submission histories are still intact and you can post anywhere else on Voat with a banned account.
           </p>
           <p>
            Provide proof your account was deleted, or stop spreading disinformation.

            , I have explained to you in the past that mods have no control over the way Voat code works or doesn't work. I realize many of you prefer to take the operational issues of this free platform personally and blame mods, and never bother to ask questions of the people who actually know in

            to find a lower cost solution to keep it alive:

             .NET Core Port (Cross Platform Voat)
            </h1>
            <p>
             We’ve been pushing very hard on porting Voat to .NET Core, as this will give us the most opportunity to cut costs and get more hands and help from the development community.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today we have major news:

             <p>
              Voat has been successfully ported to .NET Core! (2)

              Today’s commit
             </a>
             took care of the last few failing unit tests. What originally was estimated at three months of work was accomplished in less than a month.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            There have been a lot of changes to the code, and all developer attention has been focused on the port, not on fixing bugs.

             Understand very clearly - I AM NOT BLAMING MODS IN EITHER POST - I NEVER EVEN MENTIONED ANY MODS.  You all have stated repeatedly that mods at Voat have little to no power over anything regarding this creaky, broke down site.  .

            <p>
             As for the rest thanks for filling in, but it doesn't seem to apply.  It didn't shift positions, the post disappeared.  Since that never happened to me in over 45 posts, I drew conclusions from the best available information at the time - whatever the reason the post deserved to have legs as there was much more to it than I initially realized and there will be more to come of interest.    I have nothing to add but have a nice night.

            So the THEY that want to squash your post  are ME, the CIA (who it seems like you think are my employer), a buddy of mine (a buddy who I don't know at all) and the Moderators of VOAT.  Is that it?  Did we leave anyone out of your conspiracy?  It couldn't have been that once one looks at the case you are talking about, it easily discovered that you are gave a dishonest  presentation of the facts.

            Look I don't care about what you call me or who I'm thinking of, but, in the name of all that is good and decent, keep the names of Orwell and Leonard Cohen out of your mouth.  Do you really think Leonard Cohen would be on the side of this fraud?

The cutting people with chainsaws?
The feeding children to sharks?
Or that the prosecution committed official misconduct  and hid evidence of some of these wild accusations from the defense lawyers?

             So about that gorilla thing.  Seems like our lovely "expert" reporter Jordan Smith who has covered this case for years LIED about that gorilla thing - certainly misrepresented that.  Stay tuned that will be in the next post along with a whole lot more - "innocents" running for the hills?  jailhouse confessions anyone?

               you again fail to simply follow the narrative - probably didn't really bother to read the post very carefully or at all.  that's okay.  I am only interested in adding to this topic with further posts because my initial one was "lost" as I have described above.  That got me much more interested and it turned up a lot more information suppressed by the Keller fan base of reporters.  No matter what side you take, this case was very messy.

                Just ignore.  This person doesn't even pretend to research.  Clearly not legit and not worth wasting your valuable time, I'd say.

               You can't ping people in submissions, first of all. Secondly, PuttItOut has over 1,000 unread messages in his Voat inbox and doesn't even read it. If you want his attention, make a post on

                 VieBleu, are you saying it is a courtesy to let a guy know you think he's an evil, lying shill while he's fighting for the life of his site,

            Now that I checked, my upvote dissapears when I leave. So I upvote from the main room, then enter the thread, then the upvote dissapears again. The mods are pedo protectors and do damge control for the matrix being revealed in any way. They also deleted my account for repeatedly trying to post a thread dealing with the Banks being the back bone of the cabal, and we should never fund them. A bogus rule violation was cited of course followed by a snarky message.

              There is absolutely no transparency so your questions can't really be answered definitively.  That is in part because whatever is told to us by our "handlers" (mods) is often contradicted by others at the same level, and is generally a tissue of lies anyway.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about it - have  you ever heard of a tech wiz entrepreneur who can code and build a forum website, who wants to supposedly take on Reddit, but can't maintain a simple search engine? And doesn't even have one contact in his milleau who can?  of course not.  The humble search bar is on the most basic of websites, and every complicated website as well.  It is like saying you can build a skyscraper but don't know how to screw in any light bulbs, it is that simple.  It is all a lie starting from the top down.  What's the motive?  To gather the information while crippling the access - to maim and humiliate the effort without totally killing it because it is the best easy source of finding out where the bugs and loose ends are in your system.  We act like street informants here, bringing all of our interesting finds directly to those who believe they are the social controllers - much higher than mods.  We get the small payoff of talking to a few like minded souls, and of hope that incremental awareness spreads.  We get a small social payoff in "points" whoopee.  For me, I like dosing them with their own medicine, putting my message into their essentially frail systems.
             </p>
             <p>
              The handler mods are on a need to know basis, which means they don't know much of anything, except they are conditioned to view us as silly scum conspiracy nuts they are superior to by one caste, and get some experience in their field and maybe some lifeline $ or payoff thrown at them if they keep it quiet - especialy from one another.  As it is down here an atmosphere of fear and distrust, so it is above among the peon mods who are themselves handled- they mostly don't trust each other and will be careful about comparing notes. Some of the naive ones get pumped with fake free speech ideology which motivates and blinds them for a bit, while a caste or two above their heads their .com cult leader and the rest of Silicon Valley is having dirty butt sex on the down-low regularly with the big eye spy government on a bed of knives and money.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your question suggests you still think this place operates fairly or even normally somewhere above you because it is supposed to be for a good purpose.  Stop giving your trust away for free srayzie, it is valuable and should be protected like a mother.

             The level of harrassment is a good gauge of how close you're getting to their most protected parts.  A post I put up once having to do with the City of London (England's banking center) was posted and removed three times.

              The only account I know of here that was deleted was the shill who doxed abortionburger and then made death threats against her to shut her up after she publicized the account of the college kid who said he was raped by Alefantis. Mods have no ability to delete people's accounts. Only the owner of Voat can do that.

                Millennial_Falcon cannot delete anyone's account. All he can do is ban those who fail to respect the submission guidelines repeatedly and spam the board with off-topic non-research posts. It's his job; he did not make the rules. The community made the rules.

            Yes, I have noticed that going on, and it is likely the same cast of pedo defenders and CIA speak shills as always, Vindicator and MillenialFalcon. Those two of obvious compromised integrity, have called 9/11 and Sandy Hook, far out conspiracy theories. They have also mocked PG. There isn't a person in existance who has gone through the evidence of Sandy Hook and 9/11 who believe th official story. they are also known to delete good threads while citing rules violations that stretch credibility. I have also had vindicator leave mocking comments after deleting my original account. You are on the right track, but you can still opperate here, unlike Reddit, who just shut down the entire sub. By the way, as always, good riddance to Abortionburger.

               IMHO no - At least in this thread doesn't have the same language or ticks as Army Seer, who is a fairly extreme one note writer.  Seems like a wild speculation on Vindicator's part, and I've noticed more unhinged behavior by that name lately.  In this thread Vindicator has now accused me more than once of saying extreme things which were not said or even implied.

            Here is more on the Doctor in the emergency room who determined the 3 year old had lacerations - cuts - on her hymen.   22 years later after an appeals court found he gave the only solid evidence, he recanted.  After the evidence was cold and honed down, and they found someone in the neighborhood to say no one ever hung out in the cemetary, he was the only part of the case left.  Was he pressured in any way to "recant"?
           </p>
           <p>
            "However, an appeals court found that the only physical evidence came from Dr. Michael Mouw, a young emergency room physician who examined the 3-year-old accuser in 1991 and testified that internal lacerations on the child's hymen were evidence of abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            In court documents filed in 2013, Mouw acknowledged that what he had thought at the time were cuts were actually normal physiology."

            Interesting bit here, from another article about this DA review and release -
           </p>
           <p>
            "After the review hearing, the new DA was convinced the Keller’s trial had not been fair and they were released just before Christmas. She had no intention of putting them back on trial but could not justify to herself to exonerate them without evidence to prove no crime ever happened. That is virtually impossible to accomplish. Between Dr. Mouw, Jordan Smith, and
            <strong>
             Keith Hampton, who is an attorney that worked without pay for more than six years,
            </strong>
            the Kellers names have been cleared and they are free to rebuild what they can of their shattered lives.
           </p>

             https://conservativedailypost.com/couple-cleared-of-creepy-daycare-charges-after-25-years/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd like to know more about this attorney that worked without pay for 6 years  - how exactly does he make a living would be one.  Who does he know, and how did they find him?  Who else does he represent?
           </p>
           <p>
            this may be him - Keith Hampton, legislative director of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers, also served as President of the organization in 2011.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Why was it so important to Keith Hampton to whittle away at this case until he could overturn it?  Is he a crusader against a "panic" from a quarter century ago?  Why?  Aren't there plenty of recent police brutality, shootings, immigration cases and civil rights violation cases in Texas that are more relevant to today's world?  Especially since there is supposed to be nothing to all this pizzagate stuff anyway, right?

             Here's the transcript of an interview with Mike Ware and Keith Hampton of the DA's Office talking about their backgrounds and early cases.  Ware is on the board of the Innocence Project.  He talks about his friend Terri Moore recruiting him from private practice to head the Conviction Integrity Unit (as you said, SO Orwellian sounding):

             </a>
             At one point the interviewer says, "You guys have clients you can bill, right, to pay for your pro bono work?"  Hampton just says "Next question" and laughs.

              "We came up with some creative ways to work this process, a private lawyer working with the Innocence Project. We do the work, the lawyer work, and they contribute the support. So when we get into a corner or something, we go to them and say, “This is where we’re at, we need some help, can we draw on some resources here?” That’s exactly what they’re doing, so we’re actually developing a model for how you do it and these will be the relationships between innocence clinics and the crazy lawyers who are going to go ahead and march into these cases."
             </p>
             <p>
              If I am understanding this correctly - it is "The Innocence Project" that pays the lawyer bills to get these people off.  Privately, so no disclosure on the payments or who they actually come from, but I'm sure they do a little fundraising and get other support which they may or may not disclose.  Funds can also be hard to trace this way if used for bribes, campaign contributions to certain very friendly DAs, judges, whatever, right?
             </p>
             <p>
              Is it possible to call yourself "pro-bono" only in the sense that the client isn't billed?
             </p>
             <p>
              This article could be a post in itself, a couple of shady things seem to lurk... I mean "Innocence Clinics"?  Now we are out of Orwell territory and on to Vonnegut.  Welcome To The Monkey House indeed.

               Well, I guess that's why Hampton laughed when the interviewer asked about his pro bono work.  It's not pro bono for him.  Notice he didn't explain the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               I found out that the Innocence Project is a national organization with state branches:
               <a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/about/">
                https://www.innocenceproject.org/about/
               </a>
               They use DNA to exonerate.  Most of their cases, if not all, have sexual components, although sometimes they don't list that in the conviction charge and you have to read the details of the case to see it:
               <a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/all-cases/#exonerated-by-dna">
                https://www.innocenceproject.org/all-cases/#exonerated-by-dna
               </a>
               I'd like to see a comprehensive big-money donor's list.  The Florida branch published their 2013 list, and one of the top contributors was....the U.S. Department of Justice.  Yes, your tax dollars and mine.

             Check out Keith Hampton's website with a promo for "Southwest of Salem," an Investigation Discovery film involving some of his "best work" about four girls who were accused of satanic sexual child abuse:
             <a href="http://www.keithshamptonlaw.com/">
              http://www.keithshamptonlaw.com/
             </a>
             It also mentions that more of his work will be included in a documentary on the Kellers.  Here is "Southwest of Salem":
             <a href="https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/southwest-of-salem/">
              https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/southwest-of-salem/
             </a>
             Here is info about a Keller documentary but not sure if it's the one referred to on Hampton's website:
             <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4087350/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl">
              http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4087350/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl
             </a>
             Also see:
             <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4087350/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl">
              http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4087350/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl
             </a>
             The NY Times review of "Southwest of Salem" says it is shown as a cause for the Innocence Project of Texas and for Debbie Nathan, a journalist also seen in “Capturing the Friedmans,” a film about a Long Island family caught up in sexual-abuse allegations:
             <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/movies/southwest-of-salem-review.html">
              https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/movies/southwest-of-salem-review.html
             </a>
             Innocence Project of Texas probably has its fingerprints all over Keith Hampton's crusade to protect satanic abusers.  His work is not confined to Texas, though, so we need to find out whose else's deep pockets might also also be funding him.  It's worth keeping Debbie Nathan in mind as a person of interest too if she's an apologist for abusers.  Here is info about "Capturing the Friedmans":
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capturing_the_Friedmans">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capturing_the_Friedmans
             </a>
             Doesn't sound like there was a satanic element in that case.

              Here is one respected critic of Nathan and the organization she is wedded to which aides and abets pedos slip from justice - the NCRJ.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               This response also documents how Wood, Nathan, and Beck have misapplied the term ritual abuse, misstated the facts of many cases, and promoted “mythical numbers” that significantly exaggerate the number of false convictions. These critics are wrong about the only three cases they discuss in detail. The McMartin Preschool case began with credible evidence of child sexual abuse that continues to be distorted by critics. The Keller case began with even stronger medical evidence that is not diminished by the dubious and incomplete “retraction” of the Emergency Room doctor. The Fuster case involved overwhelming evidence of abuse, medical and testimonial, that continues to be distorted or overlooked by critics. Those who promote the witch-hunt narrative rely on selective use of evidence to reach an apparently predetermined result. That is politics and advocacy, not scholarship. This dismissive approach to children’s testimony has caused documented harm to children.

              He has a very meticulously written book on how the "Witch-Hunt Narrative" is made up by those trying to destroy the credible evidence of several important SRA cases and pedo apologists.  He also speaks frequently with child protection committees and law enforcement.  Glad he is out there.

             Great work.  The answers to these questions could really lay open the filthy underbelly of operations in Texas and beyond.  Thank you for being a bulldog and insisting this get exposure.  I'll be looking into the people you've identified.

            That is how it has always been in the so called
            <em>
             criminal
            </em>
            justice system (let that name roll around in your head for a moment), and exactly how it is meant to be according to the regulations of the republic.  In some cases and places, the victims are still free to pursue legal action without support of the DA's office. In other cases their only choices are to either accept their victimhood, or to risk running afoul of the regulations  by enforcing the law and restoring justice with their own hands.

             I have to admit I know little about how the injustice system doesn't work.

            <p>
             It seems like new DAs would come in and "undo" old cases all the time, motivated for example by political reasons or to do favors for being elected.  perhaps they do, but we don't hear about it all the time.  perhaps they don't as a matter of public relations, and so it takes a real important push and $$$ to get someone in who will do it for you.
            </p>

             I would be very interested in hearing the survivor's side of the story on this as well as her parents.

              I've noticed this quite a bit with other boards.  Usually upvoats take a couple of to fully run across the database, but if it's been more than that amount of time I'd consider that rather suspicious.

            this is interesting - similar thing happened the other day to Blacksmith21 in reference to the Seth Rich murder and an article about evidence of his social media accounts being geleted and disappearing, also looking into his "Panda" nickname.

            When was the last time you heard of someone accused of heinous, horrible crimes like this and wasn't guilty?  Even if they got off on a technicality.  Oh I know....OJ was innocent.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Kellers are as guilty.  Chits and favors were called in by the Deep State which were set in motion years ago.  The Kellers remained silent and for their silence, they were eventually let free on an arranged technicality - courtesy of blackmail material (NSA domestic surveillance program beginning to surface) available to the Deep State in a SCIF somewhere near the White House.

             It happened many, many times during the same times these folks were convicted.  When fraudulent "cult experts" were working with therapists and law enforcement.  When the women's movement joined in and said we must always believe the children.   Before we understood about how to interview children, before the research on false memories and false confessions was known.   This was  common phenomenon.     How understanding of memory in general is light years from where it was 20 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             There were zero reported cases of Satanic Ritual Abuse before 1980 when a psychiatrist out of British Columbia wrote a  book about the "true story" of a woman who after years of therapy and hypnosis "recovered" memories of her mother abusing her as part of a Satanic cult.  During these years of therapy and hypnosis the doctor and the patient left their marriages and became romantically involved.   The therapeutic "recovering" of memory being based on another book with dubious therapeutic techniques, Sybil.   The climax of this "true story" was when the girl was part of a Satanic ritual that went on for 81 straight days.  When reporters went to check out this "true story" they found the girl was actually in school with regular attendance during this time she was missing for 81 straight days.  She also claims that the Satanists killed someone and fake a car crash to cover up the death.  She claims she was in the car with the corpse.  Again there are zero records in the local papers about any such crash when even small accidents would get written up.
            </p>
            <p>
             The author of this dubious book became an expert, lecturing to other therapists and to law enforecement.  He was on big national TV shows
            </p>
            <p>
             Over the next 15 years after this hypnosis-induced "true story,"  there were tons of cases of Satanic Ritual abuse report.   Most were like this.   Fantastic and unbelievable accounts that when looked into were always about fearful and panicked adults coercing children into "admitting" the horrible things that happened.  Not understanding that by not believing the children at first, the children's stories would change, in fact, their memories would change to come up the "right" answers the adults were expecting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is an actual expert reviewing the interviews in this Texas case.

             The Kellers did not get off on a technicality.  The have always been innocent of the charges and the state finally realized that.  I say of the charges and not of the crime, because in this case, no crime occurred.

               I was not referencing apocryphal stories.
              </p>
              <p>
               It happened to the Kellers in this case
Kelly Michaels in NJ    (she supposedly shoved a sword in a child and without anyone else at that school hearing a thing.)
the McMartins in LA,    (in this case, the children were flushed down toilets to secret rooms, abused in hot air ballons, and Chuck Norris was a special-guest star abuser.)
In Kern County, CA 34 people had their convictions overturned on appeal.    (Why did all these cases happen?   That hoax of a book I mentioned.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases, several local social workers had attended a training seminar that foregrounded satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse, and had used the now-debunked memoir Michelle Remembers as training material.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               In Wentachee, Washington in 1995,  "Forty-three adults were arrested on 29,726 charges of child sex abuse, involving 60 children"
              </p>
              <p>
               The prosecutor could introduce no physical evidence.   30,000 instances of child sex abuse left no physical evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               The fact that case after case after case was popping up like across the country showed something was wrong.  The cases shared something in common.
              </p>
              <p>
               Physically impossible accusations
Therapists or law enforcement who believed in Cults were all over the country performing ritual abuse (in fact, they may have been trained that this was occurred)
Heavily suggestive, almost coercive interviews of children where no was no taken for an answer.
              </p>
              <p>
               No allegations or minimal allegations of abuse from the children before being intereviewed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Because of this, psychologists started looking into children and memory and if interviewers could affect children's memory and they found that they had.  They did experiments where they asked kids if a certain scenario happened.  It was made up and the kids said no. One question was did you ever get your finger caught in a mousetrap and have to go to the hospital. Then, every week they asked the kids if it happened, pretty soon the kids would say it happened and they would paint you a picture of how it happened and who was with them.  Then they did experiments where kids went to see a doctor.  This visits were videotaped.  The doctor did a few specific acts like tickle their feet with a stick and measure their wrists with a ribbon, In the video you below, you'll see after some interviewing a little girl claim the doctor wrapped the ribbon around her neck and was choking her.
              </p>
              <p>
               The experiments proved it was able to plant false memories in some children through suggestive questioning and that children can come up with graphic and violent and sexual scenarios on their own.

               There's a reason we study the Salem With Hunts.   it's a genuine issue with people, the witch hunting mentality is something we are capable of.

            that the Judiciary is entirely corrupt is old news, but now they are just making it official. Anyone who thinks they can appeal or find justice will have better luck sucking rope.

              I've noticed before that the pages only go back a few days, and then months-old posts are totally gone when browsing. Sometimes you can find them through SEARCH if you are looking for a specific post. Its the same in DELETED posts, where good stuff is gone for good.

                 What we really need is for a trusted person to run a website, but no one seems to want to take on the grief of such a controversial and sometimes dangerous topic it seems.   So we come back here and thumb our noses at the abusers.  It's an awful symbiotic relationship - they need a few of us around to look legit and get leads after all to justify their jobs and pay.
