            Not looking to be a prick here at all or start an argument, and I'll freely admit to quite enjoying this show for a laugh...
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you're misinterpreting the many references than can be observed in Archer.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example's sake, the MKU mention is hardly in favor of the program. The Tuntmore Manor pool is jarringly similar to the Vanderbilt one(so much so that it's dangerous for the badguys).
            <em>
             Many
            </em>
            other instances exist which honestly come across more as minor red-pills, indeed there's one in particular which speaks volumes to a particular friendly team that has been helping us since late 20
            <em>
             17
            </em>
            (or was it 2016?).
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, I'd implore you to consider the angle that Archer is more 'red-pill' than it is malicious boasting.

             I love the show and I haven't seen many red flags as far as pushing sodomy and child stuff however...The J. Edgar Hoover bit of the "Archer Coma Season" where they still pound on Hoover being a cross dressed.  I always wondered why that was such a long running meme  through Hollywood and it is because he saw the commies and jews and called them on it and they are still spitting on his grave to this day.  That may just be an entrenched artist thing because to be fair I have found more objectionable content (considering this is obviously for adults) in Bob's Burgers than Archer

             I can definitely see it as intentional red pilling, but the skeptic side of me tells me it's the cabal laughing at us. I hope your right in that case, as Archer has dropped several different redpills in the past.

              One thing that does seem eerie, I must admit, is that one episode had Anthony Bourdain as a guest cast member at least a few years before his death.
             </p>
             <p>
              What this might mean, if anything, I'm not sure. But I'm still fairly confident that the show isn't nefarious, given its attitude towards certain subjects and nuggets of history on questionable topics.

              I won't try to press the point though.

               Hmm, was their anything in particular to the episode? Anything that feels off or made reference to PG? I'll look up the episode. You are right though it could be.

                Nah I can honestly say I've never gotten a "PG" vibe from it. The closest I can recall off the top of my head is the anti-MKU stance(Indeed they spend a good 2 seasons constantly ripping on the CIA - one part of the story arch has the CIA masquerading as the FBI and being busted in a drug/weapons ring that aims to overthrow a country).
               </p>
               <p>
                As to the Bourdain episode, nothing really jumps out. Bourdain portrays a high-strung chef, a parody of himself, who ultimately winds up poisoning an Albanian ambassador at the behest of 'the KGB(long story)' who are trying to make ISIS(the spy agency Archer and co. work for) look stupid. 'The KGB' then turns on Bourdain's character right at the end because he annoys them, tipping him out of a helicopter while fleeing the restaurant, presumably killing him.
               </p>
               <p>
                Is all of this a hint at Bourdain's pending death?
                <em>
                 Possibly
                </em>
                , but it was aired long before he died if I'm not mistaken, so as rare as they are, it
                <em>
                 might
                </em>
                be a coinkydink.
