<p>The Satanic Temple was founded by Lucien Greaves, the organization\'s spokesperson, and Malcom Jarry in 2013.  It is described as a nontheistic religious and political activist group based in Salem, MA.  There are many chapters in the US, Canada, and internationally.  Their stated mission is laughingly &quot;to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people.&quot;  The organization actively participates in public affairs that have manifesated in several public political actions and efforts at lobbying with a focus on the separation of church and state and using satire againts Christian privilege that it says interferes with personal religious freedom.  It also views all restrictions on abortion, including mandatory waiting periods, as an infringement on the rights of Satanist\'s to practice their religion.</p>
<p>The first chapter was established in Detroit, MI in 2014.  Chapters operate as semi-autonomous grassroot groups supervised by the Satanic Temple National Council. I was unable to find any info about National Council members, but that certainly doesn\'t mean it\'s not out there.</p>

<p>A partial list of current chapters -  NY (2 chapters listed); AZ; GA; TX (2 chapters listed); MA; IL; CO; IN; FL; MN; LA; OK; CA; WA; MO; ; Canada; Denmark; France; Sweden; and the UK
It is said that the organization has increased from a handful of members to tens of thousands.</p>

<p>Last week, the Satanic Temple was named tax-exempt by the IRS.  The organization provided the Associated Press with a notice it recently received, communicating its new tax-exempt status.  The letter used a code that classifies it as a &quot;church or a convention or association of churches.&quot;  The group is now listed in an IRS database for tax-exempt organizations.  The Satanic Temple says the designation will help in religious discrimination legal cases and allow it to pursue faith-based government grants. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/apr/25/satanic-temple-named-tax-exempt-church-irs/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/apr/25/satanic-temple-named-tax-exempt-church-irs/</a></p>
<p>The Satanic Temple made it clear from the very beginning that they were primarily a political movement.  Its members don\'t even believe in a supernatural entity called Satan.  Instead, they celebrate Satan as the &quot;ultimate rebel.&quot;  They openly tell prospective members that the only real requirement for joining is to believe &quot;in the political and secular actions&quot; of the group, as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;If there\'s a local chapter where you are, to join you do have to be accepted, but there\'s no initiation or anything.  You don\'t even have to be a Satanist, you can just be a strong ally who believes in the political and secular actions without being super stoked about all the aesthetic aspects.&quot;   In other words, as long as you hate Donald Trump, Christians, and conservatives, please join.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that they claim they &quot;don\'t worship Satan,&quot; they celebrate the black mass and conduct pentagram rituals.  This group is growing, and growing rapidly, and their national influence is growing as well.

<p><a href="https://thesatanictemple.com/">https://thesatanictemple.com/</a></p>
<p>There is more to them than meets the eye...</p>
<p>For instance the recent implementation of the After School Satan Club</p>
<p>What do children learn there?  These clubs are &quot;based upon a uniform syllabus that emphasizes a scientific, rationalist, non-superstitious world view.  While the twisted Evangelical teachings robs children of the innocence and enjoyment of childhood, replacing them with a negative self image, preoccupation with sin, fear of Hell, and aversion to critical thinking.&quot;  
</p>
<p>On their FAQ page, they address certain questions.  One of them is, &quot;Is this not a Christian Nation?&quot;  The answer reads, &quot;No.  It is not.&quot; The short video on the website is disturbingly creepy.  These clubs are located in elementary schools and operated by volunteers in Atlanta, GA; Los Angeles, CA; Pensacola, FL; Portland, OR; Salt Lake City, UT; Seattle, WA; Springfield, MO; Tucson, AZ; and Washington DC, and perhaps more locations.</p>
<p><a href="https://afterschoolsatan.com/">https://afterschoolsatan.com/</a></p>
<p>The clubs are being inserted into public schools regardless of existing dissent.  The purpose is to make their presence known &quot;in schools that are burdened with the loathsome stink of the \'Good News Clubs\'  that already exist in many schools. The Good News Club is a weekly interdenominational Christian program for 5-12 year-olds featuring a Bible lesson, songs, memory verses, and games.  It is the leading ministry of Child Evangelical Fellowship (CEF).  In 2011 there were 3,560 Good News Clubs in public schools across the US and more than 42,000 clubs worldwide.</p>

<p>Here is a 5:40 video of an &quot;Inaugural Meeting&quot; of one of these clubs into an elementary school.  It boggles my mind how they can get away with this.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/K4aKjfm7XOk">https://youtu.be/K4aKjfm7XOk</a></p>
<p>There is a monetary campaign underway to continually expand these clubs, and their message is clear:</p>
<p>&quot;Well organized fundamentalist Christian organizations are trying to turn public schools into indoctrination camps for your children.  With millions in funding and a team of skilled lawyers, these theocrats are persistently eroding the line of separation between Church and State... &quot;</p>
