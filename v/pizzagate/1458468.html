<p>Until May 21st 2006
Milan\'s contemporary art comes out of storage and into view in this exhibition of 60 works from artists including Damien Hirst, Chen Zhen, Maurizio Cattelan, Vanessa Beecroft and Marina Abramovic. This show\'s theme—pain—is not very cheery, but you can\'t beat it for interest.
Works include an installation by Mona Hatoum, a British artist, where kitchen utensils turn into threatening, razor-sharp torture instruments; an untitled work by Mr Cattelan, an Italian multi-media artist, of a latex mould of a child\'s hand pierced by a pencil; a photograph from the show “Thomas Lips” by Ms Abramovic, a performance artist from Yugoslavia, of a sleek female belly with a five-pointed star traced in blood; and Mark Wallinger\'s life-sized “Ecce Homo” statue, first seen at the Venice Biennale in 2001.
Spazio Oberdan, Viale Vittorio Veneto 2. Tel: +39 (0)2 7740-6300. Open: Tues-Sun, 10am-7.30pm, Thursdays until 10pm. Visit the website.</p>

So ACACIA owns a lot of this work.
ACACIA is an art collection from: http://acaciaweb.it/
 President Gemma De Angelis Testa and today are part of about one hundred members, among which the most important names of Italian collecting.   The Association was formed with the aim of supporting art and artists Italians and to promote the establishment of a public museum of contemporary art in Milan, through a constant dialogue with the city government. The spirit of ACACIA is to highlight the role of the active collector, assuming the responsibility of a public conscience, working effectively because contemporary art is promoted, preserved and protected. </p>
<p>Through her art collection we find Luca Trevisani.</p>
<p>And honestly through most of her art collections we find the elite enjoying “cattle/animal” death, enlightenment through seeing death through the eyes of one\'s torturers, the gleaming eye.
Luca Trevisani takes the human form and morphs it into plants to show our mortality and to cloak the nasty metaphors of videos such as: 
With pieces like Fire walk with me, Fire walk with me was a torture movie about a kidnapped individual. Luca Trevisani finds interest in the odd application of tools, in a way to uniquely see the world through application...
He likes to metaphorize humans as plants and then – once you understand that, the bdsm/mortality of an individual becomes evident in his work.

            The bitcoin pizza was a real pizza and well known in the bitcoin community. The relatively high price was due to the difficulty of finding someone to accept bitcoin. Nothing to do with pizza gate.

            no one (3k average in 4 years!) listens to their songs (dont spam play their songs or that amount will go up. or screen shot it before you listen to it.)
Why are they located and can play all around so close to DC? How do they afford IT?!
