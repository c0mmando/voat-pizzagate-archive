            You called me a shill for supporting fiona. Before I found out about bond uni - 3 and 6 months ago I was on here calling her a shill myself ;) Time to get off the fence bro.

            That's she only thread she made here. Notice how she avoided all my comments I made against the OTO on her blog, an organization she's already targeted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The comments I attempted to publish on her blog she looked over was here:

           <p>
            Why didn't she approve? Thinks she would be sued? Doesn't want evidence to add more substantive evidence to her claims. She's a limited hangout and gets too much promotion. Her crazy stories get mixed up with more convincing ones like these

            ON THE GAY JUDGE JUSTICE JAMES WOOD AND THE WOOD ROYAL COMMISSION - INTEL LEAKED FROM THE NEW WOOD ROYAL COMMISSION BEING A GAY CHILD RAPING PEDO:
           </p>
           <p>
            Sam Ibraham's family was arrested this week caught working with corrupt Muslim NSW Police that forced their "Speakout" anti-islamaphobia hotline to be shutdown because it's own staff were arabic speaking muslim drug dealers:

           </p>
           <p>
            Sam Ibrahim is the pimp of little boys to gay judges explained in that document above. Hence why he can do what he does - as a top tier drug dealer.

           <p>
            And NOW compare it to THIS DOCUMENT showing the Leader of Australia' gay lobby was trying to shut down the wood royal commission saying to investigate one "innocent until proven guilty" gay pedophile Robert "Dolly" Dunn mass boy rapist is to investigate the whole gay community and is a big witchhunt - so he must be given impunity to rape little boys. Christopher Puplick AM gave 4 submissions to stop the Gay Judge Justice James Wood investigating gay OTO child raping pedos as exposed here:

           </p>
           <p>
            Fiona talks about the same things I say but she doesn't provide substantive proof. She was saying the Wood Royal Commission was a whitewash and her fellow pedo victims started it. I expose who covered it up naming names. She doesn't want anything that supports her theory the Wood Royal Commission was a whitewash because that would bring down the leader of Australia's gay pedophile mafia who is responsible for ordering a man with a dick into a Womens Prison (Noel Crompton Hall) and is already provably responsible for enacting a policy that got 4 WOMEN MASS AIDS JAIL RAPED. YES CHRISTOPHER PUBLIC HAS BEEN TO BE FOUND RESPONSIBLE OF COVERING UP FIONA'S MATES COMPLAINTS TO THE WOOD ROYAL COMMISSION TOO. Does she care? Does she forward my intel on to those victims? I wonder what little boys raped by gay men would want to know about Australia's gay leadership covering up their child sex abuse cases.

            WHY? BECAUSE POOPLICKER AM IS A GAY MAN AND SHE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT A GAY MAN THAT COVERS UP HER BEST FRIENDS CHILD SEX CASES. WE CAN'T UNDERMINE THE GAY AGENDA THAT MAKES EVERY CHILD OF OF TWO GAY MEN TO BE ROUGHLY 80x more likely to be raped.

             Fiona Barnett is working with a faggot shill that did a totally debunked hitpiece on me saying I'm not wanted for arrest contrary to NSW Police FOI GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTATION TO DEBUNK THEM - they claimed they had criminal AFP officers working for them breaking privacy laws.

            <p>
             She runs with Vinny Eastwood, Mark Passio etc ex satanist / leftist shill networks exposed here:

             The FOI officer in this Richard M Hanson was caught operating twitter accounts illegally tweeting about his work and blogging about teaching little boys in Japan, going to japanese gay orgies bars AND blogging about bum fucking the former gay police minister David Campbell (who now runs a preschool chain in Wollongong) on his self-censored blog I backed up) A more senior officer was taken off the case so a homo could be put in charge by my nemesis NSW Police head of couter-terrorism catherine Judith Burns.

               It started with the independentaustralia.net au scum I think. That's truthnews.com.au's and my biggest concerns. It's odd she mixes so much truth with the lies. I even buy her bond university stuff.

                   she claims she tried to write a book about the OTO before the wood royal commission. So much she says is true about a current affair having pedophiles before they got outed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   She has insider knowledge that's for sure. She mixes the crazy conspiracy theories about 3000km tunnels etc because she's with the OTO. She doesn't publish my comments backing up some of her claims because she doesn't want to be validated above a certain level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Just like the OTO sent a bitch after me as I exposed in my recent interview trying to be my friend and stage manage John Sunol - who's linked to the ACL and pedo Fred Nile.

             She's a shill. Her early interview starts with pushing the myth that nazi's made lampshades out of kids.

            <p>
             I've tried to be patient - she's a limited hangout. She doesn't want my own research on the OTO bringing down the judiciary in Australia. She's controlled opposition.
            </p>
            <p>
             See her links to independentaustralia.net - a very suspect globalist side pushing global warming filth. She's a cut out. She runs over to people who are REAL like other male victims, and she mixes up all their stories into her own.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Sutherland Police she dealt with is notoriously corrupt and destroyed evidence in my 60C NSW Crimes Act Case, I have a dossier on them. She's working with them. Why would she report her allegations in a district that she says is pedo HQ herself.

             She's attacking homos here which is good thought. So that's not the reason for her not to talk to me. What is the reason? Reina Michelson I have talked to and she is the real deal. Gorden Myers and the Sydney Gay judge child sex victims ARE REAL. Fiona's story highly doubtful.

             We were just discussing her being a 'limited hangout" I've got the OTO after me personally for exposing their links to the LGBT lobby and pedophilia normalization case law in Australia. I just did an interview about it yesterday.

             By far the worst thing wrong with Fiona is she evolved from the independentaustralia.net left wing filth site. I'm surprised they published this comment only 2 months late:

            "Note – the Australian government continues to hack and remove my abuse drawings. I expect this is because I get up to 100,000 views per day of this page. Each time they disappear, alert me in the comments section to this page and I will restore them and let WordPress know. Otherwise, visit other sites like Cathy Fox’s blog where you will find a copy.

            Prostituted by the Australian government to RICHARD NIXON at RAAF Fairbairne military airport, Canberra. The Australian Federal Police unit ‘Operation Attest’ refused to investigate this incident. They promised to at least investigate and tell me whether or not there was a centrifuge at the base, used to train pilots in – to validate my memories. An ex-military perosn who worked at the base validated its existence instead.

             Fiona's problem is she has just too many different shocking stories. She should have found the strongest allegations first - get convictions and then work on the rest - like this:
