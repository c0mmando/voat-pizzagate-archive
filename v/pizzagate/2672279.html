<p>Relevance: Entylawyer\'s compelling blind item about Heather O\'Rourke has pretty much become a cautionary tale of what happens in PedoWood. I don\'t trust enty, but I did some digging and might have uncovered a bizarre connection linking what was alleged to be happening on the set of Happy Days to an episode of South Park. I\'m just posting it to see if it strikes anyone else the same way because it is definitely weird and those very brave crazy creators of South Park have come out with some compelling stuff. Matt Stone and Trey Parker did reveal some pretty huge subjects including Scientology so there is a history of them throwing hints for us to pick up on so I thought I would throw it out there.

<p>Since I posted a thread on entylawyer, Heather O\'Rourke and Henry Winkler were on my mind. They were mentioned in that post and this morning, I just went digging a little bit and tripped over the damnedest thing.  It was this, the episode where South Park featured SS and Lucas repeatedly raping Indiana Jones. </p>

<p>The first scene is where Indy Jones is raped on a pinball machine ... the next where he\'s raped Deliverance style. I\'ll concern myself with the first one because the scene is taken from a Jodi Foster film &quot;The Accused&quot; in 1988. Based on a true story, the character is gang raped while on a pinball machine. </p>

<p>TOPOR I interviewed 30 rape victims, a lot of rapists, a lot of prosecutors, defense attorneys, scrub nurses. My original draft had the pool table, but the producers were terrified of being sued, so it was changed to a pinball machine.</p>

<p>It just stuck in my head for some reason and I started doing random searches for anything relating to a pinball machine and any of the usual suspects.

<p>If you follow the link, there\'s Mr. Henry Fonzie himself conversing with Heather atop the JUKEBOX!! WTF kind of coincidence is that? It really is about the same thing enty said. But what about SS and Lucas? Where do they come in? Well, I believe everyone knows the O\'Rourke was discovered by SS in a cafeteria and plucked out of obscurity to play Carol Ann in Poltergeist. But what you may not know is that Lucas does indeed have a connection to Happy Days through ... RON HOWARD! </p>

<p>Happy Days premiered five months after American Graffiti was released. It was set in the \'50s, had Ron Howard playing a teen very similar to his American Graffiti character, used &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; as its theme song, and even borrowed the American Graffiti font for the credits. You\'d think that Happy Days was somehow a spin-off of the movie, but you\'d be wrong. It actually began as an unsold pilot in 1971 and aired in 1972 as part of the anthology series Love, American Style. (Lucas watched it at some point when he was considering casting Howard in American Graffiti.)</p>

<p>And in case you don\'t know, Ron Howard was the clean-cut, all-American kid all grown up who just happend to direct a movie about ... CANNIBALISM!!!! Here\'s a link to the family\'s story: </p>

<p>The story of the Essex in particular — the real-life war between man and whale — and its crew have been told many, many times, from the firesides of Nantucket to the pages of Moby Dick, the classic by Herman Melville, who heard of the story of a “vengeful” whale attacking a ship during his own whaling journeys and even met Captain Pollard on Nantucket. Most recently, there’s the soon-to-be released “In the Heart of the Sea” film directed by Ron Howard based off Philbrick’s book. The film portrays Captain Pollard, Owen Coffin and the rest of the crew in their struggle to survive — a story that is bound to be retold in various forms for as long as humans and nature collide.</p>

<p>It\'s good to know Ron Howard is out there in the normalization campaign to destroy America! And whether the South Park Deliverance reference is aimed at Ron, I\'m not sure.

<p>Later on, Mickey and I got divorced, and he moved to Colorado and had another daughter with his new wife. And then I married Rob Reiner, so Tracy came to stay with us—she said we had more TV channels.</p>

<p>Was that the only reason she came to live with you? I found an excellent discussion that I\'m going to scramble and try to find again. Believe they said her daughter was around six?  Yes, nailed it! Found the damn thing! </p>

<p>I don\'t think it\'s Rob, I don\'t think Penny Marshall would have let her daughter be around him if he was a pedo.</p>
<p>Do you know Penny Marshall personally? I don\'t. I do not know what she would allow and wouldn\'t allow into her life or how much she would turn a blind eye. We have no idea if RR hide it well...</p>

<p>Second response:&gt;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>No. But she married to rob when her daughter was 6 and they were married for 10 years. Also from what I read about her(from her book &amp; other sources) one of the few things P seems to care very deeply about is her daughter so I don\'t think she\'d let anything bad happen to her </p>

<p>Like the responder says, there\'s no telling what someone would or wouldn\'t allow.</p>',

            I don't think it's Rob, I don't think Penny Marshall would have let her daughter be around him if he was a pedo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you know Penny Marshall personally? I don't. I do not know what she would allow and wouldn't allow into her life or how much she would turn a blind eye. We have no idea if RR hide it well...

            No. But she married to rob when her daughter was 6 and they were married for 10 years. Also from what I read about her(from her book &amp; other sources) one of the few things P seems to care very deeply about is her daughter so I don't think she'd let anything bad happen to her

           Like the responder says, there's no telling what someone would or wouldn't allow.

            So if the Indiana Jones character is some twisted inside joke/reference to Anissa Jones, then maybe the South Park episode of Indiana Jones being raped is symbolic of Anissa being raped by these a-holes?

             I think there were multiple meanings. Like using the Jodi Foster film. Jodi Foster film. While it was directed at what happened to Heather O'Rourke, it also included Foster allegedly being molested. The same with Deliverance. ''Deliver'' as in ''Delivery''? I'm sure thee's a reference there, but also there's Ron Howard and the red-haired banjo player in Deliverance. The backwoodsy feel. I'm sure it has something to do with being raped in those woods so was there something going on in the set used? Or were they referring to camping? Or somewhere in the woods?
            </p>
            <p>
             And you're, unfortunately, right. Most likely that little girl Anissa was also molested by someone. It's so disgusting.

               It's got to end, but the wall of silence is up. People have to come forward. Either one supersolid person that everyone will believe, or a group that bands together with proof. These are huge names they're going up against. They're icons and you know people's unwilliingness to believe anything bad about someone they admire. I had the same reticence, but for me those emails were enough for the truth to get its toe in the door and open it. Now we need the same type of thing done with this because no one is going to believe anything bad about SS or RR or even SK unless there's definitive proof. And really, for these types of crimes, there should be a high threshold of evidence. You shouldn't just be able to toss that word around and ruin people's lives and reputations so that's how unimpeachable this source and evidence needs to be. And the person and evidence is out there. It just needs to be dumped.

             The more I'm thinking about it, the more Deliverance is the perfect vehicle to pinpoint Howard. Been reading, and the old Andy Griffith show was all down home and backwoodsy. It's what the town in the movie was supposed to be, but they got raped. So most likely, Howard is allegedly a victim who grew up to be an alleged predator.
            </p>
            <p>
             All I know is he sucks as a director, so there had to be something ... someone bolstering his career. And he has that nice guy thing going on. I've given up on using the term "nice pedophile". None of them are nice. There are more violence ones and less violent ones, but they both ruin children's lives. And Comey, I'm still wondering what happened to him that night he was held hostage.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the eye thing ... have no idea ... none! Tooth pulling is another. Why front teeth missing? They're all so sick. I want them locked up so badly. I want their reputations destroyed by their own evil deeds being exposed, and for America to wake the hell up!!!

             They didn't "rip NAMBLA a new one" - what they did was diffuse it into comedy. That's what these people do - they turn these scandals into comedy so they gain a level of acceptance. Often this is even before the public know about the scandal.

             Like a couple of weeks ago, Sacha Baron Cohen was doing a skit with Dick Cheney - this only serves to normalize 9/11. We have to understand that satirists are not on our side, no matter how much they send up the infamous.

             I have a question thats been on my mind. Its about tv and symbolism. In two movies/tv shows I watched "killing of a sacred deer" the girls room has the heart within the heart symbol, a hand print, and small heart stickers(this one might be nothing). In westworld, a huge tv show as we all know, in the last season one of the horses had the spiral symbol on it.
            </p>
            <p>
             These symbols are popping up a lot. Are they for any purpose outside of pedos taunting us?

              When it comes to symbols, context is everything.
             </p>
             <p>
              For example, swirls seen in Pacific Islander culture are innocent. The nazi swastica is actually a bastardization of an asian symbol known as a "manji", which represents good luck. The swastica is an inverted manji.
             </p>
             <p>
              The "pedo" swirl is VERY specific in its design.

                One of the meanings of a spiral symbol is a maze, at the center the "truth" is discovered. This fits well with the plot of Westworld. IMO the pedo symbols are very generic on purpose, which causes overlap of symbology.

            Why was her daughter her favorite mistake?  Was it so she could sell her off?  Her father always gave me the creeps.  RR gives me the creeps. He has a pre-school in Parris Cal.  Same town where the Turpin family lived.  The number of children attending added up to a -2.  Hmm.  I did a post on Parris.  I could not watch the little vid with Heather OR and the jukebox.  I will never be able to unsee it.  I had always though that I never saw a SS film until I saw a pic of Heather in Poltergeist.  Then it hit me that it was the only film of his I have ever seen. That was a sick moment for me.  The movie greatly affected me and now it is even worse, knowing what happened to her.  I also read that SS used real cadavers in the pool scene.  With people and children in the pool, shooting that scene.  Vile.  RIP Heather

             Everything  is creepy about the Marshall family. She's the most untalented director in the history of film and Ron Howard is right there next to her in the gutter. I avoided both of their work like the plague ... long before pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of the cadavers, you are exactly right. I remember hearing about that. The guy must be a monster. RR has to be also. Thanks for the info on Parris. Why doesn't that surprise me? And remember the child actors staying at the Reiner home? Man, must have been fun back then! Just do what you want and no one noticed. The police were obviously looking the other way. And parents ... they were willing to let their kids do anything ... all for a career and money.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's insane, sickening, and I feel the same way. I can't think about what happened to all those great kids without getting physically ill. It's why I want the stronghold on silence to break wide open. It's also why I'm fuming about these fake Pedo whistleblowers like Isaac Kappy. Let's see ... no evidence ... name proof ... and the clock is just ticking away. All he's doing is RTing articles and collecting names of victims. I can't stand it ... I can't.

              I completely agree.  Heather has affected me the most because she is the one that I first found out about, but all the rest, well, RIP to them too.  But they deserve so much more.  They Deserve Justice and the names of their rapists and sick satanist abusers named in public.  Out on the Internet.  In Papers, On TV.  Everywhere.  Finally.  Once and For All.

             I was researching Heather at the end of 2017 and came across a forum discussing her death in 2006.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://invanddis.proboards.com/thread/3006/rosemarys-baby?page=2">
              http://invanddis.proboards.com/thread/3006/rosemarys-baby?page=2
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The board is based on a "conspiracy theory" that Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by the current Sir Paul, who in these circles is called Faul.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did some investigating into this and got deeper and deeper into it as 2017 progressed. What I have discovered is that the real Beatles were all killed in late June 1964 on the New Zealand leg of the world tour - the replacements (who had been doubling as The Beatles since at least October 1963) then returned to the UK  to take their place.
            </p>
            <p>
             This event is relevant to this topic because Ron Howard made Eight Days A Week - a documentary which bridged the time of the replacement. It is also pizzagate related because it is perhaps Jimmy Savile's greatest crime he was involved in.

             The second is difficult to answer. In terms of enty it's this:

             Enty on CDAN was the first that I heard espouse this gang rape theory. However, I had read that her death was suspicious, but there was no pizzagate and I never even thought something that bizarre could ever happen to a child. So given that Parker and Stone were hinting at this in 2008, I'd say they were the first ones to advance the theory. She died in 1988 so it was twenty years after the fact. And I'd say Parker and Stone are the real ones that know things. How? Have no idea! But look at all the stuff they broke ... so all I can say is that enty was the first I heard talking about her death being attributable to molestation, but since SP predates that by nine years, SP gets the credit for breaking that story.

              That's kind of amazing. I've never watched SP. I'm assuming they are not good guys trying out SS.

               No, they are good guys. They got into huge trouble for outing Scientology's/Hubbard's alleged top secret philosophy. It includes space aliens and sleeping and young minor boys. They are irreverent as hell. They were bashed for being conservatives and the lefties did their best to ruin their ratings, but the show was a solid hit despite their political leanings. The thing is -- nobody but them was woke. I sue didn't get the implications behind the SS and GL episode, but there it is ... there all of it is ... it proves that this has been going on a long while. Family Guy is another show that slid things in. I just thought they had great imaginations.

            Those are some really well-researched connections, the thing about the jukebox is insane, I never heard that one before.  Why do you think the image kept cropping up, where they blackmailing each other?  Flaunting it?  Fruckers.

            I've got another one.  Enty just had a blind where people are guessing SS and Anissa Jones, the little girl who played Buffy on A Family Affair.  Anissa died of a "drug overdose" and her brother did as well, around a decade later.  A weird thing is that Spielberg met with George Lucas shortly after she died.  Lucas supposedly showed SS the story about his character "Indiana Smith" and SS didn't like the  name, suggested it be changed to "Indiana Jones."  Anissa Jones.  Who was from Indiana.

            Effed up.  Anissa, Heather, Drew, Judith Barsi, Ariana Richards - all have been subjects of the SS blinds, all similar looking, 3 of them are dead.

             That's a brilliant catch! So even using Indiana Jones had a meaning.

             This is has got to stop! Somebody has to blow the whistle on these guys ... and the entire sick cabal. This is literally turning my stomach to think of kids being tortured this way, but these pervs are only worried about their own careers and reputations. Well, you know what? It's time you paid for what you did. Lord, I hope someone steps forward ...

               I remember reading how he's ruined actresses' lives because they didn't say he was the best director and the nicest, kindest man in the world. They were blacklisted for saying he was difficult. I mean, what? If he does that to adult women, you can imagine what he does to children. It's probably why alleged to be attracted to children because children do not have the coping mechanisms to fight back. Must be nice to be an ogre everyone fears.

                He is a monster.  I'll give you one blatant example of how he humiliated Ariana in Jurassic Park.   At first, her character doesn't want to pet the Brachiosaurus, but she's encouraged to do it when Sam Neill and the boy basically call her ignorant.  In other words, they groom her into petting it.   "Can I touch it?"  she says.  Vile.  What does it do?  It
                <s>
                 sneezes
                </s>
                splooges all over her face.  Queue the shot of the young girl in shock, covered in "snot."   The dino is just a huge animatronic phallus, just look at its neck.  So SS put a CP money shot right in the middle of Jurassic Park.  (and plenty more where that came from).
