            There has been a lot of publicity about
            <strong>
             Hell Pizza
            </strong>
            , because of its provocative (i.e. lurid, bad taste, playful satanism) advertising which the stakeholders claim is light-hearted.  The approach is to push boundaries of acceptability and cash in on the free publicity.  The franchise have offended several groups including the Church (with its Hot Cross Pentagram Buns) Sir Edmund Hillary, Heath Leger and the Samoan community amongst others.
A concise summary is on wikipaedia.

           <p>
            Whilst there is no public evidence of paedomania there are a lot of parallels in the imagery and attitudes taken by those involved.
            <br/>
            Personally I would not buy or eat a pizza from that franchise because the brand is part of the funky degeneration of popular culture.

            A couple of years ago in New Zealand there was some media drama involving Cameron Slater, Matt Blomfield, and Warren Powell. Powell and Blomfield were involved in the ownership/operation of Hell Pizza, and Cameron Slater was an attack blogger with connections to  recently resigned Prime Minister Key and Judith Collins. Slater was arguably responsible for Judth Collins' resignation as Minister of Justice when Slater's hacked emails revealed that she was "gunning for" the head of NZ's Serious Fraud Office.
           </p>
           <p>
            The common theme with PizzaGate was that hacked emails disrupted an election unseated a female politician who was aspiring to be a political leader. There was also some controversy over Collins' relationship with the Chinese, but nothing relating to paedophilia (unless there was more to Key's penchant for ponytails than meets the eye).
