<p>The two e-fits were commissioned in 2008 (but not released until 2013) by a fraudulent Irish, ex-MI5/GCHQ detective <strong>KEVIN HALLIGEN</strong> (his antics worthy of a separate thread alone), whose company, <strong>Oakley International</strong> was hired by the McCann\'s to look into the case of missing Madeline. His associate, another ex-M15 spy, <strong>Henri Exton</strong>, produced the actual e-fits: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/27/madeleine-mccann-kate-gerry-mi5_n_4167645.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/27/madeleine-mccann-kate-gerry-mi5_n_4167645.html</a></p>
<p>Oakley International was based out of <strong>2550 M Street, NW, Washington, DC</strong>. This address is also the office of <strong>Patton Boggs</strong>, Washington\'s most politically-connected law firm and lobbyist organization. When Kevin Halligen first moved to DC in 2005, he hired Patton Boggs to help set up his new business. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/fraud-suspect-kevin-richard-halligen-allegedly-posed-as-a-spy-and-cheated-the-elite-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/2012/06/09/gJQA3gdwQV_story.html?utm_term=.161ae464c65a">https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/fraud-suspect-kevin-richard-halligen-allegedly-posed-as-a-spy-and-cheated-the-elite-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/2012/06/09/gJQA3gdwQV_story.html?utm_term=.161ae464c65a</a></p>
<p>It would be fair to say through his close connection with <strong>Patton Boggs</strong> Kevin Halligen was more than familiar with <strong>The Podesta Group</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tony Podesta</strong> on <em>Tommy Boggs</em> of <em>Patton Boggs</em>: &quot;He’s a brilliant guy who invented what a lot of us do.&quot; 
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/patton-boggs-to-merge-with-squire-sanders/2014/05/23/1981b1b8-e2ab-11e3-9743-bb9b59cde7b9_story.html?utm_term=.1c1e95f35458">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/patton-boggs-to-merge-with-squire-sanders/2014/05/23/1981b1b8-e2ab-11e3-9743-bb9b59cde7b9_story.html?utm_term=.1c1e95f35458</a></p>
<p><strong>Nick Allard</strong>, Co-Chair, <strong>Patton Boggs</strong> on <em>Tony Podesta</em>: &quot;Tony and his group are the right people at the right time in the right place.”

<p>In 2008, (the year that the McCann \'Podesta-like\' e-fits were created, and one year after Maddie disappeared), The Podesta Group\'s profits jumped from $10mm to $30mm. 
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/156279/the_9_most_loathsome_lobbyists_in_washington">http://www.alternet.org/story/156279/the_9_most_loathsome_lobbyists_in_washington</a></p>
<p>Why did <strong>Kevin Halligen</strong> commission the e-fits in <strong>2008</strong>? Why did a random Irish eye witness, Martin Smith, (remember; Kevin Halligen is also Irish) come out of nowhere to \'suddenly remember\' months after the disappearance, that he saw a couple of mystery men near the McCann\'s apartment, that, as per the e-fits, looked to be \'Podesta like\'. He also stated that the men kept their heads down, so how could Smith have generated a carbon copy visual of the Podesta Brothers? Why did Martin Smith then, just as quickly <em>withdraw</em> his testimony? That being the case, why were the Podesta-like e-fits still used in the BBC Crimewatch TV \'Maddie Special\', televised in <strong>October,  2013</strong>?</p>
<p>In 2013, Patton Boggs “…underwent layoffs and partner exits in 2013 amid a 12% drop in revenue, and entered merger talks with Squire Sanders.”  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squire_Patton_Boggs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squire_Patton_Boggs</a></p>
<p>What dirt do Kevin Halligen and Patton Boggs have on the Podesta Group and/or the whereabouts of the Podesta brothers in May, 2007? Why <em>did</em> Kevin Halligen, hired by the McCann\'s to investigate their daughter\'s disappearance, produce e-fits closely resembling (beyond reasonable doubt) his client\'s (Patton Boggs) biggest rivals?</p>
<p>Who persuaded - and why - Gerry and Kate McCann to put their faith in (and pay $500k to) a random Washington DC-based \'detective\' (Kevin Halligen) who mysteriously reached out to them telling them he could find their daughter? Was Halligen actually bribing Gerry and Kate over something? Halliday\'s charm skills had already persuaded Andre Hollis, a former US Drug enforcement agency official, to write out an $80,000 cheque to Halliday\'s company Oakley, in return for a ten per cent share-holding (never received.) <a href="https://cryptome.org/0001/henri-exton.htm">https://cryptome.org/0001/henri-exton.htm</a> Was Hollis being \'bribed\' over something too? I digress...</p>
<p>Why, in March 2004, was Kevin Halligen handed a rare US Department of Defense Security Pass?</p>
<p>AND last but not least WHY was Gerry McCann pictured laughing and joking his way around <strong>Washington DC</strong>, home of Podesta and PizzaGate, in JULY 2007 (less than three months after Maddie disappeared), lobbying statesmen on child trafficking, kissing Laura Bush\'s dog, and generally enjoying the limelight?

            “…this is a coded warning to the Podesta Brothers to keep them in line.”
           </p>
           <p>
            That's true. And that warning could have been attached to an attempt at extortion as well. You can read my comments for my opinions of the Podestas but those efits aren't unassailable proof the Podestas were there. They could still be involved nonetheless. And to criticize even my own argument I get the impression threatening the Podestas or the Clintons isn't the best idea. Halligen would have know that so why would he pick a fight with a buzz saw?

            Wow this was a great post. That Halligen guy was slick. I can't believe this doesn't have more upvotes! This shows a connection between the McCann's and the Podesta's!

            Terrific observation and point! At any given stage of this investigation, there always seemed to be about 7 or 8 different e-fits in circulation of suspicious men seen in, around, near the McCann's for the duration of their stay and the disappearance. Here are four more different (non-Podesta-like) e-fits:

           <p>
            Im more interested in the two (yes, the accompanying text usually says 'one man' underneath pics of the

             <em>
              two
             </em>
            </strong>
            Podesta-like e-fits...odd) visuals that undoubtedly resemble the brothers, and its connection to Kevin Halligen, who I believe to be a key player.

            Something else I remembered. When an expert is listening to the interviews of the McCann parents on the Richard Hall documentary he even says that the way they speak about her at some points could suggest she was dead before the night she went missing. But what I think is that she was heavily sedated to the point where she was barely conscious. This could have been how she died.

            Interesting theory but it doesn't explain the blood in the room and in the car.  If she died of an accidental drug overdose there wouldn't be blood. The dogs were highly trained police dogs.

            The evidence you lay out seems to lead to a conclusion Halligen falsely produced the efits to damage a business competitor, but you don't reach this conclusion, You come to a different conclusion that Halligen had dirt on the Podestas.  It seems like a logical leap.  If he had dirt, then what?  What did Halligan get out of this?  Patton Boggs still ended up with declining business.   There's a gap here.

            He was running around partying and laughing because he was not Maddy's father and he is a pedo himself.  There was a Post on here a while back about how someone with the UK police scubbed CP from his computer.  I believe that the Mom had IVF and Soros is the father.  It is done everyday.  Soros and Maddy both had coloboma of the eye.  She was created for a reason.  I am not the only one that believes this.  I believe the Podestas are somehow involved in kidnapping Maddy for Soros.  This was all pre arranged with a deal with the parents.  They are the bottom of the barrel just like the elite pedos.

             "Supposedly", a transfer of power of the NY division of the Luciferians put G.S. in charge.  D.R. held that title previously.  If this is true, which I honestly don't know, &amp; McCanns r also Luciferians, then it's possible that Maddy's Mother performed a sex ritual with G.S. This actually IS standard protocol for these groups.  Would explain the coloboma as well.

              Ugh.  What a scene that would be.  Vomit inducing to be sure. After what I have read on here I would not be surprised.  They sure think they have a good thing going.  They don't realize what a bunch of sick and disgustingly evil bunch we all think they are.

              Well, one think I have realized since reading all of the posts on pizzagate is that almost nothing is too crazy to believe.  If they were hired by Halligen as his lawyers and he is a spy/detective then I would believe that eventually he either told them or they just figured it out.  More like, he told them.  This is nothing you want to tackle by yourself, especially when the adversarsaries are George Soros and the Podesta Bros.

                  The blood of young children. I hate them all, those people.  They think they are so perfect and above us all they only breed with their own.  But the blood of our children is good enough to keep them from death's door?  Kissinger and Soros.  They need to be gone.  I have never prayed for the death of anyone in my life, in their case I will make an exception.

            I believe that the podestas actually are involved in one way or another, although they may not have physically taken Madeline.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a typical sex crime black mail script.The Podestas were probably being blackmailed and called the bluff. The sketches were released as a way to get them to cooperate.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's disturbing is that whoever released the photos has enough power to tell the Podestas that even with their pictures out their, they can still be protected if anything comes of it. Unless they don't comply.
           </p>
           <p>
            More evidence we are dealing with a massive government pedo network. Setting up people and capturing evidence of their sex crimes then blackmailing them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a similar m.o. that was used to remove members of Congress by the Clinton's pre the vote on Bills impeachment.

             Thank you! I think blackmail goes on all the time, quite openly. "Hiding in public", as it were. This is the the main quality security agencies look for when hiring/ dole-ing out security clearances: is this person susceptible to blackmail...?

            I think Maddie was being prepared to be taken by the Podestas. Thats why the missing reports and flyers were produced in advance. Why Clement Freud had rented his house out to the Podestas. Why they fit the drawings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maddie was a lively little girl and was probably being sedated by her parents in preparation for the kidnapping. Somehow she ended up dead. Whether it was a fight or an accident I'm not sure. But it would explain why the dogs sensed evidence of a dead body.
           </p>
           <p>
            It all went wrong really and the McCanns needed massive government support to ensure the truth was covered up.

             Thank you! indeed it is a movie script. You could just not make up the cast of characters, cover ups,  twists and turns, links, and blatant ongoing deceit, that insults the very intelligence of the general public. I can't wait for the day someone wipes the smug, shit eating grin off Gerry McCann's sick face.

            Kate McCann describes Maddie asking the morning of the kidnapping why she hadn't responded when Maddie and her brother were crying for her the previous night -- evidently before she returned from dinner.  Then, feeling hurt by a comment by her husband, Kate decides to sleep in the children's room that night, where earlier someone may have been trying to enter the children's room?  Kate's sleeping in the children's room that night may have prevented the kidnappers from coming back that evening?  What prevented them from gaining entry earlier that night, but not the next night?

            Note that as you discuss the possible bribe of Andre Hollis, you are referring twice to "Halliday" and think you mean, Halligen?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Halliday's charm skills had already persuaded Andre Hollis, a former US Drug enforcement agency official, to write out an $80,000 cheque to Halliday's company Oakley, in return for a ten per cent share-holding (never received.)
             <a href="https://cryptome.org/0001/henri-exton.htm">
              https://cryptome.org/0001/henri-exton.htm
             </a>
             Was Hollis being 'bribed' over something too? I digress...&gt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Also re this:  "Was Halligen actually bribing Gerry and Kate over something?"
Any suggestion as to what that could be?
           </p>
           <p>
            And, "Why, in March 2004, was Kevin Halligen handed a rare US Department of Defense Security Pass?"
Can you explain how that might relate to this case -- Pizzagate -- or the kidnapping of Madelaine McCann?

            I don't know what I am talking about but it sounds like you do. Is it possible that someone else had died in that room recently? Perhaps more goes on at that hotel than one might imagine?

             Its unlikely they killed her. They planted scent of a dead person to make people think Maddie was dead. The coloboma thing, the flash in her eye, is what made her so super special. George Soros has the same flash. Its called coloboma and its extremely rare. Let me know if any of you have seen anyone with it before. 
I think Maddie is special, because the elites, Soros, believes in so much freaky shit you cant even begin to imagine. Maybe he needs her blood. Maybe the same thing happened with Soros when he was young. We just happen to have an all powerful billionaire with that  same eye-anomoly. Maybe she will show up on the radar in 2060 or something, and become a world leader. I have no idea. If there ever is a female powerful political leader emerging in the future with coloboma, its probably her.

             Even more absurd, there is still no evidence to suggest Maddie (or anyone else) even died in the room on that particular night. The timeline of what actually happened has always been very sketchy. WE only have the testimony of McCann's and the Tapas 7, who are a bunch of very shitty liars, who can't get their stories straight...

            As I said in the previous thread, the big thing that sticks out for me is HOW accurate the Podesta sketches are...almost like the higher ups knew they were involved, then produced the sketches and put them out there as a veiled threat to keep them in line (for what I don't know). How could one produce such CLEAR drawings of not one but two suspects who supposedly abducted her at night. Man, this is a deep rabbit hole...

             And, via a description by a witness who said they had "their heads down" as noted above.
Also the Irish witness evidently also quickly withdrew his witness report on which the description of the kidnappers was based . . .  that is according to the report above.

               I think it came from one of the links in the OP, but checked some quickly and couldn't find it.
Problem is lots of links and side links.  But think that's where it's from.  Apologies.

                , my total bad, I will correct this in the O posting.  One Irishman, one sighting, two different e-fits: you are correct. LOL, makes you think that Halligen definitely stiched up the podestas on purposes, knowing the 'order' was for one suspect, but he went ahead and issued two (for BOTH brothers), regardless....

                 You did great -- names can easily get confused at times.
Seems the Halligen investigation turned up something at least embarrassing for the McCanns and which they didn't want the press to get wind of.
Amazing that with all the terrible things happening to them, they're unlucky enough to get preyed on by Halligen, as well -- (via recommendation of Henri Exton) - a rather costly mistake.
Noticed this also with Mother of Hampstead case children.  She finally gets rid of Ricky Dearman and then she gets involved with another guy who is physically harming the children including during the time when they are trying to tell their mother about their sexual abuse by their father.
The gesture by Clemont Freud to get in touch also seems odd to me.  Looks kind of like people are thrown in to be close and to monitor, but that's just my thinking.

                 Re the Halligen computer-generated pictures ... (from your link) . . . this is the Irish witness:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Speaking to Portuguese police a few weeks after Maddie disappeared, Mr Smith said it was ‘not possible to recognise the individual’.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  His grandchildren were also unable to identify the man or the girl – but thought she could have been Madeleine.

              That's a good thought. You saying they were supposed to rent her for one night (where did you read that?) made me think of something. Well, what parents would leave their children in a hotel room while they are partying with friends in another building? Even if they thought the kids would be safe, a normal parent would be afraid the kids would wake up and be scared. That story has ALWAYS bugged me. I can't imagine a parent doing that.

              So I'm wondering if the parents were sick people and gave Madeline Benadryl or something else to knock her out. Then left the hotel with friends and allowed the man/men/Podesta's or someone else to go in and rape Madeline while they were out. They were not supposed to kill her. When they killed her or the drugs did, they had to get rid of the body so that's why somebody saw a blonde girl being carried on the beach that night and the girl wasn't crying or screaming. The guy who was trained to see body language and listen to how they explain things think they were in on it all and are guilty.
             </p>
             <p>
              The officer that worked on the case ended up writing a book and thinks they are guilty. The McCanns sued him to stop the book from being shared for 8 years but yesterday or the day before the McCanns lost! The judge is allowing the book to come out and the McCanns have to pay the guy money now. So new info should become public soon!

              Molochhunter - after all we've seen this is Occums Razor and makes the most sense.  It is extremely likely that the parents are also complicit and drugged the girl before the Podesta-Molesta party, BUT the dose was too high and she went into a coma and died before or during the party.  The drugs are likely administered so she would be relaxed or asleep during the gang-rape.
