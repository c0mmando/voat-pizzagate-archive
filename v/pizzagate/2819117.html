<p>Many of the children adopted from Chile by Swedes were taken from their mothers without their consent, an investigation by Chilean journalists in collaboration with Swedish national broadcaster SVT has shown.</p>
<p>Over the years, these adoptions have been questioned due to allegations of coercion and kidnapping.</p>
<p>The Chilevision television channel has reviewed many adoption papers and interviewed mothers who, according to the documents, voluntarily left their newborn children for adoption. In several cases, the circumstances surrounding the adoptions differed significantly from the facts stated in the official documents, the journalists concluded</p>
<p>All of the cases were handled by Adoptionscentrum (Adoption Center), Sweden\'s largest adoption organization. Signatures were routinely falsified, whereas information about parents was falsified or omitted.
&quot;They worked with lawyers, social workers and doctors. Everyone got their piece of the cake,&quot; Garcia was quoted as saying. She also described people associated with Adoption Center staff as part of a network where social workers actively sought children fit for taking away. &quot;They sought out pregnant women or new mothers from marginalized poor areas and offered them the things they needed or sometimes even cash directly to abandon their children,&quot; Garcia claimed, calling this scheme the &quot;child trade.&quot;</p>
<p>that Adoption Center staff had &quot;close links&quot; to special courts granting exit permits to the adopted children.
One of the victims of the scheme is Marianne Skoglund from Mölndal , who was adopted from Chile to Sweden as a newborn. According to her biological mother, Juanita Yáñez, she was stolen from her by means of a fake signature.</p>
<p>Margret Josefsson of the Adoption Center argued that the adoptions were examined by the Chilean authorities, who found that everything was managed correctly, but could not display any documents as proof thereof

            48K children? Where are they? There can't be that big of a demand for adoptions in Sweden. So, are they selling them, trafficking them or using them for organ transplants? Chile did seem to be a haven for RCC abuses of children. Maybe this was set up by the church and filtered through Sweden. It needs to be investigated and stopped!

            There are children that could use a decent home. How do we ensure that adoptions are legitimate? If this can be answered, the world will be a better place.

            You and I have both said many times who will take care of the children, who cares for them.  Where is the protection?  Who is behind these adoptions.  Certainly elites are invested.  The Church?  Would not be surprised.  Bergoglio was involved in many babies leaving Argentina decades ago. He certainly has protected many priests in Chile when they raped the Children.  The babies went to the Military families.  48K is a number I can't even wrap my head around.

             . It's competing interests.

            <p>
             Only strong families and communities can take care of children safely. Hillary was actually right in saying "it takes a village". However the gov/non-profit attempt to systemize profit-based adoption, and traffick children away from birthplaces and communities destroys family units and societies. It also can collapse communities by taking away the "smart ones". It's colloquially called a "brain drain"

              Yes, I agree she was right about that, but again she was not about to help with the provisions.  Yes, it can weaken the safety net of a community and the larger family unit.  I am sure they are asking for the best ones. So many is what boggles the mind.  Sweden is not a large country.

              I personally believe the demand is mainly driven by medical industry. Pedophiles and Cults can't account for the sheer number of children abducted.

              "In international documents, trafficking for the purpose of illegal transplantation of human organs is included in the definition of trafficking in human beings, defined in the category of other forms or intentions of exploitation. Due to high demand for organs, this form of trafficking is on the increase as transplant waiting lists in many countries are long and traffickers take advantage of desperate conditions in which organ donors live. Also, organs are often removed through deception and without a victim’s consent. All organs suitable for transplantation are available on the market. ORGANS TRAVEL FROM THE POOR TO THE RICH, from the global South to the North.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trafficking in organs, tissues and cells usually does not involve all three elements that otherwise characterise trafficking in human beings (solicitation, transportation, exploitation). So far, the international expert community has not reached a consensus regarding the definition and interlacement of both phenomena, i.e. trafficking in human beings for the purpose of organ transplantation and illegal trafficking in human organs, tissues and cells. In illegal trafficking in human organs, tissues and cells, the objects of criminal offences are organs, tissues and cells, while in trafficking in human beings, the objects of criminal offences are people whose organs are intended for transplantation. As such, trafficking in organs, tissues and cells does not include exploitation; however, it takes place on the black market, it is not subjected to standardised medical controls and it poses a threat to public healthcare. Both phenomena are under the domain of well-organised criminal networks in which travel agencies, private clinics, health workers, people soliciting victims and others cooperate."
