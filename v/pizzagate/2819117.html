            48K children? Where are they? There can't be that big of a demand for adoptions in Sweden. So, are they selling them, trafficking them or using them for organ transplants? Chile did seem to be a haven for RCC abuses of children. Maybe this was set up by the church and filtered through Sweden. It needs to be investigated and stopped!

            There are children that could use a decent home. How do we ensure that adoptions are legitimate? If this can be answered, the world will be a better place.

            In the meantime, adopt a puppy or kitten.

            You and I have both said many times who will take care of the children, who cares for them.  Where is the protection?  Who is behind these adoptions.  Certainly elites are invested.  The Church?  Would not be surprised.  Bergoglio was involved in many babies leaving Argentina decades ago. He certainly has protected many priests in Chile when they raped the Children.  The babies went to the Military families.  48K is a number I can't even wrap my head around.

            <p>
             Only strong families and communities can take care of children safely. Hillary was actually right in saying "it takes a village". However the gov/non-profit attempt to systemize profit-based adoption, and traffick children away from birthplaces and communities destroys family units and societies. It also can collapse communities by taking away the "smart ones". It's colloquially called a "brain drain"

              Yes, I agree she was right about that, but again she was not about to help with the provisions.  Yes, it can weaken the safety net of a community and the larger family unit.  I am sure they are asking for the best ones. So many is what boggles the mind.  Sweden is not a large country.

              I have a feeling that whoever wants a Child for whatever reason, they are happy to provide.  No questions asked.  It's all about the money.  I hope to God they are not using them for testing.

              "In international documents, trafficking for the purpose of illegal transplantation of human organs is included in the definition of trafficking in human beings, defined in the category of other forms or intentions of exploitation. Due to high demand for organs, this form of trafficking is on the increase as transplant waiting lists in many countries are long and traffickers take advantage of desperate conditions in which organ donors live. Also, organs are often removed through deception and without a victim’s consent. All organs suitable for transplantation are available on the market. ORGANS TRAVEL FROM THE POOR TO THE RICH, from the global South to the North.

              Trafficking in organs, tissues and cells usually does not involve all three elements that otherwise characterise trafficking in human beings (solicitation, transportation, exploitation). So far, the international expert community has not reached a consensus regarding the definition and interlacement of both phenomena, i.e. trafficking in human beings for the purpose of organ transplantation and illegal trafficking in human organs, tissues and cells. In illegal trafficking in human organs, tissues and cells, the objects of criminal offences are organs, tissues and cells, while in trafficking in human beings, the objects of criminal offences are people whose organs are intended for transplantation. As such, trafficking in organs, tissues and cells does not include exploitation; however, it takes place on the black market, it is not subjected to standardised medical controls and it poses a threat to public healthcare. Both phenomena are under the domain of well-organised criminal networks in which travel agencies, private clinics, health workers, people soliciting victims and others cooperate."
