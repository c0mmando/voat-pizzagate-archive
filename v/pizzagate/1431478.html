<p><strong>The Original Video</strong>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erh2ngRZxs0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erh2ngRZxs0</a></p>
<p>First of all: who the hell gives your own company the name of &quot;Little Baby\'s&quot;? Second: what kind of sick fuck makes THAT kind of video saying: &quot;I eat Little Baby\'s&quot;? Third: at this point, I don\'t think it\'s necessary to remind you what&quot;ice cream&quot; means within the context of this whole shitstorm. And fourth: just take a look at this video they posted on their own YouTube account four years ago...</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Breaking Down The Walls&quot;</strong>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3moy52qy_U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3moy52qy_U</a></p>
<p>I don\'t think I need to explain anymore. And maybe it\'s just me needing urgently of a tinfoil hat, but for me, their other videos seemed a bit fishy too, if you know what I mean, so I decided to take a brief look at their site. It\'s just me or the hands of their logo (the one with the smiling ice cream cone) were drawn in a way that, if you put them together, resemble a butterfly symbol?</p>
<p>I found out that while Little Baby\'s Ice Cream\'s headquarters is located at Philadelphia, turns out they do have an store (that for some reason opens only at Sundays) in Washington DC, at the Union Market. It\'s not close to Comet Ping Pong, but both places are connected through the Red Line and can be accessed from each other with relative ease. And Union Market itself is only about 15 minutes from the White House...</p>
<p>I bumped into this piece of information only coincidentally, while watching one of my favorite YouTubers just so I can forget about this whole shitstorm for a little while — I learned about #PizzaGate only two days ago, and it\'s been one hell of a mindfuck to me. Maybe I\'m wrong, maybe it\'s something that has no connection with the whole scandal at all, but I decided to post it here anyway, just to be safe. It might be worth some investigation, but I myself am new to this whole conspiracy theory thing, and therefore I completely lack the skills necessary in order to perform it by myself, so I\'m leaving it to you guys. Thanks for the attention, and good luck!</p>',
