            I'm the same. Just take a break(I should follow my own advice).
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently it's been easier because I've seen some progress. The Deep State are fighting dirty as fuck, but they are still losing. Too many people knows it exists now and once that happened they lost much of their influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are one major arrest from being redeemed. One. The media who has done nothing but try to discredit us(instead of actually looking at the stuff we have discovered) will crumble. Former sheeple might even begin lynchings over this. Though we really need the big fish in a courtroom. It will be the strongest redpill ever.
           </p>
           <p>
            You need a break. I was tearing myself apart during the first few weeks. I thought I had become one of those crazy conspiracy theorists. I did my best to debunk pizzagate, but I simply couldn't. The evidence is too damning and the way the media treats is is even more damning. It's real and I can't unbelieve something I know is true. It doesn't matter if I am the only person in my social circle who know about pizzagate.

            I'm going to post something I wrote to reddit when I was feeling just like this in the earlier days of PG. 
You aren't alone. I hope this helps:
           </p>
           <p>
            Hello in there, and THANK YOU ALL for your part in the Great Work of shining a light on the ten thousand faces of the Adversary, and in particular the penultimate darkness suggested by #pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been lurking and following the dots since #spiritcooking rose to top trend on Twitter before being scrubbed away. I've bounced between the chans and the subs here, watching them take turns being choked and catch up. I've heard of folks taking to the streets and going dark. I pray for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've seen crowds of new folk come in slack-jawed at the horror and scope of it all. They may not always bring new info but the numbers are encouraging. The hashtags are being squashed on social media, so Twitter and FB seem typically useless, but the YouTube presence expands daily. InfoWars cashed in which will at least send more of the curious to these parts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Instagram accounts are being sanitized and privatized. The accused are calling in favors and revving up the spin machine for damage control. Trolls and shills are their backup singers in the threads. "It's just art, guys. You sound crazy." I suppose The 120 Days of Sodom is "just a book," then.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody who is paying attention is surprised at corruption in D.C. and other webs of power, but what is suggested by #pizzagate goes beyond corruption into the putrefaction of the human soul. We've been mercifully spared a direct look, but even so it's all too much. Even in these early stages without seeing the damning evidence which surely exists, the implications we can draw from what is being carelessly left by the foolish or flaunted for a thrill by the proud, we are seeing the shapes of the Wendigo Class at last after lifetimes of rumors of their existence.
           </p>
           <p>
            My reddit username (ApocalypseFatigue) means the exhaustion that comes with unveiling hidden truths, and you are all no doubt suffering apocalypse fatigue yourselves. Let me offer you some simple advice to help your journey.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honor your body. It is the vehicle of all your work and we are all too quick to take it for granted. The mind requires the healthy brain, and the brain requires certain things of the body to work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drink water. Sounds simple, but many of you may be drinking lots of coffee to dig and lots of booze to forget. Both rob you of water. Hydrate and replenish electrolytes. Take magnesium if you can, as it calms the nervous system.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are what you eat, so eat as well as you're able. Whole foods (meaning fruit/veg/grain/nuts etc rather than processed, not the chain store) will deliver the purest and most sustaining energy. Keep up with your omegas and zinc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have a walk around the block as often as you can. Fresh air, natural light, blood flow, and stimulus unrelated to the mystery that plagues your mind will all recharge you. Paradoxically, to serve the people who cannot leave these situations, we must give ourselves a break between digs to stay fresh and useful. The Wendigo depend on burnout and collapse in those who would expose them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This will seem hardest: get enough sleep. Balance the nightmare fuel with something light, even funny before bed. Meditate if you can to reset the mind and prepare it for rest. White noise, or streaming calm music will help. Soma FM is full of useful material for this and runs 24/7. I recommend the "Drone Zone" station.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take time to express all that is building inside you. Keep posting but also, make art. For yourself, as a release valve. Transmute the poison, or just drain it off.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you are overwhelmed, that is the moment to show yourself love immediately and do what must be done to ground yourself. Explore meditation, yoga, or benign magick if you're so inclined (banishing rituals are a great idea). Get the shadow out where you can see it. Fill the space it leaves with light.
           </p>
           <p>
            To quote another hoping to inspire those who fight darkness, "Do not lose heart. We were made for these times."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is it. Don't give up. Thank you all.

            I'm glad you posted this because this is where things are going. Pretty soon we'll begin seeing high level perps arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced for heinous and treasonous crimes. The crimes the Deep State committed will no doubt drive this nation closer to God as average people struggle to make sense of what happened. The following might help people put things in perspective historically. In my opinion people need to process what has happened before any resolution and/or absolution can happen. Take it for what it's worth. I'm not a shill I only posted these because they helped me make sense of what these wicked and immoral mother truckers did.

            What we're seeing the last stages of these days is an idea that began in the Enlightenment. That idea was to replace God with Human Beings. It started out great as most revolutionary ideas do. The Enlightenment argued the average human being is good and only society corrupts them. That's true for the most part provided you keep some Religion to keep things in perspective. It was all good at the time. Religion had way too much control over Society. As hard core Religion receded the world flourished in the new found freedom. Unfortunately however in the past 50 years that idea was taken to its logical extreme. Right around 9/11/2001 the Human Being officially mounted the Thrown of Throwns while the King of Kings was away on another more Earthly thrown taking a shit. In the Kings absence Rich White People giddily anointed themselves as
            <a href="https://youtu.be/SXWVpcypf0w?t=10">
             The New Gods*.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Then as the King of Kings was taking a shit, and mind you not the Shit of Shits that's coming up later this Summer on Judgement Day Jr but just a plain old Earthly shit a regular and normal every day Johnny Crapper.............the World turned to shit. Things didn't work out too well. And here we are.

             I like the cut of your jib. Thank you for your light and the reminder that the church is not the faith.

              I was just mentioning that phrase to someone last week. Fascinating. Either you're with NSA or God sent you. Either way it's all good. I love that expression. It's so corny it comes out the other side as funny.

            you aren't alone as this info is definitely rough canoeing. google cognitive dissonance for better understanding of what you are up against armed with such info. take a week off and get outside.the feelings you feel are possibly intended by design. remember to be human and enjoy and seek out the good things in this world. know that people are aware and progress is being made towards bringing the criminals down. don't push this on unaware people, but ask if they've heard...get them to look into it on their own and come back to you. it's too difficult for most to look into. it's why goats dig deeper.
