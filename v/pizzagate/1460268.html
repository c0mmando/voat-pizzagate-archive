             Yes, based on his website georgebrooks.net . He has been a professional since 2012 or something. before that he owned pizza shops, and called in sightings of missing children, with an alias.

               I don't yet. Not a hundred percent. But there is a huge amount of reasons. Looks like him. There is a photocopy of the original gb's passport. Both have white hair on the sides, which is distinct. The age fits. But I am asking for a second opinion here, so I can be sure. Whoever he is, it is a worry that he has hotdogs written on his blog, and his page for no apparent reason. I was most convinced, when I saw he has been to Portugal, at least once. Oh and he has a picture of an old ice cream truck, which kind of hinted at a past in food industry. And last things, is that he started his photo business, after the Mcann case. This would indicate a change in careers, given his age.

            Checkout the business landlines number it was being used by another food business also, with owners linking to the management company of the resort she went missing from. Sorry don't have more detail here seen a few posts on this was back just after the eddit so they are here. Will see if I can drag them up.

             thanks. I did not know he was linked to the resort. The report he made, of seeing  two people with a girl,  makes little sense, and appears to be contrived to fit a narrative. That plus the fake name he gave, and the way he left so quickly,  makes him of extreme interest to me.  That plus using hotdogs, for no other reason,  in his titles of pages.
