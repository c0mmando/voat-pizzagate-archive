            And just a PS on this topic --
           </p>
           <p>
            It couldn't be clearer that our sexual abusers of children are MALES.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that's probably the least discussed subject in the world because most
societies live under patriarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same is true of MALE violence -- rarely discussed.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need more studies on this subject .... but I doubt that patriarchy wants
any more studies on it because the first mystery of sexual abuse
of children would be revealed -- i.e., that it is MALES who sexually abuse children.
           </p>
           <p>
            So -- I doubt they want to broadcast that reality.

            <h1>
             1 -- Spacey seems to be a pedophile
            </h1>
            <h1>
             2 -- If you notice in the link, Spacey says that he has also had affairs with women ....
            </h1>
            <h1>
             3 - but that he is now choosing to live as a gay man.
            </h1>
            <p>
             My opinion is that he's a pedophile.
I don't know if anyone knows the ages - i.e., whether he's been involved
with anyone younger than this guy who was 14 at the time... as I  recall it.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you look at info about pedophiles, you'll see that they are attracted to various
ages ... from infants and toddlers, to 10 year olds -- and when they move past
that age the interest in them is over.  This also applies to teenaged youths,
under the age of consent.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it does also seem that Spacey has travelled a road of "discovery" ...
perhaps even at one point thinking that he was bi-sexual.
            </p>
            <p>
             These upper teenaged years also seem to be the ages where the NAMBLA
group people argue that they should have access to these kids though they
are below the age of consent.  If anything, the age of consent should be 
moved upward, imo.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again -- pedophiles are thought to not have any real sexual-orientation
as we think about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             However -- again, according to studies, heterosexual males are our 
sexual abusers of children.

             Spacey also has the MKULTRA model ..... a father sexually abusing

              No keep it. Kevin Spacey was a friend of Epstein, and this could have large implications as to a pedo hollywood. Don't why anyone would think that a famous celeb having sex with underage boys,and the inherent cover up, would not be pizzagate related, "organized government ring" or no.

               Bc that's what pizzagate is - a) child trafficking (for sex or anything else) AND b) government-sponsored (or at least INVOLVED). Unless you can meet BOTH of those criteria It's not pizzagate and all it does is muddy the investigation - which, of course, is what the mods want which is why they let so much unrelated crap stay up. Even just a loose connection is all it takes. But just bc someone is a perv doesn't make it PG.

             Yes, likely Spacey is a pedophile.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that doesn't change his family background and the possibility 
that he is/was MKULTRA.
            </p>
            <p>
             The family model with father as sexual abuser of children is classic.
