<p>So far, he has answered two of my questions. (I\'ll screenshot, upload, and edit this post as soon as I pick a new image host that isn\'t Imgur) I\'m using the name DonFrogger.</p>
<p>Question #1: You have mentioned that there are restaurants where children can be ordered on the menu. Do you happen to know if one of these is a restaurant chain owned by a sort of celebrity chef, where the restaurant has multiple US locations and one location in Saudi Arabia? [Note: I was referring to Spike Mendelsohn\'s Good Stuff Eatery. See my thread: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1682421">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1682421</a>]</p>
<p>RDS: No but is exactly the right kind of thinking. The FBI is not serious about this stuff. Discreet surveillance of Saudi princes, many of them pedophiles and most of them homosexual in a sadistic controlling way, would quickly map their favorite places in London, DC, NYC, etctera. We are simply not requiring the FBI to be serious in part because many of our federal and state &quot;leaders&quot; get to go to those restuarants, probably without paying, as part of the deal.</p>
<hr />
<p>Question #2: How widespread is the use of &quot;trauma-based mind control&quot; within government ranks or to what extent is it relied upon? </p>
<p>RDS: An interesting question. CIA and Yale and other places in Connecticutt started the whole mind control thing in the 1950\'s, there is a very strong neo-Nazi patina over all this stuff, I would say that 95% of the USG is just stupid and the other 5% is Satanic.</p>',
