<blockquote>
<p>Lord Timothy &quot;Tim&quot; Bell (born 18 October 1941 and ennobled in 1998 as Lord Bell of Belgravia) is a British advertising and public relations executive, best known for his advisory role in Margaret Thatcher\'s three successful General Election campaigns.</p>
<p>Tim Bell began his career in 1959 at Colman Prentis and Varley and, after stints with Hobson Bates and Geers Gross, <strong>he helped form Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in 1970</strong>, where he was Chief Executive and later International Chairman. Bell left in 1985, by which time Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was the number one agency network in the world. Bell joined the Lowe Group (part of Interpublic) as Deputy Chairman and led an MBO of the communications division Lowe Bell Communications, which became Bell Pottinger in 1987. The firm was renamed Chime Communications when it was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. Bell continued as Chairman of Bell Pottinger Private Communications Ltd, when it separated from Chime in 2012 following a management buy-out.</p>
<p><strong>Knighted in 1990 after nomination by Margaret Thatcher, Sir Tim Bell was made a Life Peer in 1998 after nomination by Tony Blair</strong> as Lord Bell of Belgravia. Chairman of the Conservative Party\'s Keep the £ Campaign, <strong>Lord Bell serves on various arts and public administration bodies.</strong> On 8 April 2013, it was Lord Bell who officially announced the news of Lady Thatcher\'s death. In August 2014, Bell joined the board of trustees for the Brazzaville Foundation which, through conflict resolution, aims to bring political and social stability to African countries.</p>

<p>Bell Pottinger, the firm set up by Margaret Thatcher\'s PR guru Lord Bell in 1989, set up a base in Camp Victory in Baghdad, in what is believed to be one of the most-costly PR contracts in history.</p>
<p>From here, nearly 300 staff operated a top-secret \'Psychological operations\' task force, which included writing soap operas and allegedly distributing fake al-Qaeda videos which were used to track the people watching them.</p>

            <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4889766/Heather-Kerzner-led-gilded-life-went-wrong.html">
             The socialite who fell to earth: Stupendously rich after divorcing a billionaire, Heather Kerzner led a gilded life... then Fergie introduced her to the now shamed PR firm Bell Pottinger and it all started going wrong
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The duchess had added two of her friends to the guest list that night: PR company boss James Henderson and Heather Kerzner, vivacious ex-wife of pint-sized South African hotels and casino magnate Sol Kerzner.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ever since 2010, when her royal life reached its lowest ebb after a newspaper ‘sting’ in which she offered to sell access to Prince Andrew, her ex-husband, in return for £500,000, the
             <strong>
              Duchess had relied on Henderson, chief executive of world-famous PR firm Bell Pottinger, to rebuild her reputation.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             nd that kindness has been repaid. Henderson’s son Felix spent a winter season working as an assistant at the Swiss ski lodge she jointly owns with Andrew.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not long afterwards, 48-year-old Heather was making a significant gesture of commitment to their relationship, investing several millions of her personal fortune buying a 15 per cent stake in Henderson’s PR firm.
            </p>
            <p>
             But amid allegations it tried to stoke up racial hatred in South Africa while working for a lucrative client, the company — set up by Maragret Thatcher’s favourite ad-man Lord (Tim) Bell — has spectacularly collapsed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Settling in London soon after their wedding, Heather began rubbing shoulders with an international crowd,
             <strong>
              ex U.S. president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, South Africa’s former president Nelson Mandela and Hollywood stars like Robert De Niro
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             The following year, her 41st birthday celebration at Annabel’s nightclub, was notorious for the fracas between actor Hugh Grant and
             <strong>
              PR man Matthew Freud
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, Heather was soon becoming a familiar figure at Bell Pottinger events. At its summer party in June at Lancaster House, next door to St James’s Palace, Heather glided easily among the guests, including politicians such as David Davies, Nigel Farage and Viscount Astor (Samantha Cameron’s stepfather), media figures like ITV’s Robert Peston and, of course, the Duchess of York.

             Clement Freud without a doubt knows, he had dinner with them in the days after, at his Praia de Luz villa, not far from the McCanns place. I'd say they (its a pedo vacation spot, with a literal pedo pub, where pedos meet up to discuss sharing arrangements, rates for locals etc) went for a swapping holiday, and the shit got out of hand with Maddie. I'd say they all know. My only question would be, did the McCanns leave knowing someone was coming for arranged rape of their daughter, kill her and leave with the evidence (maybe th e-fits of Podesta's) , or were the McCanns present at some point, and did they disppose of remains?

              I very much agree.  The Freud Family is really messed up.  Clement's wife was accused of sexually abusing a 16 year old boy and he claims it was kind of a "family thing"  that was accepted by Clement as well.  He had no problem with it.  His wife had a connection to Lewis Carrol of Alice's Adventures fame.  She was enthralled with Carrol when younger.  While checking out the internet during reading your comment I found this

              This is a blog of Craig Murray who was a Former Ambassador to the US.  Read it all, it is not long, and I found it astoundingly startling.  Another interesting fact about Murray is that he swore that he was the person that Seth Rich handed off the Podesta emails to in a DC park.  Interesting.  Very Interesting.  Read the article for it contains a small piece about Freud, and the McCanns and that is also very startling.

            Getting knighted seems to have been a special privilege for sex offenders.... /s
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe we should look at the list of people who got knighted in Britain? (Only half-joking.)

             I seriously think that's really what the knighting thing is all about. It really is a special club.
