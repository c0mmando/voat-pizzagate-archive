<p>i thought it was odd that the address in question would be in such a strangely formatted spreadsheet, and a quick look couldn\'t find anything interesting.</p>

            */https://cryptome.org/2016/08/guccifer-14573-democrat-contacts.xls I dont know whether the info is there as well, not being techy.
I had assumed the field hosue was a separate little summehouse thing, but good work it might well be as you surmise. 
I wondered about the pillow they bought as it said  in the email, whether pillow is pillow or is code.

             i'm sure that pillow is pillow - i've stayed in vacation homes like that before - everything is for sale if you ask about it...and the realtor currently has an interior design business.
            </p>
            <p>
             if we assume she's not hip to the goings-on, then the request about pillows is not alarming.  without any other real mention of pillows in the collection of emails, it seems innocent.

              Yes just reread that email, i had not worked on it for some time. yes it was sandler who was using the  code not kate, so pillow probably is innocent. Have you checked out the kitchen island as a matter of interest, where the handkerchief was found?
