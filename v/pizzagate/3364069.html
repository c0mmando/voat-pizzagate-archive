<p>I came across an extremely provocative article connects a lot of dots and creates others. It\'s based upon the premise that the expired Saudi Passport that was issued by Israel was issued as part of Iran-Contra. While the origin of the passport is speculative, they do hit the nail on the head as to what was going on in that period of time.

<p>Israel\'s participation and activity in this trafficking and the plot to destroy America has become more than evident to me. We all keep forgetting that Jews have the same problem Christians have, in that, their religion is a cover for Satanists. Satanic pedophiles who proliferate like the scum they are. That\'s the enemy. Keep your eye on that ball and not the shiny glitter ones thrown at us for distraction. </p>
<p>I believe the putting the Epstein child sex trafficking operation into perspective is important. It does make sense to me that it is a continuation of Iran-Contra. A whole lot of blackmail and money is being collected by keeping the most lucrative part of the enterprise going. Here goes: </p>

<p>Wow…It’s an MK slip-n-slide all the way down everywhere you look these days. In the just released film Midsommar, the bright daylight and sunny climes conceal the true horrors that lie in wait for the unsuspecting, the uninitiated. What a parable for these times….. Almost like a breezy Caribbean island where the unspeakable lurks underground, undercover, and behind every palm tree. And interestingly, tellingly, huge occult markers lie at the bottom, and stand as lynchpins, of both of those rabbit holes. And this is our world. The real world. The one we’ve been telling, warning, people about for years and that no one wanted to acknowledge or even give a cursory glance towards. Smart people. People that should have known better.  ... </p>
<p>It’s still a panic attack, it just ain’t so low flying anymore. And I repeat, it’s not a “witch hunt” in their paranoid, entitled classification system if there REALLY ARE witches. They always just call it that to paint their vile selves as martyrs. Don’t fall for the misdirection of their self-outing themselves as what they really are and then portraying it as pious satire and/or sarcasm. Michael Aquino on Geraldo’s Devil Worship Exposing Satan’s Underground special in 1988 lamented the prosecution of Satanists as a “witch hunt” during  the “Satanic Panic” days – that wording seem familiar now? I’m sure they would love to take the Pedowood stance and turn the ‘Prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein’ into the ‘Persecution of Jeffrey Epstein’ and make it the same thing. It is NOT, and no amount of dark-state-sanctioned pedo-enabling and pedo-normalizing in the media is going to change that. Thankfully the awakened and pissed off masses are much less easily duped these days, Colonel.  .... </p>

<p>The article continues from there and it really is well-done, but in terms of other similarities or coincidences, here is one concerning Sir Jimmy Savile and Jeffrey Epstein.

<p>So they both indulged in &quot;eye&quot; art? And did you catch the reference to a \'\'doll\'\' hanging from a chandelier. Was Sia\'s song \'\'Chandelier\'\' written with that in mind? One wonders. Now in terms of impregnating women, here\'s the recent story about Epstein. And I didn\'t overlook the above film &quot;Midsommar&quot;. It\'s a film about human sacrifice.

             I always wondered if Somerton Palace were really alluding to Roy Radin.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was found decapitated in the desert, but then they walked back the detail and just said he was murdered. He was scum and was alleged to film rapes and maybe other kinds of videos at his wild parties thrown on Long Island.

             Hey, thanks so much.
            </p>
            <p>
             The article is extremely well-written and I wanted to get it out there. As I said, yesterday I discovered another twist to this global perv elite cabal story that is so ridiculously insane that I almost can't believe it -- and, yet, I can.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hope to get it submitted soon.

            "Wexner Asks $60 M. at Godly 834 Fifth" -- "By January 1996, the billionaire Les Wexner hadn’t spent two months in his 21,000-square-foot stone mansion on East 71st Street, even though he had bought the place seven years earlier, his protégé Jeffrey Epstein told The Times. Never mind that it had been outfitted with a hidden lead-lined bathroom (with a closed-circuit TV) and a heated sidewalk to keep the mansion snow-free. Mr. Epstein, who has since become a billionaire as well, eventually moved into that mansion..."
           </p>
           <p>
            Hung lead sheets are used for soundproofing, such as in recording studios. They deaden low frequencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that in NYC media discussing hi-end real estate, 834 Fifth is often referred to Lordly or Godly. Also note that Epstein favors bizarre art with themes of death and the occult, as did the Podesta bros.

             Interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
             So basically, this group pitches in and sets each other up. All they do is recycle money and launder it through their business dealings. Hence, the video Julian Assange tweeted of MIA and Paper Planes.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is undoubtedly a cult/cabal and more. You can tell by the members thinking along the same bizarre lines. It's weird enough to find one person that enjoys jewelry and art made from eyeballs, but you have two leaders/influencers within the same elite pedo cabal? And probably more. And I know what we're talking about is beyond weird, but I've actually discovered something even more sick and twisted. How is that possible? Well, by following the clues the turds in the snow, the feces leads you there. I'm still thinking of how to phrase the submission and still doing a little more research to see if Junkermann fits into it ... I'm sure she does ... if she is a she. I'm not taking anything on faith anymore.

            Thank you for hightlighting the Saudi connection. Remember that Epstein is connected to Prince Salman  - he has a photo in his house showing him and Salman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, his appartment in Paris is in a house with four apartments, and one of them is owned by a member of the Saudi Royal family - i.e., a relative of Prince Salman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Incidentally, Prince Salman's sister lives in on the same road as Epstein in Paris, on the posh Avenue Foche.
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein hired an interior designer for his NY mansion who is a fav intererior designer of the Saudi Royal family.
           </p>
           <p>
            His name is Pinto, and he and his sister seem to have dined frequently with Epstein
            <strong>
             and underage girls
            </strong>
            when Epstein was in Paris. Pinto's sister says she didn't know the girls were that young. Sure. /s
           </p>
           <p>
            Going to do a post about it, and will ad the sources then.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-section">
           </h1>
           <p>
            A correction  - the passport found in Epstein's mansion was issued by Austria not Saudi Arabia. It said that Epstein lived in Saudi Arabia though.
