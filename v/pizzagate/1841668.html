            YES !!!
           </p>
           <p>
            The Catholic Church has been preaching intolerance and hatred for homosexuals
for more than 1,000 years and it worked to create violence against them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though, about 1,000 years ago the Catholic Church was performing gay marriages.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it was natural that the Catholic Church would try to scapegoat homosexuals for sexual
abuse of children in the church.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure many will also recall the Anita Bryant campaign which was quite vicious
against homosexuals and tried to ban them from adopting children and from 
teaching in our public schools and from Boy Scout groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the contrary, homosexuals seek adult relationships with other adult homosexuals.
           </p>
           <p>
            And while it is agreed even by right wing women's groups that MALES are our sexual abusers
of children, they are heterosexual males.
           </p>
           <p>
            Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLEASE READ THIS ... if I haven't posted it to you previously.  Thank you!  :)
           </p>
           <p>
            A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children. A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual. One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men. Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children. They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults. In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children. Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay. One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children." Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."

 Also : The right-wing "Family Research Council" notes/confirms findings that "almost all child sexual abuse is committed by men."

            Oh my God, do you really think that women enjoy being gangbanged, spat on, choked?  What fuels porn is the demand, and the demand comes from men.

            i don't really think that run of the mill porn is really the problem. i think it's Addiction that is the problem &amp; the intentional way that the industry keeps pushing it into the realm of violence &amp; then eventually snuff. it's really quite frightening how many sick people are running around doing all kinds of weird things to satisfy their addictions, but i don't think being a paranoid prude is really the remedy. many addicts can be treated (NOT pedos however), unless they are hopeless psychopaths. in that case they need to be sequestered away from a functioning society.

            i found my mother through an organisation called jigsaw i dont know if they even exist any more in australia. i applied for my original birth certificate with my birth mothers name on it and my original name. the whole thing is really confusing and i have no regard for organised religion or the governments policies on allowing institiutional abuse of children. the other victims were the aboriginal children who were removed from their families by the government and suffered terrible abuse at the hands of paedophile run orphanages

            How bad is it, when a porn star is repulsed by the obvious catering to pedophiles?

            Here is her testimony on video: "Ex Pornstar EXPOSES pedophilia promotion within the porn industry ":

           <p>
            From the description: "I've been battling with myself over telling the public about why I quit porn for many months now. I'm partly ashamed and partly fearful of the potential backlash, so I'd really appreciate any and all of your support. Hopefully this was educational for many of you and hopefully if you're an 18 year old girl thinking of dropping out of high school to do porn, you won't now."

            What a collective load of bullshit.  Whatever happened to good parenting and personal responsibility?  This addicted to porn shit is only because lazy ass parents don't kick their kids out the door to go play.  They'd rather stay home and jerk off.  If the internet was around when I was 11...who knows what would have happened.  They can also order any drugs they want off the internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do agree that the limits of "mainstream" porn seem to be everchanging with newer, weirder, and kinkier.  And yes, the young thing is pushed to the limit.
           </p>
           <p>
            But at the end of the day, there is such a thing called free will and people need to be accountable for their own actions.  Saying "the Jews control everything" is saying your life is a hot mess and it isn't your fault, because it's the Jews' fault.

            So many ordinary people seem to think pornography is a normal , harmless adult thing to do. Wake up! Its not. It's completely toxic to the human psyche and to human interpersonal relationships. The elite are trying to make perverts of us all, and it's working to a large extent.

            i did find her but unfortunately its hard to forge the mother daughter bond. i blame the church and the state they were taking babies from single mothers in australia for decades. you went to neerkol. i'm impressed. i havent even been out there but i did read a book by one of the children who survived the abuses out there. there is a memorial there now built by the survivors.

            real question. would you consider the movie "pretty baby" to be child porn? there is a trend to rewrite history. society used to be MORE accepting of children's sexual activity. the real conspiracy is that the new narrative is that children's sexuality and sexual activity is always evil and wrong. the new narrative is that any adult who has sex with a child is automatically raping the child, because the child's sexual desire is by default considered wrong or at the minimum, invalid.
           </p>
           <p>
            men addicted to seeing sexual activity like to see a variety of sexual activity. this is like men who watch movies like to see a variety of movies. men who like jokes, like to hear a variety of jokes. humans in general like novelty. the new narrative has to censor the truth in order to maintain the lie. many children enjoy sex.

            Do you have kids. Do you let them watch modern Disney and other popular animated films.
Watch closely because they are sexualizing your kids and turning them into cynical sarcastic sexualized brats. Of course not every child will become that, but there is a noticeable sexual programming going on from a very early age from childrens Disney tv and films.

            I had a friend who was addicted to more and more extreme porn. This was years back when streaming Internet was expensive.. He clocked up over $500 bucks on our internet account and was using our laptops while we were at work to feed his habit.
It completely took over his life. Luckily he got over it before he lost everything.

            Orwell predicted the use of pornography to control the masses and destroy the traditional family unit - guess even he couldn't imagine such a nefarious use as this for it, but worryingly it makes a lot of sense. Not normally a reader of Catholic newspapers but this is a decent article:

             While I completely get every word you are saying and am behind what you say I believe the poster isn't wrong. While this may right now be "some" men the bigger agenda will eventually be all and the destruction of a family unit. I'm guessing you didn't have explicit porn since the age of 8. That's what is happening now. 10/20 years down the line of growing up with sexualisation being a complete norm - adverts, films, music videos etc .. will their sexual desires still be forfilled? This plan of turning the nation into brain washed pigs has been going on since at least the 50s and I don't think the plan was to stop any time soon.

            Unfortunately, pedophiles can be created by sexual abuse/torture, something which the CIA/MKULTRA clearly understood.
NOT every child who is sexually abused will become a pedophile, but some will.
Studies seem to show that pedophiles have NO sexual-orientation.
           </p>
           <p>
            In order to protect children every family needs to know that our sexual abusers of children are MALES.
Even right wing women's groups agree with that.
But they are heterosexual males in the main.
Don't know what the estimate is on pedophiles in our society, but I've read that it's a rather small percentage
(when CIA isn't involved) and generally attributed to childhood sexual abuse.  But even when sexual abuse
is eliminated as a cause, researchers do find that at least one will show up.
I've come to question whether circumcision -- which I think started as religious ritual -- may be a cause of it??
More men have to begin to protect their sons from the pain and lasting impact of circumcision.
And more Mothers have to realize that they have to play a larger role in protecting their newborn sons from circumcision.
Our pediatricians also have to be challenged on circumcision which continues to be proscribed as beneficial to health!
           </p>
           <p>
            Coming back to the question of who sexually abuses children, heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.  Homosexual males seek relationships with other adult males according to studies.
           </p>
           <p>
            When heterosexual males are involved in sexual abuse of children, it is being referred to as "situational" pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's one of the studies on this issue --
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
            </p>
            <p>
             Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children. A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual. One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men. Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children. They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults. In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children. Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay. One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children." Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."

             Interesting thoughts on circumcision....as a cut guy myself.....but not so sure about putting it all at straight guys' door...we are the majority of the male population....and there are plenty of female abusers....and the situation we are looking at in Washington seems to have a significant gay contingent

             Interesting point about circumcision. In the UK, where circumcision for non-religous reasons is comparatively rare, a study showed a correlation between the lack of a foreskin and a preference for a smaller orifice. Perhaps those faiths who have insisted on this practice for hundreds of years will have a higher cultural and physical propensity to seek out anal sex or children for their sexual gratification.

             I dunno. Now that homosexuality is accepted and protected, I tuink the pedophiles are aligning this way. In truth, that part about them having no sexuality is probably the most right. They're just horny sociopaths.

              I think you're confused.
             </p>
             <p>
              Homosexuality is not abnormal and about 1,000 years ago the Catholic Church used
to perform homosexual marriages.
             </p>
             <p>
              You need to understand that our sexual abusers of children are MALES 
and that they are heterosexual males....
             </p>
             <p>
              Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a 
homosexual male --
             </p>
             <p>
              And that is the truth despite the lies and propaganda the Catholic Church has spread
about homosexuals for a thousand years or more.

            This so-called 'expert' is a relationship counselor. Study after study has shown that these people actually have
            <em>
             no skill at all
            </em>
            in fixing relationships. To a first approximation they know nothing useful.

            All she offers as evidence is a few stories. Note the lack of peer reviewed studies published in reputable journals.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no evidence that exposure to porn turns people into pedophiles.

            True, this has been a long emerging problem where let's be honest, the porn industry -- Comcast and Verizon are making $$ and pushing child porn on those already addicted.  Some families are waking up to find the guy is so totally addicted to porn that they can't work and are becoming distant from their families hiding what they are doing.  It has to remain hidden, that's clear.  Society is NOT going to embrace this.
And it's making the guys sick.  If you want to lose your mind this is one way to do it.

            You know, I love porn. I have watched porn for many years without the desire for it to get weird, bad, or sad.
            <br/>
            However, I do see weird shit being pushed in porn. Are there really that many people into incest? And most disturbing, pornhub has added a "panda style" category. What the  fuck is up with that? Especially given all the horrible panda associations discovered here?

             There is now a significant amount of incest porn, forced sex (simulated rape) and just degenerate porn (water sports, gang bangs, bukaki etc) being featured on the world's largest porn site, Pornhub.  This is the agenda push to debase and desensitise the goy, plain and simple and anyone denying it is either wilfully ignorant or tacitly in support of.  What is bad for the goy is good for (((them))).

             Recall Sigmund Freud's "Oedipus Complex" where he betrayed his young patients who had confided in him being sexually abused by fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins - and male friends of the family.
             <br/>
             In the Oedipus Complex, Freud made the outrageous suggestion that it is infants and toddlers and young people who are the sexual aggressors against adult males in their families.  This was a gigantic lie which has kept the public from understanding who our sexual abusers of children really are.  They are MALES which everyone needs to know in order to protect our children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also need to make clear to those who have been influenced by the Catholic Church's propaganda against homosexuals.
Homosexuals seek relationships with other adult homosexuals - not with children.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Hawaii, before the "white" man arrived, homosexuals were held in high esteem and honor for their care of orphaned children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Too many Americans today still believe the RCC church and "Anita Bryant" propaganda to create intolerance and hatred for homosexuals, especially to make it impossible for them to adopt children here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's some further info --
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
             </p>
             <p>
              Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children. A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual. One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men. Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children. They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults. In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children. Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay. One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children." Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."

Also : The right-wing "Family Research Council" notes/confirms findings that "almost all child sexual abuse is committed by men."

               There is no homosexual "agenda" except that which has been pushed by the Catholic Church
for more than 1,000 years.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, records show that the Catholic Church until about 1,000 years ago were
conducting Homosexual Marriages.
              </p>
              <p>
               We also see in our own society that homosexuals are making excellent parents when they
are permitted to adopt children.
              </p>
              <p>
               We also know that in Hawaii (before the coming of the white man) homosexuals were honored and
esteemed for their care of orphans in Hawaii society.
              </p>
              <p>
               Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
              </p>
              <p>
               We've also seen how often Catholic priests sexually abusing children can also often be involved with adult females.
This is called "situational" pedophilia.

              <p>
               It's taken great courage for homosexuals to stand up against homophobia as you are showing it and I very much hope if I were homosexual that I would be that courageous.
              </p>
              <p>
               We do however need more emphasis on this Catholic Church of pedophiles and situational pedophiles who are heterosexual.
As Italians have made clear, Catholic priests have been abusing children since day #1 of the church's existence and that's 2,000+ years.

                 yeah, it does get a bit suffocating up in here sometimes, doesn't it? if we weren't all concerned about the child abuse etc issue we wouldn't be here. so we do have that in common.

            In the 1960s pictures of naked women were enough.  Then in the seventies porn was normal women and men having sex.  But then that's not enough, and men want more.  Now gonzo porn is the norm--women gagging, vomiting, being choked being spat on, anal rape, gang bangs.  That's what's 'normal porn' these days.    It's not even sex any more--it's abuse.  And with titles like 'Daddy give it to me' and 'Schoolgirl fantasy', yeah, they're pushing pedophilia.

             Very glad you're talking about the violence of pornography which is often denied.
I've read that the physical abuse of those women who have appeared in videos is now so
intense and cruel that they leave the industry now after about three months.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the ways that child porn is introduced is the same way that they've corrupted advertising --
Cigarette advertisers would put up billboards showing young people hanging out, playing pool, but one or 
two would be show blowing bubble gum and when you looked again, you'd realize that they didn't quite look
like teenagers -- but younger.  They'd find kids who looked younger than their actual years to use and it was
legitimate, but it was done to confuse the public.  Fortunately, that's gone.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, recently I noticed NJ LOTTERY ads -- and previously they weren't allowed to advertise
gambling, but evidently they are now.  At any rate, it's a very quick commercial for the lottery showing
kids playing basketball and up pops the suggestion "play the lottery" -- maybe college money will come
your way?  But when this ad which is probably only about a minute long ends, you're really wondering
about the age of the kids they were showing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Same way they're drawing very young kids into watching porn.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pornography is for men without imaginations, but it's also about encouraging physical abuse of females.
And disrespect for females.

            This can't be happening. But yes: we have already seen the normalizing of child porn, as discussed many times on Voat before. I'm scared at the time frame of when all this will be considered 'legal.' Hope I'm dead before then.

             Me too.  There are some sick women out there too, but the porn thing is mostly a man thing.  It is really sick and so very destructive, to the victim and the viewer.  It robs your soul of respect for your fellow humans. I don't want to think how they start viewing children in their families and on the street.  Very frightening. This is the beginning of our crumbling society.  It must stop, for I believe it is an epidemic.

            Get off porn.  It is human trafficking.  We've seen horror stories of young girls in human trafficking and of adult girls in human trafficking.  The stories are very similar and range from standard prostitution, to transport across the US, to drug and economic dependency, to physical tracking and physical captivity.  No matter the age you see the full spectrum of human trafficking.  Age has no meaning in human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            But we see that CP is a thing, which is a product of human trafficking.  Where is the adult human trafficking film?

             Exactly. A friend of mine wrote her brief in Civil Rights Litigation on the treatment of prostitutes as victims rather than whores. The majority of prostitutes are victims. The pimps are the traffickers. To pretend that porn is any different is a little naive. Prostitution is paying someone to have sex with you, porn is where the owner of the girl gets paid to film it.

              This isn't exactly a study, but it refers to a Canadian study --
             </p>
             <p>
              Note the claim that 29% of the female population has been sexually abused.
I wouldn't be shocked by that figure.
Recall that 80 million (an old figure) females have suffered Female Genital Mutilation, the
equivalent of which would be total removal of a male's penis.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               One theory is that people who are molested/abused have their sexual/moral compass thrown off kilter, particularly in case where the abuse was by family or friends: Daddy loves me; Daddy is good; Daddy touched me, ergo, this type of behaviour is okay. I'm sure that there are plenty of people who are
abused that also withdraw instead of "act out".
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's some data I pulled from one Canadian study:
              </p>
              <p>
               Quote:
history of childhood sexual abuse
• prostitutes: 38% -- 73%
• general pop: 19% to 50%
• male care-giver
              </p>
              <p>
               Bagley &amp; Young:
• compared prostitutes &amp; general sample
• 73% vs 29%
              </p>
              <p>
               So there does seem to be some correlation, although that study also indicates it is not causative.

               Interesting that you are bringing up genital mutilation. Genital mutilation stems from the Lilith myth. Lilith is also the mother of the Baphomet, the androgynous symbol of the antichrist and her offspring with his father Satan. The tranny agenda is all about the androgynous Baphomet and it is about mutilation as well.

                Not familiar with your interpretation of Female Genital Mutilation -- 
Understand that this is full removal of all of the tissue between the labia right down to the bone.
And women are forced into positions where they actually carry out this torture on young girls.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, Lilith was Adam's first wife who understood that she was created equal to Adam.
Adam saw her as "uppity" and they were divorced.
There are a lot of lies about Lilith and you have to dig and dig to find the truth -- that she 
was a very good friend to Eve, for one.
               </p>
               <p>
                You've mainly captured the lies, imo.

                 Here's more info on the origins of circumcision and how it was later forced on the Jews with threats of death at the hands of the Egyptians after the Jews tried to stop the practice.

                 There are ample resources comparing different types of female genital mutilation, there is not just one type. Similarly there is not just one type of male genital mutilation, but all types of genital mutilation are wrong whether on boys or girls. Are you saying Lilith is not the demon in charge of killing babies in the Jewish myth if they don't go get circumcised? Feel free to enlighten us.

             The point is that this is where it's headed, this is the next logical step in the quest for bigger thrills. As Rock Hudson told his "lover" to bring some young boys over to "spice things up."

               Yes, I read it years ago, it was part of court testimony I believe. I believe they were more like 15 and 16 years of age, not young children.

             Its co-founder and chair Juliet Grayson has warned that addiction to online porn is leading men to seek out indecent images of children, even though they do not identify as paedophiles who are attracted primarily to minors.
            </p>
            <p>
             Speaking exclusively to Femail, she explained that people who look at illegal images have often temporarily lost the ability to discriminate between right and wrong because of their addiction.

             They don't identify as pedophiles, but heterosexual males are the majority of our sexual abusers of children.
It's called "situational" pedophilia and we need to have a full understanding of who our sexual abusers of children really are.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are MALES --
            </p>
            <p>
             Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the lies about homosexuals linger in the minds of many who find it difficult to believe that they've been
lied to by the Catholic Church and Anita Bryant ... !!
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's not lose sight of who is pushing this -- Comcast and Verizon for $$$$$$$$$$$$$ --
            </p>
            <p>
             Behind this push has always been the desire to corrupt youth -- whether with drugs or sexual perversion.
            </p>
            <p>
             I still have a movie network on my TV which I have free and later at night they push porn on the public ...
Well, it's kind of disguised by various titles to hide what it is -- 
but as I go by it, I often stop for a moment in wonder at who watches it because it's basically "jackhammer" sex.
And it's laughable.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's always a battle to separate males from women and children -- 
that's the only way to send a male to war, for instance.
            </p>
            <p>
             Music which may soften the male heart or make clear his yearning for a female
has to be disappeared because it might suggest that a female can control a male 
by her desirability.  And that's what much of Doo Wop was about.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's been every effort made to disappear music which speaks of love and romance.
But, it does keep happening.  :)
            </p>
            <p>
             This pornography is intended to show and create violence against women.

              While that may be true, the fact is pedophile normalization, a little publically known platform of BAMN, is using gay rights advocacy as the vehicle to get pedophilia recognized as a civil right, along with sexual rights of children to engage in whatever sex "they want" with adults. At the same time, BAMN has been brainwashing young teens with radical Marxist communist doctrine and using them as protest slaves.  Their members are embedded within teachers unions, and the entire educational system.
              <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/04/28/documents-tie-berkeley-riot-organizers-to-pro-pedophilia-group-nambla/">

             </p>
             <p>
              "The 1992 edition of the pro-pedophilia bulletin also noted the participation of RWL, which was described as a “NAMBLA ally.”
Shanta Driver, described by the Capital Research Center as BAMN’s founder and co-chair, was affiliated with RWL as early as 1983, according to the Workers Vanguard, a communist publication. She also identified herself to the Los Angeles Times as an activist with RWL in late 1995 while protesting in Berkeley.
             </p>
             <p>
              Driver argued before the Supreme Court on behalf of BAMN as recently as 2013.
Driver’s former law partner, Eileen Scheff — who has represented BAMN on multiple occasions, including at the Supreme Court — has been a self-described “member of NAMBLA.” The bulletin identified Scheff as an RWL member."
             </p>
             <p>
              A founder of the hard core Marxist communist, violence endorsing group BAMN, Eileen Scheff is quoted in the Nambla publication, speaking out for a litany of groups, ..."and gay organizations such as Nambla."
             </p>
             <p>
              The text of Scheff's speech was accompanied by a picture of young shirtless boys, 'attendees', sitting on the ground outside, listening to speeches.

            This is exactly what the ex porn star was talking about in the post yesterday that if you log into a porn website the first you see is like young looking girls with braces and little girl clothes. The porn industry is totally pushing people to watch CP. Also, if people watch a lot of porn they are being desensitized to normal sex and want to see dirtier and dirtier things. Scary times we live in.

            </p>
            <p>
             "The boom in images that turn women into sexual objects accompanied the sexual revolution -
            </p>
            <p>
             not to cater to men's fantasies, but to defend them against their fears."
            </p>
            <p>
             "When men control women's sexuality, they are safe from sexual evaluation."

             Porn has always been a Jewish dominated industry.  Relatedly Yale is probably like 20% jewish and it's motto is written in Hebrew and Yale is famous for its "sex week" which is more like 10 days where freshmen are given sex toys, lube, seminars on anal sex, lectures by the biggest porn king a mr. ((HIRSCH)). At least one Jewish pornographer has stated he relished getting revenge on the WASPs who bullied him by addicting them to smut and prostituting their daughter.  These are the media Jews who made the term "barely legal" into a brand name they were so proud of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The WASPs who founded this country were strict Puritans with morality codes so strong they would confiscate illegitimate children from single mothers and banish vagrants from the area.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jewish "scientists" from sciences as dislocated as linguistics pushed the idea of relativism with the aim of upturning the traditional consenus among Europeans: that illegitimacy, promiscuity, and sodomy are destructive and should thus be stigmatized so as to warn younger generations.
            </p>
            <p>
             We now have no stigmas left except against tobacco smokers. Jewish Hollywood has in fact glorified the single mother as equal to a traditional monogamous European family.

              Great comment. Until people figure how the jewish question plays out in ALL our affairs, then these ignorant people simply know NOTHING about how the world is managed by jews and how they start all the wars, all the revolution and are behind all corruption. Pizzagate is jewish blood sacrifice. PERIOD. Nothing to debate.

              Right, they were simply people who burned women at the stake -- !!
And were probably pedophiles in their own homes with their own children -- !!
             </p>
             <p>
              There are a small percentage of people in every group - males/women -- every religion, every political party, ever race, every nationality -- who are a problem for the rest of us.  They are often violent, sexually perverted, criminally-minded, whatever.
             </p>
             <p>
              Humans have never found a way to deal with  the few violent among every group.

There is a reason they are kicked out of EVERY FUCKING SINGLE COUNTRY THEY HAVE EVER SETTELED IN! All the pogroms were because jews have been Pizzagating for 100s of years. The jews call the conspiracy "blood libel" but its 100% true and WELL DOCUMENTED in hundreds of court cases. There are Childeren who were cannonized as saints because they were abducted and sacrificed!

                DONALD DRUMPF
               </p>
               <p>
                I have copied and pasted the relevant parts of the essay by Miles Mathis on Donald Drumpf 's (not Trump) Jewish ancestry…
               </p>
               <p>
                His genealogy is a total mirage. Click on his mother, Anne MacLeod. She is the wife of Alexander MacLeod, so that is her married name. What is her maiden name? Whoops, it is also MacLeod, because her father is also named Alexander MacLeod. So both her father and her husband have the same first and last names? Did she marry her own father?[Geni also fails to mention the name Trump was originally Drumpf.]
               </p>
               <p>
                Both Trump's parents died at Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anne McLeod is supposed to be Trump's great-grandmother. Although Trump looks about 30 years older than me, his listed age is only 17 years older. Which takes us back to 1863. So we have a 30-year gap there between his 4th generation.
               </p>
               <p>
                So let's return to Friedrich Drumpf, Donald's great-grandfather. Two of his sisters are listed as Elisabetha Freund and Syblia Schuster. Oi-vay! Those are both Jewish surnames. We just saw the name Schuster in my paper on Engels published two days ago. I reminded you there that Max Schuster, founder of Simon&amp;Schuster, is now admitted to be Jewish. The Schuster in the Socialism project with Engels was also shown to be almost certainly Jewish. As for Freund, see Michael Freund, Moshe Aryeh Freund, Wilhelm Freund, Yoav Freund, Leopold Freund, and too many others to mention. So at least two of Trump's great-aunts married Jewish men. This reminds us that his daughter Ivanka married a Jewish man, Jared Kushner. We are told this is an anomaly, but it isn't. What is an anomaly is that Kushner admits he is Jewish.

                Friedrich Drumpf's mother is named Katarina Kober. Not only is that possibly Jewish, but it lead to another suspicious scrubbing of the genealogy. Her father is given as Johann, but he has no parents. He is the only one in that generation whose parents are unknown. Even his wife's parents are known. I suggest the name isn't Kober, but Kolber. We have seen the genealogies being whitewashed this way again and again. Changing one letter is often the best way to do it. It is the most subtle, so it draws the least attention. Kolber is very often Jewish.

                With more study, we find that Trump's aunt Elizabeth married William O. Walter. That name is also possibly Jewish. We find a William Walter as Director of Jewish Family Services in York, PA. Also a William Walter just buried at Jewish Memorial Chapel of Long Island. Also a William O. Walter marrying a Cora Neuhauser in Lebanon, PA, in 1924. That name is also probably Jewish. And most curiously, a William Walter, Esq. listed in the Jewish Missionary Intelligence of June, 1896. More research discovers his firm were the honorary stockbrokers of this London Jewish society in 1900. That is interesting because it directly ties to my previous paper on Friedrich Engels and Robert Owen. Owen's brother in-law was James Haldane Stewart, who worked for the Jews' Society in the 1830s and 40s, a precursor of this Jewish Missionary Intelligence. At any rate, this may be our William Walter or his father, given that date. His father is scrubbed at Geni. The names Walter and Walters were chosen by Jews entering the US, as a new name, as we see from Barbara Walters. Her father Louis Walters was original Louis Abrahams.

                [In later papers on Spotlight and on the Nazis, I found a possible genealogical link between Trump and top Nazis. Wiki and Geni admit Donald Trump is related to the famous Heinz family. Marty Baron, editor of the Boston Globe, is listed at Geni.com as the son of Howard Naftali (Heinz) Baron. We aren't told what the Heinz stands for there, but it isn't his mother's maiden name, since she is a Kohane (probably a variation of Cohen). I guess we are supposed to think it is just his nickname, but how do you get Heinz from Howard or Naftali? His grandfather is Naftali Herz Kohane, so I thought maybe he got the Heinz from Herz. Is that possible? Well, there is a Heinz Herz, b. 1907, famous German historian, so let's study him. He has a Wiki page in German. There, his father is given as “evangelical pastor” Johannes Heinrich Herz, but suspiciously no mother is given. However, they all but admit Heinz was Jewish when they tell us he was denied habilitation during the Nazi era. Why else would he be denied advancement? Are we supposed to think he was a Gypsy? Even stranger, they admit he was a NSDAP party member since 1938. What? A party member, but denied habilitation during the Nazi era? Could this bio be any more contradictory? I take both facts as indication he was Jewish, for reasons you now understand. If we search for his genealogy, we find nothing, but we do find a Heinz Herz from 1923 in Germany. His mother is listed as an Arensberg, which is Jewish. More indication is that he worked in a bank early on—which may have been a family bank. This also reminds us that in German, Heinz is normally a given name, not a surname. But that still hasn't given us any link between the Heinz family and the Herz family. It certainly doesn't indicate Heinz is a variation of Herz. So I appear to have hit a deadend. One of my hunches finally died on the vine. Or did it?
               </p>
               <p>
                If we take Henry John Heinz back several generations, we come to Johann Georg Heinz. He married Anna Henninger, daughter of Nicholaus Henninger. This rings a bell because Himmler's paternal great-grandfather was really a Hettinger. His grandmother was the Himmler, which means the names were switched at this point. Himmler should be a Hettinger. Either way, we have Hettingers and Henningers. Could they be the same family? If they are, then I will have linked Trump to Himmler by another route. In fact, they are linked, as we find at these pages for the Oberst family. Those pages are worth studying, since we find links to many curious surnames, including Lanza. Remember Adam Lanza, alleged shooter at Sandy Hook? We also find Schicks, Ackermans, Görungs (Görings), Hammers, Kaisers, Rudolphs, Zimmermans, Brecht(el)s, Jungs, Barths, Meyers, Webers, Vaughans, Brauns, Vogels, Feils, Hoffmans and Mullers. But the first sign of Henninger we get is when Elisabeth Oberst marries Johann Henninger in 1825 in Unterowisheim, Baden. Both are of that town. In 1849, Susanna Oberst marries Jacob Hettinger of. . . wait for it. . . Unterowisheim, Baden. In 1851, Michael Oberst marries Katarina Henninger, again in Unterowisheim, Baden. In the 1920s, an Olga Obrist marries an Edward Hedinger. I suspect these are all variants of the same name, but even if they aren't, we have just linked the Henningers and Hettingers through the Obersts. They are from the same town in the same years, and are linked to all these obviously Jewish families. To salt that in, we also get the Görings and Brauns and Hoffmanns. Also the Schicks. Hitler's grandmother was a Schicklgruber, remember? So not only have we just linked Trump to Himmler, we have linked Himmler to Göring, Braun, and Hitler. All these people now look like cousins. Yes, the links I have uncovered are from the 19th century, more than 150 years ago. But historically, that isn't that long ago.

                But back to Trump. In his biography The Art of the Deal, Trump lied about his grandfather's country of origin, stating it was Sweden instead of Germany. So if you think these people wouldn't lie about their ancestry, you need to explain that whopper.

                Trump was brought up in Jamaica Estates, Queens, which has a large Jewish population. He went to Kew-Forest School, ditto. Its other notable alumni include Katherine Weber, Jewish, Gideon Yago, Jewish, and Hank Azaria, Jewish. Googling on “attended Kew-Forest” brings up mostly Jewish names. Trump's father was on the Board of Trustees at Kew-Forest. By the way, it is very expensive.

                Ivana is also Jewish. An early boyfriend was George Syrovatka. That is a Jewish name. Her first husband was Alfred Winklemeier. Many websites try to pass him off as an Austrian skier, but Wiki admits he was a real estate agent. Winklemeier is a Jewish name. Ivana lied about being an alternate for the Czech Olympic ski team. She went to McGill University in Montreal, a spook academy we have run across many times. Geni.com lists her father's name as both Knavs and Zelníček. I'll give you a hint: drop the second “e”. You get Zelnick. It is Yiddish for haberdasher. Clothier. It's Jewish, too. See Robert Zelnick, Strauss Zelnick, Bob Zelnick, etc. Robert was a fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford. Strauss was President of 20th Century Fox. Bob was ABC News producer. Also Friedrich Zelnik, silent film producer. Also David O. Selznick, whose name was originally Zeleznick, or, alternately, Zelnick. He and his father were major Hollywood producers, David at RKO (which was owned by Joseph Kennedy, remember).

                Both Trump and his father ran with top Jews in New York, including Samuel Lindenbaum and his father Abraham (Bunny), and Roy Cohn. These guys weren't just their attorneys, they were their enablers. As the NYT says in the 2012 obituary of Samuel Lindenbaum:
Mr. Lindenbaum cultivated a scholar’s knowledge of the Zoning Resolution, the arcane document that governs development in New York. As a result, he was able to bend the resolution to his clients’ will without breaking it. And because his clients were major builders and landowners — among them Harry B. Helmsley, Harry Macklowe, Larry A. Silverstein, Jerry I. Speyer, Leonard Litwin, Steven Roth and Donald J. Trump; the Fishers and Tisches and Rudins and Roses. . .

                Notice anything about that list? Everyone on it “except” Trump is admitted to be Jewish. Curious, no?

               Keep in mind that as part of the Genocide versus the American Indian, the US government organized the kidnapping of native children and put them in the care of the "Church schools" which were run by the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church.
These children were tortured, beaten, hung -- and sexually abused in every way in those schools.
              </p>
              <p>
               It was an effort to destroy generations of native children.

               There is something to this, the Jewish elite have a disproportional grip on power (money and media). They have been called out by many prominent people for centuries for their exploitation of nations through excessive usury and they (at least the elite amongst them) feel they are a superior race (God's chosen) and that Gentiles are cattle to be used. This is not a racist comment just a fact. Anyone can research it. Bernard the banker was pointing this out.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some researchers believe it is a genetic trait (Pakistanis will quarrel for example till they have the last word and they also are "thrifty" to a fault, to put it mildly ... the Dutch have an impish sense of humor, blacks are "inferior" to whites and Asians when it comes to IQ, etc., see the book The Bell Curve).
              </p>
              <p>
               Others believe there is a curse upon them by the God of the OT for their backsliding after he blessed them (which would make the phenomenon more of a "supernatural" thing). This is what Martin Luther believed though he subscribed to the reformation theology teaching that God would indeed visit them again spiritually and reveal their rejected (Jesus) messiah to them.

              <p>
               Edit: A certain regard to the Jewish race, at least by Christians, is to be maintained, as the apostle Paul reasons below.
              </p>
              <p>
               I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
              </p>
              <p>
               2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
              </p>
              <p>
               3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
              </p>
              <p>
               4 Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;
              </p>
              <p>
               5 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Okay, one more EDIT. That EquineLuvr guy believes the bloodlines of the Jews goes back to OT times. Me too. But he's another guy who needs to understand that you do indeed catch more flies w/ honey.

                Like their mainstream counterparts, Jews who enter porn do not usually do so as representatives of their religious group. Most of the performers and pornographers are Jewish culturally but not religiously. Many are entirely secular, Jews in name only"

               Thanks for demanding a response to his accusations.  I am so sick of this.  It seems they wait ready to attack with their same old same old droning Jewish insults.  Enough already.

                Yall are just banking on other people's laziness... And can't see it for the exploitation of human spirit that it is. Should I look into the other points to validate them, or should I too be lazy and muddy the waters rather than engage in real discourse?

                 “We stand ready to assist the students.”   Well I am sure they will.  The Skull and Bones Society is full of pedo elites.  There will be a lot of this going on all over the country in theri attempt to weaken our society even more than they already have.  There will be people from all walks of life, religions and races and sexes.  They have all been indoctrinated and bought out or brownstoned.  We know there is plenty of money to brainwash the masses.  It seems like an insurmountable task to fight this, but I will not stop.

                 Lol. Do your own homework. The evidence is overwhelming. Its why the jews have been kicked out of everysingle country they tried to settle in! Vindick, are you a jew? It seems your sole purpose on Voat is to deflect from the JQ jewish question. As you can see you are failing. Truth will always out itself. TRUTH IS ANTI  SEMITIC.

                 Do your own homework Vindick. The evidence is overwhelming. Its the jews, its always been the jews. Its why they were kicked out of every single country they have ever setteled in. Are you jewish? Is that why you keep defending them? Is it your job to defend jews on Voat?

                 He may be a dick, but sadly he is right.  It is more so the Zionist scumbags we're talking about.  Not all Jews are bad (obviously), but there is quite the disproportionate amount of them who are orchestrating the NWO. (along with their

                 The problem is that all truth is anti semetic. Stop fearing the jews. You were programmed to fear them, we all were. Throw off all fear. Do your own reasearch, then you will be fearless because you will know the truth. All truth is "anti semetic".

                 The pizzagate movement also can't afford to ignore crucial negative facts just because the perpetrators are Jewish. Absolutely ridiculous. Personally, I'm anti all organized religions, they are all equally corrupt and responsible for the hell-like conditions on our planet. How all of you should be, 100% unbiased with no fear of blaming who needs to be blamed... even if there's the risk of a cute little label being put on you like "anti-Semite". Such a joke.

                  As soon as the label is applied people's mind's automatically shut down and dismiss what you're saying. I see where you're coming from with your statistics, it is no secret that people with Jewish names are common in the top 1 percent of earners in our country and are overrepresented. Be that as it may, when you start focusing on that you sound like a whiny jealous you-know-what and you alienate the Jewish people who are NOT in that income strata. There's simply no point in ranting and raving about it. What are you hoping to accomplish? Do you think you're going to get everyone here to hate Jews? Gimme a break.

                  Good for you, but this isn't the "anti religion" subverse. This is the pizzagate subverse and it has a specific and determined scope. Religious talk in itself is not part of it.

                    No offense, was just a bit of humor. His song Imagine. I agree with you. To an extent.

                    Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace ...

                    False religions are indeed a problem, but they're not all false, still some good churches. Having said that, I obviously think Lennon's a bit misguided and/or uninformed ... he was pretty bitter about religion though that's for sure, from what he saw empirically.
