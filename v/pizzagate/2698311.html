<p><a href="http://morningstarboysranch.org">Morning Star Boys Ranch</a> is a group home for boys located in Spokane, Washington.</p>
<p>Many associate the term &quot;morning star&quot; with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Star">Lucifer</a>, although the term has also been used to represent Jesus in the Bible, Phosphorus in Greek mythology, and others. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.spokesman.com/topics/morning-star-boys-ranch/">19 sexual abuse lawsuits were filed against Morning Star Boys Ranch</a>, starting in 2005. Only one went to trial. The litigation lasted seven years and damaged <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2012/may/26/boys-ranch-reaches-deal/">Morning Star\'s reputation</a>. In 2012, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/settlement-reached-on-sex-abuse-cases-in-spokane-diocese/">the Seattle Times reported</a> that the number of unresolved claims against Morning Star Boys Ranch was up to more than two dozen, and that these claims were being settled outside of court. </p>
<p>The allegations named Father Joe Weitensteiner, who began his career with Morning Star Boys Ranch in 1960 as a counselor and was promoted to director in 1966 after becoming an ordained priest. These allegations were dismissed, and <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/apr/17/morning-star-boys-ranch-founder-reinstated-active-/">he was reinstated as a priest by the Diocese</a>. He now works for the <a href="https://www.morningstar-foundation.org">Morning Star Foundation</a>, whose major beneficiary is Morning Star Boys Ranch.</p>
<p>The allegations also named defrocked priest and pedophile Patrick O\'Donnell, along with several counselors. Instead of handing O\'Donnell over to law enforcement, after admitting to molesting &quot;dozens of teenagers boys over three decades&quot;, the Catholic church tried to treat his pedophilia. When that failed, he was defrocked but never faced any jail time for his crimes. As of 2008, he was &quot;free to roam&quot; and <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/jan/27/ex-priest-patrick-odonnell-free-roam/">living in La Conner, Washington</a>. </p>
<p>One particularly disturbing detail of some allegations is that some of the abuse occurred on overnight stays <em>outside</em> of Morning Star Boys Ranch:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2010/feb/05/former-ranch-director-denies-abuse-allegations/">Weitensteiner recalled taking Putnam and another boy named Jeff Benz on an overnight trip on his boat on Lake Coeur d\'Alene...</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/documents-detail-sex-abuse-allegations-at-boys-ranch/">In 1996, Morning Star failed to properly report a resident’s complaint that he had been fondled by a man during an <em>overnight stay</em> at the man’s home. The boy’s social worker and probation officer did not approve the visit, and Morning Star had not conducted a background check on the man.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_07_12/2005_07_31_Morlin_DisturbingConnections.htm">Morning Star officials...acknowledged recently that visitors were not required to register their names in ranch log books.</a> </p>
<p>Morning Star Boys Ranch is still currently in operation. </p>

<p><strong>Jim West</strong></p>
<p>In 2005, Spokane\'s then-mayor Jim West was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/05/AR2005050501868.html">accused of molesting two boys</a> while West was a Spokane sheriff\'s deputy and a boy scout leader. The other leader of West\'s troop, David Hahn, <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2005/may/07/west-faces-new-allegations/">committed suicide in 1981 after being told to reisign or risk facing a criminal investigation</a>. </p>
<p>West was on the <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2005/may/07/west-faces-new-allegations/">board of directors for Morning Star Boys Ranch for 12 years</a>. He resigned in 2005, after the accusations of pedophilia were brought to light. <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_07_12/2005_07_31_Morlin_DisturbingConnections.htm">&quot;[David] Hahn\'s brother-in-law, Dick Walters, said he clearly remembers that Hahn and West checked out boys from Morning Star for recreational outings.&quot;</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Gonzaga University</strong></p>
<p>While I was working through this information, I began to notice a possible connection to <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu">Gonzaga University</a>, located in Spokane. It has its own startling set of child abuse/cover-up allegations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 1961, John Leary, a Catholic priest, became president of Gonzaga University. In 1969, Spokane police discovered that Leary had molested several young boys and at least one Gonzaga student. Instead of arresting/prosecuting him, <a href="https://inlander.com/spokane/1969-gonzaga-spokane-police-give-pedophile-priest-a-free-pass/Content?oid=2972235">they gave him a 24-hour window during which he was allowed to leave</a>. He moved to California, where he founded New College of California in San Francisco. Later, he moved back to Spokane, where he died.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gary Uhlenkott was a Jesuit priest and a professor of music at Gonzaga University when he was sentenced to six months in jail for downloading and viewing child pornography. <a href="https://www.kxly.com/news/former-gonzaga-priest-and-professor-sentenced-for-child-porn-possession/742632415">&quot;A United States Postal inspector determined that Uhlenkott repeatedly purchased child erotica and child pornography from the company\'s website. A review of his transactions showed Uhlenkott made 29 separate orders totaling $1,164.40 from the web site between 2008 and 2011. The billing address was Boone Ave. in Spokane and he had provided his Gonzaga email address.&quot;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Jesuit priest and teacher at Gonzaga Preparatory School (which is under the same Jesuit authority/umbrella as Gonzaga University), Michael Toulouse, molested multiple boys. The father of one of the boys brought a gun to Gonzaga University, where Toulouse lived, to confront him. However, he was talked down, and Toulouse was never prosecuted. Instead, <a href="https://seattlepi.com/local/article/Man-tried-to-confront-priest-with-gun-1215831.php">he was re-located to teach at Seattle University</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2013, Timothy Woodard, a maintenance worker at Gonzaga, <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/may/29/gu-worker-faces-child-rape-charges/">was charged with seven felonies, including first-degree rape and first-degree child molestation</a>. Some of the events were said to have taken place on Gonzaga\'s campus. Woodard <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2013/06/gonzaga_maintenance_worker_fac.html">committed suicide</a> before he was able to face charges. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The pedophiles involved in the Morning Star Boys Ranch allegations all attended Gonzaga:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jim West, former Spokane mayor, <a href="http://www.historylink.org/File/10956">graduated from Gonzaga</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe Weitensteiner <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news13/2006_04_27_Finley_FatherWeitensteiner_Joseph_Weitensteiner_3.htm">attended Gonzaga Preparatory School and later took night classes at Gonzaga University</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patrick O\'Donnell <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/jan/27/ex-priest-patrick-odonnell-free-roam/">attended both Gonzaga Preparatory School and Gonzaga University</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also noticed that many high-ranking people involved in law enforcement and politics in Spokane have attended either Gonzaga Preparatory School or Gonzaga University:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spokane\'s current mayor, David Condon, <a href="https://my.spokanecity.org/mayor/about/">graduated from Gonzaga Preparatory School</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spokane\'s police chief, Craig Meidl, <a href="http://www.khq.com/story/32589443/mayor-condon-stays-within-spd-and-chooses-craig-meidl-as-new-police-chief">holds a master\'s degree from Gonzaga</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All twelve of the Spokane County Superior Court judges attended Gonzaga in some capacity <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Annette_S._Plese">1 - Annette S. Plese</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1594/Department-2">2 - James M. Triplet</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1595/Department-3">3 - Raymond F. Clary - served as advisory director at Morning Star Boys Ranch from 1994 to 2007</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1596/Department-4">4 - Julie M. McKay</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1598/Department-5">5 - Michael P. Price</a> <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/jul/29/vote-judge-tony-hazel/">6 - Tony Hazel</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1600/Department-7">7 - Maryann C. Moreno</a> <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1998/mar/03/longtime-attorney-will-seek-judgeship/">8 - Harold D. Clarke III</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1602/Department-9">9 - John O. Cooney</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1603/Department-10">10 - Michelle &quot;Shelley&quot; D. Szambelan - currently serves on Gonzaga Preparatory School\'s board of directors</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1604/Department-11">11 - Timothy B. Fennessy - currently serves on Gonzaga Law School\'s board of directors</a> <a href="https://www.spokanecounty.org/1605/Department-12">12 - Ellen Kalama Clark</a> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, Gonzaga is local and considered one of the top law schools in the area, so it makes sense for at least some of these people to attend. But all of them? I\'m not so sure. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To conclude, there are a number examples of sexual abuse in Spokane, many of which have overlapping connections, such as Morning Star Boys Ranch and Gonzaga Preparatory School/University. Is there something more here, or are these just a series of coincidences?</p>',

            Morning Star's reputation
           </a>
           . In 2012,
           <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/settlement-reached-on-sex-abuse-cases-in-spokane-diocese/">
            the Seattle Times reported
           </a>
           that the number of unresolved claims against Morning Star Boys Ranch was up to more than two dozen, and that these claims were being settled outside of court.

          <p>
           The allegations also named defrocked priest and pedophile Patrick O'Donnell, along with several counselors.

             One Jesuit priest and teacher at Gonzaga Preparatory School (which is under the same Jesuit authority/umbrella as Gonzaga University), Michael Toulouse, molested multiple boys. The father of one of the boys brought a gun to Gonzaga University, where Toulouse lived, to confront him. However, he was talked down, and Toulouse was never prosecuted. Instead,

           To be fair, Gonzaga is local and considered one of the top law schools in the area, so it makes sense for at least some of these people to attend. But all of them? I'm not so sure.

           To conclude, there are a number examples of sexual abuse in Spokane, many of which have overlapping connections, such as Morning Star Boys Ranch and Gonzaga Preparatory School/University. Is there something more here, or are these just a series of coincidences?

                Dude, don't be a bitch. All I'm saying is you've already got multiple posts going about them. No need to follow them around everywhere, especially on posts that have nothing to do with that. Harassing users with shit unrelated to the OP is what shills and fags do. If you want to be treated like an adult, act like one.

                 It might be what I start doing to people that attack my mods until they either provide evidence, or apologize.  These "users" that suspiciously hop on the bandwagon to attack the mod team

                  with absolutely no justification
                 </em>
                 don't really deserve to be able to continue to operate unimpeded here.  Their carefully-made accounts should be marred by their misdeeds - the spectre of those misdeeds showing everyone that they appear to have an ulterior motive for being here.

                 What's great is that with a comment, I can link you directly to those misdeeds.  The way I see it, this is absolutely PG-related.

             Dear Friends ~
            </p>
            <p>
             The 18th Annual Caring for Kids Luncheon to benefit St. Anne’s Children and Family Center and Morning Star Boys’ Ranch (held September 25th) was nothing short of fantastic thanks to all those who planned, sponsored, attended, and donated! Yes, it takes a community, a village, a team, a family…to pull off a wonderful event that supports these programs that in turn, support the well-being of children who need it most.
            </p>
            <p>
             Special thanks to co-chairs
             <strong>
              Tina Condon
             </strong>
             and Staci Clary,
             <strong>
              Archbishop Blase Cupich
             </strong>
             for his remarks and blessing over the event, and Nada Stockton for her keynote address on the importance of support networks that are integral to raising healthy, happy children.
            </p>
            <p>
             And of course, thank you to our sponsors ~ Avista, Bank of America, American On-Site Services, Barr-Tech, Garco Construction, Heylman-Martin Architects, Technical Resource Consultants, Catholic Charities Foundation, and Morning Star Foundation.

            Cupich served as the bishop of the Diocese of Spokane, Washington from 2010 to 2014:

            In 2016, church traditionalists were alarmed when the pope named him to serve with disgraced Cardinal Donald Wuerl in Washington, DC, where they played key roles in choosing future U.S. bishops:

             Just saw your mention of Condon.  Were you thinking of Gary Condon the one that they were investigating for the murder of Chandra Levy?  I think they are still trying to stick that case on someone to take the rap for Condon.

            Holy Shit Q gave the submarine that fired off the missile attack on Hawaii and the sub that launched the missile attack on AF1.

            Ok follow me, because it’s a little confusing. 
On November 14th, an Argentinian submarine ARA San Juan disappeared along with 44 crew members as it was being “chased by a British helicopter” before it went missing.
            <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/666845/Argentina-submarine-missing-ARA-San-Juan-mystery-Falkland-Islands-South-Atlantic/amp">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s said, the last known communication was November 15th, which was an explosion (or possible hull implosion) was picked up by listening devices on November 15.
but on the 14th, it was being chased. 
Early articles in Argentina claimed the submarine reported a leaking snorkel, which started a fire in the battery compartment late on November 14, and that an explosion (or possible hull implosion) was picked up by listening devices on November 15.

            If you know your history, you know that the UK and Argentina had a war over the Faukland islands and the UK won.

            So, a submarine capable of firing a nuclear missile. Is lost. In case your wondering how a nuclear missile is fire out of a torpedo tube here’s a good explaination.
            <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-submerged-submarine-fire-a-cruise-missile">
             https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-submerged-submarine-fire-a-cruise-missile
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Its about 8,000 miles from the Faukland Islands to Honolulu
           </p>
           <p>
            The ARA San Juan travels about 8 knots an hour for 12.000 miles
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distanceresult.html?p1=630&amp;p2=103">
             https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distanceresult.html?p1=630&amp;p2=103
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            it takes less than one month to travel from Faukland Islands to Honolulu.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also takes about one month to travel from Faukland Islands to Puget Sound WA.
            <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distanceresult.html?p1=630&amp;p2=234">
             https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distanceresult.html?p1=630&amp;p2=234
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            From Puget Sound to Honolulu its only about 2700 miles.
            <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distanceresult.html?p1=103&amp;p2=234">
             https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distanceresult.html?p1=103&amp;p2=234
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            now this gives the Cabal plenty of time to go directly to Hawaii or Puget Sound first and get refueled and nuclearized.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because, its 61 days from the helicopter chasing the Sub, to the event at Hawaii.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, that number 61? It’s the same amount of days from the firing of the missile in Puget Sound to the stolen Q400 air plane.
           </p>
           <p>

How do you prevent the public release of incriminating acts that would forever strip their power away?
How do you BIND the hands of POTUS?
Two-Pronged SITU.

Think missile(s) accidentally fired.
Against WHO?
Relationships are VERY IMPORTANT.
The SHARING of INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT.

           <p>
            The firing of the missile on June 12th was not supposed to happen that’s two a two prong situation that was not supposed to between Hawaiian Alarms and the Puget sound missile fire launch.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, its 61 days between November 14th and Jan 13th. 
Then 61 days between June 12 to August 31, 2018

            The sub was stolen from Argentina, the crew was killed and/or held prisoners and used to start a nuclear war with NK. When the sub was destroyed, they had to use tehir nuclear powered sub hidden in Puget Sound where its hard to pin point to try and fire on AF1 after NK talks to once again try and start a war. The writing is on the wall.

            UpVoat!  You have done a phenomenal job on this horrid story.  We did research on this before but I can't seem to find it in the Search.  Thanks for bringing it to light again.  I have a feeling there are some elites in the area involved here.  Possibly allowing them to abuse these boys.  This is a horrible and degrading link here This is what they did to those boys
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_07_12/2005_08_25_AP_BoysRanch.htm">
             https://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_07_12/2005_08_25_AP_BoysRanch.htm

           <p>
            The lawsuit filed in Spokane County Superior Court on Wednesday contended that in one incident, two counselors forced several boys to pose for photographs with flowers protruding from their rectums.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lawsuit, the latest in a string of abuse allegations against the ranch, said those photographs were circulated among the staff and residents at Morning Star, and were kept in the desk of the Rev. Joseph Weitensteiner, the ranch's revered director.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It was a joke to them," the former resident, identified in court documents as W.K., said in a July interview with The Spokesman-Review newspaper.
           </p>
           <p>
            Timothy Kosnoff, a Seattle attorney representing the two men, could see no purpose to the photos.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Why does a middle-aged priest keep photos in his desk of boys with flowers sticking out of their ass?" Kosnoff wondered.
           </p>
           <p>
            W.K., whose parents were deaf and mute, arrived at Morning Star at age 9 because his parents were unable to care for him. He was the youngest boy at the ranch, he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the court document, at age 12, W.K. and several other boys were sick and confined to their beds. Counselor William Condon and another counselor entered the room with a handful of irises and a jar of Vaseline, the documents said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "They told us to drop our drawers and lay down on the bed and spread open, greased our butt and stuck the flower in us, and stuck them straight up," W.K. said in an interview. "And then they said the first boy that the first flower that falls over gets hacked (spanked). That's what happened."
           </p>
           <p>
            Condon died last month, but in an interview this spring denied he ever sexually abused a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember researching this place before but can't find it in the Search.  I remember a boy committing suicide that went there.  Can't find.

              I can't remember his name but some came out to speak in his defense.  I think some of the threads where under posts about CPS  because there are so many homes that they send foster children to.  Morning Star just happened to be one of many.  But they have been in business for years receiving huge bundles of cash from our govt.  Burns me up.    Yes, this Condon could be related.

              There is no doubt some kind of network up there, same as all the other states

              The Catholic Church system needs to burn to the ground
             </p>
             <p>
              One would think the people of that faith would be the one with the matches
             </p>
             <p>
              they forget its not so much their faith that is in questioned but those they have put in charge
             </p>
             <p>
              I personally question all organize religions, but understand why people need something to believe in
             </p>
             <p>
              The Catholic Church, what it has become, needs to come down
             </p>
             <p>
              question is, Is worth rebuilding

             <p>
              What religious groups steal children?

              Mennonites have been on my radar for awhile now

               At a time when we know that all faiths are lying and most are caught up in the abuse of children, I agree.  It's not just the RCC but they play a huge part in it. We do not know who to trust.  It's really sad.

                   I am sorry but I just could not finish it.  I had to stop twice, and thought I was going to barf.   They are serious about this.  We must not think this is a joke.  Teaching Tolerance is a program offered by SPLC.  Think about that for a while. This must be spread.  You should do a post on it.  This is Normalization of the worst kind. They are against using the words Victim and Survivor because it implies children die from sex.  I am taking this seriously.  What usually happens is people think this is a joke and will go nowhere but by the time they realize it is for real, it will be too late.  Just like the Trans program and now we have them turning little kids into trannies and transvestites and  we have that boy whose parents approve of him being a Drag Queen.  This is how we got to where we are today.  Ignoring it.
