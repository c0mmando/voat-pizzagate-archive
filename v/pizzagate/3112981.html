<p>here is Hollywood connecte even more to pizzagate I\'m going to tell you exactly what\'s happening with this pay to play, college cheating scheme. The whole thing from the beginning seemed fishy to me. Not only does it not make sense, but....there\'s more to the underlying story. These elites were not paying to get their kids into Ivy league Universities. These elite universities and celebrates and coaches, were running a human trafficking ring. They don\'t need to pay big bucks to get their kids into Ivy league schools...they\'re already elite, they have an open invitation. Remember the scandal with Penn State\'s football team? Sandusky.....was, and many others were abusing underage, under privilege kids. And everyone knew and did nothing or were involved. Well, these Ivy league schools are involved in child trafficking. The elites were paying for kids. And using the admission into schools, as a front. What you also have to understand.....is these indictments on money laundering.....are the easiest way to take down child predictors. It\'s much, much harder to trace the trafficking, and much harder to prove. But money laundering....is a much easier and more fail proof way, of taking them down. Plus, it breaks it to the public, much easier. You\'ve got elite schools (pedo havens), you got Hwood (pedo haven), you\'ve got elite sport\'s coaches (pedos).... Remember, pedos run in rings. If a pedo is running an Ivy league school, you better believe, they\'re bringing on staff and coaches, that have the same preferences. 💥💥💥💥💥💥 &quot;Actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were among more than four dozen people charged in a nationwide college admissions cheating scandal that involved wealthy individuals purportedly paying up to $6.5 million to place their children into elite universities, say court records released Tuesday.&quot; This doesn\'t even make sense^^^^ It makes no sense, that they would be paying over 6 million dollars, to get their kids into an Ivy league school. What were they really paying for? Kids. 💥Yale- runs a program of underprivileged children and youth. 💥Georgetown- runs programs for underprivileged children and youth. 💥Stanford- runs programs for underprivileged youth. 💥University of Southern California- 💥UCLA- runs programs for underprivileged youth. 💥University of Texas- runs programs for underprivileged youth. So....... What we\'ve just seen busted up, was a massive child trafficking ring. Moochie Obahma\'s private tennis couch was another one arrested. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-massimo-giannulli.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-massimo-giannulli.html</a> ttps://www.thisisinsider.com/college-admissions-cheating-scandal-full-list-people-charged-2019-3 Parents Gregory Abbott: the founder and chairman of the International Dispensing Corporation, a food-packaging and research company.

<p>nother crosspost
Wooooo! I\'m going to tell you how this went down with the college scandal. Remember when George Pell was charged with sexual abuse, in June of 2017? Remember Q pointed out he was singing like a bird. What was Pell\'s role? He managed the money of the Catholic Church. Pell ratted out all the donors involved in child trafficking. Then who was the next big arrest and scandal to break? NXIVM? Who was arrested? Alison Mack, for human trafficking in April 20, 2018(not even a year later). Remember Q mentioned she was singing like a bird. Hwood💥 Then what was the next big scandal to break? The College scandal (March, 2019, not even a year from Alison Mack\'s arrest). Which was a front for child trafficking. Well, I\'m more then cetain this is all connected. Now, back to the Catholic Church and Pell and how it connects. What was Lori Loughlin\'s daughter doing the day she was charged? She was on a yacht, in Fiji. Who\'s yacht was she on? Rick Caruso, board of trustees for USC. Well guess what Rick Caruso has? The Caruso Catholic Center and Parish on the USC campus, which he made a 9 million dollar donation to. Now.... remember where Lori\'s daughter was? She was on Caruso\'s yacht in Fiji. Guess what Fiji is jammed packed with? Catholic church\'s. The church\'s are all clustered on the edge of the Island. What might the significance be? Ports. What have ports been used for? Moving trafficking victims. Rick Caruso....has big time ties to the Catholic Church and Hwood, because the two have been working to traffick kids.
