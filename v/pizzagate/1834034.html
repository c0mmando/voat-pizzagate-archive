            Here's the amazing part many of you won't believe but it's all true - the Pentagon now has the power to trigger earthquakes artificially anywhere in the world with the press of a button it's done through the HAARP network and it works perfectly. They can cause man-made quakes if they want to destroy a place then go in and grab hundreds of kids and Dick Cheney's Halliburton and other companies get the rebuilding contracts to make a lot of money. Many earthquakes in 3rd world countries are man-made.

            This is a link to a report of USAID blocking visas for witnesses to come to the US. Included are a string of emails with names, dates, etc. in which Paul Kendrick accuses government officials of blocking and interfering with an investigation into one Michael Geilenfeld, Director of St. Joseph Family of Homes in Port Au Prince, Haiti. Originally brought up in 2011 the last email by Paul Kendrick is 2/5/14

            In my humble, simple view I've always thought of God dwelling in a highest heaven.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeremiah 23:24 says "Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? Saith the LORD."
"Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD?"
           </p>
           <p>
            God also dwells in each of his followers.
1 Corinthians 3:16
"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
           </p>
           <p>
            Satan roams the earth.
1Peter 5:8
"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour."

            That's the million dollar question. I'm not ruling it out. He's been talking about this for four months. We'll see what happens June 10.

            I know. I can't even imagine. These poor babies didn't ask to be here. Yet, they are brought into this world, so innocent and defendant on others to even survive. To think that a person could take these children, that have already gone thru so much, would then abuse them for their own sick needs, is beyond my comprehension.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you imagine being a child and taken from all you had ever known, being scared from whatever hell made them end up in an orphanage in the first place, to then be taken by new people and have no choice but to totally dependent on these new adults? Then, to be tortured, raped, sacrificed, etc..?
           </p>
           <p>
            What a waste of life. Every baby is a miracle, no matter where they are born. A person that could hurt, torture or kill a child has no soul. I hope they burn in hell for eternity. It breaks my heart.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think so different now. No matter how much my day may suck, I honestly now think of these children, as well as the ones living in these war torn countries, and realize how lucky I really am. So many are born into horrible circumstances and never even had a chance. It makes my trials so trivial.

            Yeah, he's mysterious. We'll see. He never came back and answered my question (about Trump) ... he usually does ... I think he knows I'm one of the people here that doubt him.

            I being forced into seeing a psych and therapist because of pizzagate, and everything else, just seeing that the mainstream reality is a total lie. 911 was an inside job, sandy hook was fake, cia did the boston bombings, etc...

             It is extremely important to be careful with what you say around certain peoplevel. Some people are never going to accept this as real even with irrefutable proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             No, we're not crazy but, we have to be smart about protecting ourselves from the system we're fighting.

            I am also trying to give up being so obsessed with all of this and just live my life.
I will continue to do what I can to try and open other eyes to these things.
I've seen where some are rededicating their lives because they now see Satan is real.
And if he is real so is God...that is a good thing.
God IS in control.

            a well versed well educated person said something "people do not want to know"    they will listen for a short while then tune you out.  there mind cant get their
head around the fact this evil exists and exists right next door.   Guilt comes----they looked just like us------I didn't know-----I would have done-----etc etc
then the shut down.   the earth is inherrentaly evil We are given free choice when we are born.   Look what we choose.

            Oh I believe there are millions of good people!
There is tons of good in this world!
I just didn't know how much darkness was here...now I definitely do know as much as I care to...what I have a hard time with is that innocent children are living through it.
I think God is tearing the cloak of secrecy off of the people involved. The devil always does things in the dark.
God says there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed...for some reason now is the time.
End of the ages?

            I've posted before that our family cardiologist had all this dropped on him at a conference in France. I remember kind of "pooh-poohing" what he told us.....then, the Weiner laptop hit the fan and everything changed for me.  Maybe things won't get completely sorted out, but, we have the Internet now, and we will never stop trying to stop this evilness preying on these poor kids.

            That's the redpilling process.  Just when I think I am 100%, I realize I am only about 50%.  Everyday is a wake up.  Everyday is a learning experience and a lesson in coping.  It's also a lesson in keeping the brainpan wired tight.

            This all connects to MIT (see Aaron Swartz), Knights of Pythias, the Pilgrims Society, DNC and RNC, secret societies, the mafia, corrupt nonprofits and foundations, John McCain, Ashton Kutcher, the Catholic church, Satanic groups, United Nations, and Racine, Wisconsin. They know something very big is about to be exposed, and some of those involved are paying off local media and law enforcement to silence and target the victims and witnesses that know the truth. More is being developed now. Stay tuned, and help put the spotlight on Racine. It begins June 10.

            One day they are going to think you are brilliant when this comes out because you had it all figured long before.  Yes, these kids think someone is saving them and their hell is just beginning. Add on they can't speak the language to tell anyone what is going on and they don't even know where they are because they were probably drugged as they were transported to the US or wherever highest bidder lives.

             Great article.
To think of all the money that was given to help these people who have never had anything...that someone who has everything would think so little of them as to take their help!!!
God help those people because I fear for their souls!
Poor people can die and go to their rest in heaven...but there is no rest for the wicked.
Now or for all eternity!

                 Is that the problem?
That we the public are complaining but not actually doing anything like calling officials, writing letters?
Seems like maybe we should make a concerted effort to do these things all at the same time as to make it look like a more serious effort.
Something needs to be done or else we are wasting our time and emotions thinking about these atrocities everyday.

            Judicial Watch is an honorable watch dog organization focusing on the right issues and always in need of donations if you have money to spare. They can accomplish things we can't but that doesn't mean we can't help, we can by digging up pertinent information that dovetails with their efforts. Let's bring these awful people to justice.

             Same here . I do not trust anything on T.V ( childrens shows ) and all I do is have nightmares that someone is trying to take my grand daughter and daughter. What they are doing to these innocent children haunt me every day so it blows my mind that people can do this and not feel anything . I pray we all get a turn at them in a public square just like it used to be.

              I'm currently paddling the same boat. I think patience is vital and I realised that some people are just not interested in facing these kinds of truths so I stop wasting my time with those kinds of people.

             You are not alone...I feel exactly the same way.
My life will never be the same.
I think that all of this was supposed to come fully out at this time...this era.
It is darkness being uncovered.
Thank Goodness I know Jesus Christ and believe that He can get us through anything coming before us.
It's important to put our trust in Him and Him alone!

             I am deeply saddened by how many people I've tried to "red pill" about this that just don't care. Most won't even look at the evidence and still call it bullshit.

             I admit to having had my struggles with the massive cognitive shift I've experienced since learning what I/we now know.  And the thing is, I'd researched; I'd read for years, and I really thought I had a good handle as to how things worked,  bad as they were, but what has dawned since October has truly rocked my world.

             Where's the justice though, guys?  I'm still praying and cheering y'all on, you awesome citizen researchers who do this work.  I'm pulling for you and wish like mad that those with the evidence would speak the fuck up and SHUT IT DOWN.   Stay strong.  I'm trying to stay patient.  I just wish Assange would reveal the DNC-and-Podesta leaker, and that the white hats in the NYPD &amp; FBI would spill it.  Sigh.

               .  I do understand that those with evidence get killed.  I worry that the statements about upcoming dates are dangerous.   I wish those with evidence would just put it out there, or upload it here or on the chans.  I think of how scary it would be to have evidence, but I also think holding onto it keeps the person holding it in danger.  I'm too tired to think, but I bet you get it.  I just want to say thanks for giving your perspective.
