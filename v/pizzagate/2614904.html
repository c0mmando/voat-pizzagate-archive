in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise victory on Tuesday, Wenig sent out a company-wide note — which Recode got its hands on — to eBay’s global staff on Wednesday,</p>
<p>In it, Wenig acknowledged the “sense of fear and disruption caused by the impact that changing economic trends, including technology innovation, are having on people’s lives.” ... blah, blah, globalism, blah, globalism, blah, ....</p>

<p>It looks like Wenig is tied to **Rothchild\'s **Reuters -

            "Are these cultists devil worshippers?" If you look a the bah'i symbol it is a 9 point star. Count the axis points and you get 18. 6+6+6. Probably nothing, right?

            A quick search on Instagram led to me discovering a slime culture of many children, girls are all I saw, uploading video clips of their hands massaging, poking, prodding lumps of this slime stuff. I'd no idea such a thing existed but I then found a video of Jimmy Kimmel promoting it.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmiOvwB99jo">
             Jimmy Kimmel makes slime with kids
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Just made me wonder if this was one of those child friendly video cultures that is actually for the pleasure of paedophiles. Videos of childrens hands massaging and kneading gungy slime.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the kids. Why is the girl dressed like an old woman and looking rather tired? The boy seems happy enough if not a bit nervous. I don't know. That clips could easily be put down to the kids being nervous about being on camera. It's strange how different they both look compared to Dearman who looks very clean cut, smart and professional. They look like they're wearing hand me downs or charity shop stuff.

            If you go to the website at the end it states made by GAB, I believe that is either short for the boy's name Gabriel or short for Girl And Boy. The last name if it has some hidden meaning at all Williams comes from the German language   will= desire helm = protection. But I do believe it is rather strange he chose GAB

            Here is one of the rooms from Hampstead school. I find it strangely ceremonial looking, and the 2 bright red chairs where I assume those in authority sit, give me pause. The circular artwork with the Sun in the middle around which the entire room is centered makes it seem like a place for ceremonies. I also found this

            which I find odd as well. I think they are hiding in plain site the very rooms used for satanic activites after dark, or when the curtains are drawn. The first image (above) looks to be in the basement, which is where the children said it happened...

              Oh isn't that interesting? No pictures of the school itself, just close ups of children with beautiful lighting? Wow. And the last one shows a book with the one eye looking back at us (occult symbolism)... Very pedophile-y choices for photographs. Why feature children when it's supposed to be about the school? Everyone knows what rich white kids look like, this does nothing to inform interested parents looking for a new school. At least the other website shows what they offer the children (library, etc), and don't waste webspace showing meaningless photos pf the children themselves. That's very telling.

            stated, he has that "Damian" look; he has taken on the characteristics of his dad, a perpetrator, rather than the innocence he once had. The little girl is pretty much paralyzed, she shows almost no signs of life except for one forced "smile" which was more of a grimace. This children have been murdered while they are alive, by their father and the rest of the satanists as well as by the State and the authorities in charge of the world, who handed them BACK to the evil ones. They must feel as if the entire world except for their mother and step father are OK with what is happening to them. No wonder they have morphed into what we see today. God HELP THEM and us all, in Jesus Christ.

             Its almost guaranteed that the boy will go on to become an abuser himself - its how they perpetrate their dynasties Multi-Generational Abuse creating fractured Narcissistic Personalities. At this stage the boy probably looks up to and wishes to emulate his father.

            I screen shoted  it but I'm a tech-tard and don't know how to post it here using my phone. If someone wants to check and see if that's what pops up or let me know how to share a screen shot I'd appreciate it.

             Wonderful Slime is a product of the son Gabriel "Gab". Even though its the father behind the keyboard responding to orders, I assume.

              I can see that for Gab, but that doesn't explain the use of " Williams".

            This is my theory.. (keeping Elsa gate in mind ) regarding the " wonderfulslime " business venture . Look at the audience " Elsagate " type videos attracts. There are tons of YouTube videos of kids playing with this slime . Think of what we know about the spying capabilities. Not saying that RD himself is making these videos , but  supplying the main ingredient " slime " to the children at large , will make him bigger bucks than the youtubers promoting it . I have so much more to say on this theory , but have no time right now to write it all out . Hoping someone might see what I'm talking about here and look into it further .

             There's a lot to your theory based on what came out about him.  Many people said his earlier websites were a front for porn (including children) and streaming stuff.

               No wonder they look dazed and confused.  They had a bitter pill to swallow - no one came to help them even after their story was plastered all over.  Even the BBC stepped in to shut it down.

                  Same here. This was one of the first cases I read up on several years ago after I became aware of what's really going on in the world and it was so disturbing. It still is and pisses me off that this POS can just parade around like this with his victims on display!

             what does he consider "love", and what EXACTLY are the ingredients in this stuff? I feel sure he has put some liquids from his after school activities in it. This is probably a mass initiation into the dark arts, even touching this stuff is probably a part of a ceremony and none of the children not their parents have any idea. What's fucked up is that even if someone tested the stuff and found bodily fluids, Bobby would get off scott free just as he did in the past, just as all pedophiles do in London.

             I looked them up on eBay and Etsy. Not too much info on either, but on their Etsy the reviews are not good. I sell on Etsy and know that most people there tend to give 5 star reviews. It's really rare to see a shop with a cumulative 4 star review or less but this shop has 3.5. Many of the reviews talk about the slime being really watery or going bad shortly after purchase. Hmmmmm. Wonder what's in that stuff!
            </p>
            <p>
             In one review the shop owner responds and has a very arrogant, flippant attitude! That's is NOT typical for Etsy or a seller who actually cares about their shop.

             Yeah dont mind the double entendre...Their symbolism will be their downfall. 18 cant come soon enough for those kids. I just hope that they havent been totally enducted into the cult by then.

            Great work! Everyone is worried about these kids... and you’ve brought much needed attention back to some very important elements. I find the hard drives especially interesting!
           </p>
           <p>
            I once had a friend from a Baha’i family. Not that it’s and indicator, but he stole a bunch of stuff from me.
           </p>
           <p>
            The religion seems like a cherry picking of all of the easier elements of other religions, mixed with the cultish  admiration of a leader. It’s a surprisingly influential religion. If I’m not mistaken, their recruitment is directed towards high-IQ types and Mensa members

             I live a couple of towns over from the Baha’i “temple” here in Chicago and I’m friends with a family that’s Baha’i. If it’s any consolation, both parents went to Northwestern and be if their sons got accepted when he was around 15. Super smart, all of them. What else do you know about Baha’i bc I know nothing. I asked them about it years ago and the mom said that sometimes they’ll sing songs around the house but that’s it bc there doesn’t seem to be a traditional weekly congregation. Ohhh, and I remember hearing her say that they encourage race mixing; that particular family was mixed, as well.

              From what I remember... there is a prophet of the religion whose philosophy gives respect to Christianity, Islam and Zoroastrianism. It’s an international religion. That is as much as I got when I asked. They did NO PROSELETYZIND and made no attempt to sell me on their religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              One could take that as respect, but I respectfully asked more than once, basically leaving the door open to be introduced.
             </p>
             <p>
              That alone struck me as weird. The family was high IQ, or at least believed they were. They totally had an effete, elitist aire.
             </p>
             <p>
              I liken it to a less virulent strain of Scientology... basically just a thin veneer of unimportant, unbeliever dogma that covers a nepotism system based on recruiting SPECIFIC individuals, not the masses; the way that Scientology recruits drones (whom are the spies and operators of the black mail and secret-keeping apparatus) or ‘queen bees’ (which are the artists that have a narcissistic need for the ego boosting “services” of Scientology).
             </p>
             <p>
              I need to do more research into the TYPES of people involved with Baha’ito confirm or refute my suspicions, though. I’m mostly speculating based on limited experience and light reading.

             Dearman is a crappy nobody wannabe actor. I think those internet marketing charlatans wouldn't dare put their own face on their websites and will most likely pay for a model/actor to pose for them.

               Notice the record label is called “Father/Daughter” records? The logo is that of a man holding a little girl’s hand. The music video above has a scene with Hulk Hogan in a ballerina costume with a little girl holding his hand. A harmless early 90’s movie scene on its own, but, takes on a new meaning in context.

               This thread directly connects no less than 4(four) main characters in the Pizzagate Saga, the main player, James Alefantis ( his business Comet Ping Pong and Pizza named in direct correlation through email with Hillary Clinton and John Podesta by the international whistleblowing organization WikiLeaks ), Donald Sussman ( by far the single largest donor to the Clinton campaign ) Hillary Clinton and of course our other star attraction John Podesta.

               Emily Tisch Sussman is the daughter of Donald Sussman ( himself one of the largest single donors to Hillary Clinton's 2017 Presidential run ). She also happened to be Campaign Director for Podesta's Center for American Progress, making the direct and probably most intimate connection to John Podesta.
              </p>
              <p>
               That's not all, a Washington Life Magazine Editorial guest list of February 11, 2014 lists Emily Tisch Sussman and James Alefantis together as 2014's geniuses, visionaries, crusaders, and innovators shaping Washington.

                Before his life became consumed by the madness of Pizzagate, restaurateur James Alefantis, the man behind Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing and Camping, took a trip to Cuba last year with the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art.
               </strong>
               He invited Nathan to join him, even though they would have different aims. Alefantis had art business to attend to. Nathan was there to visit “like all the Jews in Havana,” Alefantis jokes. “We met all these young Jewish Cubans.”
              </p>
              <p>
               But they also met Paolo Titolo, husband of Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban president Raúl Castro and director of the country’s National Center for Sex Education. Titolo is an Italian photographer known for shooting members of Cuba’s transgender communities. Titolo took Nathan and Alefantis to a shantytown where they stopped at a shack with a corrugated metal roof, home to a local drag queen who makes dresses for young girls to wear to their quinceañera celebrations. Titolo told the Americans they would have to be discreet at the home.

            Excellent thread! Those poor kids look soulless and the boy even appears to have that "Damian" look in the way he smiles. The conclusion of Wenig's letter is veiled in Satanism as he mentions how the holidays are upon us... who we serve.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I'm left feeling angry and defeated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here we are, essentially in a vacuum, raising the awareness of those who already know about this, but go onto them streets of your home town and ask anyone you meet if they're familiar with the Hampstead children and they'll likely say 'no', then where to begin to get them from the police videos of thebkids all the way to the eBay awards to wake them up, but then what? Hope they are able to tell someone else? Most likely, they'll start researching, find Voat, and research more, and essentially get stuck in this vacuum like we all are seeing and understanding the vastness of it all and not knowing what to do with it all and how to combat the beast.
           </p>
           <p>
            eBay, Eli Lilly, and these other companies are huge and powerful, and it's going to take more than a boycott to bring them down. Even if we do push them out of business, they grow a new head (as Hydras do) and we have to research all over again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Palantir's eTrolls are basically useless and only exist to irritate and remind us (here in the vacuum) what we'll be faced with should we go into the real world and start talking about this vast Satanic system.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on and on about this, and yes, researching and discussing this amongst ourselves and waiting for Q to reveal and waiting for the hammer to drop is starting to feel like grains of sand in my shoe.
           </p>
           <p>
            We really can't sit behind our screens contributing to and absorbing info from a vacuum forever and expect to get somewhere. God helps those who help themselves, so what can and should we do?
           </p>
           <p>
            Q shirts and decals can raise awareness, but Q (on the surface) only discusses politics and strategy, and many people will not be able to hang for long because they don't understand, can't keep up, or (let's be honest) will be turned off by the Trump train.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the main thing we need to make people aware of is the rise of Satanism. It's the only common denominator, and anyone with half a brain can see how it's being normalized in the mainstream, even if you are washing down your Eli Lilly psych meds with Stargags coffee.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry for the diatribe. I'm just scratching at the walls of this matrix vacuum because I'm getting frustrated seeing more evil unfold and knowing we aren't even putting a dent in it.

             Research can lead to arrests.  Unfortunately we do it for free, but that's OK. Have you ever wondered about the effect that Frank Parlato might have had on NXIUM? Maybe, just maybe, someone from law enforcement stumbled across him and started reading.

              No, I never considered that, and I suppose it's possible. I always remember that the greatest rewards are for things we do for free.

               Some of the last words of my grandfather, was, " the greatest feeling you can have, is truly helping someone else." He died shortly after of alzhiemers.

             Thank you for the comment.  I appreciate it.  As you say, sitting behind screens one wonders what impact this type of research has.  But I do it because the more I research and read other posts here, the quicker I can form links between various pieces of the puzzle.  Do not despair.  One day we'll have a story or link that cannot be ignored by the masses.

              Thanks for understanding, and I do appreciate your research as well as many others' submissions. I also do it to feel like that one puzzle piece will be found and everyone will finally get it, but the frustration is setting in after 2 years of PG research in addition to 15 years of traveling the darkest rabbit holes, I walk around outside disappointed at the miniscule level of awareness. Maybe they're awake, but just pretending to be asleep out of fear of ridicule? Damn, I hope so. Then, there's all of Soros' SJW zombies who are brainwashed into permanent states of zombie-hood or simply just care about money, or both.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just need to figure out a way to combine posting here and trying to wake up people in the real world. Please note that violence isn't part of anything I'm talking about and above all, I hope even the sleepy timers know that the evil ones such as Soros and Waters are the ones who are behind any violence.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm speaking about local businesses who have the pedo triangle and other nefarious symbols on products and literature in their store, but nowhere on their website, so keyboard researchers have no way to demonstrate this connection without being outside searching, too, and reporting back. And vice versa.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for all your hard work and don't stop. Discouraging you is not what I came in here for. Your thread and the info within just caused a spark, and that's a compliment.

                 I really don't know. I haven't had much luck in convincing people. I have been astounded and dismayed at how disinterested people are, and how thoroughly thought-controlled the average person is. It often seems like the average person is in a kind of hypnotic state and they will only accept suggestions from their "masters", i.e. mainstream sources. Any other information is attacked or quickly dismissed and forgotten. I know not everyone is like this but this seems to be the norm, and it is quite discouraging.

            Sandy Hook Unity: The Plot Thickens

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             John Woodall, former Harvard professor, and his wife, Margo, are head of the Unity Chapel, which has its headquarters in Haifi, Israeli.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Woodall’s shared the following words of comfort at an Interfaith Memorial Service in Newtown, which was nationally televised on CNN. The passage was originally offered by ‘Abdul-Baha, the son of the founder of the Baha’i Faith, to a mother who was grieving for her deceased son. The Woodalls’ read the letter in its entirety
            </p>
            <p>
             Margo then took the microphone and finished their sacred letter:
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              “That beloved child addresseth thee from the hidden world: ‘O thou kind Mother [and father], thank divine Providence that I have been freed from a small and gloomy cage and, like the birds of the meadows, have soared to the divine world—a world which is spacious, illumined, and ever gay [joyous] and jubilant.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Therefore, lament not, O Mother and Father, and be not grieved; I am not of the lost, nor have I been obliterated and destroyed.  I have shaken off the mortal form and have raised my banner in this spiritual world.  Following this separation is everlasting companionship.  Thou shalt find me in the heaven of the Lord, immersed in an ocean of light.”
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              This is the creation of a death culture
             </strong>
             ; Boston strong, Sandy Hook strong; “Sandy Hook chooses love.”  Born of a global agenda that can be the most giving, it brought in millions of dollars because of the hoaxed tragedy.
            </p>
            <p>
             From its headquarters in Haifa, Israel and under the authority of the Universal House of Justice, Baha’i is overseen country-to-country by National and Local Spiritual Assemblies. The religion is an international phenomenon, with its spiritual founder prophesying a global socio-political transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
             What is arguably of concern is that Woodall proceeds under the cover of mental health professional while espousing an ardent globalist ideology that runs counter to the traditional political beliefs and religious faiths that, for better or worse, are espoused by a majority of the world’s population.
            </p>
            <p>
             What a scam this is.  How convenient that the supposed murder occurred where the leaders of the Baha’i faith’s Unity Project were located.  They got the exposure on national television on the Interfaith Prayer Service.  The rabbi sang his prayer, the Muslim had their prayer too, and the “Christians” were mostly represented by two woman pastors and foreigners.  What a disgrace!

             In January, Buffett, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, and JP Morgan’s Dimon announced they were creating a joint venture to cut healthcare costs and improve services. Although many view this as likely to have an impact on the broader U.S. healthcare market, it appears to be focused primarily on solving the three companies’ internal healthcare issues. Together they employ 840,000 to 1.2 million people worldwide. Last week they announced Atul Gawande as chief executive officer of the joint venture. Gawande practices general and endocrine surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and is a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School. He is also founding executive director of Ariadne Labs, a health systems innovation center.

              Fucking George Soros. I can't wait for him to kick the bucket. I often think that his and the Queen mum's deaths are going to be our best opportunities to inject the most truth into societies and have people pay attention. After all, nobody would listen while Savile was alive, but when he died, it was no holds barred and Thatcher's image will always be tarnished as we see the world waking up to this particular level of evil, but not yet seeing the grand scale. Maybe this is the key. Every time a creature dies, the spell is broken a bit more and people are able to see what they couldn't before.

            On the Baha'i Faith and the Lucis Trust:
            <a href="http://www.green-agenda.com/spiritualunitednations.html">
             The Spiritual United Nations
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Lucis Trust was originally founded in the 1920s by the renowned occultist Alice Bailey under the name of the Lucifer Publishing Company. The Trust is recognised by the United Nations as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) and is represented at regular briefing sessions at the UN. The Lucis Trust is also a member of the UN Economic and Social Council. Interestingly Robert Muller served as the Secretary of this Council for many years. Until recently the Lucis Trust was located at 666 United Nations Plaza and lists its official sponsors as the UN, Greenpeace and Amnesty International.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alice Bailey claimed to be able to channel a spirit guide called ‘the Tibetan Master Djwhal Khul.’ Robert Muller was a disciple of Bailey and in his World Core Curriculum it is explicitly stated that "the underlying philosophy upon which the Robert Muller School is based will be found in the teaching set forth in the books of Alice Bailey by the Tibetan teacher Djwhal Khul." Bailey taught that the ‘World Spiritual Teacher’ would soon appear and lead the world into the Age of Aquarius and it was the task of her disciples to “prepare the way for His imminent appearance.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Bailey claimed that this reappearance required intense meditation and the reciting of the Great Invocation. Former UN Sec-Gen Dag Hammarskjold was also a follower of Bailey and he was responsible for the construction of the Meditation Room within the UN building. Meditation meetings have been held regularly within this room for decades and they open with a recital of Bailey’s Great Invocation..
            </p>
            <p>
             The Baha’i organisation claims to have a close working relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO) and with the United Nations Environment Programme. It is also involved in joint activities with UNIFEM and UNICEF as well as many other religious, environmental and social programs within the UN. The Baha’i spiritual beliefs mirror almost exactly those described by the Lucis Trust and AAC described above. They too are waiting for the imminent arrival of an ‘Enlightened Being’ who will lead humanity into a ‘new world order’

             <p>
              Along with the institutionalized secular faith of carbon-centric environmentalism that figures centrally in the Bahá’ís’ undertakings, the Unity Project’s understated transnationalism is likewise making inroads at public schools and in communities throughout the world. As in his previous endeavors, the Sandy Hook tragedy has provided the backdrop for Woodall’s evangelizing that seeks to realign the traumatized individual and group toward certain ideals and norms. What is arguably of concern is that Woodall proceeds under the cover of mental health professional while espousing an ardent globalist ideology that runs counter to the traditional political beliefs and religious faiths that, for better or worse, are espoused by a majority of the world’s population.

            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In stark contrast to his libertarian posturing, Omidyar is connected at the hip to the very same intelligence nexus that he publicly condemns, particularly Booz Allen Hamilton, the NSA security contractor that employed Snowden in Hawaii and Japan . One of the major investment partners with Omidyar Network, Salvadore ”Sal” Gambianco, sits on the board of directors of Booz Allen Hamilton Holdings.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Booz Allen and Omidyar Network
             </strong>
             are corporate members of an NSA-linked consortium called Innocentive, a consultancy focused on crowdsourcing (read: data-mining of public-opinion polls, consumer surveys and Internet-based personal data). Other member-companies include
             <strong>
              In-Q-Tel, a developer of communications monitoring software spawned with millions in start-up capital from the CIA.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also represented is the In-Q-Tel spin-off
             <strong>
              Palantir
             </strong>
             , which creates fictive personas or virtual trolls to mount smear campaigns to debunk or threaten journalists and critical websites online and in letters to editors. Palantir, which refers to itself as an “electronic warfare” firm, has created a meta-data collection program similar to the NSA’s PRISM. Michael Leiter, former head of the National Counter-Terrorism Center , is the executive counsel to Palantir.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Another corporate partner in Innocentive is Lilly Ventures, the investment arm of Eli Lilly pharmaceuticals, which produced LSD for the MK-ULTRA mind-control program
             </strong>
             and is now the lead partner in the Obama-sponsored national brain-mapping project. Full-spectrum surveillance is advancing from wireless electronics into the bio-network of the human synapses, the last frontier for total mind control. The objective of pre-crime pre-cognition, that is, the detection of criminal tendencies, for instance, resistance to authority, and intervention before the crime can happen. Using drugs to impair the mental capabilities of individuals is, of course, only a part of a wider and larger program of social engineering to ensure domination of the globalist elites over any increasingly dependant and expendable population.
            </p>
            <p>
             As birds of the feather that flock together, Booz Allen Hamilton and Omidyar Network are a pair of ducks in the NSA-CIA pond. These intelligence links are so thinly guised, it beggars belief that an attorney like Greenwald who practiced law in New York City could be so oblivious to the conflict of interest in regard to the security of his client Edward Snowden.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Who is Pierre Omidyar?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Since the existing grude match between the clowns of American and British intelligence cannot continue indefinitely, a new character must be introduced onto the circus to relieve the tension. As a person with close ties with the spy masters of U.S. , Britain , France and Abu Dhabi , Pierre Omidyar arrives with a shocking suddenness as ringmaster for the Greenwald acrobatics.
