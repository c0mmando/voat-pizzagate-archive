            The initial report was paid for by FusionGPS on behalf ofJeb!   It was later picked up by nevertrump and shopped around to democrats .  Ultimately, John McCain was given a copy by a UK diplomat, and being such a concerned patriot (sarcasm). .. he took it to the FBI who said..yeah, ok and then when they read it said
..."as if!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Multiple MSM organization had already seen it but they waited until it would be most inconvenient...even though it was so outrageous that it was unbelievable, contained numerous geographical errors about Russia, and was badly...no, horribly written.
           </p>
           <p>
            Christopher Steele went into hiding, for fears of Russian retaliation, when was outed by UK official. He has not reappeared in public but Russia was not amused.  Some indicate that recent russian ambassador "heart attack" was related to this.

             thanks for the insight, is there any truth it the pee  part being a 4chan or 8chan info prank? or am I confusing stories? I have to say, when I first heard of the dossier I thought it was hilarious, I guess even Jeb had enough sense to give it a pass.  "but Russia was not amused" is funny too. Are they all on drugs or is this the best they can come up with? wtf is wrong with people, are they really that stupid or do they think that we are?

              Same story, just that 4chan tried to take credit for it because someone claimed to have made some fan-fiction that was similar to parts of the dossier accusations. Who knows if it's true or not, probably not considering it's 4chan.

            So we have WaPo (CIA mouthpiece) trying to sow division between the FBI and Trump. There are some traitors and some plants in the FBI but the CIA is the one doing the majority of the terrible things like human trafficking, drug running, gun running and organ trafficking. This is a psy-op paid for by CIA to make people take their eye off the ball. Beware!!! We're getting close and we shouldn't give up. They're going to divide us by taking out critical infrastructure like the twitter, fb and reddit. I believe this is already starting with the internet blackout. They're going to be scrubbing the internet so we need to archive as much as possible. I'm keeping my info on a portable HD in case anything crashes or gets deleted. I'd advise all the researchers to do the same.

            ... but it will be interesting to deconstruct the Clinton-Steele-FBI connection as well, and the press connections. There's got to be something about a candidate (out of office) using agency favors to win a presidential campaign ... No?

             Nice point.  I think they are presenting the argument that Steele claims to be MI 6 so Clinton hiring him wouldn't technically be agency favors, but I don't believe that either.
