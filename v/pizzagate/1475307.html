<p>Ok, so this &quot;Ecstatic Living&quot; institute, pushes for sex-ed in very young children, and they hold workshops ^in above mentioned resorts^. These resorts are also into new-age stuff, tantric sex, etc., which in and of itself is nothing to think anything of (I used to be kind of new-agey, but after looking into all this stuff I feel like I am questioning every belief I have ever had). But....what other kind of stuff goes on at these places?</p>
<p>&quot;TO BEAT, OR NOT TO BEAT?&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS3pZlAssOwYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS3pZlAssOwYouTube</a></p>
<p>All these centers are part of what is called the &quot;International Holistic Centers Gathering&quot; (side note: Jay Ogilvy [Ogilvie?] was either a founder or on the Board at Esalen [sorry, my notes are scribbled. Remind me to look that up]. He isn\'t there anymore. He is now the founding dean at PRESIDIO [remember Michael Aquino, Franklin Coverup, MK-Ultra stuff?] University. It could just be a coincidence but who knows. Just thought I\'d share) </p>
<p>Anyways... There is another new-age commune that is also a part of the International Holistic Centers Gathering- it is called the Findhorn Foundation/Community. This is important to acknowledge because of two people, specifically: Stacy Millichamp and Lady Diana Whitmore. They are both connected not ONLY to the Findhorn Foundation, but they are also on the Board of the Psychosynthesis and Education Trust.</p>
<p>What is psychosynthesis? </p>
<p>&quot;Spiritual goals of &quot;self-realization&quot; and the &quot;interindividual psychosynthesis&quot; – of \'social integration...the harmonious integration of the individual into ever larger groups up to the &quot;one humanity&quot;\'[2] – were central to Assagioli\'s theory.[1] Psychosynthesis was not intended to be a school of thought or an exclusive method[3] but many conferences and publications had it as a central theme and centres were formed in Italy and the United States in the 1960s.&quot; &quot;Assagioli was not the first to use the term &quot;psychosynthesis&quot;. The earliest was by James Jackson Putnam, who used it as the name of his electroconvulsive therapy. The term was also used by C. G. Jung and A. R. Orage, who were both far closer to Assagioli\'s thinking than Putnam. C. G. Jung had written, comparing his goals to those of Sigmund Freud, &quot;If there is a \'psychoanalysis\' there must also be a \'psychosynthesis which creates future events according to the same laws\'.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosynthesis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosynthesis</a></p>
<p>Not only are they both part of the Findhorn Foundation, both on the Board  of the Psychosynthesis and Education Trust, they are both Board members of Teens and Toddlers. Lady Diana Whitmore is the CEO, and Stacey Millichamp is a co-founder. Peter Hein is also on the Board of T&amp;T, as well as on the Board of the Psychosynthesis and Education Trust. </p>
<p>Teens and Toddlers had a program called “Project Caress”, that later got shut down. It promoted children to touch/caress the elderly and vice versa- for therapeutic reasons.</p>
<p>ARK funds Teens and Toddlers, part of ‘Children Our Ultimate Investment\'. COUI was founded by Laura Huxley- wife of Aldous Huxley- wife of the T@v!st0ck Institute operative, LSD supplier and eugenicist : </p>
<p>Aldous Huxley, with some very interesting close family members; Huxley was the author of ‘A Brave New World’, amongst many other books. In a letter written to George Orwell in 1949 21 October; he congratulating Orwell on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is.&quot; In his letter to Orwell, he predicted that &quot;Within the next generation I believe that the world\'s leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&quot;</p>
<p>Pretty much all the senior staff at Teens and Toddlers are heavily involved in Psychosynthesis.</p>
<p>ARK’s website provides details of ARK’s management team and trustees. It also provides details of ARK executives. As well as Arpad Busson, other Ark ‘trustees’ include multi-millionaire Paul Marshall, one half of the fund managers Marshall Wace.</p>
<p>Paul Marshall is the largest individual contributor in the country to the funds of the Liberal Democats. Mr Marshall is a director of six companies, three belonging to the ARK empire and one being the Liberal Democrat Business Forum. </p>
<p>Also, a Wikileaks doc that could potentially connect Arpad Busson- the founder/chairman of ARK- to MARC DUTROUX

<p>I actually made a post 9 days ago which goes into more detail about ARK/Arpad Busson/Dutroux/Clinton Foundation. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1451709">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1451709</a></p>
<p>Also, Jennifer Moses is a Trustee of ARK 
<a href="http://arkonline.org/about-us/who-we-are">http://arkonline.org/about-us/who-we-are</a></p>
<p>She is also the fucking Managing Director of Goldman Sachs

<p>AND CHECK THIS OUT </p>
<p>Now the connections even link all of this shit to Robert Maxwell- Ghislaine Maxwell’s dad. Ghislaine Maxwell was who FOUND AND HIRED UNDERAGE GIRLS FOR KNOWN PEDO JEFFREY EPSTEIN</p>

            "King Solomon Academy" is an ARK school.  Anytime a group refers to King Solomon outside Christian bible suspect it's an occult group.  King Solomon's later writings teach how to summon demons &amp; innocent blood is used for the rituals.  Rituals done by the highest levels of occultic groups actually use his writings.

            Found this.  Why did Australian/UN partnership donate so much to The Clinton's?  Is the UN funneling money to them?  This org is at top of list of donors dollar wise.

            Here's another having to do with Findhorn, Harbin, Esalen, and some other linked orgs they mention, and seven survivor stories.

            One of the orgs, HAI Global, seems a little disturbing, some of the core values they display... almost like it teaches people (children?) that there is nothing off limits in 'relationships'.   Just lots of things that seem OFF, with a main page that looks like it's all innocent, only teaching how to love and have relationships.
            <br/>
            One FB commentor wrote this, below, note the reference to oxytocin......
Susan Cockrell
December 3 at 2:30pm
“light stroking” ... "shuts down the stress response and helps produce both oxytocin and serotonin, two very calming neurotransmitters" "Oxytocin ... is also potent in all interactions involving human touch, including sex and simple, gentle stroking" "in response to touch, vasopressin. oxytocin, serotonin, beta-endorphin and other feel-good chemicals swirl together in a potent mixture not found in any other activity. "

            This is great stuff, espiCIAlly the links to Tavistock Institute, though I wish those were better defined than mere pronouncement.

            Definitely worth pursuing, except it's a deep side-investigation that may turn out to be it's own animal. But definitely connected, even if only via means of "behavioral modification techniques" and Freud.

            Jan Irvin of gnosticmedia.com has done a bunch of research in this area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's one of his articles for example: "How Darwin, Huxley, and the Esalen Institute launched the 2012 and psychedelic revolutions - and began one of the largest mind control operations in history"
            <a href="http://www.gnosticmedia.com/how-darwin-huxley-and-the-esalen-institute-launched-the-2012-and-psychedelic-revolutions-and-began-one-of-the-largest-mind-control-operations-in-history/">
             http://www.gnosticmedia.com/how-darwin-huxley-and-the-esalen-institute-launched-the-2012-and-psychedelic-revolutions-and-began-one-of-the-largest-mind-control-operations-in-history/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He has many more articles, videos and podcasts showing his research in this area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, he uses "The Brain" software, which is free database software that allows you to create a footnoted "mind map" infographic, showing the connections between people. He his created a map of connections related to his research that he makes available for anyone to download.
            <a href="http://www.gnosticmedia.com/links/brain/">
             http://www.gnosticmedia.com/links/brain/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW it would be a good idea for some of us to download "The Brain" software and create a mind map of the Clinton Foundation connections. It's one hell of a spider's web.

            About ten years ago I caught my ex and her cousins playing with the quija board. I stood in the doorway and warned them it's not a good idea to play with fire. They responded by saying, we are just curious to know if it's true. Sure enough, weeks later things began to happen at home that were unexplainable. And it kept getting worse and worse, to the point we talked about getting someone to come bless the house. A few days later my ex told me she had spoken to one of her friends who was a "white" witch about the ordeal and she told her what to do. The following week I happen to meet this "friend" of hers at a family gathering. I asked her so how did you get to become a "White" witch. Her response blew me away. She said, oh don't worry I come from a long line of witches that date back to Luisiana when it was still a French colony. She also said, you see in our family we have this family "friend" who is introduced to all females at the age of 9. As matter of fact, my daughter is turning 9 soon and am wondering if she will freak out. So who is this family friend I asked. Is a familiar spirit that has been with our family all along. 
...So why am I sharing this story with you right?
You see, humanity is just like that little girl about to be shown something that will shatter her understanding of reality. That little girl, just like all society is faced with two choices, allow curiosity to take the best of you and find out what those familiar spirits have to say or refuse to be manipulated by doctrines of demons. 
You see my friend, freewill comes with great responsibility. Either way you chose there will be consequences. 
Furthermore, all humanity as a whole is guilty of all that has occurred in the dark because we have allowed it to happen. 
- and not just in the dark either but by allowing evil to be packaged, perfumed, and advertised as "progress", "choice", "liberty" and all those great sounding terms that distract us from their true nature. 
I'll give you an example. "Women have the right to chose what they want to do with their bodies. The government needs to stay out of the it".
Choice = Sanctioning of child sacrifice 
Since 1973 we have allowed millions and millions of innocent babies to be sacrificed to Moloch. We are all guilty but not many people are willing to accept it.
If we honestly want true meaningful change for the sake of all children, we must start with ourselves.

            We should really investigate finders cult and their connection to pizzagate. They are some sort of a cult that is involved in child trafficking/sacrifice, documents prove its existence, They operate through underground tunnels and is within miles of connecticut ave. Finders cult and its whereabouts possible connections that could be uncovered could be the bombshell to blow this wide open. Just speculation could be another diversion.

            I just found this video today.  A talk by Christopher Story who puts alot of this stuff into historical and political context.  A must watch:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1a4wYwq3D8">
             Lenin's Satanic World Revolution
            </a>
            .  He mentions the Epsalen Centre around the 33:33 mark. Spooky.

            go look at the interview by Larry Nichols who worked for Bill and Hillary in their early years in Arkansas and come back and tell me they are not literally witches. 
Bill Clinton in his own biography admitted to practicing voodoo and Hillary conjuring spirits of the dead. 
What you have before you friend is literally a fight against Satanic witches and warlocks. Refusing to see it does not negate the reality that it is what they are.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, in an interview in the early 90's conducted by art bell, the Vatican's chief exorcist Malachi Martin estated that Bill Clinton was one of very few people he had come across during his career that was perfectly possessed. That he would not touch him with a ten foot pole or go near him. Research Father Malachi Martin and you will find that he outed the Vatican's Satanic pedophiles over a decade before it hit mainstream. In his book WindSwept House he describes in detail how Satanic Vatican and U.S officials conducted a Black Mass and sacrificed a little girl to enthrone Lucifer at the Vatican.

            I have a friend in India who actually travels form place to place interseading for people involved with Satanism/luciferianism/ and yes Eastern Mysticism. I've been kicked out of most churches here in the U.S and called crazy by friends just like yours.  It is to be expected. It is a natural human reaction by them to stay in their comfort zone. I would suggest you watch a documentary by Gen6 productions called The UnHoly See.
If you email me privately I can get it to you for free. Otherwise it cost about $17 to purchase online. I highly recommend it because it ties up the history that was hidden to us by the elites.

            It was a real program, their were Congressional hearings about it. I'm not sure why you wouldn't believe it happened. I can understand skepticism that it's still going on but I'm not sure why it wouldn't be.

            <strong>
             Roberto Assagioli
            </strong>
            ; he was a disciple of
            <strong>
             Alice Bailey,
            </strong>
            who founded the

             Lucis Trust

            as  "Lucifer Publishing company" and is rumored to have been the foundational basis of the UN.

             "Spiritual goals of "self-realization" and the "interindividual psychosynthesis" – of 'social integration...the harmonious integration of the individual into ever larger groups up to the "one humanity"'[2] – were central to Assagioli's theory.[1] Psychosynthesis was not intended to be a school of thought or an exclusive method[3] but many conferences and publications had it as a central theme and centres were formed in Italy and the United States in the 1960s." "Assagioli was not the first to use the term "psychosynthesis". The earliest was by James Jackson Putnam, who used it as the name of his electroconvulsive therapy. The term was also used by C. G. Jung and A. R. Orage, who were both far closer to Assagioli's thinking than Putnam. C. G. Jung had written, comparing his goals to those of Sigmund Freud, "If there is a 'psychoanalysis' there must also be a 'psychosynthesis which creates future events according to the same laws'."

            Two remarks: the pathways to the Divine are there for everyone to use and to explore. Tantric sex is one of those pathways, and is therefore not necessarily an "evil" thing. If you try to make sense of any occult stuff, please keep in mind that none of it is, in its very essence, evil, because, ultimately, all things are an expression of the One.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evil creeps in the moment people in the know start perverting these pathways for their own nefarious goal: to act like a God-of-the-Earth and seek to dominate and control others. This is what ALL black magick is about: to seek what is holy and powerful and Divine and pure, and then rape it, destroy it, mock it, smear it, defile it, warp and twist and distort it, in such a manner that it because your personal powertool. So, be careful not to throw aside tantric practice as evil, because it is Divine in origin.
            <strong>
             The fact that these human monsters seek to defile it so vehemently, is the ultimate proof that sexuality is one of the most powerful tools the Divine has to offer
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Second:
            <strong>
             here's a little secret
            </strong>
            They have an Achilles heel. It stands in New York, is an effigy of Isis, is erected on an 11-pointed star, carries a torch, and should have been called the Statue of Enslavement. Get your Google Earth, and start drawing lines starting from the torch, spanning the globe, and find out where all the points and valleys of the 11-point star are aiming for. For starters, one of them points straight at the Black Stone in Mecca. The Statue of Liberty is their Dark Magickal Seal. Almost like the One Ring that binds all their evil intentions.

and back up everything

            It gets worse, i mean it gets less credible sounding the more you dig because the truth is so frigging unbelievable, i mean seriously.. once you know.. its hard to just live a normal life and enjoy things when you know how frigging crazy things are.
When im looking at the big picture here, the real big one, we have high strangeness to consider also. It cant be overlooked. This shit is satanic, its ritualistic. Its cold, heartless and psychotic kinds of people here. Sociopaths and con artists all working together.
Well lets consider a few quick facts.
Psychopaths approx 1 to 2% of population, thats 1 in every 50 people in some areas, 1 in 100 in other places (statistically)
Psychopaths are cold, calculating, habitual, cruel, and they are power hungry, they always seek positions of power and influence, they thrive on competition and are ruthless in their dealings, but also can pretend to care, but have no emplathy or conscience.
And seem to enjoy sacrificing people, and the info is clear that its young kids of a certain geno type or bloodtype they are looking for
We have a well organised machine here with established trafficking routes using private and often cia jets to move kids (its in the books and testimony of Cathy OBrien) ,
They scare the victims to increase adrenaline in the blood and then drink that blood.
This is the kind of "people" we are dealing with. But on another level they are kind of hosts for something else. A being that operates in the shadows, known By Shamans and the Castaneda books as the fliers,
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest reading Transformation of America by Cathy OBrien.
Its all in there.. who they are, what they are..
Bush himself tells Cathy directly who they are and what they are up to.. this is the big picture. And its unbelivable.
Cathy thinks that the strange things she sees are some kind of hollagram but my conclusion is that Bush is showing her the truth.

This path is of the exploration of the dark recesses of the Mind and Spirit, transforming the self into a vessel of Divinity, the Daemonic itself. Found in ADAMU are foundation rituals and theory of Luciferian Sex Magick, the Forbidden Art of transforming consciousness and body into a Temple of the Adversarial Spirit, being Samael and Lilith, to initiate the self and become a part of the divine by awakening the symbol of Cain, the First Satanist. ADAMU outlines practice which defines the how the Luciferian Sex Magick path is a successful method of initiation which only strengthens and awakens consciousness. Vampiric (spiritual) Sex Magick and ancient Buddhism/Bon Po, including workings and descriptions of Kali and her various mythological guises. Adamu features numerous discipline-building exercises which will set the focus for serious initiatory practice."

            EDIT 3 (cont.)- having issues with editing post again, sorry 
One of Ark’s trustee' Bernard Sabrier also funded a charity called "Children Action"
This charity has another partner- Bernard Kouchner-  said to be involved in pedophile and organ trafficking rings.
Here is a quote from the following link in relation to the trafficking of children by Zoe's ARK (of which Kouchner is involved)-
           </p>
           <p>
            Deby made angry accusations that the children were being kidnapped for pedophile rings and organ transplants. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bernard Kouchner, set up a crisis team headed by Rama Yade, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Human Rights. She flew to Darfur and stated, "We know absolutely nothing about how these children were gathered. We don’t know their origins, their nationality or the reality of their family situation. Taking them like this is in my view illegal and irresponsible.” Sarkozy somewhat belatedly backed her up, and French police searched the Zoe’s Ark offices and Eric Breteau’s home. French supporters of Zoe’s Ark said they had been in the region for two months, and claimed that both Kouchner and Yade knew about and agreed with the operation.
Another company involved with Kouchner's Zoe's ARK- French Four Wheeled Drive Federation- joined with Zoe's ARK in '04, presumably to supply the vehicles required to transport the children after the Tsunami on Boxing Day. Their aim was to raise funds in France and work with the United Nations to create a village in Banda Aceh as a refugee for some of the 50k orphans thought to have been made so after the Tsunami.
The leaders were Guillaume Catala, one of the founders of ARK, and Eric Breteau, a former Fireman and president of the Four Wheeled Federation.
Bernard Kouchner was also involved in the human organ market.

            Edit 4:  a random comment from a site I just found: 
re: Bowlby and attachment theory and how they studied it, and why. It’s been said they were looking, overall, at ways of breaking down the family and breaking down the parent-child bond. By “they” I mean social engineers, inspired by Freudian ideas, and Tavistock types like John Rawling Rees
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawlings_Rees">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawlings_Rees
            </a>
            who inspired Brock Chisholm and other globalists with the means at their disposal to put these theories into practice via the UN, and psychiatry. In Canada since 1945, there have been serial scandals and mass tragedies involving orphans ( e.g.Duplessis orphans), native residential school children, and Child Protection Services (Children’s Aid) taking children from “broken” or disadvantaged homes and making them wards of the state subject to all kinds of experimentation, drugging and sexual abuse. Literally hundreds of thousands of children have been victimized in Canada alone — to what purpose? Is there an agenda to create a “new” type of human who grows up detached from parents and emotionally traumatized, making them more susceptible to social control and manipulation by media and all the other bombardments. And is that the ultimate goal of all this “social work” and endless “caring and compassion” — ? I forget where I’m going with this but it’s like the air we breathe and the soup we all swim in.

             Your reference to Canada and the serial scandals also rings true in the US.   However it wasn't prevalent in 1945 in the US but did get it's start with Walter Mondale with the enactment of CAPTA or what's better known as the Mondale Act.
             <a href="http://www.faithandreason.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mondale-Act-After-Forty-Years_-True.pdf">

             Years later in 1997 HRC penned the ASFA which the POTUS, her husband signed into law.  The Adoption &amp; Safe Families Act (ASFA) which is funded majorly through the FED- IV  (social security trust fund) not only subsidized the cost of foster care for each state but gave states bonuses worth multi millions of dollars if they increased the adoptions they completed if and only if they exceeded the prior year's adoption totals.   Children in the US are being removed from families without warrants, without any justification for the removals and most often the targeted families are those that live within the FPL guidelines and don't have the means to hire attorneys which can and do charge up to 150k.  CPS then exercises their control and begins their quest to break the child/parent bond while the child/children are in state's care, parents visits are cancelled, the children are told the parent mustn't love them any more because they don't show up and the mind games CPS plays are endless.   MSM will not touch these stories because parents have been told time and time again that their is a media blackout with publishing any CPS case involving child removals.   However just like pizzagate there has been a movement that started on social media about  three years ago and there are thousands upon thousands of families who've turned to FB to get the word out.   Often times these very parents are gagged by the judge with threat of incarceration if they publicly breathe a word about their child/children being unjustly removed.....rather kidnaped fits the description better.  There are some parents who go back into the shadows after the gag is imposed and others who choose to defy the unconstitutional court order and share it from the rooftops.  Yes, there is also medical experimentation done as well as suspected drug trials on some of these children who have documented medical complexities and the percentage of children in foster care receiving psychotropic meds currently stand at 40% of that population which currently stands at 415000.    I've been following the foster/adoption crisis for some time now so it's interesting that you connected it to globalists, the UN etc.   because I personally believe you have hit the nail on the head.

             On another note.  MK Ultra has been referred to several times in several threads but here's a short video with testimony from two MK Ultra victims. There's a good deal of debunking going around these days regarding MK Ultra being a conspiracy theory however their testimony is in front of a Presidential Advisory committee which gives them credence as well as MK Ultra being justified.

            Yes, MC is still ongoing. We have survivors in their 70's all the way down to a fourth generation coming forward in their teens and twenties (if they're lucky and their programming was flawed). Yes, the techniques are ever improving. You wouldn't believe the field tech they have now. The perps are invested in keeping the reality of MC hidden. Any honest effort is met with coordinated and merciless opposition, even if it's just an obscure blog. They have entire teams dedicated to interfering with subjects trying to get free through therapy. They are invested because MC has long been operational and subjects used to fill positions at the highest levels of government. Yeah, I get how that sounds. I say it so anyone tripping down this lane knows exactly what they're up against. Be wary of disinformation however, it has been promulgated since day one. You cannot trust the info coming out of the some of the high profile cases. They are high profile for a reason.

            Most of what is known is whispered among survivor and caregiver circles, as is isn't safe to go public. I myself paid a heavy price for speaking out. What helps is when more and more people are talking about it, it's much harder to beat down a determined crowd.

            2007 Extreme Abuse Surveys - Results (RA, MC, pedo rings). At a conference sponsored by the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) and with input from her co-researchers, Karriker (2008c), presented 10 key fndings from the Extreme Abuse Survey Series helpful to understanding RA/MC. RA/MC is a global phenomenon. More than 40 different countries were named. 170 participants did not give their countries of residence. Numbers of countries named for each survey: EAS 31, P-EAS 20, C-EAS 19 See the rest at the link.

            Heavily sourced primer (FMSF, DID, RA, MC). Growing reports of RA/MC and elite pedophilia rings were driven underground in the 1990's by two pseudo science based political campaigns, "false memory" and "satanic panic". The False Memory Syndrome Foundation was founded by parents accused by their adult children of sexual abuse, it was partially funded by the Office of Naval Intelligence, and on its board sat former MKULTRA subproject contractors and at least one admitted pedophile.

             wow. THANK YOU so much for all your links and info! i am somewhat skeptical of one of the more famous people that have come forward, claiming to have been programmed and used as a sex slave, etc... is there anything more you can hint at/say to be able to help myself and others distinguish between the people that are telling the truth and the ones that aren't? (aside from what you already said?)
            </p>

             I am mindblown by all of this. It feels like... i am literally watching my reality shatter before my very eyes. There is so much info, and it is so screwed up... I don't know what to do with this information anymore

              Research Carolyn Hamlett. She is another survivor like Cathy O'Brien, except Carolyn was one of the higher ups and was exposed to much more info than Cathy. Your mind may literally explode if you hear her testimony conducted by Dan Duval.

            "conditioning and narco-hypnosis"
           </p>
           <p>
            I was taken by DFACS (CPS) in the state of GA. Home of Sen. Nancy Schaefer. I was taken to an institution with bars on the windows. I was drugged and forced to stay awake and answer bizzare questions. I was made to watch violent videos and sitcoms. I remember them not letting me sleep and asking me things I didn't understand about All in the Family.
           </p>
           <p>
            They accused my father of raping me (never happened,) and once they discharged me into a foster family, they gave me a teddy bear.
           </p>
           <p>
            My parents won in court and got me back. My father left and anytime I reached out to him he'd say "I don't want any trouble." That's not the father I knew. He never hurt me. My memories before CPS are crystal clear.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've known many other GA victims. Same story. I've moved on, but Wikileaks has brought it all back. If I hadn't been through what I believe to be eugenics, I'd call pizzagate fake news.

            Let's recall that psychoanalysis was used to create the lie of the "Oedipus Complex" where Sigmund Freud cemented the outrageous belief that it is young children who are the sexual aggressors against adult males in their lives, from fathers, step-fathers, grandfathers, uncles -- to male friends of the family.
In this way, Freud betrayed his clients -- young patients both male and female -- who had confided in him their sexual abuse by male members of their families.
Studies also show us that MALES are our sexual abusers of children and that they are heterosexual males.
Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
In earlier times in Hawaii, homosexuals were held in honor and esteem for their care of orphaned children.
Nonetheless, the RCC has tried to blame homosexual priests for sexual abuse of children -- a lie.
In regard to creating split personalities -- i.e., MKULTRA/Project Monarch -- calls for torture and sexual abuse.
Some may not know that the new personalities can be programmed to do things that the individual, himself/herself, would not ordinarily do.  They can also live their lives without knowing what they are doing as they are unaware of their other personalities and their programing.  It also seems that about age 30, the mind begins to struggle to restore all memory.  It's been suggested that about this time the subject may be eliminated.  Children programmed in this way for MKULTRA have been used as homosexual prostitutes, drug runners, and for espionage/as spies.  It's seems also to be possible to create a photographic memory.  Former Director, Richard Helms, ordered MKULTRA-Monarch Program records destroyed.
Also remember our own government begins its life on this continent by genocide against the native peoples, enslavement of Africans here -- under Papal Edicts that call for their "enslavement or murder."
Recall also that in the war on the natives, their children were kidnapped, stolen from parents -- put into "church schools" run by both the Catholic and Mormon churches ... and abused in every way in those schools.  Their physical appearance was changed as they were forced into European-style clothing, barred from being able to speak in their own languages.  They were beaten, tortured, hung, sexually abused and murdered in those schools.
The Old Religions had no Satan -- he was an invention of organized patriarchal religions (Judaism, Islam, Roman Catholicism) which underpin elite patriarchy.  That's where Satanic beliefs, rituals and Satanic violence begins.
In other words, what's happening today in the US is not really anything new.  What's new is that it is becoming visible to many of us.

            There are a lot of details/info/connections that I have not posted yet. Is there a reason that you do not ask questions before you automatically assume "disinfo"? I know what you're up to, sillyhead.

            Yes. I am the epitome of what we call "sheeple". You couldn't be more correct. Anyways, I have a bunch of info I haven't put into this thread that I'm holding onto for the time being. It will come out. If I'm not the one to expose it, someone else will. More people than me have the info.

            since this is at the extreme end of the system's you're working to illuminate, I'm just gonna leave this here.

            Jack Parsons founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Operation Paperclip had, I believe already commenced. Jack Parsons was very close friends with Aleister Crowley and did two things that brought a terrible energy into this country.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the desert North of Los Angeles (China Lake area) Parsons and Crowley performed a witchcraft spell. They summoned (I believe...) Moloch. Shortly afterward, Parsons wrote a two-page book called "AntiChrist". If you read it, be warned...

            J.P.L and N.A.S.A. were populated with the most brilliant Nazi scientists/occultists. This is when the Black Projects really took off. Skunkworks, Pentagon, C.I.A. - Billions of dollars a year have been poured into them ever since.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your "scribbled" notes appear to refer mostly to "Social Engineering". But the real enchilada is what these monsters built. It actually frightens me a bit. An example (I haven't seen it debunked yet, so... not sure) Jesse Ventura did a piece on an underground network that ran an estimated 1,400 miles under Texas, all the way to the East coast. I wondered if a large portion of the flood of able-bodied Latin American males could have been diverted to this underground system and subject to mind-control/conditioning to be used as an army against the American people. That idea frightens me.
           </p>
           <p>
            But to the point of the post, Trillions of dollars have been diverted from the American treasury for Black Projects. Some are Social Engineering, some are Weapons/Hardware etc and some are well...

             Just remember that the entities contacted by parsons, Crowley, Sitchen et al 
are not what we think of as aliens. They are metaphysical beings from a dimension outside our own.

             2016 was interesting to me in that the 16th card is The Tower. What man could be more thoroughly associated with a tower than The Donald? lol

             Next year, 2017, would be associated with The Star by this "logic". Could get very interesting.

            I accidentally wound up at Harbin Hot Springs with a group of friends. Its a nudist place, which was fine but awkward. Got into Springs and noticed people getting it on .....immediately remembered there is no chlorine in a natural hot springs. Never put my face in the water. Got out, showered, dried off with a blowtorch. Yeah, good memories

            Threre was the astronaut that went crazy saying the planet needs to be warned, then I remember the FBI saying they had seen the devil himself during the email investigation, Buzz Aldren just tweeted "We are all in danger. It is evil itself" two days after being airlifted back under emergency circumstances from Antarctica,  There were also several pictures of Antarctica in the podesta emails.  What is in Antarctica that everyone is so secretly focused on at the south pole?  Would be a safe place for a biological or nuclear attack?

             It's an entrance to inner earth basically, it's some pretty fucked up shit. The elite make sure that it is completely hidden and unknown. There's no quick / easy way to explain it - but I suggest looking into it and reading about it. Obviously many people wouldn't believe it - but there's a lot of very strong evidence.

             It was in 1991 that Maxwell plunged from the deck of his £15million luxury yacht — a 180ft vessel named Lady Ghislaine after his daughter — and soon afterwards it was discovered he had stolen £440 million from the Mirror Group pension fund.
            </p>
            <p>
             [...]
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein helped Ghislaine forget her past. Through him, she began to build a respectability in New York that would have been impossible in London, where Maxwell’s crimes were less easily forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein was not, however, altogether straightforward. He may have been a firm fixture on the social scene but he had, to say the least, an opaque professional history — a little like Robert Maxwell. He is rumoured to have worked either for the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad, the CIA or even both.
            </p>
            <p>
             On one occasion, he arrived in London at the home of a British arms dealer bringing a "gift" — a New York police-issue pumpaction shotgun. "God knows how he got it into the country," said a friend.

             Thanks for the info- on my massive "tree diagram" or whatever the hell you call what i scribbled into my notes- I have a Robert Maxwell/Mossad connection. Do you know off the top of your head what year he died?

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Maxwell was presumed to have fallen overboard from the vessel which was cruising off the Canary Islands,[39][40] and his naked body was subsequently recovered from the Atlantic Ocean. The official ruling at a Madrid inquest held in December 1991 was death by a heart attack combined with accidental drowning, although three pathologists had been unable to agree on the cause of his death at the inquest; he had been found to have been suffering from serious heart and lung conditions. Murder was ruled out by the judge and, in effect, so was suicide. He was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

              However, upon further investigation, it doesn't seem quite so straight-forward. (surprise, surprise)

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               ...the British publishing tycoon apparently did not die of drowning but probably suffered a heart attack, even though the autopsy found no evidence of such an attack...
[...]
"We are saying that he probably died of ischemic heart disease," said Dr. Lopez, describing a condition in which not enough oxygen-rich blood reaches the heart. He said detailed studies performed in Madrid had found no proof of a heart attack. They had also produced no evidence of poison, alcohol or significant doses of medicines, he said.
[...]
"They can't prove he drowned; they can't prove he didn't drown. They can't prove a heart attack; they can't prove there wasn't a heart attack. So they are assuming. We would call this unascertained death."

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The ball is now in the family's court to prove that he died of accidental causes."
[...]
Dr. West's autopsy report found tearing and bleeding of the muscles in the back of Mr. Maxwell's left shoulder.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dr. West's report examined several possible explanations for the injury to the 290-pound man, including an accidental fall overboard. But, his report went on, "One sees this pattern of injury on occasions in individuals who kill themselves as a result of falling from high buildings. Whilst some will jump or let themselves topple over a balcony or out of a window, others will actually ease themselves over the edge and hold on for a time with one or both hands before letting go."
              </p>
              <p>
               Last year, Dr. West told Bernard Knight, president of the British Association in Forensic Medicine, that he believed that the muscles might have been torn when the rescue helicopter crew that found the body tried to winch it up from the sea.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Whilst the deceased did suffer from cardiac disease and we cannot exclude it as being a factor in his death, we are of the opinion that the most likely cause of death is drowning," Dr. West's report said.

               Her father named his luxury yacht, the Lady Ghislaine in her honor, and it was near the yacht in the Canary Islands in 1991 that his body was found floating in the sea. Though a verdict of death by accidental drowning was recorded, Maxwell has since stated that she believes her father was murdered, commenting in 1997 that "He did not commit suicide. That was just not consistent with his character. I think he was murdered."

             The original post I made was 9 days ago- I think I included it in ^ post. Also, I have heard a few people say that others have started connecting the dots also between these people/institutions but the posts keep getting slid/overlooked. I would like to include others' posts in here too...they are very important. If I copy and paste the other post's urls in my post, will they get any kind of notification? I would like to get all the people that have been looking into this specific avenue together somehow so we can get a better/broader understanding of all of this

            This is exactly what I've been researching. Amongst other things of course, and I completely agree with you. I don't think people understand the depth of this shit, not even here.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is precisely why
            <strong>
             every
            </strong>
            connection is important. I'm starting to think that this is something beyond comprehension, like everyone has been caught in a huge spider web. It feels like anything and everything could be a sham. This is something that's operating at
            <em>
             every
            </em>
            level.

             The problem I see is that people have been conditioned to believe empirical evidence as the sole method to prove things. The problem is our senses alone cannot explain most of these people's occult practices without sounding crazy. 
First of all Francis Bacon, the father of the empirical model was an occultist.
Secondly, there is no difference between science and the occult. One deals with the physical world while the other deals with the spiritual one.
That being said, in order for people to understand this crazy world we must be open to the idea that a spiritual world literally exists and that science is being used to rip open the veil which separates both creations. 
The sooner you accept this, the easier it will be for you to understand what is being done by the elites. 
They know other life forms exist outside of our physical world. All those ritual practices they perform are done to literally open portals to the spiritual world. 
And They are very close to opening a permanent portal that will allow spiritual life forms to be anchored to ours.
They want to use humanity as their anchor babies so they can have permanent access and complete rule over us. The huge hurdle those entities have is that humanity must accept them voluntarily. That's the reason why deception is their main form of pushing their agenda. However they have to do it incrementally or else people will rebel against them. Everything that is being done by elites is to condition us and receive them with open arms as the seviors of humanity. 
Research every renowned satanist/luciferian and you will find that all of them communicated with spiritual entities channeled through various forms. Their ultimate goal is to intertwine the physical and spiritual worlds. They will succeed too and most people will not be able to handle it. The craziness of PizzaGate is mearly a blurred foggy glimpse into the true reality of our existence. You have seen nothing yet folks.

              what i think too is really bizarre- is that i always am on some kind of ocd kick. right now its pizzagate/whateverthefuck this is. within the past three years i was super obsessed with quantum physics, nikola tesla, consciousness, and energy. But anyways- I pretty much did the same hardcore digging with those subjects as I have been with this pizzagate shit... and i will be damned if what you said is not true. If it weren't for all the past digging ive done on random (seemingly meaningless at the time) subjects- its like... i dk, its so unbelievable to me how all of it is coming together now. quantum physics and spirituality/consciousness go hand in hand- like what you were saying. if i had read what you wrote 4 years ago, I would have written you off as crazy lol. My question is... what are we supposed to do now?

               Build a world based on love. Expose the powerful, put them in mental hospitals if necessary for their psychopathy. Robots do all the mining and farming, humans hang out and play video games or whatever. As long is there is money and laws, there will be rich untouchable scumbags. No more money or laws based on punishment and enforcement. That's the only way we escape this global slave plantation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sex slavery is just another kind of slavery, but we're all slaves. We all have a boss who rules us for 40 hours a week, and police who rule us the rest of the time. And all those weapons and rules definitely aren't based on love....

               The best way to fight back against the illuminati is at the spiritual level. Remember that only 1/3 of angel fell so the vast majority of spiritual beings are on our side. However, fighting at the spiritual level is not for the weak of heart. You, your family, finances, will get attacked 100% by demons. And if you don't have your full armor on, you will get stumped. 
Second best method is a combination of both. Help by doing research and awakening people while praying for them. 
I tried the first method for almost a year and saw lots of victories and lots of defeats. Lots of spiritual and physical attacks. One person I was interceding for actually manifested a demon who told her she needed to stay away from me. And it can be disheartening if you allow the battle to become personal. 
Maybe you were hoping for a different answer but the reality is that this war is between good and evil. Spiritual weapons make the most damage but attract the most fire in return.

               To avoid the chaos you've got to track it back to it's roots and then work out a strategy for implementing a remedy.
The ARK stuff involves fundamentals like love and sex and their role in the natural world. There are two mainstream paradigms for dealing with these issues: common law and civil law. Common law is misrepesented as being what the judges tell you it is, but in fact it goes back to sovereignty and theism. Civil law is more suited to a zero-sum game, the world of predators and victims, but it's clothed in the language of acceptability, eg civilized, universal.

               Seriously. I mean let's say hypothetically that somehow ALL those responsible would be charged and prosecuted for ALL their crimes - can you imagine?...
              </p>
              <p>
               From the looks of things, it would be nearly all world leaders, the CEOs of some major companies, and many other powerful individuals in prison, leaving - to put it lightly - some major holes to fill in governments all over the world (all Western countries, the Middle East, Russia, Korea, Japan, etc etc etc)
              </p>
              <p>
               Then you would have the fact that all these organisations they were hiding behind - organisations for humanitarian aid, child protective services, mentoring, adoption, sexual health, etc - don't actually exist as legitimate organisations, and that means there are actually no services in place to deal with these issues. (This just occurred to me today and made me really sad)
              </p>
              <p>
               Then you would have to deal with the public's inevitable shock and indignation at finding out the twisted truth about those they should have been able to trust as leaders. This reaction would be HUGE and would quite likely cause revolutions, coups, vigilantism in those countries affected, and I mean, which countries wouldn't be affected?
              </p>
              <p>
               Would it be that crazy to think that it would lead to societal collapse on a global scale, and maybe World War III?
              </p>
              <p>
               Seriously the more I read about pizzagate, and the more believable it gets, the more I wish it weren't so fucking credible.

                What you describe is exactly what the Watchers want. They want total breakdown of society, complete chaos and WW3. This can be verified in the writings of Albert Pike. 
Then, after humanity is at the brink of possible extinction they will come out and implement The Plan. People will be so fed up with war that they will begg for peace. This is when their Ascended Master- The Most Illumined of All will appear and deceive all by flattery and deceit.

                Indeed. I think I interpreted Hillary's "Fake news is putting lives in danger" speech a little differently than most people. All you have to ask is, what governments do you think
                <em>
                 aren't
                </em>
                involved?
               </p>
               <p>
                It will take a mass awakening in order to put a stop to this. And it has to happen soon.

            I really think you are nailing it. You are on the right track. Mind control. They trade/sell some kids. Rape, murder EAT?? some others, but many end up being slaves for experimentation by the CIA. Who knows how many they have created or what the end goal is, but it is sick as fuck.

            Edit: And from what I understand- what I make of all of this- there seem to be maybe 3 different ... "groups" of people. All the mind-control shit that we've heard about- how it happened in the 60s- and how they stopped the program? No. It is still going... they have just realllly improved upon their methods. You want kids/other people for sex ? program them. You need someone to stage a false flag? Program them. They'll be more than happy to do it. Need a spy/patsy? If you split someone's mind they will pass a lie detector test, unless the person administering the test recognizes and knows how to specifically test someone with multiple personality disorder/DID. And then you have people like us- the regular people/the mass/the zombies- their tentacles are literally in everything- they also have control of not only the media, but chemical companies, the education system, pharmaceutical companies, etc- everything that is designed to dumb us down, not question anything, and "go with the flow". We are the "wage slaves"...the little worker bees, if you will. And of course, in the background of all this/behind the scenes, you have the few select Elites, that are working on evolving consciousness and pretty much.... i don't know. It gets too weird. I honestly don't know if I am understanding this correctly- but that's how I am interpreting what I've seen regarding this. I will add more stuff to my post on voat later tonight, I still haven't put everything in here. This is all... I don't know. Too much.

            Dude you're a genius. Great work. Bee tee dubs for a little humor, I laughed my ass off reading this gem: "Teens and Toddlers had a program called “Project Caress”, that later got shut down. It promoted children to touch/caress the elderly and vice versa- for therapeutic reasons."...
Holy sheet these people are insane.

            Convince me. This looks like a fake post with separate orgs of interest strung together that are not together. Esalen has been around forever; Joseph Campbell taught there. The other retreats are long-known new age borderline pervy/but not really places where people have been finding themselves for a generations. Just because you are a founder of a place doesn't mean you control it forever (Mrs. Huxley) and not Huxley himself. And Huxley was warning against what he foresaw the state doing, like Orwell, not championing it. 
You, OP, may be able to fool the newbies, but not the long time readers and observers/watchers. I call BULLSHIT.

             Apparently the Manson cult tried to attend not long before the murders.  Hunter S Thompson was the  janitor and course it is the migratory home of the Monarch butterfly and not far from the twitter CEO's current abode (or one of.)

             Given that an SRA survivor, Joan Baez attended, along with the likes of Robert Anton Wilson, who worked with Leary on Mind Control (see How To Wash Brains).  Also interestingly, Leary was said to have spent time in the same prison as Manson...  Was this state prescribed.  It could be.  Very particular social engineering going on.  Physicists in attendance. Which connects us to NASA, who consider themselves a set a part in terms of the Occult.  Look at their father Jack Parsons, who not only was a member of the OTO but also the creator of solid rocket fuel...  He was friendly with scientology founder Hubbard until his wife or girlfriend made off with him..  He was also under Oppenheimer, "I have become a destroyer of worlds".

             Huxley was the author of ‘A Brave New World’, look into it. In a letter written to George Orwell in 1949; he predicted that "Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience."

            Honestly people need to start looking outside and working their way back into CPP, (not that you linked directly back into CPP), but that there is a much larger picture, the details of which we will probably never know even 100 years from now. However, in an investigation it's important to not just work straight from the source and then out. There's been enough talk about illuminati, Freemasons, new world order, Tavistock, Soros, ect that I think it's important to do the great work you've done here and tie the links backwards. 
I've wondered if Achilles started as a victim first or if his family was connected. From what I can tell, if you are inside these ranks, it's one or the other. 
On a side note, when thinking about "victim" it reminds me of his BF Brock. No one here has spent too much time on him, but he's much more connected than JA. I'd love to know why someone who started (in 90's) as a supposed Republican, wrote a book not flattering to BC, and was working on a book exposing HRC, when suddenly he completely changed his tune. The book released was a softball and then he had the "great awakening" that he was now a Dem who was going to go after Republicans. So....what exactly did they hold over his head? He went full throttle crazy, CTR, owned by Soros in a nanosecond. I assume the dirt or threat must've been pretty interesting...

             Their families are connected going all the way back to Nimrod. Before Nimrod all the way back to Cain whose true father was the serpent. 
... Maybe crazy ass David Icke wasn't so crazy after all🤔
I've heard testimony from multiple illuminati defectors that a reptilian bloodline is true. 
Is hard for me to believe even after witnessing someone's eyes changing from normal to those of a beast. My brain still tries to rationalize what I witnessed.

               Yes.  Be forewarned: he does take a particular ethnic stance on things, but is scrupulous about substantiating and supporting every theory he posits with EVIDENCE.  Maybe start here:
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVNe1OmRPbQ">
                RadioClip
               </a>
               The radio host is a bit of a challenge for me to listen to, but Jones is very informative in this clip.
              </p>
              <p>
               Essentially if you read his work and follow him enough, you see he provides a kind of 'theory of everything' which shows how most major cultural events in the twentieth century were part of a larger social engineering experiments.
              </p>
              <p>
               Gnostic Media is also a very good resource on this point (although I don't agree with their religious conclusions they are still very good for showing the larger pattern of social engineering and connectedness between hollywood, silicon valley, compromised government and satanism and pedophilia).

                 I edited and added the Gnostic Media post as well cause that is directly tied to Esalen.  With Jones, you have to listen to/read a body of his work to begin to see the pattern.  Hope it helps!

            The Esalen connects directly to pizzagate for one of it's speakers included Robert Anton Wilson who is responsible along with Robert Shea for developing the notion of "Hot Dog Friday", in his discordian works and in particular Illuminatus.
           </p>
           <p>
            I recommend you read the words to "Play Me Backwards" by another speaker there, Joan Baez.
Let the night begin there's a pop of skin 
And the sudden rush of scarlet 
There's a little boy riding on a goat's head 
And a little girl playing the harlot 
There's a sacrifice in an empty church 
Of sweet li'l baby Rose 
And a man in a mask from Mexico 
Is peeling off my clothes
           </p>
           <p>
            The Esalen is the migratory winter home of the MONARCH BUTTERFLY.

             Also- I just edited this into my post: And from what I understand- what I make of all of this- there seem to be maybe 3 different ... broad groups of people. All the mind-control shit that we've heard about- how it happened in the 60s- and how they stopped the program? No. It is still going... they have just realllly improved upon their methods. You want kids/other people for sex ? program them. You need someone to stage a false flag? Program them. They'll be more than happy to do it. Need a spy/patsy? If you split someone's mind they will pass a lie detector test, unless the person administering the test recognizes and knows how to specifically test someone with multiple personality disorder/DID. And then you have people like us- the regular people/the mass/the zombies- their tentacles are literally in everything- they also have control of not only the media, but chemical companies, the education system, pharmaceutical companies, etc- everything that is designed to dumb us down, not question anything, and "go with the flow". We are the "wage slaves"...the little worker bees, if you will. And of course, in the background of all this/behind the scenes, you have the few select Elites, that are working on evolving consciousness and pretty much.... i don't know. It gets too weird. I honestly don't know if I am understanding this correctly- but that's how I am interpreting what I've seen regarding this. I will add more stuff to my post on voat later tonight, I still haven't put everything in here. This is all... I don't know. Too much.

             ( I just edited this into the post) From what I understand- what I make of all of this- there seem to be maybe 3 different ... broad groups of people. All the mind-control shit that we've heard about- how it happened in the 60s- and how they stopped the program? No. It is still going... they have just realllly improved upon their methods. You want kids/other people for sex ? program them. You need someone to stage a false flag? Program them. They'll be more than happy to do it. Need a spy/patsy? If you split someone's mind they will pass a lie detector test, unless the person administering the test recognizes and knows how to specifically test someone with multiple personality disorder/DID. And then you have people like us- the regular people/the mass/the zombies- their tentacles are literally in everything- they also have control of not only the media, but chemical companies, the education system, pharmaceutical companies, etc- everything that is designed to dumb us down, not question anything, and "go with the flow". We are the "wage slaves"...the little worker bees, if you will. And of course, in the background of all this/behind the scenes, you have the few select Elites, that are working on evolving consciousness and pretty much.... i don't know. It gets too weird. I honestly don't know if I am understanding this correctly- but that's how I am interpreting what I've seen regarding this. I will add more stuff to my post on voat later tonight, I still haven't put everything in here. This is all... I don't know. Too much.

             Do you know Kurt spent some of his final month with William Burroughs, who shot his wife.  Who is connected to Kenneth Anger which connects us back to Alfred Kinsey, father of the "sexual revolution" (degenerate relationships) who believed babies to be sexual beings.  Utterly repulsive, I believe he castrated himself towards the end.  Not a healthy mind and yet, many MSM laud him still.  This also brings in the nazi connection and connection to a temple in Sicily, an Occult temple.  Whole scene.

              I've been finding that the Nazis were likely innocent of most of what they've been accused of. Who do you mean by Nazis? Hitler and the German government seem to have been largely blameless, according to what I've found recently.

               Are you suggesting the Nazis weren't embraced by the Americans during project paperclip?  Are you suggesting the Nazi's weren't crucial to the development of MKUltra?  The twin research for example has no baring on unusually high births of twins in a small South American Village?

                I'm interested in learning all of the truth about history. What seems to be false is that Hitler wanted war and wanted world domination and that he wanted to exterminate Jews. Instead, he seems to have wanted only to end the threat of Bolsheviks terrorizing and destroying Europe as they had done in Russia; getting Jews out of Germany, since they were oppressive; and improving conditions in Germany and Europe. It seems he did not want war and tried to prevent war, but FDR was the main war-monger, with Churchill being the runner-up. There don't seem to have been "concentration camps" in Germany, but just labor camps. People were starving there toward the end of the war, because the allies had blockaded and bombed Germany, so they could not produce food or transport it, so all of the people of Germany were starving, not just the people in labor camps.

                I've heard about evil experiments that were supposedly done in Germany under the Nazis, but I don't know yet if that was just propaganda, like most of the rest of the falsehoods. If the stories of those experiments were true, it still wouldn't prove that Hitler or the Nazis were responsible. Maybe they were, but it has yet to be determined, as far as I know so far.

                 You sound almost exactly like me.  It's been a wild ride learning about "the rest of the story", and it just keeps taking more strange turns.  The phrase "anti-semitism" has long been used exactly the same way "fake news" is being used right now -- and by many of the same people.

              Honesty I do not want to know, or be exposed to these things. I want you to uncover and punish these evil people. But I can not stomach such behavior. My soul, my being, is fragile, I refuse to corrupt it with such malevolence. And let's be clear, these things they do, is pure evil. Whether you are religious or not. This is evil.

               Yes, it is and it is extremely traumatic waking up to all of this.  I remember crying on the phone to the police a number of years ago in relation to all of this.  It felt all the more overwhelming coming up against so many brick walls but now is different.  The world is wakening and the research being conducted is nothing short of remarkable.  My faith in humanity has been deepened and broadened so much by this and part of the wakening process is seeing how we have all been kept divided from one another.  We are all part of the human family and as a family, we are genius and with boundless energy.  Let's do it.

            You can't use Goldman Sachs as the "link" between Robert Maxwell and Ark. Goldman is a bank. If you are going to consider that every client of the bank is somewhat linked to the bank executives and large shareholders, you are going to find a lot of spurious and meaningless connections.

             It is current, modern day MK-Ultra/Project Monarch. All the mind-control shit that we've heard about- how it happened in the 60s- and they stopped the program? No. It is still going... they have just realllly improved upon their methods. You want kids/other people for sex ? MK-Ultra. You need someone to stage a false flag? Get one of the people that have been programmed their whole lives and have them do your bidding. They'll be more than happy to do it. Need a spy/patsy? If you split someone's mind they will pass a lie detector test, unless the person administering the test recognizes and knows how to specifically test someone with multiple personality disorder/DID.  And then you have people like us- the regular people/the mass/the zombies- through all of this, they also have control of not only the media, but chemical companies, the education system, pharmaceutical companies, etc- everything that is designed to dumb us down, not question anything, and "go with the flow". We are the "wage slaves". In the background of all this, you have the few, select Elites, that are working on evolving consciousness and pretty much.... i don't know. It gets too weird. I honestly don't know if I am understanding this correctly- but that's what I am getting from all this. I will add stuff later tonight, I haven't put everything in here. This is all, like, I don't know. Too much.

              Can we create a separate subverse where we research this? Most people write this sort of connection off as being some kind of tinfoil hat trip, but I'm utterly convinced that this should be the cornerstone of the investigation. Putting it in a separate place would allow people to talk about it without getting buried in the mix and "discredited" by other people who think it is too much of a stretch (same thing they do with the Luciferian cult angle). I think it is just one too many red pills for people, even those that are fully invested in Pizzagate, but it is a completely legit angle that needs to be investigated as thoroughly as possible, and from your posts I get the impression that you are as frustrated as I am that more people are not taking this seriously. If there is overlap in the investigations, we can always cross-post. The beauty of this kind of crowd-sourced, non-profit investigation is that people can branch off and investigate separate things without weakening the overall investigation.

               I'm new here... My take is that MK Ultra is the reason there are no visible victims. With trauma based mind control, the (old enough to talk) child would have completed enough monarch training to disassociate -- and therefore NOT REMEMBER...
              </p>
              <p>
               I totally agree though, that this needs to be sold to the public with as few tin-foil details as possible. They can only handle so much.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, another reason for no victims is, they are unrelated to the perps and "removed" from the scene. This is incredibly organized. I mean, they have "realtors" that follow perps around and clean up after sessions...

               At this point I dont really think this is something that we need to be really trying to "push" to people. I think we need to talk about this maybe just amongst ourselves until we can figure out what to do with this info. And I mean, it is hard enough for some people to even consider the possibility of our government being actively involved in child sex stuff. Pedophilia is a non-arguable, real, thing. MK-Ultra... it isn't. I don't know what to do with this, honestly. I don't think it should be "marketed", if you will, until we can figure out an intelligent way to do it. And I think the way to do that is get ALL the facts before we start spilling it all over social media.

                I concur, which is why I think it might fare better as a separate subverse; it is clear that people, other than you and I, are interested in the subject, but it keeps getting buried in Pizzagate because it seems too tangential &amp; too "far out" for most people to process. I don't think we should be pushing it to anyone, hence investigating it independently in its own subverse  so it is more accessible to anyone that wants to approach it from a "big picture" angle. If there are any overlaps in the investigation, we can post them to pizza gate. This angle is extremely important, but if we post about it here even the people investigating pizza gate call us "conspiracy theorists" and instantaneously discredit us with a thought-terminating cliche.

               I think this is a great idea. You could post a presentation of what you uncovered? See if the community can poke holes in it. Sounds almost professional. Great thinking.

              Thank you my friend. I believe everything you say. The only problem I have is the MK/Ultra stuff is a "hard sell" to the general public. It sounds Tin Foil Hatty if you will. Everything else is suitable for public consumption. What's my point? PizzaGate needs to be "sold" to the public in the same way the Elites have "sold" their lie. For us Deplorables the public's "entre" into this is straight up Pedophile hunting.  No one can argue with that.

               It does sound like it's a part of the tin-foil hat brigade, which is why I lead with Project Paperclip-- bringing German scientists over to the states after WWII, and finish with the fact that in 1995 Bill Clinton issued a formal apology to those who were human experimentation victims at the hands of the US gov.

               It makes it much more palatable to those who haven't been red pilled to know that a president acknowledged (and giggled his way through) an "apology."

               At this point I dont really think this is something that we need to be really trying to "push" to people. I think we need to talk about this maybe just amongst ourselves until we can figure out what to do with this info. And I mean, it is hard enough for some people to even consider the possibility of our government being actively involved in child sex stuff. Pedophilia is a non-arguable, real, thing. MK-Ultra... it isn't. I don't know what to do with this, honestly. I don't think it should be "marketed", or whatever, until we can figure out an intelligent way to do it. And I think the way to do that is get ALL the facts before we start spilling it all over social media. I have many more connections I've made (on paper), but I don't think I am going to post much more of them until I have a shit load of info, and then I will dump it all. Because right now, with as much info as is in the post, it's not nearly enough. I think EVERYBODY should look into this, but NOT post the info online until maybe like a certain day/time. When we investigate all this shit and put it out in the open like we have been doing- they have time to cover their tracks as well as think of excuses/explanations for the stuff we uncover.

                "figure out an intelligent way to do it"....That's why I wrote the Pedophilia stuff is unassailable. Everything has to be tied to Pedophilia. There's TOO much other stuff that's bad but could water down the primary mission of Pedophile Hunting. Get my point? Have you ever heard the term "Trying to boil the ocean"? Yes? It fits perfectly here. ;-)

                Those are extremely sketchy to the point PizzaGate would lose credibility if stuff like that was associated it. Like I said true of false MK-Ultra is a no go show stopper. It's too tenuous to prove.

                    Yes, there's a resemblance.  However, I don't know of any evidence that Noble's art has ever been in CPP, and that's the claim some are making.

                     "Posters with Kim Noble inspired art" vs "Posters with Kim Noble art". Does it really matter? Reminds me of that old saying "Shakespeare's plays were either written by Shakespeare or a man calling himself Shakespeare". ;-)

                   <p>
                    "Until last night I didn’t realize that some were claiming she had made some of the art that decorates Comet Ping Pong and Pizza in Washington, D.C., the center of the current child abuse controversy. [Note: I do not know this particular claim to be true.]"

                   <p>
                    I don't know it to be true either.  Is there any actual evidence of it?  Or did people just make an assumption when they saw images together, and a rumor started?
