<p>LATEST Q THREAD</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/LightlyToasted">@LightlyToasted</a> posted the Dec. 7 Q Anon thread <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2279787">here</a> which features several photos, including one of Pope St. John Paul II with the caption: &quot;Pope visits the site of the Sermon on the Holy Mount&quot; in which one can see the late pope embracing a bishop.</p>
<p>This picture appears to have been taken when Pope JP II visited the Sea of Galilee near the Mount of Beatitudes in March 24, 2000. The bishop the pope is greeting is apparently Archbishop Boutros Mouallem of the Greek Melkite Community. You can see them together in this picture:</p>

<p>POPE ST. JOHN PAUL\'S POWERFUL HOMILY ON THE MOUNT OF BEATITUDES</p>
<p>The pope, addressing the youth of the world, gave an (uncharacteristically!) brief but extremely compelling <a href="http://ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/documents-and-statements/roman-catholic/pope-john-paul-ii/337-jp2-00mar24">sermon</a> on that occasion in which he pointed to the nearby Mount Sinai (on which the Ten Commandments were given to Moses) and the Mount of Beatitudes as &quot;the roadmap of our Christian life and a summary of our responsibilities to God and neighbour. The Law and the Beatitudes together mark the path of the following of Christ and the royal road to spiritual maturity and freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>He goes on to remind us that there are two voices competing for our attention and two paths open to all of us: &quot;the choice between good and evil, between life and death.&quot;</p>
<p>EXCERPT FROM THE POPE\'S PIVOTAL SERMON</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ten Commandments of Sinai may seem negative: &quot;You will have no false gods before me; . . . do not kill; do not commit adultery; do not steal; do not bear false witness ... &quot; (Ex 20:3, 13-16). But in fact they are supremely positive. Moving beyond the evil they name, they point the way to the law of love which is the first and greatest of the commandments: &quot;You will love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul and all your mind. . .You will love your neighbor as yourself&quot; (Mt 22:37, 39). Jesus himself says that he came not to abolish but to fulfill the Law (cf. Mt 5:17). His message is new but it does not destroy what went before; it leads what went before to its fullest potential. Jesus teaches that the way of love brings the Law to fulfillment (cf. Gal 5:14). And he taught this enormously important truth on this hill here in Galilee.</p>
<p>3.&quot;Blessed are you!&quot;, he says, &quot;all you who are poor in spirit, gentle and merciful, you who mourn, who care for what is right, who are pure in heart, who make peace, you who are persecuted! Blessed are you!&quot; But the words of Jesus may seem strange. It is strange that Jesus exalts those whom the world generally regards as weak. He says to them, &quot;Blessed are you who seem to be losers, because you are the true winners: the kingdom of heaven is yours!&quot; Spoken by him who is &quot;gentle and humble in heart&quot; (Matt 11:29), these words present a challenge which demand a deep and abiding metanoia of the spirit, a great change of heart.
You young people will understand why this change of heart is necessary! Because you are aware of another voice within you and all around you, a contradictory voice. It is a voice which says, &quot;Blessed are the proud and violent, those who prosper at any cost, who are unscrupulous, pitiless, devious, who make war not peace, and persecute those who stand in their way&quot;. And this voice seems to make sense in a world where the violent often triumph and the devious seem to succeed. &quot;Yes&quot;, says the voice of evil, &quot;they are the ones who win. Happy are they!&quot;</p>
<p>4.Jesus offers a very different message. Not far from this very place Jesus called his first disciples, as he calls you now. His call has always demanded a choice between the two voices competing for your hearts even now on this hill, the choice between good and evil, between life and death. Which voice will the young people of the twenty-first century choose to follow? To put your faith in Jesus means choosing to believe what he says, no matter how strange it may seem, and choosing to reject the claims of evil, no matter how sensible or attractive they may seem.
In the end, Jesus does not merely speak the Beatitudes. He lives the Beatitudes. He is the Beatitudes. Looking at him you will see what it means to be poor in spirit, gentle and merciful, to mourn, to care for what is right, to be pure in heart, to make peace, to be persecuted. This is why he has the right to say, &quot;Come, follow me!&quot; He does not say simply, &quot;Do what I say&quot;. He says, &quot;Come, follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>You hear his voice on this hill, and you believe what he says. But like the first disciples at the Sea of Galilee, you must leave your boats and nets behind, and that is never easy—especially when you face an uncertain future and are tempted to lose faith in your Christian heritage. To be good Christians may seem beyond your strength in today’s world. But Jesus does not stand by and leave you alone to face the challenge. He is always with you to transform your weakness into strength. Trust him when he says: &quot;My grace is enough for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness&quot; (2 Cor 12:9)!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RELEVANCE OF THE POPE\'S HOMILY FOR OUR TIME</p>
<p>Not hard at all for us here on Voat to see why &quot;Q&quot; is directing us to the Polish Pope\'s beautiful homily.</p>
<p>There are two voices demanding our attention and two paths open to us all.</p>
<p>There is the voice of God and His Saints urging us to follow the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes and to follow Jesus and &quot;be poor in spirit, gentle and merciful, to mourn, to care for what is right, to be pure in heart, to make peace, to be persecuted.&quot;</p>
<p>Then there is the voice of Satan which contradicts the Beatitudes which says: &quot;Blessed are the proud and violent, those who prosper at any cost, who are unscrupulous, pitiless, devious, who make war not peace, and persecute those who stand in their way&quot;. And this voice seems to make sense in a world where the violent often triumph and the devious seem to succeed. &quot;Yes&quot;, says the voice of evil, &quot;they are the ones who win. Happy are they!&quot;</p>
<p>We are called to follow the former and make the fundamental choice to obey the Laws of God which requires a change of heart, a metanoia, to accept His grace and His assistance in following the straight and narrow path to eternal happiness.</p>
<p>This is apparently a decisive, INDEED, A PIVOTAL moment in the history of the world. Whom are we going to follow: Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, or Satan?</p>',

           EXCERPT FROM THE POPE'S PIVOTAL SERMON
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The Ten Commandments of Sinai may seem negative: "You will have no false gods before me; . . . do not kill; do not commit adultery; do not steal; do not bear false witness ...

           </p>
           <p>
            3."Blessed are you!", he says, "all you who are poor in spirit, gentle and merciful, you who mourn, who care for what is right, who are pure in heart, who make peace, you who are persecuted! Blessed are you!" But the words of Jesus may seem strange. It is strange that Jesus exalts those whom the world generally regards as weak.

And this voice seems to make sense in a world where the violent often triumph and the devious seem to succeed. "Yes", says the voice of evil, "they are the ones who win. Happy are they!"
           </p>
           <p>

His call has always demanded a choice between the two voices competing for your hearts even now on this hill, the choice between good and evil, between life and death.

Looking at him you will see what it means to be poor in spirit, gentle and merciful, to mourn, to care for what is right, to be pure in heart, to make peace, to be persecuted. This is why he has the right to say, "Come, follow me!" He does not say simply, "Do what I say". He says, "Come, follow me!"
           </p>
           <p>
            You hear his voice on this hill, and you believe what he says. But like the first disciples at the Sea of Galilee, you must leave your boats and nets behind, and that is never easy—especially when you face an uncertain future and are tempted to lose faith in your Christian heritage. To be good Christians may seem beyond your strength in today’s world. But Jesus does not stand by and leave you alone to face the challenge. He is always with you to transform your weakness into strength. Trust him when he says: "My grace is enough for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness" (2 Cor 12:9)!

            It is a mistake to equate institutions such as the churches with Jesus.  As soon as you have organization, you get hierarchy, as soon as you get hierarchy and the concomitant power it gives to some, the sooner you get abuse.  Institutionalizing any teacher, Jesus, Buddah, whoever is a good way to neutralize their message.  John Paul may have said good things, but did he sell all the possessions of the Catholic church and give them to the poor and take up his cross to follow the example of the life of Jesus?  We don't need a homily on the beatitudes from someone adorned with gold and fancy clothes, we just need the beatitudes.  They are quite easy to understand.  If the poor are blessed then the catholic church and all the protestant churches should sell all they have and live as Jesus did.  Sermons are almost always designed to give people excuses to not follow what Jesus taught. I grew up loving Jesus and his teachings but all I found in church was hypocrisy.

             Just one question: have you sold all you have and given it to the poor?

             I'm not trying to be snarky, but most people would acknowledge that Catholic Church does a great deal to help the unfortunate. I don't agree with the US Bishops' terribly misguided protection of illegal aliens (for which they are handsomely paid by the US Govt) but there is no denying that there are many Catholic organizations which help the poor. Three outstanding examples from the tri-state area: Missionaries of Charity, the Friars of the Renewal and the the Sisters of Life.

              Gilderoy, I tried to live as Jesus lived.  I spent time in Haiti working with Mother Theresa's sisters in their children's home.  In the end I found I was not up to the goal I set for myself, to live like Christ.  My impressions of the sisters is that although they were doing the work with the kids, they were really more interested in each other and getting points with god than they were in the kids themselves.  I remember only one of them acting warm to the children.  And while they lived simply they clearly lived better than most Haitians as indicated by their waistlines.
I found after I could no longer believe that a powerful god who could act in human lives was a good god.  I can't say if god exists or not, but the situation on the ground in the world proves that if there is a powerful creator god he is not good.  The suffering I saw in Haiti of the innocents convinced me.  I still admire the teachings of Jesus and still wish I had the courage to live that life of service and sacrifice but I have settled for living a simple life.  I did service work as a Christian and service work as a non-christian.  I have done Hospice volunteering, work with the mentally handicapped, homeless shelter volunteering etc.  I don't own jewelry or fine clothes such as adorn the Bishops, Cardinals and Popes.  I don't abuse children as so many of the priests have done.  I have friends who are devout Catholics and Christians of other denominations.  I have no problem with them.  But I recall that Jesus attacked the money changers in the temple and I have no doubt that if he was here today he would take his whip to the Vatican, and all the other denominations which build their wealth on the backs of the poor.  The Catholic church has been doing it longer than any of the protestants.  They even had their own serfs in the Middle ages.  Because some Catholics do truly good works does not pardon the Church for its accumulation of wealth, the Inquisition, and the overall oppression of the poor.  Meanwhile a bunch of its wealth coming from the donations of good people is being paid out to cover the sins of the pedophile priests.  I don't understand why catholics are not leaving the church in droves.

               Kacey, you have a very compelling story. I can understand why you feel like you do after what you've experienced. Very sad to hear about the way Mother Teresa's sisters acted.  My own experience with most priests and bishops is nothing to write home about, but I have decided to stay with the Church because I love the traditional teaching of the Church and the traditional liturgy. That is what my faith and hope is based on---not the bad example of individual Catholics.
              </p>
              <p>
               The good news is that very often you do find good, holy Catholics whom God sends into your life at key times. Whenever I'm most discouraged and want to give up, it seems like a sign of encouragement is sent so I keep holding on. Jesus didn't promise us that life as a Catholic was always going to be beatific, lovely and easy, but He did promise that His Church possesses the keys to the kingdom of heaven and that is what I believe with all my heart: that if I follow the laws of God and receive the Sacraments, by the grace of God, I will be saved, but outside of the Church, there is no salvation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Either you believe that, or you don't, and if you believe it, nothing any person can do can shake that belief. I've always loved this verse:
              </p>
              <p>
               "For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

                Gilderoy, I am sure you are taking the best from your faith and living out much more closely the life Jesus taught than many.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have never, even in my Christian days, wanted eternal life.  Sounds boring.  I believe we return to the nothingness from which we came.  I am not afraid of death and as old age adds new aches and pains I know that one day I will welcome death with open arms.  I have seen so many Hospice patients do just that.
               </p>
               <p>
                BTW I was raised Lutheran and even planned at one time to become a Deaconess. :)  I did at one time enjoy the ritual, but preferred folk services.  I wondered when I abandoned the last remnants of faith what would fill that place in my life.  But for me life without religion has turned out to be much happier, more peaceful.

                 Kacey, I know very well how "religion" can become a cover for vileness and corruption. So many terrible things are carried out in the name of "religion" and sometimes the most "pious" and "holy" people are the nastiest people you know. That is the perennial challenge: to know your Faith and love God and His law so much that, with His grace, you go forward regardless of the obstructions, discouragement and outright persecution. With God's grace, we carry the Kingdom of Heaven in our hearts and, if we persist and keep trying, we can begin to live "heaven" right here on earth. Our homes and relationships with others should be a spot of heaven. From the sounds of it, and all the good works and love you have for others, you are carrying the Kingdom of Heaven into some dark, lonely places. I daresay you wouldn't be on Voat if you didn't believe there was a better way, a higher plan for the world and didn't want to fight for the restoration of goodness and morality, which come from following God's plan for humanity. : )

                  Jesus denounced the hypocrites eh?  I will continue to point out religious hypocrisy when I see it.  I see it big time with the Catholic church.  I think Jesus would come and tear the whole institution down if he returned.  Per Jesus you do not need the Catholic church sacraments to be saved.  Basically he said "believe and be baptized" and "like as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto, come into the kingdom".  The institution of the catholic church has been "selling" salvation including at one time selling indulgences (being Lutheran I was well educated as to why Luther split with the church).  You may enjoy the liturgy and services but you do not need a priest to forgive your sins or the church to administer all those sacraments in order to be saved per Jesus himself.  I believe that when I priest violates a child it is much worse than a politician, or even a protestant pastor.  Priests give the sacraments which are needed for salvation according to Catholics.  The stand above the flock as supposedly between them and God.  When a priest does this to a child the damage to their psyche is far deeper and long lasting.  I hope you as a Catholic are doing everything you can to be sure that all such priests are exposed and defrocked and punished by our nation's laws.  I have no influence in the Catholic church or any church, but perhaps my comments can wake up religious people to be more aware of what their leaders may be doing.  Too much reverence has protected these monsters for too long.
                  <br/>
                  If God is all powerful he can just make us all good.  If he can't and won't he is the author of all the world's misery.

            Yes, the church has been infiltrated by Satanists, Freemasons and pedos. But at it's heart, it teaches love, compassion and kindness. That's what Jesus taught.  Catholic priests understand the fight between good and evil.

            Anything pointing to Jesus is a good thing.  The RCC messed up by not following other scripture, like a church leader must be married, prove you can handle that before leading a church.
           </p>
           <p>
            Solomon tells us, nothing new under the sun.  When the Jews returned to Israel, the folks there were doing awful things to children, ie. Molech.  God was very clear on how those folks should be handled.
           </p>
           <p>
            The battle is spiritual, good vs evil.  Scripture is absolute truth, it is solid rock.  Deviate from it at risk.  The political elite, tied to the hollywood elite have deviated all the way to the other end of the spectrum.  It is the good folks here, fighting the good fight.  God is on their side.

            I had friends in High School who had gone to Catholic School until 9th grade.  This was in the late 60's.  They told me the teacher nuns would have to leave from time to time to have babies because they got knocked up by the priest.  I never heard that he abused any of the kids.  But imagine growing up in a faith where the local priest who is your confessor is known to be violating his oath of celibacy.  That in itself is an abuse as you teach them one set of rules for them and another for the adult who is their spiritual leader.

             Kacey, I also went to a Catholic school with nuns, and let me tell you, if a priest had tried anything funny with those nuns he would have left the premises in a pine box. I'm not disputing that such scandalous things may have happened before the changes to the religious orders occurred in the 1960's, but such incidents were exceedingly rare before disciplines were changed. If you really understood the culture and the system of preconciliar convents and women religious and also of traditional Catholic parish life, you would realize how absurd such stories are. Many, many safeguards and disciplines were in place to prevent scandals like that. Women religious had a very rigidly structured existence. Just one example: nuns were never, ever allowed to go anywhere alone. They always had to travel or be in public in pairs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Same thing with priests. Before the changes of Vatican II, there were many safeguards and rules in place to prevent even the whiff of scandal. I'm sure untoward things still happened, but the entire culture and atmosphere was built on layers of protocol and conventions that were almost impossible to break out of. That is probably why everything went wild in the 60's. The priests and nuns threw off all the shackles and broke all the rules, but that's a story for another day. : )

              So are you saying that no sex abuse happens in the Catholic church anymore?  Or just that no nuns get raped anymore.
             </p>
             <p>
              I presume that each church, especially those that are smaller and have one priest, run by the rules that priest sets so the character of that priest would probably be more indicative of what was likely than rules laid down in Rome.
             </p>
             <p>
              Any rate here is the number of Catholic priests defrocked since 2004 for pedophilia.  I would guess that number is the tip of the iceberg.

               I never denied that sex abuse happens in the Church. I addressed a claim you made implying that it was commonplace for priests to impregnate nuns teaching in Catholic high schools which I very seriously doubt ever happened on a wide scale in the United States, esp. before the Second Vatican Council. As for the experience of nuns and priests in the Third World, I have no idea. I assumed we were speaking of the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
               Regarding clerical pedophilia, I agree with you that it happens in the Church; I have had personal experience fighting the appointment of a Catholic pastor who had a very dodgy past and was the subject of many allegations who was being shuffled around the diocese by the bishop. I fought that situation tooth and nail, wrote multiple letters to every one up and down the ladders of power, made phone calls, assembled a 110-page dossier, contacted canon lawyers----and lost. The priest is still pastor of my parish, though I have long since moved on.
              </p>
              <p>
               I KNOW THERE IS A CLERICAL PEDOPHILE PROBLEM IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. I think the percentage of priests who are criminal pedophiles is small, but the fact that bishops and popes did not do enough to eradicate it and compensate and help the victims is an enormous scandal and sin. That does not mean that I have given up on the Catholic Church; I will never give up my faith, God willing, and I hope and pray the Church will return to better practices and a better understanding of Catholic morality and responsibility.

                I was responding to what I thought you were implying, ie that such stories are rare.  I don't know if priests raping nuns is rare or was rare, I only know what my friends told me.  In fact if true, the nuns could have been willing and not raped.  What they were allowed to do outside the church when they went out has no bearing on what might have gone on at night when no parishioners were around.  I know that the pedophilia scandal with priests is real and that priests used their power to coerce young boys to have sex with them.  It appears to be more common than was originally thought because, higher clergy, police, politicians helped cover it up and parents and parishoners were so in awe of the priests that they went into denial.  If that could happen with little boys and girls I suspect it could happen with nuns.  At the time my friends told me this I was shocked and didn't know what to think.  But given the revelations about pedophilia by priests it seems likely it did happen and if it happened in one parish it probably happened in others.

According to The Washington Post Sister Amoa admitted to smothering the baby she named Joseph after giving him birth at the Catholic Northeast Little Sisters of the Poor Convent.
Although the nuns reported Sister Amoa to police, Catholic authorities have not always been transparent about homicides committed within their secretive walls. According to child abuse survivors of Catholic institutions, it was common for priests and nuns to rape and kill children, especially a newborn. There was assurance from the Vatican that anyone tarnishing the Roman Catholic Church by reporting such crimes would be excommunicated and thus live in eternal Hell.

             Happy to help out any way I can. Thanks for the flair. I'm still trying to absorb the fact that "Q" posted a picture of Pope John Paul II and the implications thereof. Quite a fascinating development.

              Indeed. That's the second clue he's given that he's Catholic. The first was the version of the Lord's Prayer.

              I wonder which of the people in that picture on AF1 with them giving the thumbs-up in the shape of a Q is a Catholic? Hmmm...

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We are called to follow the former and make the fundamental choice to obey the Laws of God which requires a change of heart, a metanoia, to accept His grace and His assistance in following the straight and narrow path to eternal happiness.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The law itself don't necessarily require a change of heart, rather the heart becomes the environment of the law, eg "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts" Jeremiah 31:33
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the Hebrew word translated as grace can also mean favour:
           </p>
           <p>
            Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
So shalt thou find favour (grace) and good understanding in the sight of Elohim and man. Proverbs 3:3-4

             Beautiful! Thanks for the adjustment. My paraphrase of the Pope's sermon leaves a lot to be desired. He said it far better than I did and much more in line with you said. The most amazing thing to contemplate is that it appears the world is on the verge of a conversion, a softening of the heart to accept the Word of God. We are at a fork in the road: will we accept God's grace and turn back to Godly living, or will we choose the path to destruction?

              Your paraphrase was more in line with the conventional Christian doctrine of grace through belief. IMO the difference in our interpretation of the role of grace is based on the faith vs works argument, i.e. the new covenant of Jeremiah 31:31-33 vs the law nailed to the cross in Colossians 2:14. In James 2:20-26 there is an argument against Paul's doctrine from Romans 2:2-5. The public schism between James "Judaizers" and Paul's Christians goes back to the riot that occurred during James' test of Paul (Acts 21:18-32), and remained as Paul failed to deliver James' four points from the Council of Jerusalem.

             The inverted cross has a troubling symbolism, I agree, but I believe the intention was to symbolize St. Peter's death, which was an upside-down crucifixion. St. Peter, the first Pope, was condemned to death by crucifixion, but in his humility, he asked to have the cross turned upside down because he didn't deem himself worthy to be crucified in the same way as Jesus. A famous representation by Caravaggio:
            </p>
            <p>

              http://2fish.co/files/artwork/crucifixion-of-saint-peter-big.jpg
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The inverted cross at the Sea of Galilee on this occasion symbolizes the connection of the Pope to St. Peter. I know it's disturbing, but I don't know if you can blame the Pope for the chair. He couldn't possibly manage every single detail when he visited places all over the world. It would have been better if there had been some explanations, and it would have been far better if they hadn't produced that chair at all.

            As a Catholic, sometimes we have to look past the flawed leaders to Christ's message which is as true now as it was 2000+ years ago. I think somehow that this moral abyss that we see today , an abyss created by those  that want to destroy Christianity, can be a blessing in disguise in that it forces us to not take our faith for granted but to reignite our commitment to faith and to doing good, not evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you (and Q) for publicizing Christ's message. If we left it to Pope Francis (who  hides his Pectoral Cross in his cummberbund when meeting with rabbis), the message would fade out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Merry Christmas!

            One of my Catholic friends admitted the Roman Catholic church is the world's largest organized pedophile ring. This pope and all others know full well what lurks in their ranks. This is not Pizzagate- this is why we HAVE pizzagate.

            Pope John Paul II was certainly
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            a good person. He didn't do anything about the sexual abuse in the RCC. He was one of those who did the cover-up. Don't know why people glorify him.

              No. I know someone who at the time wrote to John Paul II and told him he had been abused by a priest.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Pope's answer was: I will pray for you. He didn't do anything about the abuse allegations. In fact, priests who abused kids merely were assigned to a new parish when people found out. Abusers didn't face any punishments, the abuse was simply covered up.
             </p>
             <p>
              I deeply respect anyone who believes in Christ, but the Popes - maybe with the exemption of John XXIII - have all been implicated.
             </p>
             <p>
              So pizzagate is now cheering 'Q' for placing hints about John Paul II's sermons? Oh my.

               I am sorry this happened to your friend.  It is awful. However, The Pope took actions to protect the children and further abuses that you are not aware of.   The VIRTUS program was imstituted.   Many safety precautions that both religious and lay people had to abide by we’re started.   All are expected to take classes in awareness of pedophilia and child abuse.  Did you know most pedophilia is committed by family members?  And women are offenders almost as much as men?  Anyone who works with children in the Catholic Church now has to be trained in recognizing pedophiles behavior. 
The Church has done a lot to change and protect children.  Granted this should never happen to begin with.

             I don't agree with all of his actions, but I do believe he was a man of intense prayer and had tremendous theological/spiritual insight. His encyclicals are a beautiful synthesis of traditional Catholic doctrine and contemporary thought. He was able to capture Biblical truths and present them in a dynamic way.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is certainly abundant proof that he personally led a life of heroic virtue, but he made some terrible episcopal appointments and did not apparently root out the pedophiles as he should. Some have postulated that he did not believe all of the accusations and thought it was a plot by the Church's enemies to smear the clergy because he was accustomed to the Nazis and Communists using such tactics when he was a bishop and cardinal in Poland.

              Indeed. Not to mention the fact that -- as many on this board know -- it is often hard for people who are genuinely good to comprehend the depths of depravity people who seem similar to themselves can fall to.

              I never liked any popes after him.  Francis is a Fake.  He just changed the words to the Our Father.  What an Arrogant Jerk.

               I hope somebody someday soon proves that Pope Francis' election was a fraud. I wouldn't be surprised at all and would be very relieved if and when it is verified that he is not a valid pope.

                Well we know who might be behind the fraud, but as soon as someone starts screaming fraud, they will scream, The Russians!  They will be sure to come up with a reason the Russians would want him in the Vatican.  It just amazes me that none of the Normies are catching on to this Russia thing.  It is so very obvious.  Staring us right in the face!

                 LOL, you got me with that one! Very ironic, esp. because Putin allegedly said recently that Pope Francis was not a man of God, and that Pope Francis' "God" was not the God of the Bible.

                  Yes, I agree, but a few I believe tried to do what they could, to no avail.  It was too ingrained and infiltrated.  I believe the dye was set and in place for Bergoglio. .The whole of the Vatican is Evill.

              Saint Pope John Paul’s cause for Sainthood was put on the fast track because of an outcry from the people.  They begged for him to be canonized.  He was an amazing human being and priest.  Sad that people are judging him now.  I am Catholic and into  Pizzagate. Message to

                 Same to you! I actually heard a Catholic priest talking about pizzagate on YouTube. He is an exorcist and said the things he has seen and heard have confirmed the existence of "pizzagate".

                 Uh huh. Written circa 60 A.D., before Christians were being called Christians, before "The Vatican" existed, and about one and a half millennia before Protestants existed. You think St. John was telling folks to leave the Church he was a bishop of. Right.

               The Catholic clerical pedophile problem is indeed a terrible scandal, but other denominations as well as secular institutions have the same problem and often to a far greater degree.

             Hope it can be of help. I will keep looking into the visit by Pope John Paul II to the Mount of Beatitudes, but this sermon appears to be of the most relevance. There could be other aspects of his visit, too, but the gravity and sense of urgency in this sermon seem to be most appropriate to the current moment.

              I think it'll be worth your time. Q chose that picture, specifically, I imagine it would have taken some digging. Please alert me if you find anything else of note. :)
