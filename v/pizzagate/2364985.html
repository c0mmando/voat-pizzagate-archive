            This is a very important issue: The staggering amount of CP and the very, very low numbers of children who are saved.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are not interested in rescuing any children imo.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember a case in England in 2017, where a 17 yr. old Eton boy produced most horrible child porn, and he got a slip on the wrist (had to go to some therapy lessons).
           </p>
           <p>
            The police and the judge never asked where he got the children from - it might have led to others involved, and obviously they didn't want to find more perps, especially since he was from an elite family.

            I live in Collin County and used to work in Richardson ISD as a teacher. Honestly, I got the creepiest vibe from Berkner High School (where I worked).
           </p>
           <p>
            In the 3 years I worked there, two teachers were caught having sex with students (barely made a ripple in the local news). The mascot is a ram (looks like a satanic goat). The semester is divided into three 6-week intervals so everything is 6-6-6.
           </p>
           <p>
            The last year I worked there, someone hung a dead goat from the football field goal posts. The marching band practiced its routine on the field before it was taken down- it looked like a freaking ritual. Oh, and the school is named after LV Berkner who was a member of the majestic 12.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Police-Investigate-Dead-Goat-Found-on-Berkner-High-School-Campus-223722751.html%3famp=y">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The admin was nuts and I got an MK uktra vibe from several staff members. And I basically lost my job because my students interrogated our congressman at a town hall we hosted- the admin were not happy about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Freaking crazy shit in Richardson ISD. Everyone I worked with who was a reasonable person left Berkner because it was too batshit. I would not be surprised if some schools are used as a cover to traffic kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the Poor Richard's cafe owner in Plano got arrested a while back for CP related issues.

               I will try and find the you/hooktube I saw on it. It was somewhere in Delaware if I recall. The town has a real big wicca gathering every year or something akin to it.

              Yes. I am very good friends with a former chemistry teacher and we both thought there was something seriously weird going on there.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is one teacher who I swear was under some kind of mk ultra mind control. She had like 7 names that she had gone by at some point. She was very stepford-wife ish and was like a robot. She was married to a wealthy high power lawyer who has argued in front of the Supreme Court. She came from a family involved in Louisiana state politics. Her brother is a CFO (I believe) of a huge company and delivered a speech on cyber security at the UN within the past few years.
             </p>
             <p>
              And she was always ALWAYS taking orders. The school started inviting Texas Instruments to do these "gender equity" teacher training. Classic leftist oppression Olympics garbage that everyone hated (except her). Like, she was always gung-ho to implement politically charged agendas that came from the top. She came off as really sweet and kinda robotic but then did some awful back stabby stuff to other staff members- shit was weird there man.

               Yeah, I went to school at UTD so I know that area well. Richardson is a gigantic poop-hole now, it's hard to tell who was born there into the ghetto life and who got a special Hillary visa to come there.
              </p>
              <p>
               I remember hearing about that Poor Richards Pub thing, it happened the same day I got stalked in public for the first time and my hairdresser told me about it. It's almost as if that was the first round.
              </p>
              <p>
               PM me - would love to know more about who that congressman was. I have some suspicions about some specific people active in politics around here.

                I taught government/economics and am very into the conspiracy stuff so my class was quite the red pill. We filmed the town hall and Buzzfeed did a story on it. There's a link to the town hall in the article. It's long AF but the students's questions (which are badass) are subtitled.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's funny too that the guy who wrote this story for Buzzfeed ended up working at CNN and was the guy who got his panties in a twist about the CNN wrestling gif and tried to dox the gif creator.

                 Oh boy, don't even get me started on BuzzFeed and CNN, it's strange that you mention that actually. I'll have to catch up with you some time. Studying. And I didn't notice a grammar issue but congrats on the baby! I know the feeling of typing while nursing.
