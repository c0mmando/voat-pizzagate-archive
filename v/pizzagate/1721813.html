<p>In late <strong>October 2014</strong> ,  <strong>Big Paul</strong> purchased between $100,000 and $250,000 in stock from green energy company <strong>Sun Edison</strong>.  Just three weeks later, the company acquired <strong>First Wind</strong> , a wind power company.  <em>The purchase caused Sun Edison’s stock to soar 29%</em>. <strong>Many believe that the purchase had been made thru one of many insider trading operations thru Nancy’s senate seat</strong>. Sun Edison hired the services of <strong>The Podesta Group</strong>, a lobbying firm run by <strong>James Alefantis, Hillary and Bill Clinton’s close friends, Tony and John Podesta.</strong> [43]</p>
<p><strong>Is Pelosi\'s husband guilty of insider trading?</strong></p>

<p>In San Francisco, Guccifer 2.0 leaks reveal that Nancy Pelosi’s email account is registered as a backdoor to Goat Hill Pizza, which has made numerous donations to the Democratic Party.[44]</p>
<p>Started in 1975, Goat Hill Pizza has been owned by most likely Roman Catholic Philip DeAndrade (Goat Hill, Inc.) since 1985, Task Force Chair for the San Francisco County Board of Supervisors. Goat Hill Pizza is listed at 300 Connecticut St., SF, while Ping Pong Pizza also has a Connecticut Ave address. [45],[46]</p>
<p>It\'s this sort of incestuous relationship that Washington insiders get involved in all the time.  It is easily discernible to see Sun Edison\'s acquisition of First Wind going through the Democratic Party grapevine via The Podesta Group and landing on Pelosi\'s desk. </p>
<p>Perhaps an investigation by the SEC into the purchase of Sun Edision stock by other Democratic Party insiders is warranted.</p>

            We need solar and wind energy really bad. And people need to start implementing it themselves on their own land, circumventing the utility companies. We need to start depending on ourselves to the greatest extent possible. Interesting that they are doing some good.

             We need an alternative form of energy altogether separate from the kinds they tell us to use. I'm pretty sure Nicholas Tesla was somewhere around the bend to a power source that was virtually pollution free as the 'ancients' might have utilized until this modern era.

             Except they are finding out that solar panels aren't working as well as they should, are being scrapped and contain very noxious substances.  The countless batteries required are bad enough.  Wind energy, if you're speaking of wind farms, emit infrasound and if there are enough and you live close by, it is said that they can drive you nuts.  Although maybe small windmills on property would be the best choice.  Having said that, I agree that we need to depend on ourselves and stop leaving it in the hands of government, but as I see it it's almost too late.  The vultures have infested the world.

              Seriously. Cant get my parents to move an inch in the right direction, they were made too comfortable by society and they don't realize that they could lose that paradyme at any moment. I think with the utilization of graphene the problems with solar panels will be solved, and obviously we just need to continue researching, we will fix the problems undoubtedly.

              You should check out heating your water with solar energy, it looks really simple, just need a metal panel that holds water painted black. And then you need to hook it up to your water system.

               Yes, you are right about older folks being so stuck in their comfort.  We've got troves of people driving humongous buses around because they don't like the weather where they are in the winter.  It's insanity.  This comfort will not last and will be a shock to most people who are oblivious to what is happening in the world.  Red pilling your folks might help however, I myself, have not had any luck convincing anyone I know.  I'm an older folk, but not too old.  I can still chop wood and carry water. I've been red-pilled to no end.

               I have a small solar system that I will be installing this spring if it ever stops raining or snowing where I live (they are chem spraying like crazy these days).  I've also discovered that you can heat a small greenhouse simply with 4 litre milk jugs, painted black.  They will provide enough heat in cool spring and fall.  I will look into the water heating for sure.

                They are chem trailing the fuck out of the town where I live as well, and is part of the reason I am going to stop going to college. Can you explain how to heat a small greenhouse with the milk jugs? Wont it heat itself? Why do you need to heat it more?

                 I live in a climate that is quite cool (cold), in the mountains and the greenhouse needs more heat at night.  This method will keep it warmer at night apparently.  The problem is is that they haven't stopped spraying and it has been raining and snowing literally for f*kg weeks and if it stops for a bit, then there's nothing but fog, so I haven't seen the sun for a long time to get the jugs warm.
