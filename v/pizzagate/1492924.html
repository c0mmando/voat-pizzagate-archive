             I was cautious and extremely suspicious of what I have heard before. I did not make any post about those ones because of distortions and static in the audio (the phone call one in the hall?).  This interview with Hannity was very clear to my ears as I was able to hear the subtle intonations and depth at the back of his throat.  You see, Australians speak in a nasally back of the throat style that has a particular characteristic. It is hard to pick it up unless you are used to hearing the person often. For whatever reason, Assange did not sound all there for whatever reason (maybe sick?) last time I heard his voice. This time though he sounds healthy and recharged.

              Thanks for the well thought out response. Is it possible that it is his voice but from previous recordings? I hope he is alive

            I made no claim if he is alive or dead. I have no way of knowing that. I also have no way of knowing if the audio is spliced, but no intelligent person can deny it is his own voice.

            It would be nice to see a live stream, to prove that he is not just alive but okay and safe. Russia is the "hacker," so JA should be set free. Why is this so hard to understand?

             That was not my point at all. You misunderstood me here. I do not believe that Russia did the hacking. It is clear that as Julian has said, there was a leak from an insider. I believe that Julian did us all a great favour by exposing the dirty shady dealings of Clinton and Podesta. I also have a strong suspicion that they are pushing for a war with Russia. Now, all I am saying is that the voice we heard was Julian Assange. It does not mean that they did not interfere with by manipulating it in some way.

              My point is that anyone who does believe Russia did the hacking (MSM &amp; Friends) has no reason to blame Assange in particular and keep him hiding. Obviously he is hiding more secularly than ever (if that is his voice), but why would he need to do this he is not culpable or believed culpable? The Russia claim should be an excuse for him to go free or at least make an appearance. I am beginning to believe that if we continue pizzagate pizzagate pizzagate there will be a war and no peaceful transfer of power, Congress will have to impreach. Comey is going to have to show grounds for impeachment. We'll see what happens with the EC votes soon. this is all speculation and i really have no clue what the future brings.

            God this sub has been taken over. No intelligent individual would put so much trust in an audio recording from the MSM after learning of pizzagate, especially when it is Assange, not to mention deny the technology exists. I spend all day listening to foreigners try and speak English as part of my job, and the voice of Assange in that interview is NOT natural, the intonation is NOT natural. They will drag this on forever so they don't have to admit he is dead, minimising exposure to WikiLeaks and the disgusting emails between the Pedopoliticians.

             Listen up, that is no doubt Julian Assange voice. However, I made no claim if he is alive or dead. I have no way of knowing that. I also have no way of knowing if the audio is spliced, but no intelligent person can deny it is his own voice.

            I know Assange's voice very well and it was him. I'm an expert on English language intonation and the intonation was 100% Assange. I disagree very strongly with those who think technology has reached the level of being able to simulate someone's voice perfectly. It hasn't.

             You know that video where someone was simulating another person using their face was creep af. Thankfully, we are probably some years away from that. I have to say our paranoia level is reaching the ceiling.

            Fellow Aussie here and I concur that is the voice of Julian Assange. My brother (5th generation Australian) has a distinctly similar voice. He like Assange is educated and has spent most of his life in England and on the continent. His accent is distinctly 'educated/intelligent' Australian. All 'reports' that Julian Assange is 'missing' are therefore erroneous.

             Yeah we have people here that keep screaming "fake" etc, that is just misleading and wasting energy. One thing I would say to people is that it is good to be skeptical but sometimes it can also be just as blinding.
