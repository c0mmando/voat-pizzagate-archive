            While I see the "art" argument in that masturbation takes place at young ages, and there are always those stories about how women "feel" riding a horse or a Harley, it is hard not to see the exploitation aspect with rehearsing the scene, the stunned collapse after orgasm (was the child actor told to act like she saw someone being killed in the TV Western playing before her and pass out? they should not have told her to "act like you are having an orgasm")...but how could the kids not have known what the scene meant to adults? And as the youtube commenter states, the second 7 year old looks like Jon Benet Ramsey with the same hair and makeup. Another commenter says these girls were probably "passed around" at the movie's "wrap party." Maybe its adults being involved that make it inherently exploitative. Then there is digital media and commercialization making it that much worse.

             That video clip makes it clear that it's about being a precurser to soft child porn imo.  No art argument in my mind at all.  This scene was geared toward adults getting aroused over kids getting aroused.  It's even worse, the younger sister is clearly meant to look aroused over her older sister getting off.  At minimum the Director should be kicked in the nuts for creating this shit.  It would be interesting as to what BS the subtitles meant.   But you did get to the heart of the issue overall.

             It's about the adults.  Whether kids masturbate has never been the issue imo, it's about the adults getting involved in it.  The movie is sexually themed, in all likely hood intended to arouse adults (I haven't seen it).  So depicting kids in a state of sexual arousal is part of normalizing/and or grooming ADULTS getting aroused by kids.  Perhaps the mother running into the room with a boa constrictor wrapped around her neck should be the real clue as to the meaning, the forbidden fruit.  Not for the kids (to stimulate themselves), but for adults doing it while watching the kids (or worse), where it's the kids that are the fruit.

              kestrel9 - I am for freedom of expression for the most part. I hadn't watched the clip to the part where the mother came in holding the snake. The snake may point to the girls being "forbidden fruit." But it can also mean sexuality itself being a fall from innocence. Whichever case, it is a negative, adult-created association. Masturbation is fine for kids as long as the adults stay the hell out of the way.  Remember it was not too long ago that religious leaders said that masturbation was a sin. It's a total mindfuck regarding a beautiful natural human behavior. But for all the reasons you and others have stated -- the Jon Ramsey Binet lookalike, the voyeurism, the bathing suit, the makeup, the snake, etc. -- the scene has more to do with encouraging adults to view children as sex objects than with natural child self exploration. I am not surprised that Netflix and YouTube are promoting this stuff while deplatforming political views that are against globalism, cultural relativism and child sex trafficking. I would say that in an explicitly sexual product made by adults for adults, the legal age of consent should be required for all participants. Those two young girls did not possess the maturity necessary to make an informed decision about their involvement.

            Any investigation of Netflix child porn content would lead right to Hussein who is now suggesting/approving content. Do it.

             I've seen an ad for another new show, "Sex Education" on Netflix. About minors, and sex of course. The whole thing reeks of pedophilia. Minor children should never be placed in, filmed, or even slightly insinuated participating in sexual behavior. Fuck you Netflix. You're next to go the way of Facebook, everyone will be such of you.

             I tended to believe that pedophiles pushed the normalization of child sexuality on a grand scale.  However, I just read an article outlining how Leftist revolutionary maggots in the 1960s included a push towards child sex as part of their official political philosophy, and political aspirations.  Over a few short decades they've managed to create a culture of child abuse and exploitation and a larger population of child predators and consumers of child porn.  The Leftist Revolutionary movement is a form of predatory, soul sucking EVIL, pretending to be 'enlightened'.  This is likely why Hussein and Biden think that their fondling young kids in front of the camera is okay. (Although Biden will fondle anything with a heartbeat).  See this for commentary about Netflix
