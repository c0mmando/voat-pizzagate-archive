<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE EPSTEIN &amp; MAR-A-LAGO CONNECTION</strong></p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly denied his connections to billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, despite the extensive history between the two. Trump <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-billionaire-pedophile-who-could-bring-down-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton">regularly visited</a> Epstein\'s Upper East Side home, and Epstein had 14 different private numbers for Trump and his family in his little black book. Epstein also <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/09/the-friendship-between-trump-and-a-billionaire-pedophile-that-nobody-wants-to-talk-about/">chose to exercise the Fifth Amendment</a> when asked if he had ever socialized with Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18. Epstein\'s house manager <a href="http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/national-govt--politics/will-president-trump-used-witness-sex-offender-epstein-case/YijRjaz87dDMiV18TGeDAN/">Juan Alessi said that Trump even ate in Epstein\'s Palm Beach home</a>.</p>
<p>Mark Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein\'s brother, <a href="http://lawnewz.com/uncategorized/president-trump-on-witness-list-in-case-involving-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/">testified that Trump flew on the Lolita Express</a>. Trump also said about Epstein: “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>
<p>In a suit, Jane Doe alleged that <a href="http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-accuser-raped-13/">Trump raped her</a> in Epstein\'s Wexner Mansion when she was 13 years old. She also claims that, immediately following the rape, Donald Trump threatened that if she told anyone about the rape, he would physically harm – if not kill – her and her family.</p>
<p>Virginia Giuffre filed a civil suit against Jeffrey Epstein that alleges that <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2017/05/sex-slavery-lawsuit-links-trumps-mar-a-lago-to-pedophile-ring-report/">she was working at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago resort</a> when she was coerced by <a href="http://pagesix.com/2016/03/17/alleged-epstein-madam-forced-to-hand-over-17-years-of-documents/">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>  to work for Epstein as a sex slave.</p>
<p>Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago resort and Epstein\'s mansion are only 10 minutes away from each other: <a href="https://fitzinfo.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/trump-and-epstein-palm-beach.jpg">Map</a></p>

<p><strong>TRUMP\'S SEXUAL COMMENTS</strong></p>
<p>“You know I moved on her actually”, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html">Trump told Access Hollywood’s Billy Bush</a>. </p>
<p>Also during this interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You know she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed. I’ll admit it.”</p>
<p>“I did try and fuck her. She was married.”</p>
<p>“You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”</p>
<p>“Grab \'em by the pussy. You can do anything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-baby-daughter-comment-2016-4">Trump one time discussed the potential breast size of his then infant daughter Tiffany</a>. “Well, I think that she\'s got a lot of Marla, she\'s a really beautiful baby, and she\'s, uh, she\'s got Marla\'s legs. We don\'t know whether or not she\'s got this part yet,&quot; Trump said in the old clip, motioning to his chest, &quot;but time will tell.&quot;</p>
<p>Trump <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3835421/Donald-Trump-s-sleazy-comment-ten-year-old-girl-visited-Trump-Tower-revealed-latest-hot-mic-video-surface.html">also said</a> “I\'m going to be dating her in ten years. Can you believe it?” in reference to a ten-year-old girl. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IVANKA</strong></p>
<p>Trump has a history of making <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2016/10/08/grotesque-history-donald-trumps-sexual-comments-daughter.html">sexual comments</a> about his daughter:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ivanka was asked, &quot;What\'s the biggest thing you have in common with your father?&quot; Ivanka answered real estate or golf. Donald Trump said &quot;sex.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody. And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She’s six feet tall, she’s got the best body.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In September 2004, Howard Stern asked Trump if he could call Trump’s daughter Ivanka “a piece of ass.” And yes, Trump said that was OK, that Stern could refer to his daughter as “a piece of ass.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I’ve said that if Ivanka weren’t my daughter perhaps I’d be dating her.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Yeah, she’s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father…”</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/upload_images/trump_daughter-ivanka_creepy_01.jpg">another picture</a> of Ivanka sitting in her father\'s lap; notice they are sitting right next to what appears to be a statue of two parrots mating.</p>

<p><strong>JOHN CASABLANCAS, ELITE MODEL MANAGEMENT,  AND A LINK BACK TO EPSTEIN</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Model_Management">Elite Model Management</a> was founded in Paris in 1972 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Casablancas">John Casablancas</a>. Since it\'s opening, it has been plagued with scandals.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=VeUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=john+casablancas+girl+crazy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UFvNFKwwSJ&amp;sig=NMt24z8tHl-02wav2GHxtWoZkiI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3IL-gcfPAhWE4D4KHYwNARQQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20casablancas%20girl%20crazy&amp;f=false">An article</a> written about John Casablancas is entitled <em>Girl Crazy</em> and talks about his love of young “women”.</p>
<p>In 2003, Beverly Hills lawyer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Boucher">Raymond Boucher</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0609/066.html">filed a lawsuit</a> against Elite Model Management. His client is a former fashion model who claims John Casablancas impregnated her 15 years ago when she was a teenager.</p>
<p>Head of Elite paris, Gerald Marie, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/fashion-scandal-agency-exposed-on-tv-say-bbc-film-was-rigged-1125517.html">resigned amid public outrage</a> after he was caught on camera trying to give a 15-year-old model £300 for sex, and bragging of how many entrants to the Elite Model Look competition — average age 15 — he was going to sleep with that year.</p>
<p>Karen Mulder was a model with Elite who <a href="http://jezebel.com/5304706/modeling-and-the-tragedy-of-karen-mulder">tried to commit suicide</a> after making many serious allegations, including that Elite had used her and other models as sex slaves in <em>a ring that extended through the top echelons of French society, implicating politicians, members of the police, and other top officials</em>. These statements, made during an interview, were regarded as so potentially libelous that France 2 never aired the segment and <em>destroyed</em> the master tape. Her suicide attempt, made after her allegations, also came after she was packed off to Montsouris hospital and heavily sedated for five months of treatment for depression and anxiety. (Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris and one of the men Mulder had accused of raping her, paid.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Campbell">Naomi Campbell</a>\'s career <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1454418/Fashion-world-shaken-as-top-New-York-model-agency-faces-ruin.html">was launched by Elite</a>. <em>She was also listed <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/10/09/the-sex-slave-scandal-that-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/">on Epstein\'s flight logs</a>.</em></p>
<p>Back to Trump...
Not only was John Casablancas <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/19/business/trump-takes-a-meeting-now-backs-a-resort-in-brazil.html">on the board at Trump Realty Brazil</a>, but <em>Ivanka\'s first modeling contract was with Elite Model Management</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/style/her-cheekbones-high-or-her-name-trump.html">From the <em>New York Times</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that Monica Pillard, the president of Elite, had been eyeing Ivanka since she spotted her on her father\'s lap four years ago, when Mr. Trump was a judge of a new-talent contest for the agency. Mr. Trump and Elite have a longstanding, informal relationship. Ms. Pillard served as a judge in the Miss Universe pageant, which is jointly owned by Mr. Trump and CBS, as is the Miss Teen USA pageant. John Casablancas, Elite\'s founder, is a friend of Mr. Trump\'s, and Elite has held events at Trump Tower in Manhattan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elite\'s scandals were widely publicized, and (especially considering their extensive relationship) Trump must have known about Elite\'s and Casablancas\' shady dealings. Not only did Trump continue to have a relationship with Casablancas, he allowed his 15-year-old daughter to sign her first modeling contract there.</p>

             In September 2004, Howard Stern asked Trump if he could call Trump’s daughter Ivanka “a piece of ass.” And yes, Trump said that was OK, that Stern could refer to his daughter as “a piece of ass.”

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            It seems that Monica Pillard, the president of Elite, had been eyeing Ivanka since she spotted her on her father's lap four years ago, when Mr. Trump was a judge of a new-talent contest for the agency. Mr. Trump and Elite have a longstanding, informal relationship. Ms. Pillard served as a judge in the Miss Universe pageant, which is jointly owned by Mr. Trump and CBS, as is the Miss Teen USA pageant. John Casablancas, Elite's founder, is a friend of Mr. Trump's, and Elite has held events at Trump Tower in Manhattan.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Elite's scandals were widely publicized, and (especially considering their extensive relationship) Trump must have known about Elite's and Casablancas' shady dealings. Not only did Trump continue to have a relationship with Casablancas, he allowed his 15-year-old daughter to sign her first modeling contract there.

             I’m starting to think that Pizzagate is a limited hangout designed to steer eyes away from other, more important/dangerous/secretive operations. Sort of like knowing a flood is coming and trying to divert the water away from certain things (that was the best analogy I could think of, rofl). I believe that one cannot reach beyond a certain level in life (be it in fame, riches, politics, etc.) without being compromised in some way.

            This thread is undeniably important and highly underrated,  especially in this current environment of partisan bullshit.  I'm amazed that after so many years of being deceived by these two corrupt parties that any of you still think there's any hope that they're not all controlled.  And to think this lump of shit is any different.  This platform can be as pro trump as it wants to,  but it's only blind delusion for a man that knows he's got to pull us into another world war.  You trumptards are pathetic,  just as much as you retarded clinton supporters.

              It’s so funny to see people talk about how brainwashed other people are, but then those same people dismiss sign after sign of Trump’s bullshit. Allegations against Bill Clinton/Podesta/etc. weigh more than they do against Trump. But why? Until people realize the level of their own hypocrisy/confirmation bias and actually get it, I’m afraid the world is headed for the shitter.

             The thing I started to notice is that people are quick to make excuses for Trump, but if these same connections were found for Podesta or Clinton, people would be all over it. The bipartisan stuff is bs and people need to take their rose-colored glasses off.
