<p>but there\'s so much more </p>
<p>Eventually the time came when Raniere wanted to prey on Salzman’s two young daughters. How he pulled it off is classic Raniere.</p>
<p>Ex-NXIVM member, Becca Friedman recalled:</p>
<p>“During a seminar [for women] Nancy Salzman talked about how men [fathers] become attracted to their daughters when they hit teenage-hood, because the kids look so much like their mothers. This was totally disgusting and really turned a lot of people off. Most of us could not understand what she was talking about, why and what it had to do with feeling empowered as a woman.”</p>
<p>Salzman spoke about this father-to-daughter attraction at the seminar because Raniere introduced the concept to her, most likely in order to accomplish his own plan to sleep with Salzman’s daughters.</p>
<p>Here is how I think he worked it: Raniere tells Salzman that fathers are attracted sexually to their daughters because it reminds them of their wife when the father first met her and fell in love. A mother should be flattered, Raniere says, and not have conventional, unenlightened disdain for this ‘normal,’ incestuous attraction.</p>
<p>Ex harem member, Toni Natalie recalled that Raniere was not opposed to incest.</p>
<p>The Albany Times Union wrote, “When [Natalie’s] conservative Catholic upbringing made her reluctant to engage in oral sex [with Raniere], she was invited to attend a class Raniere created on the subject. She said he told the students, including Natalie, that mothers in some developing nations perform oral sex on their children to soothe them. She suspects the class was organized just for her.”</p>
<p>Another ex-harem member told me that Raniere did not organize the class for Natalie but taught this tribal mother – son oral sex concept before and after and that Raniere teaches that sex with children is acceptable as long as there is no pain involved</p>
<p>Raniere also practiced what he preached. Several women who are now adults have publicly claimed that Raniere had sex with them when they were under the age of consent</p>
<p>A harem member who fled and returned to her homeland told me that Raniere, “tells women that sex is an opportunity for him to teach in a way that words won’t. The women have to come to believe he is doing them a great spiritual favor when he has sex with them.”</p>
<p>Several harem women told me that Salzman handed her daughters to Raniere to be taught this way</p>
<p>If true, this shows how Raniere used his connivance skills to persuade a mother he was/is sleeping with to approve and encourage sleeping with her own daughters</p>
<p>Women I spoke to point out an even darker side to Raniere. They allege he tells women he has supernatural powers to trick them into sex; that he has slept with illegal Mexicans under the age of consent [Mexico’s age of consent is 12]; that Raniere had an underage Mexican boy film him having sex with the boy’s sisters</p>
<p>Raniere is proof that you can buy you own lifestyle, crook the courts, and spend and control millions in America without paying a dime in taxes and no law enforcement agency is going to take you down.</p>
<p>There’s something worse, though. Not only is he immune from prosecution, he directs prosecution anywhere he likes. He has had most of his enemies, including harem members who left him, indicted on trumped up charges. It has cost him millions to do it, but he has millions at his disposal.</p>
<p>a lot of info can be found in this 11th part of this series </p>
<p>there are pictures of the women in his &quot; harem&quot;</p>

<p>Do not pedophiles get close to the Mothers to get to her children?</p>

            Since this is safe for work, can someone go to work on Monday and spread it far and wide? I was also wondering how single males can identify and avoid ex cult members.

            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So this would mean he raped children younger than 12, and also let a child rape his sisters and produce child porn.

            On a side note. One of the DoS women claimed 'The Vanguard' took her to some isolated cabin, blindfolded I recall, but then some other guy raped her. I remember reading this recently.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm speculating if this other guy could even be potentially someone outside the organization. He could offer his harem to others in this way. That would be a way to blackmail control some pervert, or potentially be a quid pro quo situation to get them to do something for Raniere.

            This Frank Parlato article, from February 2016, certainly fleshes out the child trafficking allegations. I feel like I've seen at least parts of it before, but it must not have sunk in. Thanks for posting!
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course you cut &amp; pasted portions, rather than the whole thing, but I found this omitted part interesting also. Italics indicate a section already quoted above, bold interesting allegations:
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <em>
             that Raniere had an underage Mexican boy film him having sex with the boy’s sisters
            </em>
            ; that sleeping with lesbians is a trophy accomplishment; that from ‘guilting’ her, he sexually enslaved Clare Bronfman;
            <strong>
             he sexually enslaved a woman whose rich and well known husband impotently watches and donates millions to Raniere
            </strong>
            ; four well known TV actresses – his students – have been favored by being allowed to come into his bedroom for special teaching sessions; a third Fernandez sister, Daniela, refused to cooperate with Raniere’s sexual plans and illegal computer hacking, and
            <strong>
             was imprisoned in a house owned by NXIVM. After more than a year she escaped
            </strong>
            and left her two sisters in Raniere’s harem and returned to Mexico; and finally and saddest, that
            <strong>
             he encouraged two women to commit suicide and they did
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Normally the type of allegations made against Raniere by these women who were close to him would initiate an arrest or commitment to an asylum. But Raniere is said to have control of Clare Bronfman’s money – which makes him a very rich man [
            <strong>
             and now control of the husband-millionaire of one of his sex devotees
            </strong>
            ] – and
            <strong>
             he has no problem paying top lawyers, offering money through his harem to elected officials and making job offers to government prosecutors at salaries that dwarf what they make as public servants
            </strong>
            ."
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we know who this millionaire cuckold is that he controls?

             There is a whole organization of men/husbands, run by Raniere also - unfortunately, I don't recall the name at present, you'll find it on the Frank Report pages. It's a 'secret' men's club, Raniere taught them that humiliating women is essential.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems that the husbands of Raniere's harem have been members there.
