<p>==========</p>
<p>But the way Obama won the senate seat is just as damning. Rep opponent Jack Ryan was a shoe-in and then comes the blackmail and sleaze! Somebody dug into Ryan\'s divorce proceedings and there was his wife alleging he visited kinky sex clubs in Paris, NYC, and New Orleans. </p>
<p>Wow, blackmail comes in handy, doesn\'t it? </p>
<p>Here\'s an old news story on it. You\'re gonna love how this was done: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Illinois,_2004">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Illinois,_2004</a></p>
<p>State Senator Barack Obama won the Democratic primary and Jack Ryan won the Republican primary. Three months later, Ryan announced his withdrawal from the race four days after the Chicago Tribune persuaded a California court to release child custody records.</p>
<p>Six weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat Alan Keyes to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. The election was the first for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were African American. Obama\'s 43% margin of victory was the largest in the state history of U.S. Senate elections. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections – $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes – is also among the largest in history in both absolute and relative terms.[1]</p>

<p>Here\'s that key part again: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>the Chicago Tribune persuaded a California court to release child custody records.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>California again! The courts in California are dirty, dirty, dirty. Now you know why The Cannibal Elite got and maintains such a stranglehold on that state. </p>
<p>And look at the money poured into The Kenyan\'s campaign!!! FOURTEEN MILLION compared to TWO-AND-A-HALF-MILLION by Keyes. Keyes was the incumbent so where did a novice get FOURTEEN MILLION from? Somebody must have thought it was imperative that Obama win that seat. </p>
<p>And to do anything to make sure it was his.</p>
<p>========</p>
<p>Edit: Actually now that I\'m thinking about this, the money Alwaleed was alleged to have spent on The Kenya does come into play. Is finding out about Obama part of what is happenng in SA? I\'ve theorized that the Crown Prince is extracting intel and working with our POTUS. Here\'s a link to one of the several submissions made on the subject: </p>

            Some people are not noticing that Pizzagate is morphing into the theatrics of Russiagate. The way we can see this is that Republicans associated with the pedophile network are not suffering the same unfortunate political fates as Democrats.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Republican vs Democrat turfwar is not about taking out a pedophilia blackmail ring, it is about pigs jockeying for better positions at the taxpayer money trough. Pedophilia has yet to enter the equation because "The Storm" is not about taking out the pedophile blackmail ring. Its about Russiagate, Obamagate, etc....
           </p>
           <p>
            Its dragging Pizzagate into the swamp and diluting our message of pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophiles, Republican and Democrat alike, are rejoicing. Suddenly pedophilia is only a Democrat problem, and no Democrats are going to jail for pedophilia. The subject of pedophilia is slowly sliding off the map.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until the most famous and powerful people in the world, politicians and billionaires, are publicly outed for pedophilia, all else is noise. They are still protecting themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its not lost on me that Republicans directly involved in Pizzagate are not suffering the same fate as democrats. The reason for that is obvious, its a turf war between two factions of the D.C. swamp.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish people would notice. If this keeps up EVERYTHING that happens in D.C. will be pizzagate related and this forum will look the front page of a political news site.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because some people have taken the bait that this political battle between the Republicans and the Democrats is all about pizzagate does not make it true.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish it was but it isn't.  Just a difference in perception.

             All I want is THAT LIST of sexual pay-offs to see if they are pedogate related!!  If so, wahoo thats the springboard to jailing the lot of them!  I agree ESOTERICshade you are 100% true, sexual predators have no political boundaries, scum is scum, they both do it and both blackmail.  The world will be a much better, safer place for our children when they are locked up or 6 feet under.
