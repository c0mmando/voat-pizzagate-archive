            Well I certainly didn't mean to offend any well intentioned individuals. There are different philosophies out there...that people choose to follow......even atheists and Satan worshipers have a philosophy and they may even get angry when their beliefs are challenged. I think that if a philosophy is worthy then it should stand up to close scrutiny. I think we're all on the same page here on this forum against pedophilia and that was the only point I want to make. However I did study the verses I mentioned and I read them over and over and I just couldn't come to terms with the excuses given. For me the arguments don't hold water. There also seems to be an allowance for bestiality in Islam which I find also particularly disturbing.  For me I have decided to follow Jesus Christ. When I heard the words he spoke I know they were truth. Words of peace, love, and brotherhood and the example of himself that he presented convinced me. If you give it a chance I think you would come to the same conclusion. For me it has made all the difference.

            The Vatican City has an age of consent...and it's 14. Firstly, why the fuck does the Vatican City need age of consent if the priests and Pope are celibate? But secondly, that was only recent it was raised to 14, from the age of 12!

            You should look more into the background of
            <em>
             Muhammad
            </em>
            and Islam - created by the Catholics and Vatican City. Catholicism and Islam have very un nerving similarities. It wasn't look ago that a lot of Christian woman wore head dresses. Nuns wore full face coverings. Their is definitely an Islamic agenda going on.
