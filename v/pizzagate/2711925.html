            The Vatican is one of the owners of the IRS along with the International bankers led by Rothschild and the British Crown. They are the controllers that governments work for. Our government was dissolved march 9th, 1933 via the emergency banking act. Our national parks were given to the United Nations through the Unesco scam. All nature preserves are given to the UN and are no long our property. The government then surrendered their gold to the international bankers, and they collateralized the citizens by giving us a social security number and making us corporate fiction by putting our birth certificates in all capital letters. The Vatican and the International bankers cannot be touched, our government is paid by them. Remember, the controllers pay the politicians, not the citizens. Income tax goes to the private IRS. they pocket all except what they put aside to pay tax refunds, pay government officials and fund the IRS. Trump is the CEO of USA INC, he is theirs and our government is a corporation. No, the Vatican is not in danger of ever facing justice. No they don't punish their minions for their PG work.

            , diplomatic immunity sheltering pedos is a huge problem that is by no means limited to the Vatican. Saudi Arabia, Israel, members of the EU have all abused this aspect of international law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone ought to do a thread on the development of diplomatic immunity, rounding up all the times we've documented that pedos have used it to their advantage, and analyze how this fits in with the advance of the globalist agenda post WWI or II. I'd be willing to bet it would show that the elite developed it as a way to gaurd their deviant playground, just like Hollywood making all those tv shows with child actors they could prey on.
