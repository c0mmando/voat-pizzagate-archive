            The first documented evidence of sexual depravity and child sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church was in the 4th Century. 1700 years ago.

            Always with the nuns.  My grandparents went to an Irish school and were treated terribly.  My grandfather went to The Brothers Christian (even that name sounds fucked up) and was beaten mercilessly and he was a A CHILD.  They just do what they want in Ireland.  I know this isn’t about Ireland directly but you know.   I’m not sure why these people are “doing God’s Work” and abusing children at the same time!!! 
I’d love to get my hands on the nuns who hurt my grandfather.   They messed his fucking head up for life.

             Funny how they all know the church is broken but still think "not me, I've been taught the TRUE form of Christianity". If the head is rotten, the rest of the body isn't going to function as it should either. No Christian/Catholic church is teaching information that hasn't been okay-ed by the powers that be, same as the public school system. Why is it so hard for them to consider they've been taught wrong about religion and spirituality as well? The brainwashing is strong.

             The majority of atheists are equally good goys and cucks, if not far worse. They're politically more left leaning and they attack the very abrahamic religion that they have the most things in common with in regards to culture and morality - while being mostly silent about another one slowly taking over. They also contributed the most for the west losing it's culture and identity replacing it with relativism.

             In the long run almost 90% catholic poland will likely fare better than the less religious parts of europe.

             Did you read the section where it says Mother Theresa did not like the laws of India !  She thought she was above the law.  Playing judge by deciding that single parents etc. were not good enough to adopt.

              I had heard that before.  She was a vile evil person.  The female version of jorge bergoglio.  That's why he liked her so much. Vile and Evil.  Same letters.  I hope she is shoveling coal down in the Fires of Hell.

            Possibly that charity shelter is a breeding farm if the baby was born there.  Mother Theresa was not anything like what we thought she was.  Much of the money donated to her cause never was spent on the poor.  Also the pope has supported them and the charity which should be a big tip off.  jorge bergoglio allowed many babies to leave the country and be given to others.  Why should he mind what they do at the charity. This is a horrid operation and I am sure has been going on for decades.  Another well known organization that is hurting Our Children

            Sister Norma Pimentel is rumored to be the next Mother Theresa and may be canonized as well.  More bad news for immigrants.
