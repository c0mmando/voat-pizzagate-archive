<h1>On podcast, Preet Bharara gives new details on why Donald Trump fired him</h1>
<p>Washington (CNN)Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York who President Donald Trump fired just three months into his presidency, says he believes that if he had stayed Trump would have asked him &quot;to do something inappropriate.&quot;
&quot;I will tell you one thing, now that it\'s been some months. I believe based on the information that we have on the president talking to Jim Comey relating to Michael Flynn, the information about the president talking to Jeff Sessions about the case of Joe Arpaio, and how he wanted both of those cases to go away -- that had I not been fired, and had Donald Trump continued to cultivate a direct personal relationship with me, it\'s my strong belief that at some point, given the history, the President of the United States would have asked me to do something inappropriate,&quot; Preet said on the first episode of his new podcast &quot;Stay Tuned with Preet.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holy fucking shit! The guy is PSYCHIC!!!! He knew what Trump was going to do before he did it -- and don\'t you know it was going to be a CRIME!!!! Does this has overtones of Judge Dredd? In fact, I think WaPo should use this \'\'PSYCHIC DEFENSE\'\' for the FBI planting spies and wiretapping our POTUS!!!! They could say they \'\'ANTICIPATED\'\' he would collude with Russia!!! </p>
<p>Oh, but there\'s more:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>On Wednesday, it was announced that Bharara had been hired as a senior legal analyst at CNN.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course! Why wouldn\'t he be scooped up by CNN, the fake news channel? I\'ll bet he\'ll handle the Precognition Desk!</p>
<p>But there\'s more! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bharara added that he still doesn\'t know why he was fired by Trump in March. He was known as one of Wall Street\'s fiercest watchdogs and a widely respected prosecutor.</p>
<p>The interactions Bharara said he had with Trump started with a call from Democratic New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, his old boss, who called Bharara shortly after the election to tell him Trump wanted to keep him around.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Bharara said nothing &quot;inappropriate&quot; or &quot;untoward&quot; came up, including discussing the details of any ongoing cases. But something peculiar did happen: Trump requested Bharara\'s personal cell phone and office numbers.
&quot;It was odd, because as a general matter, Presidents don\'t speak directly to United States attorneys. It\'s unheard of in my experience,&quot; he said. &quot;You know the number of times President (Barack) Obama called me? Zero.&quot; ... </p>
<p>&quot;I have reason to believe later that nobody knew that Donald Trump was calling me from the Oval Office,&quot; Bharara said. &quot;I\'m not saying he was going to tell me to do something I shouldn\'t do, but I thought even the phone call was a problem.&quot;
Bharara said he mulled over how to react to the call. He considered having someone listen in to the call but said it didn\'t seem proper. He even considered recording the phone conversation but said he ultimately decided it was &quot;a bridge too far.&quot;
So instead, he decided to decline the call completely, and called back the President\'s office to let them know.
Less than 20 hours later, Bharara said, he was asked to resign.
Today, Bharara says he is still unsure why he was ultimately let go, along with 46 other US attorneys appointed under President Barack Obama -- especially since Trump had gone out of his way to let Bharara know he wanted to keep him.</p>

<p>In case you missed it: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>The interactions Bharara said he had with Trump started with a call from Democratic New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, his old boss,</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>SCHUMER WAS HIS OLD BOSS? And this guy was involved with being objective in prosecuting Anthony Weiner, CHUCK SCHUMER\'S PROTEGE? </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, nothing to see there! </p>
<p>Then the other rock falling: </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yup, our POTUS has been a busy boy!!!! FORTY-FREAKIN\'-SIX US ATTORNEYS ... BUH-BYE!!!! </p>
<p>Can\'t imagine why they were fired, can you? </p>
<p>As for this one, let me put it this way. </p>
<p>WEINER .... SCHUMER ... KNOWLEDGE OF NXIVM ...</p>
<p>How much did Schumer know and when did he know it? I think that\'s what we should be asking because you can bet he\'s involved up to his slimy eyeballs. How could he not have knowledge of NXIVM when the story broke in 2007?!!!! But back to Bharara, there\'s more regarding the NXIVM trial because of this ... I\'ll pose it in a Q style: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schneiderman down
Who will take his place? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I\'ll bite ... who? </p>
<p>PREET BHARARA!!!!</p>
<p>Yes, according to reports, he\'s under consideration!

<h1>A case of severe ‘Prosecutorial Misconduct’ and Preet Bharara</h1>
<p>Corruption at the highest levels of Obama’s DOJ</p>
<p>By Frank Dux </p>
<p>With former US Attorney for the Southern District of NY, Preet Bharara is said to be under consideration for the post of NY State Attorney General recently vacated by disgraced and abusive prosecutor  Eric Schneiderman,</p>
<p>Following the “Great Recession” in 2008, President Barack Obama’s Justice Department launched a concerted effort to go after “white collar” criminals.  Leading the effort was Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI’s New York Field Office.</p>
<p>Bharara’s high-profile investigations quickly earned him a reputation as “the scourge of Wall Street” and landed him  the cover story in Time Magazine as the “top cop busting Wall Street.”</p>
<p>Bharara also aggressively prosecuted political corruption in Albany winning convictions against assembly speaker Sheldon Silver and Republican Senate majority leader Dean Skelos–both of which were overturned. Silver was retried and convicted.</p>
<p>The ‘crime-busting” Bharara was hailed as a future Governor or US Attorney General. When fired by President Donald Trump Bharara attacked the President and signed a lucrative contract with CNN as a legal analyst.</p>
<p>But Bahara is neither the “White Knight” nor the “Mr. Clean” depicted by the media.</p>
<p>A closer look reveals that as a prosecutor Preet Bharara regularly broke the law and abused his power in order to convict innocent targets. This pattern includes knowing about and approving FBI leaks of grand jury testimony to the media and lying to a federal Judge about it, pressuring compromised witnesses into changing their story and lying, pressuring an exculpatory witness into pleading the fifth amendment, suppressing exculpatory evidence and violating the rights of the accused in order to maximize publicity for himself.</p>
<p>In other words, Preet Bharara regularly broke the law in order to convict innocent men of breaking the law. ...
* 
* In an effort to resuscitate what he described as a “dormant” investigation into Walters, Agent Chaves began leaking confidential information about the investigation to newspaper reporters.
* A March 29, 2015, article in the Wall Street Journal described such actions as “Mr. Bharara’s M.O,” noting that the U.S. Attorney, in earlier cases, had “exploited tools once reserved for the mafia or terrorists to go after white-collar crimes.”
* As subsequent articles explained, the leaks were a government tactic used in an effort to “scare (targets) into cooperating” through public exposure of the mere fact they were under investigation.
* The unauthorized leaks – including some “over dinner” – occurred between April 2013 and at least June 2014, and probably several years thereafter, and included secret grand jury and wiretap information.
* The leaked information, including secret grand jury information, was provided to reporters Matthew Goldstein and Ben Protess of the New York Times and Susan Pulliam and Michael Rothfeld of the Wall Street Journal.
....
Judge Andrew Napolitano has called the “most stunning case of prosecutorial misconduct I have ever seen”.</p>

            A case of severe ‘Prosecutorial Misconduct’ and Preet Bharara
           </h1>
           <p>
            Corruption at the highest levels of Obama’s DOJ
           </p>
           <p>
            By Frank Dux
           </p>
           <p>
            With former US Attorney for the Southern District of NY, Preet Bharara is said to be under consideration for the post of NY State Attorney General recently vacated by disgraced and abusive prosecutor  Eric Schneiderman,
           </p>
           <p>
            Following the “Great Recession” in 2008, President Barack Obama’s Justice Department launched a concerted effort to go after “white collar” criminals.  Leading the effort was Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI’s New York Field Office.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bharara’s high-profile investigations quickly earned him a reputation as “the scourge of Wall Street” and landed him  the cover story in Time Magazine as the “top cop busting Wall Street.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Bharara also aggressively prosecuted political corruption in Albany winning convictions against assembly speaker Sheldon Silver and Republican Senate majority leader Dean Skelos–both of which were overturned. Silver was retried and convicted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ‘crime-busting” Bharara was hailed as a future Governor or US Attorney General. When fired by President Donald Trump Bharara attacked the President and signed a lucrative contract with CNN as a legal analyst.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Bahara is neither the “White Knight” nor the “Mr. Clean” depicted by the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            A closer look reveals that as a prosecutor Preet Bharara regularly broke the law and abused his power in order to convict innocent targets. This pattern includes knowing about and approving FBI leaks of grand jury testimony to the media and lying to a federal Judge about it, pressuring compromised witnesses into changing their story and lying, pressuring an exculpatory witness into pleading the fifth amendment, suppressing exculpatory evidence and violating the rights of the accused in order to maximize publicity for himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words, Preet Bharara regularly broke the law in order to convict innocent men of breaking the law. ...
* 
* In an effort to resuscitate what he described as a “dormant” investigation into Walters, Agent Chaves began leaking confidential information about the investigation to newspaper reporters.
* A March 29, 2015, article in the Wall Street Journal described such actions as “Mr. Bharara’s M.O,” noting that the U.S. Attorney, in earlier cases, had “exploited tools once reserved for the mafia or terrorists to go after white-collar crimes.”
* As subsequent articles explained, the leaks were a government tactic used in an effort to “scare (targets) into cooperating” through public exposure of the mere fact they were under investigation.
* The unauthorized leaks – including some “over dinner” – occurred between April 2013 and at least June 2014, and probably several years thereafter, and included secret grand jury and wiretap information.
* The leaked information, including secret grand jury information, was provided to reporters Matthew Goldstein and Ben Protess of the New York Times and Susan Pulliam and Michael Rothfeld of the Wall Street Journal.
....
Judge Andrew Napolitano has called the “most stunning case of prosecutorial misconduct I have ever seen”.

                Source is not a good one. You have to wonder who takes the risk of purposely putting fake news out there though. I remember when the FCC was cracking down on cursing for fear of offending Christians. Bizzaro World live in we.

              Correct his bio claims all this experience in high profile NYC DA offices and LEO functions etc. Even Supreme Court stuff, ther eis nothing of him no photos no articles until sparsely recently...that is the way DEA Agent Mike Vigil  assumed an identity in the 80's 90's take two identities meld them fake SSN. Same with Donnie Brasco although his fake identity was bottom up fabricating all the records sheep dipping him in over a year.

              I found paydirt one way or the other and this Strang guy is kind of spooky if you know what I mean...his connection to this ghost Jeffrey J Mueller is very interesting, JJM's biography is almost intertwined with Strang and I've looked and looked but can't find shit on this Jeffrey J mueller guy. His "employment" record no articles not even as an ADA for Kings County NYC...this is fucking ridiculous. He must be one of the most private public figures or Strang is JJM and left a bread trail....which is freaking me the fuck out.

               No, I found the same thing when researching the Paul Mitchell mess. Believe the guy's name was Crowley. He'd set up something called The Windsong Trust. Anyway, it's worth millions and millions, and this guy's like a ghost. No footprint.

               I did eventually find a few really interesting things in following the grants, but I have more on the web about me than someone with a trust and that was a multimillionaire? Doubtful.

            I've been down this rabbit hole for nearly a decade. They haven't even begun to expose New York. It's nice to see more focus there as this is just the beginning. The whole laying the groundwork thing is a fact.

             I remember, over 20 years ago now, when stuff fell off cargo containers and ended up in dry containers in the back of famous shops next to asia town. Cheap high quality stuff. Has Babylon changed since? I ain't been back.

             They gutted New York like a fish and installed hand-picked puppets ... like Weiner. And the installation was mutli-layered, like having Baharara as a US Attorney that could be propped up as a governor or AG. God, I hate these fucking elites! They're more AI than anything. No soul, no heart, no compassion ... just relentless, unbridled greed and lust.

            We only know for sure so far that the NYPD had Weiners iphone (from sexting notoriety) but no evidence they also had a laptop
           </p>
           <p>
            Did Preet subpoena Weiner's files ?  Even if so, what does this mean precisely? did he seek a copy of the data in the iphone , or the hardware itself ? Even if we presume he did n good faith, it remains an iphone only, not evidence of NYPD having a LAPTOP
           </p>
           <p>
            do we have a copy of the Warrant in the format Honeybee showed us when the FBI took Weiner's laptop/ipad off Granite ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because, once again, if Granite had Weiners laptop - and that we appear to have IN EVIDENCE, not hearsay, it remains unclear / unproven if and when NYPD ever had any device other than the iphone   (unless perhaps he had 2 laptops)
           </p>
           <p>
            this remains an evidentiary link not substantiated beyond the Black (Eric) Prince's claim that spawned a million conspiracy theories about NYPD cops losing their lunch
           </p>
           <p>
            I will repeat the same request i have in half a dozen of these threads now
           </p>
           <p>
            CAN ANYONE PROVIDE INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE of the NYPD staff saying they have and are shocked by an insurance file THAT IS NOT A DERIVATIVE /downstream assertion of Eric Prince's otherwise unsubstantiated gossip?

             How do we know this?  The FBI seized three items from Weiner: an iPhone, an iPad and a Dell laptop.   That is from the warrant.
            </p>
            <p>
             We don't know that the NYPD ever even viewed these items let alone possessed them.

            <p>
             What's your source for the NYPD had Weiner's phone?

               A lot of people seem genuinely confused by this.  Some people have called me a liar because they seem not to understand this.  He plead guilty to a federal crime and the Feds got his devices not the NYPD.
              </p>
              <p>
               A local investigation started and a federal investigation started.  However the Feds issued a subpoena on the very day they opened case and they got the evidence.  And he plead guilty to Federal Charges.  The NYTimes and ProPublica/Newyorker both did big reviews of Comey reopening the Clinton email case.  This stories have way more details about what was going with Weiner's laptop.  The NYPD is never mentioned in either story.  I think there's no evidence the laptop ever left the FBI's possession.
              </p>
              <p>
               When Weiner plead guilty, the Justice Department's press release did thank the Special Victims Unit of the NYPD for their work, but it doesn't indicate what work they did and that is the only on the record evidence I know of of any NYPD invovlement in this case.
              </p>
              <p>
               I looked into this over a year ago and my conclusions from back then are proven this week.  The only thing I would change is to add the caveat I just mentioned about the press release.

                 Often times the unopened box is more interesting and more powerful than finding out what is actually in the box.

            What I love is how Voat has this small cult of anti Christians and then many of those people pretending NYC hasn't been corrupt as hell. We have long known where the problem lies. Let me "break this down" Barney Style for you - Synagogue&lt;Masonry/Cults&lt;Leftism&lt;Criminal Networks/Controlled Opposition And NYC is a haven for all that and then some....

            All of this story comes from one source Anthony Wiener and his gear. Now the chain of custody on 2 stories is fucked, and the FBI has lied through its teeth.

            <p>
             All you need do is look at who's elected to get an idea of what's going on. Like in California. Brown ... Governor? Yeah, HUGE problems! NY? Cuomo? Schneiderman ... deBlasio? Yeah, SWAMP!
            </p>
            <p>
             I think people are still stuck trying to rationalize the noble idea expressed rather than look at the criminality going on ... and the destruction of America. The cities under these leftists P'sOS are becoming shitholes. Drugs, crime, gangs, homeless, the mentally ill ... they're all combining ... then there's the lack of decent housing ... it's bad. At least now there's a resurgence of jobs. It's abating some of it, but in abating it, it's letting people still stay suckng on that blue pill.

            FBI informant tries to ENTRAP Trump pre-investigation Shame on you for letting this slide in less than 24 hours. The Obama Administration tried to institute one party rule using the intelligence agencies and only failed by a margin of 100,000 votes. This is the biggest threat to our Republic. Ever.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The New York Times has essentially outed the CIA and FBI informant as Stefan Halper tonight in yet another lengthy justification article citing the reasoning from the perspective of the corrupt intelligence officers who conducted the surveillance and spying operation against the Trump campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two things to remember: First, they denied all of this for eighteen months. Second, these are their leaks, their story, their version; delivered via their spin, from the people who were conducting the scheme against the Trump campaign:
            </p>
            <p>
             NYT: The informant, an American academic who teaches in Britain, made contact late that summer with one campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, according to people familiar with the matter. He also met repeatedly in the ensuing months with the other aide, Carter Page, who was also under F.B.I. scrutiny for his ties to Russia...
they took steps, those officials said, to ensure that details of the inquiry were more closely held than even in a typical national security investigation, including the use of the informant to suss out information from the unsuspecting targets...
The informant offered [to George Papadopoulos] a $3,000 honorarium for the paper and a paid trip to London, where the two could meet and discuss the research project.
Mr. Papadopoulos replied that he had no insight into the Russian campaign — despite being told months earlier that the Russians had dirt on Mrs. Clinton in the form of thousands of her emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             [Papadopoulos'] RESPONSE CLEARLY ANNOYED THE INFORMANT, WHO TRIED TO PRESS MR. PAPADOPOULOS ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT KNOW

            <p>
             Definitely, scummy all the way. But the biggest rebuttal to this narrative of the friendly-planted spy agents ''helping'' Trump will be the emails exchanged ... especially the ones between Strzok and Page. Remember that the rumor is some pretty unpleasant things were discussed re: Trump, and if there were a helpful vibe, some of the solutions proposed to the problem of Trump would not have been broached because there wouldn't have been a problem.

                I believe in infiltration and false masks for organizational disruption/inversion/control hence what i seen since growing up and the not so distant past. All the infiltration claims by the organixc groups pair together sometimes exact names.

                 Yes, organic groups. That's why the shell game and reinventing assets works so beautifully. It you just plunked a stranger down in a town where you lived, they'd have to start as a stranger and earn your trust and show what they could do. But if an organic group pushed and promoted this person, there you go! It's like creating a Twitter account and having 0 followers, or with the organic group's help, having 1 million.

              There's a lot of things wrong with your post starting with this.
             </p>
             <h1>
              Not the NYPD Attorney
             </h1>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The US Attorney That Subpoenaed Weiner's Electronics on Behalf of the NYPD was FIRED BY TRUMP
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The US Attorney is a federal position and works with the FBI.
             </p>
             <p>
              The chief prosecutor who would have worked with the NYPD would be the District Attorney which is a state/county level position. In this case it would have have been the Manhattan District Attorney, Cy Vance, Jr.  (Google him and Trump and you'll find some interesting stuff.)
             </p>
             <p>
              So if the laptop was subpoenaed on behalf of the NYPD, it would have been by Cy Vance, not Preet Bharara
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump can fire a US Attorney, Trump cannot fire a district Attorney.

             <p>
              Yeah, because Trump was trying to violate the principle of the Justice Department being independent of the White House and prosecutorial independence.   Prosecutors must avoid even the "appearance" of a conflict of interest and be indepenent of political interference.  Bharara mentioned this principle in his farewell statement: "One hallmark of justice is absolute independence."
             </p>
             <p>
              US Attorneys shouldn't be talking directly to anyone at the White House let alone the President. The President is supposed to go through official channels at the Department of Justice starting with the Attorney General. This discussions would be documented and known by several officials. He is not supposed to be having private, off the records conversations with US Attorneys.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just as it was improper for Trump to call Comey aside ask him if he could "let it go" with regard to the Flynn investigation.  It's improper for Trump to call Bharara privately. This is a giant, alarm bell ringing Red Flag in and of itself.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you go back to beginning on this Trump met with Bharara in Nov 2016 and asked him to stay on as US Attorney.  Then in March 2017, they announce all the US attorneys were being asked to resign.  This was a totally sketchy move, because while new administrations change US Attorneys, they don't do it all at once AND they don't do it without replacements in place because it has a big impacts on active cases.  So it was totally suspicious why they were doing it this way.
             </p>
             <p>
              Later it was discovered that
              <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-personal-lawyer-boasted-that-he-got-preet-bharara-fired">
               Trump's personal attorney was boasting he got Bharara fired.
              </a>
              .  Why would Trump's personal attorney be involved?  Well, Bharara was the US Attorney for Manhattan, where Trump lived and worked. Any crimes that predated Trump being president could be prosecute here.   Notice that nobody is too concerned about the  US Attorney for Brooklyn or Albany or Buffalo.   To underline this point, Michael Cohen the President's long time lawyer is currently under investigation in the Southern District of NY, Preet Bharara would be the US Attorney in charge of that investigation if Trump didn't fire him.
             </p>
             <h1>
              Frank Dux ?
             </h1>
             <p>
              I don't know who Frank Dux is or why you put some much credence in him, but I would check his claims vs the actual facts in the case.  He's not an original source nor an unbiased source.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do know that Bharara was pretty well respected at the time he left office.  He went after Wall Street and White Collar criminals and prosecuted Democrats and Republicans for political corruption.

              Yes. Clearly schumer cuomo and deblasio compromised / heavily involved.  50% of nypd was compromised.  Teenagers or runaways at pt authority, gwb, train, taken by the wrong police and thats it.

                MS-13 is absolutely very big in NYC.   Where are you getting that from?  I literally have never heard that
               </p>
               <p>
                The violent crime rate in NYC has been dropping for 27 straight years....that goes back to Mayor Dinkins.
               </p>
               <p>
                Last year the murder rate was the lowest since they have accurate records.  You have to be about 70 years old to have lived through a safer time in NYC.
