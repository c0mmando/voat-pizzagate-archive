             All these weird characters are....they are to strange not to be..they cant do anything but go along with the life that has been made for them. Most of the boys are "gay" now if you haven't noticed. Its not just a coincidence that a lot of these pizza shops are ran/owned by gay men. The pizza shop in Austin, along with several more.  Most have been rewarded for the horrible life they have been given, so they also can still control them when they need to use them.

            Wait, I missed something...Barbara Bush is a relative of Crowley's? I just shit my pants. Can you point me to that Voat thread? Thank God all of you guys are on this...I'm truly thankful for all of the connections that everyone is making. I think many of the elites are shitting their pants, too, and I love it!

             There is some speculation that this is so, but this is by no means established. See, for instance:
