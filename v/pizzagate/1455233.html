I believe we are witnessing a titantic shift in how actual news and events are reported to our fellow citizens.  I am not an attorney but I think we have enough evidence to charge Tony Podesta and James Alefantis as being in violation of VA 18.2-371 or Contributing To The Deliquency of a Minor.  I think that posting lewd photographs of children may indeed cause said child to be in need of services and it most definitely constitutes abuse.  Connecting dot\'s and digging for more evidence for the bigger picture, i.e. organized crime; money laundering; child trafficking; bribery, etc. is important.  However, let\'s not forget that it\'s the small statutes that have taken down the bigger criminals and their respective criminal organizations.  I know in my part of VA High School kids can get in some serious trouble for &quot;sexting&quot; and sharing lewd photographs. In addition to Alefantis\'s Instagram photo\'s there is a WAPO article which states that Tony Podesta displayed photographs of nude teenagers in his home.  Where does Alefantis reside?  I will attach the statute.

            Here is another statute.  I believe that a case can be made that Instagram (Social Media) is a form of advertising.  Please see the clause towards the end of this regarding "Consent for a minor": A person may not use a minor’s right of publicity without written consent from the minor’s parent or guardian (Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-40(A) (2011)).

            I saw an article which stated that Podesta now lives in DC (and the NYT article referenced Obama moving in next door and that per "Pod-molesta" the 2 were going to have "backyard pizzza parties).  Alefantis grew up in Mclean, VA I think?  Someone with a legal and/or law enforcement background needs to find the statute.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a DC statute which might work and then if Alefantis/Podesta are found guilty they then might be guilty of DC's law for Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor.
