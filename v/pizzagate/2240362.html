<p>Guillod, whose major work includes films such as Atomic Blonde and Ted, stepped down as the co-CEO of the Primary Wave entertainment company last week, after being accused of sexually assaulting actress Jessica Barth in 2012.</p>
<p>Now three more women have come forward to accuse him of rape, including an assistant who claims Guillod picked her up during a company retreat and raped her. Two other women claim they were drugged and woke up covered in blood.</p>

             Have no idea! And note that the rape was reported and the police are "STILL INVESTIGATING"?!!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Seriously, how can they say that with a straight face?!!! Well, now that it's out, maybe ... just maybe these scumbags will be arrested!
            </p>
            <p>
             As to why ANYONE would think they could get away with this behavior, all I can say that it's proof of a very big, very sinister cabal!
