<p>What do you call this predictive programming? I Call it creepy and depraved. Especially that last phrase &quot;let\'s end it&quot;.  We have a saying in my culture there you say the dog tracks got all mixed up what is the horse tracks, it is like that you don\'t know anymore who is who. Is it just an innocent song? Or is there much more to it?</p>
<p>It has been around for sometime you can see from this video
