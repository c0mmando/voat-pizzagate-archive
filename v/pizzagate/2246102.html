<p><strong>Senator Al Franken Kissed and Groped Me Without My Consent, And There’s Nothing Funny About It</strong>
<a href="http://www.kabc.com/2017/11/16/leeann-tweeden-on-senator-al-franken/">http://www.kabc.com/2017/11/16/leeann-tweeden-on-senator-al-franken/</a></p>
<p>Mods, this is clearly Pizzagate-related because Pizzagate involves the &quot;elite&quot; hypocrites in our government, and Al Franken is one of the most outspoken among them. Before he became the hypocritical moral compass of the Senate, for example, Franken joked about child rape at a Comedy Central event held in 2000. The video of Franken making his sick child rape “joke” can be seen here: <a href="https://youtu.be/nfkePDpZtVYYouTube">https://youtu.be/nfkePDpZtVYYouTube</a></p>
<p>Moreover, we know Franken is a sexually-focused hypocrite. Don’t believe me? Just read this story published in The Harvard Crimson in 1976(<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/4/16/live-from-new-york-its-al/">http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/4/16/live-from-new-york-its-al/))</a>)). Here, according to the story, the hypocritical Franken:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“recalled writing a skit called SEAMEN ON BROADWAY that was rejected from the Hasty Pudding show &quot;by some preppie so they could take some other preppie\'s skit.&quot; Franken started to smile again, but his tone was serious, too serious. &quot;It\'s not preppies, cause I\'m a preppie myself. I just don\'t like homosexuals. If you ask me, they\'re all homosexuals in the Pudding. Hey, I was glad when that Pudding homosexual got killed in Philadelphia.&quot; The smile became so broad it pushed his eyes shut. He couldn\'t stand it any longer. &quot;Put that in, put that in,&quot; Franken laughed, leaning over the desk. &quot;I\'d love to see that in The Crimson.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decades after revealing his vile, homophobic self, Franken morphed into a purported “champion” of gay rights in his role as outspoken Senator.</p>
<p>Speaking of politicians, we recently learned that known pedophile Harvey Weinstein was one of Al Franken’s political supporters: <a href="http://people.com/politics/harvey-weinstein-political-ties-steve-bannon-hillary-clinton-barack-obama/">http://people.com/politics/harvey-weinstein-political-ties-steve-bannon-hillary-clinton-barack-obama/</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, I think this story (with its image of Franken’s paws on Ms. Tweeden’s chest) has value in confirming the Pizzagate premise. A culture of depravity and moral bankruptcy exists in the United States, wherein pedophilia and sexual abuse by those in power can thrive. This culture pervades the elite circles of power in America and must be exposed.</p>
<p>In addition, this is Pizzagate-related because Al Franken runs with the pack of pedos we\'ve already linked the Pizzagate scandal. Here is a story from 2009 (found here: <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2009/02/05/media-matters-party/">http://washingtonlife.com/2009/02/05/media-matters-party/))</a>)) describing and depicting images taken at a party thrown at the Hirshhorn Museam [Cripes, it’s always a museum]. The story says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“in celebration of Barack Obama’s inauguration and the role that Media Matters played in monitoring the election coverage. Guests had access to the museum’s permanent collection as they rubbed elbows with the nation’s media elite. THE GUESTS: Al Franken, Arianna Huffington, MOMA Curator Rajendra Roy, David Bennahum, Sarah Tanguy, Robert Lehrman, Barney Frank, James Alefantis, and David Brock.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the story below is important because the picture contained in the story captures, in a single image, the horror of the foul brutes who are were in control of our military, and the dishonor that brings on us all. This shames and disturbs the good folks who serve and their families. &quot;BRING ON #TheStorm&quot; ought to be the caption. </p>
<p>We need to flush these fuckers. It\'s clearly time to dig into old Al Franken to see what else he might possibly be hiding in his closet. . . .</p>',

             Well, as if the normies didn't have enough reason to call pizzagaters crazy this should leave no doubt and finish us off for good. The death of pizzagate has arrived.

            Now the Senate may have to have an investigation about this OBVIOUSLY STAGED event. Thanx for flooding the sub with mainstream news bait. It is ROCKING mainstream news right now.

              Calm down dude... How fragile do you think The PizzaGate investigation is? I mean, many of us here have been called crazy for over a year now. I don't believe a few creepy pictures of Al Franken is discrediting anything.
