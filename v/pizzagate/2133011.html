            I don't doubt that there are rituals going on in France.  A hot bed?  Idk.  I am sure there is as much going on there as here with the Ruling Class.  The Ruling Class has been (as we are finding out) evidently doing Black Magick and all other sorts of other Disgusting Dastardly Deeds for centuries.  It is going on everywhere in all countries.  Evidently King Louis XIV was not too happy to find out what was being done to him.  I did not look up the history of his Reign except that I know that both he and Marie Antoinette were both beheaded.  "Let Them Eat Cake" she is famous for saying.  I am a history buff of sorts, but am the first to admit I do not know everything.  I have always loved Versailles for it's beauty but know there are some bad stories that go along with it.  This summer I made a trip with my husband to Paris and we visited Versailles.  Let me tell you it is a beautiful place.  The Gardens of Versailles are Spectacular.  There are people in France that are just as clueless as people here about what is going on with the SRA and their rulers.  Yes, nothing has changed since Louis XIV for the Elites, just I think that they have become more powerful.  BUT.  People are now waking up.  Waking up all over the world.  Let's just hope it happens fast enough to save us.

            It sounds like something that is probably true, especially with the circles involved. Today France is a major hotbed for child sacrifices, via Dinner Parties (the children are raped, murdered and eaten -- often prepared by celebrity chefs).

            Magic doesn't really "work", it's simply paying homage to people who are empowered, who then convey dribs and drabs of empowerment. It goes to show what repugnant trashy sentients are administering our world. They like when you harm people because you erase the culpability of what they have done to you under an EQUALS IN MISERY world policy -  they would otherwise owe you. The thanks they give is modest little empowerments, with a few large scale strings attached cases for purposes of serving as a CONVINCER.

             I agree with everything you wrote except magic does work. Which is why prayer works too. It is why the CIA uses remote viewing and develops various psychological tool. 
Never assume anything. The people that practice this are the most educated, wealthiest and powerful people on this planet. They run both the public and private sectors of pharma, healthcare, legislation, universities. They want you to think it does NOT work. These are not bumbling idiots.

              When I said it doesn't "work" what I meant is that it is HIGH TECHNOLOGY, magic is basically privileges within a high technological system. Doing the silly little dances and recitals does nothing by itself, all it is is LORE / story lines that are attached to the triggering of high technological privileged implementations of what is simply labeled "magic". You could attach "magic" to anything, if the system agrees that you are privileged enough to effect it and you successfully attach the privilege to a certain trigger. Poof, where did that tennis ball come from? ;)

             You need a history lesson.  The following are testimonies of people involved in this case:
            </p>
            <p>
             Testimony of La Voisin's daughter at Vincennes, 9 October 1680:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              "A child that appeared to have been prematurely born was presented at Madame de Montespan's Mass by order of her mother, and Guibourg put it into a basin, cut its throat, poured the blood into a chalice and consecrated it with the host, finished his Mass, then took out the child's entrails; the next day mother Voisin took to Dumesnil, to be distilled, the blood and the host in a glass phial which Madame de Montespan took away. The child's body was burnt in the stove by mother."
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Testimony of the Abbe Guibourg at Vincennes, 10 October 1680:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              "He had bought for a crown the child that was sacrificed at this Mass; it was presented to him by a grown girl. Having drawn blood from the child, whose throat he pierced with a penknife, he poured some into the chalice, after which the child was removed and taken to another place, and its heart and entrails were brought back to him for a second"
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Notes for a report from M. de la Reynie to the King, November 1680:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              "Guibourg, who had denied opening the child's body, agreed that he had torn out the heart and entrails and had cut open the child's heart after the Mass to take out the clotted blood that was inside the heart and put it into a vessel prepared for that purpose; and with it he also put fragments of the consecrated host, and what was in the chalice, and it was taken away by the lady on whose belly he had celebrated Mass, whom he believed to be Madame de Montespan, as La Voisin told him."
