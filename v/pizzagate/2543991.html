<p>‘Cult’ leader Keith Raniere makes killer claim on newly released video</p>
<p>An accused con man who runs an upstate “cult” bankrolled by the Bronfman booze fortune has “had people killed,” he boasts in an explosive new video.</p>
<p>Keith Raniere, who runs Albany-based NXIVM, makes the chilling claim on tape to female followers who confronted him with their concerns about the group, which has been derided by detractors as a harmful “cult.”</p>
<p>“Here’s the thing,” Raniere says on the 2009 video, which was sent to The Post and also posted last night on youtube.com. “I’ve had people killed because of my beliefs — or because of their beliefs.”</p>
<p>Former NXIVM members told The Post that Raniere’s claim is particularly disturbing in light of the mysterious disappearance of a former NXIVM student several years ago.</p>
<p>In 2003, 35-year-old environmentalist Kristin Snyder vanished from an Alaska hotel after taking NXIVM classes. Her body was never found. </p>

            Good ol' 72 Seconds and Enty. Although CDAN isn't a source I like to use, they really hit some nails on the head sometimes--even I have to admit that lol.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Of particular note there:
            </strong>
            "NXIVM disposed of some of their female followers that had been imported from the Middle East"
           </p>
           <p>
            If true(probably is), then, I think we know(or have, at least, a starting point for) how they got connections in the region.
