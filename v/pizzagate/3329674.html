<p>Peter John Dalglish, a former senior United Nations official and co-founder of one of the world’s largest children’s charities, [Save The Children (formerly Street Kids International)], has been jailed after being found guilty of raping young boys in Nepal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the arrest, two young children, ages 12 and 14, were rescued from Dalglish’s custody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dalglish, 62, described as a “high-profile humanitarian worker from Canada”, was sentenced on Monday to two separate terms of nine years and seven years after being convicted of the horrific crimes last month. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3323410">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3323410</a> <a href="https://voat.co/u/maurice">@maurice</a></p>
<p>Dalglish was awarded the Order of Canada by the Trudeau government in 2016 for his work with children, after making his name advocating for the most vulnerable — street children, child laborers and those affected by war.
He founded Street Kids International which later became the internationally renowned Save The Children charity after a merger. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>He has been traveling the world working with disadvantaged children for the last two decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the high-profile and decorated former UN official’s jet-set lifestyle has come to an abrupt end. </p>
<p>Thakur Trital, a district court official, told Agence France-Presse that the former United Nations senior official had been sentenced to nine years for abusing a 12-year-old boy and seven years for molesting a 14-year-old.</p>
<p>“The judge is yet to decide whether he should serve a total 16 years in jail or be released after nine years. In most cases of a similar nature, sentences get overlapped but it is upon the judge to decide,” Trital said.</p>
<p>Dalglish has also been told to pay compensation of 500,000 Nepalese rupees (£3,600) to each of his victims.</p>
<p>DIG Pushkar Karki, director of the CIB, told MyRepublica of Nepal that Dalglish had been promising to help educate disadvantaged children and provide charity and job opportunities for their families:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our preliminary investigation has found that he has been targeting children from poor financial backgrounds and sexually abusing them.
By promising the family members that he would educate their children, take them abroad and also provide them jobs after they finish their education, he had been sexually abusing children. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given his age and his high profile in the humanitarian sector, he would easily win the trust of the family members and later abuse their children.”</p>
<p>Karki also said that Dalglish was well known for these types of crimes in other countries, despite the fact that he has never been prosecuted. International security services and law enforcement have been turning a blind eye to the UN’s top children’s charity advisor while he abused children around the world.</p>
<p>“Not just that, he might have been involved in pedophilia in other countries as well where he served as UN official in the past,” Karki said.“He had arrived in Nepal three months ago. After we got information about his sexual misconduct from security agencies in other countries, we had been closely following him and managed to arrest him.”</p>

             I still haven't dug into some of the details on things he was involved with.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think his Schools Without Borders (for profit) activities were intended to recruit/groom future pedos of influence to embed in various jobs, and who know how many ended up working on behalf of UN (staying in the field into adulthood long term, as volunteers or employees of NGOs).
            </p>
            <p>
             The Joel Davis case came to mind when I read that Dalglish was taking Canadian teens from well to do families, kids with promising futures and steering them into humanitarian careers (for some).  Some of them may have been temporary useful idiots in finding children that were easy to get close to.  He hand picked these 'disciples' of his.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              When Peter Dalglish was arrested, I explained not everyone had been groomed. Dalglish would have networked with other predators. The tributes and amply paid UN positions would have been given to him by men like him. Doing the same thing. Pedophiles help each other obtain authoritative professional positions, titles and awards.
             </p>
             <p>
              They use these positions to protect each other and their crimes. This is their criminal defense.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pedophilia is a highly networked crime. Networking is a defining aspect of the crime. Pedophiles collectively engage in child abuse, share children they have access to, tip each other off on where to locate vulnerable children and protect each other from arrest and prosecution.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Joel Davis is a typical pedophile, then there are humanitarians who networked with him, possibly in these crimes and in helping him build a humanitarian career. It is plausible that the sexual abuse of children is what provided Davis, a teenager — with no qualifications of any kind — a rocket to the top of the humanitarian world. The other explanation for his meteoric rise, based on no merit, is the humanitarian community is incompetent in basic due diligence and dangerously ignorant of predatory patterns of behavior.

              Imagine how much more we could discover if we had records like his "hideaways" guest books, ledgers, his bank statements lining up with certain guests at his place, etc. We could put together so much more. And to think that law enforcement likely does nothing with any of this information.

              We can build a box around anyone's life and the smallest error in bank transactions will likely lead to more of his fellow pedos.

              UN Whistleblower Exposes Network Of Pedophilia And Rape
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              2018
             </p>
             <p>
              (TFTP) An outright frightening dossier released by a former senior United Nations official reveals that United Nations employees have carried out over 60,000 rapes in just the last decade. What’s more, the dossier estimates that the organization currently employs at least 3,300 pedophiles.
             </p>
             <p>
              In just ten years, under the guise of rendering aid, the United Nations has literally been raping and pillaging countries across the world. The problem has gotten so out of hand that it prompted the former UN insider, Andrew Macleod, to blow the whistle and hand over the evidence to Britain’s Department for International Development (DFID) Secretary Priti Patel.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to the exclusive report by the Sun, the dossier reveals that on top of the 3,300 pedophiles working for the organization, thousands more “predatory” sex abusers specifically target aid charity jobs to get close to vulnerable women and children.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               <em>
                “There are tens of thousands of aid workers around the world with paedophile tendencies, but if you wear a UNICEF T-shirt nobody will ask what you’re up to.”
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               <em>
                “You have the impunity to do whatever you want.”
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               <em>
                “It is endemic across the aid industry across the world.”
               </em>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              According to Macleod, anyone who’s attempted to blow the whistle on the horrifyingly rampant abuse is silence and fired.
             </p>
             <p>
              The UN also admits that the likely true number of cases reported against its staff is double that, as figures outside of war zones are not centrally collated.
             </p>
             <p>
              Prof MacLeod also estimates that only one in 10 of all rapes and assaults by UN staff are reported, as even in the UK the reporting rate is just 14 per cent.

             Apparently, Pompeo, when he was still Director of the See Eye A,  was in Nepal at the time of Dalglish's arrest.
