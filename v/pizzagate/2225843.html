<p>After an extensive worldwide search, the ONE Campaign has named Gayle Smith — a top advisor on development issues to two American presidents and one of the world’s leading experts on global development — as president and chief executive officer. Smith succeeds Michael Elliott, who passed away in July 2016, and Adrian Lovett, who has served as the interim CEO.</p>

<p>Guerilla Mistress To Obama Confidant;
The Life And Crimes Of Gayle Smith  
</p>
<p>Gayle Smith started her career in service to the American Empire as an undercover CIA operative posing as a journalist in the Horn of Africa in the late 1970’s. </p>
<p>Taking her duty seriously, she became the mistress of a guerilla fighter known by the nom de guerre of “Jamaica” in the Marxist-Leninist-Enver Hoxha-ite Tigrayan Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF), then fighting for independence from the Soviet Union supported Mengistu regime in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>As a close confidant to the leadership of the TPLF, Gayle Smith would spend the decade of the 1980’s as the liaison between the CIA and Meles Zenawi, the leader of the TPLF who was to become the Prime Minister of Ethiopia after the defeat and overthrow of the Mengistu regime by the Eritrean independence movement in 1991.</p>
<p>Gayle Smith is the person most responsible for the rise to power and elevation to international leadership status of Ethiopia’s Meles Zenawi, one of the most corrupt, bloodthirsty genocidal killers of modern times who would once again stride the world stage at the G-20 meeting held in Korea.</p>
<p>“The Holocaust in the Horn; The War Nobody Remembers”, 
250,000 dead,1.5 million refugees and Gayle Smith’s fingerprints all over the crime scene.</p>
<p>Until then the life and crimes of Gayle Smith continue, blessed by President Barack Obama himself. The guerilla mistress turned presidential confidant still rules her roost, ready to order the dispatch of her goombahs to commit murder and mayhem, genocide even, whatever it takes to try to preserve the crumbling empire she has served so faithfully. </p>

<p>Obama’s Quiet Consigliere</p>
<p>She then took up with a rising star in the Democratic Party, one Barack Obama, endowed at the time with the nickname “Senator Slither” by the late Alexander Cockburn  (  HAHAHA  SENATOR SLITHER)</p>
<p>Gayle Smith brought on board Susan Rice, the god daughter of former Secretary of State Madeline Albright, for whom Gayle who? had become a big sister/mentor to during Ms. Rice’s rookie days as Under Secretary of State for African Affairs under Bill Clinton in the mid 1990’s</p>
<p>Today Gayle who? occupies an office close to her Godfather, Barack Obama in the White House, avoiding the sunlight and dispensing very dubious council considering the desperate shape the USA has been finding itself in matters of world affairs</p>
<p>GODFATHER?   WHO ARE HER PARENTS?</p>

            Smith, who was 59 when she was nominated, is from Bexley, Ohio. She attended Bexley High School, where she was a cheerleader, and graduated in 1974. She went on to earn a B.A. from the University of Colorado.
           </p>
           <p>
            An article Smith wrote in May 1983 appeared to defend the kidnapping of 10 westerners by the Tigrayan Peoples’ Liberation Front as a way to get publicity.

               I don't think there is a list.  I think people look up the flight records of people of interest.  It is able to be done, but I have never looked before.  There are records.  That is how they found about BC and Spacey, etc.

            How can Obama be her Godfather when she was already a CIA operative in the 70's?  Another creation in a test tube perhaps or stolen from some unfortunate parents?  IDK but she has some history.  She has really been responsible for a lot of murder and mayhem, no wonder Madeleine Albright is her Godmother.  I  bet Susan Rice rides on the Lolita too.  She and Obama are very close as well.
