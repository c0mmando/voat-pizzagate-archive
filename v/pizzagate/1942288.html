           114) The DNC honored Seth Rich by putting a plaque with his name on it by the Bike Racks... Yes.. the Bike Racks, they cared a lot.

            88) Now why would Police walk you by someone to identify you if you've been shot???.. Get my ass to the Hospital!
           </p>
           <p>
            My reading was that Mike/Mark was able to identify Seth because the police walked him past - not that the police walked Seth past Mike/mark in order for Mike/Mark to identify him - would have to go back to the source to be sure.

             haha. What an idiot. Seth Rich is the most likely to have leaked the Podesta emails. Those emails brought us pizzagate. And you think it's not related? Lmao. What a douche.

              They were phished as has been proven by an email chain you dumbfuck.

             <p>
              Rich was most likely a kabbalist pedophile PANDA-LOVER and certainly didnt expose pizzagate, which is old news. The revelation was the use of pizza shops as fronts.  And since seth richs fake murder has been a constant distraction and no one finds new fronts to boycott, more kids will be raped and you should fucking kill yourself for being a soap opera-addicted little bitch. STOP SPAMMING, WEBB IS OVER, NOBODY CARES ABOUT (((SETH THE ISRAELI PANDA LOVER RICH)))
