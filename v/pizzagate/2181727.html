<p>I\'m new on Voat, but I have been following the Pizzagate investigations for months. I would like to say thanks to all people who are holding up the torch. We are united! &lt;3</p>

<p>This astrologer claims that Jupiter in Scorpio (starting today) will favor investigations and revelations of all sorts, especially those concerning children:</p>
<p>Look for the section titled &quot;Knees-deep in the muck: Jupiter in the sign of the Scorpion&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scorpio is the sign of the reality behind appearances, and of the spiritual in the material. During his time in Scorpio, Jupiter will increase the powers of this sign considerably, attempting to bring out all the affairs he so diligently tried to hide while he stayed in Libra. <strong>Tensions will erupt, smoldering conflicts will flare up and we will be faced with big scandals, new and known before. There is a spirit group in early Scorpio that rules everything concerning children. We can thus expect a renewed interest in the hushed-over Pizzagate affair, or the surfacing of other pedophile scandals.</strong></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Naturally, in the end it is up to the investigators to determine how fruitful their efforts will turn out to be, and how visible their results will be to the general public. <strong>But with Jupiter in Scorpio the public at large will definitely be more receptive, and the investigations are favored to go very deep.</strong> The end of October sees Jupiter channeling the zodiacal spirit collectives of ADAE (also called ADON), <strong>emphasizing matters of family and children</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Another transit that will help investigators of all sorts will be Mercury’s ingress into tropical Scorpio around October 17th, followed by a conjunction with Jupiter soon after. Mercury in Scorpio is the prototypical private dick, the detective, the fringe theorist, tinging all our thinking with audacity and an otherworldly sense.</strong></p>
<p>The Sun will follow Mercury and Jupiter into Scorpio around October 23rd, conjoining Jupiter on the 26th, serving to <strong>illuminate and radiate whatever findings were excavated to this point.</strong></p>
