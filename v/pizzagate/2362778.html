<p>DEVIN STRZOK is Mark Strzok\'s son  and is a lieutenant and skipper with the US Coast Guard.

<p>KIRSTEN nee Lepp STRZOK is the wife of Devin Strzok and is also a lieutenant and nurse in the US Coastguard. 
(refer to preceding link)</p>
<p>That\'s about it for the family tree.</p>
<p>There are 2 interesting visits Devin Strzok made to the White House.  
</p>
<p>On March 12, 2015. Devin Strzok, Kristin Strzok, and Eugene D. Mok were scheduled for a &quot;West Wing Tour.&quot; Katherine Ustler is listed as the host. Their visit started at 9:45 pm (?!) and ended at 11:59 pm. </p>
<p>DEVIN Strzok\'s second visit was on 04/14/16 aling with 642 other people from 9:30 am to 11:59 pm.  Barak Obama was host.
<a href="http://white-house-logs.insidegov.com/d/a/Devin-Strzok">http://white-house-logs.insidegov.com/d/a/Devin-Strzok</a></p>
<p>Eugene Mok\'s history is kind of vague but he was once a 2nd year law student and was part of the US Navy for 6 years. He &quot;left active duty to pursue a legal career dealing with national security&quot;; worked in the intelligence community; interned with the Chief of Naval Operations Special Counsel; and interned with the DOJ National Security Division.

<p>Lastly, it looks highly suspicious and likely that Peter Strzok was the last person to touch the physical server that had the remaining 33,000 emails of HRC.</p>

            Ignore the anal retentives whining about this supposedly being just a political thread,

           </p>
           <p>
            This is actually one of the most important threads we could have right now: for Pizzagate!
           </p>
           <p>
            Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Strzok family is, and has been for decades, generationally involved in the deep State. They're always behind-the-scenes players, though. They never run for office, but they get jobs in the church, in religious deep-state organizations, in the 3-letter agencies, and a few people have said that they're actually more powerful than predidents and congressmen.

           <p>
            This family is like the Octopus: its tentacles reach into everything involving the deep state, and sorting out these connections will be a key to figuring out who the spooks are
            <strong>
             behind
            </strong>
            the easy-to-figure-out pedophiles like Clinton and Epstein.

               Not how it works. YOU are supposed to do the legwork and bring the evidence here to be examined and discussed if you are going to post it in this sub. There is zero evidence that a pedophile investigation is ongoing in relation to this post. If people start posting all this political garbage here it will be a never ending stream of manufactured D.C. garbage sliding the forum.

               <p>
                This is something we need to discuss.
               </p>
               <p>
                I do appreciate your concern to keep
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                 /v/pizzagate
                </a>
                on-track. And I'm afraid there it can be hard to keep the off-topic stuff under control at times. Can't say I have an answer for you.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am aware that my post about sea-lioning was antagonizing and polarizing, so I deleted it.
               </p>
               <p>
                OTOH, I want to make sure that people who are onto leads about really significant subjects aren't stifled. And the Strzok clan is definitely one of the deep currents people have been missing up until now, including their links with Obama and African pedophilia.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm doing other stuff right now, but am researching the Strzok's on the side, and when I do post anything it will be complicated and massive. But I want to make sure other people are aware that they might find some gold if they dig in this particular rabbit hole, so what I posted is a heads-up to the OP and other readers.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would urge you not to appoint yourself as thought-police on the sub, because it's often people trading leads around that results in breakthroughs and links to things they hadn't thought of.
               </p>
               <p>
                BTW: I appreciate the excellent work you've been doing in the whole elite pedophile research field. Please keep up the good work.

            until it is proven they are taking down pedophiles. If this Washington D.C. drama gets posted here every day we can kiss our pedo specialty sub goodbye, and honestly, that may be the intent of Washington.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            They don't talk about pedophiles for a reason, and they keep us distracted with all their garbage. They WANT for us to focus on it, nothing good FOR US comes of their drama, and I burn very few of my brain cells on their manufactured bull shit.

            Whatever they claim their intentions to be, I just reverse it, and in the end it seems to produce about a 90% accuracy rate after all their smoke and mirrors crap is finished.

             I disagree. Powerful D.C. families running things behind the scenes is very much pizzagate related. Obviously a direct connection to podesta or actual pedo-activities would be great, but this guy clearly is involved with fixing things for the Clintons, and given his high level FBI position there's no telling what he's been involved with.

              Great. Probably so. But if we just dump political crap about political families in the sub without a link to pizzagate spelled out this place becomes a republican cheerleading sub and i'm totally against it.

              I don't think the zionist republicans intend to do any more for us than the marxist democrats did. I just see this whole thing as the new cabal taking control from the old cabal. The new cabal will fuck us over just as hard as the last one and they all work together to a degree anyway. I won't cheer for the bastards when I know they will fuck us all over in the end.

               Legit concerns and probably you're right. Personally I think politics if related to Hillary is part of PG, and when researching for links/connections it's not always apparent if something is PG or not, and that's part of the battle. How to include potential leads while screening for disinfo and other noise postings.
              </p>
              <p>
               About the new taking control from the old, maybe. I do support Trump and hope for more good things to come, but I have to accept the possibility that he's another arm of the same beast. Either way we can't just sit on our computers and complain and accuse without taking some kind of action. Even if we get fucked over yet again, it's all archived and we will adapt.They have the advantage in almost every way. They have a fuller picture and have been painting for more than the last 100 years, the bulk of their work already done.
              </p>
              <p>
               We must do something, yet anything we do we must question if our actions are feeding into their plans, and if those we choose to trust are just the ones they've delivered for us to trust. We're in a tough spot no doubt.

             This all ties in to pizzagate.  The Deep State has wants impeachment of President Trump and has been planning for it since the day of his election.  What do you think will happen to pizzagate if they succeed???  Many things tie in to pizzagate.  I laid some groundwork with this post, and yes, it remains to be seen what else can be uncovered.  Should I have waited and posted an entire novel?  Facts are discovered incrementally.  Take a chill pill or drink some chamomile tea.  BTW, you do good work.

              So do you bro :) I'm just against dragging D.C. drama in this sub without a direct link to pizzagate because the drama D.C. creates is for our amusement and it never ends. It is meant to distract.

               In context, I agree with you, but in reality, the evil spider web that has been spun (and that is the best way I can describe it) continues to grow with no end in site unless it is completely brushed away.
              </p>
              <p>
               Things have changed since pizzagate started.  Who would have thought 15-16 months ago that it would have resulted in this fiasco?  When all this  BS broke-out before and after the election, I waited every day for the arrests to be made -  Hillary, Podesta, Alefantis, etc. and for everything to be busted wide open.  I just knew it would happen.
              </p>
              <p>
               And here we are, still, uncovering more and more every single day.  In order for pizzagate to end, our government has to be rebuilt, starting with the dismantling of the FBI and CIA and arresting those who have committed treason.

                I agree, but, that is not happening in D.C. The drama going on in D.C. is just run of the mill drama. They are not really getting ready to arrest themselves. There is no indication of it. Meanwhile, on the "hope" that they are we plod along and over the next few months this sub gets normalized into a politics sub.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think its a terrible idea to allow this place to get normalized to politics posting because quite frankly I think the intention of the D.C. drama is to drag pizzagate into their swamp and drown it out with politics. I think D.C. is fooling us into supporting their drama with no intention of delivering anything to pizzagate.
               </p>
               <p>
                As that continues to happen we will ruin this sub.

                 Often, I ponder, why haven't pizzagate-related arrests been made for the top-of-the-food-chain scum?  Hillary Clinton, Podesta, Obama,  Alefantis, Abramovich, etc.  No evidence we are told.  Yes, there is evidence.  Because this has NOT happened, I must believe there is something much larger planned.  Ideas of what that might be are constantly running through my head.  This current state cannot last much longer.  It gets worse day by day.
