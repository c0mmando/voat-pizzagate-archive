<p><em>On the narrow issue of whether the Israelis will allow the two containers being held at customs in Haifa to be admitted duty-free, we are making progress.

<p><em>On the larger issue of the remaining 7 containers still in the U.S. and waiting to be shipped, as well as future shipments, it is much more difficult and more complicated because Israel has the legal right to impose the duties under our existing bilateral trade and economic agreements.</em></p>

<p>I\'d like to say here that 9 containers of fish costs ~$1.9 Million (guessing, $8 / lbs * 2000 lbs / ton * 12 ton / container * 9 containers).  Not really secretary of state / congressional worthy.</p>

<p>So they were shipping from Illinois</p>
<p><em>We at the embassy have asked he highest political level in Israel to see if we could get an exemption from customs for all the 9 containers</em></p>
