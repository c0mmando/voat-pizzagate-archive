<p>Recent suspicions on Seth Rich being the leak gets WaPo to push articles on daily bases for a while. The news are controversial, Fox pushing Seth Rich as the leaker, WaPo pushing Fox as a liar.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As an independent journalist, these events are always sad to see. If we had a couple of independent medias above, readers would not be pushed to endless argues on who\'s right, not only on the medias, but also on each other. We are actually looking at two biased medias pushing American people to two separate camps. From a pizzagate point of view, two camps can be controlled - If people would unite, that might not be possible.</p>',

          <p>
           As an independent journalist, these events are always sad to see. If we had a couple of independent medias above, readers would not be pushed to endless argues on who's right, not only on the medias, but also on each other. We are actually looking at two biased medias pushing American people to two separate camps. From a pizzagate point of view, two camps can be controlled - If people would unite, that might not be possible.

            I love this. Thank you for taking the time. It would be cool to see this for a lot of the mainstream media. Most people I know are only going to take the time to watch one or the other. Sadly that ends up becoming their reality. No further reading necessary for them. I'm glad there are still some communities out there that aspire to a higher level of critical thinking.

            This is great. The saddest part is knowing that not only is the media supposed to be a check on power to protect the people from government but law enforcement is supposed to be just. If it is not someone is supposed to step in.
           </p>
           <p>
            To think that in Washington DC last summer government operatives would be involved in political assasination of a 27 year old millennial to save themselves &amp; elect their candidate makes us all want to vomit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Citizens have to step in against law enforcement, against the press, against threats to try and tell the truth and still died. Then it was covered up again.

            You so vividly demonstrate the importance of organizing evidence. It enables valid inferences to be drawn as opposed to having a bunch of factoids swirling around in the atmosphere. Much appreciated.

             Ain't it interesting to see which media makes the openings all the time. Being 2nd is always somewhat easier, as the weak spots in the opening can be checked and taken advantage of. And if it doesn't work, just do it again and again until the public is "served" (aka agenda running smooth again)
            </p>

             WaPo showed no interest to deliver the truth: That this is an unsolved murder.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either media showed almost no efforts on demanding solving the truth, which would serve the public the best way, being the most important goal of journalism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Noting that there's currently total rewards summing up to $145,000 (+$130,000 unconfirmed) for information leading to solving the case, neither media telling that to the public, is a strong evidence against the press itself.
            </p>
            <p>
             This article seems unbiased, and demands solving the case:
