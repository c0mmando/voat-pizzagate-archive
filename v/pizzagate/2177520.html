             FBI INVOLVEMENT IN CHILD PROCUREMENT for SATANIC RITUAL AND MURDER
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Write Into Action is now going to show the international public a face and name of an FBI agent that procures children for rape, torture, and murder by the elite. The kidnapper is associated with CNN and members of the legal community.
           </p>
           <p>
            JOHN REGAN – THE UNDERCOVER PEDOPHILE and BABY SALES – WASHINGTON D.C.
           </p>
           <p>
            The search for HaLeigh Cummings involved a strange man dressed as a pastor named John Regan that identified himself as an FBI agent and CIA agent to multiple witnesses.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Regan told Wayanne Kruger, an author and advocate from California that was staying with Crystal Sheffield (HaLeigh’s mother), he was an “undercover pedophile” for the FBI. He also told Kruger the FBI already had HaLeigh in their possession but wanted to keep it quiet. Kruger said John Regan told her he reports to “Washington”.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Background records obtained by Write Into Action show John Regan was convicted of a felony sex offense.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Holmseth later learned from Kruger, the author and advocate that was staying with Haleigh’s mother, that she (Kruger) knew first-hand that John Regan is a pedophile that rapes little boys and is involved in a child sales operation being staged out of Florida.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The procurement of babies involves Florida Department of Children and Families and the name of an attorney involved.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Kruger said she can place John Regan and and William Staubs (private investigator, also known as Cobra) traveling together from state to state because the two were pulled over by a state trooper of which there is a record. Kruger said they were on their way to one of the houses used to hold the children (possibly in Virginia).
           </p>
           <p>
            Kruger said John Regan and his son, Jeremiah Regan, were seen going into the home of HaLeigh Cummings with a camera shortly before the little girl vanished.
           </p>
           <p>
            Holmseth provided the FBI the entire child trafficking blueprint (actual recording of Wayanne Kruger explaining the operation and naming the participants) provided by Kruger of how the babies and small children were kidnapped and moved through the U.S. Embassy with fake documents. During the interview Kruger mentioned children in Belgium and Russia.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             During recorded telephonic interviews, Timothy Holmseth obtained evidence from multiple operatives in the kidnapping and child porn operation. Holmseth ultimately captured the operatives, including a Florida DCF social worker named Bonnie Warner, on recording, discussing child rape pornography photos of HaLeigh Cummings that were being passed around by the missing child’s mother’s legal team including John Regan’s son, Jeremiah Regan.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            On March 22, 2009, John Regan (the undercover pedophile) was involved in a search for HaLeigh Cummings with Private Investigator William (Cobra the Bounty Hunter) Staubs at a remote location near San Mateo, Florida. The search was staged with fake evidence being planted in advance that included HaLeigh’s toys, bloody glove, suit case, map, nebulizer fluid, male sock, and car keys.
           </p>
           <p>
            An FBI Agent AJ Eilerman told Holmseth that the search for HaLeigh Cummings on March 22, 2009 was staged to make the public believe HaLeigh Cummings was dead so people would “stop looking for her”.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Richard Grund has a part in all of this. Grund is an admitted (former) Satanist and father of Casey Anthony’s former fiancé Jesse Grund
             <a href="https://caseyanthonydotme.wordpress.com/2014/09/13/caylee-anthony-murder-re-visited/">
              https://caseyanthonydotme.wordpress.com/2014/09/13/caylee-anthony-murder-re-visited/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Grund’s colleague, Wayanne Kruger, told Holmseth she feared Grund might have killed “HaLeigh Cummings” in another one of his “frickin exorcisms” – a scenario consistent with the National Enquirer story.
            </p>
            <p>
             Grund’s belief that Casey Anthony was ‘possessed’ or indwelt by a demon lends credence to Kruger’s suspicion that little Caylee could have died during an exorcism (if Grund believed BOTH mommy and daughter were possessed and a ritual was being performed).
            </p>
            <p>
             Kruger said Grund didn’t believe HaLeigh Cummings was completely human because her reproductive system didn’t work due to Turner’s syndrome.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <h1>
           </h1>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Many people started trying to set Holmseth up. CNN, including a reporter for Nancy Grace started trying to shut him up
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In June of 2009, multiple members of HaLeigh Cummings’ mother’s legal team telephoned the police in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. Police records show the callers spoke with Lt. Detective Rodney Hajicek, the ranking officer at the EGFPD. Despite Hajicek’s written incident report that states Holmseth was committing no crimes, Hajicek telephoned Holmseth and suggested he stop writing about Donna Wagoner, Xentel, Inc., Florida.
           </p>
           <p>
            Holmseth had come across Wagoner and the company Xentel through photos of the missing child that been emailed to him by a web developer working for Crystal Sheffield’s legal team that showed the thread began with Wagoner.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Police records would later show the operatives that contacted Lt. Hajicek were associates of CNN and included Nancy Grace’s reporter Art Harris, who stayed in contact with Hajicek as they discussed how Holmseth could be stopped.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Records show Hajicek approached Polk County (Minnesota) Attorney Greg Widseth and EGF City Attorney Ronald Galstad about possibly finding something to stop Holmseth.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2012 Hajicek and his rogue officers fabricated probable cause to seize Holmseth’s computer and then attempted to destroy Holmseth’s evidence by ruining the hard-drive before returning it (Holmseth had back-ups).
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a specific reason Holmseth was being targeted. In the summer of 2009 Holmseth turned over actionable evidence about photos of HaLeigh Cummings to the FBI, which resulted in FBI agents in Florida visiting Donna Wagoner at Xentel, Inc, Florida.
           </p>
           <p>
            Following the FBI visit to Wagoner, Art Harris, CNN/HLN/Nancy Grace, contacted Hajiek about Holmseth and was irate Holmseth was assisting the FBI.
           </p>

             Holmseth and his children begin being targeted.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Holmseth and his children have been relentlessly stalked and threatened since 2009; warned to remove his publication from the Web. In 2016 the operatives began to use Donald Trump’s telephone numbers.

             CLINTON GLOBAL IMPLICATED BY CHILD SEX OPERATIVES TARGETING DONALD J. TRUMP
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton Global has been implicated by black operatives that are targeting a Minnesota journalist while using the name and contact information of Donald J. Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evidence shows Director James Comey’s FBI has been running cover for the operation.

            This reminds me of the New Mexico political figure (I think she was a Senator? Congresswoman maybe?) who had the cops called on her and her crew because they were being rowdy at the hotel and throwing bottles off the balcony, and when the cops showed up, the political figure got on the phone with the police dispatcher and was like "We are sitting here drinking Cokes and eating Pizzas. Call off your dogs now." She was extremely threatening, and was asking for names and room numbers of who called the police, and was saying "You will tell me this information, now." Very, very creepy.
