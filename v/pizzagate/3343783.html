<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday night, royal correspondent Emily Andrews of The Sun revealed that Buckingham Palace had filed a certificate of incorporation for a private limited company, the new royal foundation for Meghan and Harry, that\'s to be called &quot;Sussex Royal.&quot;</p>
<p>The new registration filing for the foundation also revealed the charity\'s four directors: Meghan and Harry (of course) plus their communications secretary, Sara Latham, and <strong>former Royal Foundation staffer Natalie Campbell, who will serve as the new CEO</strong>.</p>
<p>ICYMI: Prince Harry and Markle attended <strong>The Lion King U.K. premiere</strong> on Sunday on behalf of Harry\'s environmental work in Africa (and, yeah, met and hugged <strong>Beyoncé and Jay-Z<strong>). The couple, along with their 2-month-old baby Archie, will travel to the continent this fall and embark on their first royal tour as a family of three. They\'re expected to make a big announcement about their new foundation\'s charitable initiatives during this trip. (</strong>At Sunday\'s premiere, the royal couple revealed that Walt Disney Co.\'s Protect the Pride campaign, which helps lion conservation in Africa, made the first donation to their as-yet-unrevealed initiative.</strong>)</p>

<p>So, would that  new foundation be based on a similar template as the arrangement Prince William has with the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) ? as pointed out in this post ? <a href="https://www.voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3325887">Ship Seized In Record $1.3 Billion Cocaine Bust Belongs To JPMorgan.

             How Royals' lawyer used Leveson, Lord McAlpine and veiled threats to keep Rolf Harris arrest secret...and even tried to forbid us from even publishing their warning
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Lawyers for Rolf Harris have used intimidating and potentially misleading tactics to stop The Mail on Sunday from naming the Australian entertainer in the investigation in the wake of the Jimmy Savile abuse claims.  In a series of threatening emails sent to this paper, London law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis warned of the ‘highly damaging personal consequences’ in identifying their client.
            </p>
            <p>
             They also brandished Lord Justice Leveson’s name to declare there was no public interest in reporting the arrest. It meant that for more than four months The Mail on Sunday decided not to publish Mr Harris’s name in connection with the Savile investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             As recently as March 30, Har¬bottle’s senior media lawyer,  Gerrard Tyrrell, who has acted for Prince William, Prince Harry and the Middletons, warned: ‘If you proceed then both you and the Editor of your newspaper are on notice of the consequences.’
            </p>
