            Sorry for the spoilers but this is literally what they start doing towards the end of Season 1 of True Detective. Amazing season and definitely worth a watch as it deals with EXACTLY the type of investigation we're focusing on here.

            Good idea in theory, not sure how well it would play out. I figure any attempt at professional investigation would get smashed by the media but it's worth a shot.

             You want to structure it so that there really isn't a structure.  You don't want leadership or any focal point for them to attack.
            </p>
            <p>
             The thing is, you'd need some organizational structure to manage the funds you'd take it through crowd sourcing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everything else could be coordinated anonymously in the forums as a decentralized group.
            </p>
            <p>
             People need to start making threads like,
            </p>
            <p>
             " 900$ required to investigate XYZ"
            </p>
            <p>
             And then links to a crowd sourcing site.
            </p>
            <p>
             Only give money to crowd sourcing campaigns linked to accounts/people/groups  you trust.

             This would be under the radar and would be spread out into different cells.  It would be impossible to stop.

            <p>
             The only thing you'd need is a central hub to process the funds.  You'd  need some organizational structure for that I suppose, but it could still be decentralized.
