<hr />
<p>I can\'t say I\'ve followed every tidbit revealed about NXIVM, so forgive me if this is well-known, but the information in the title stood out to me, from a #pizzagate perspective.</p>
<p>Quoting a Bonnie, one-time friend of India in the cult:</p>
<p>“Then a friend of mine, another coach, confided in me that she’d been removed from her position as head trainer because she’d committed an ethical breach against Keith by refusing to have his baby. <strong>In this secret society, all babies go to Keith—it’s part of their vow of obedience. They have to sign a waiver that if they get pregnant with Keith’s child—or anyone’s, for that matter—they must give their babies to Keith.</strong>”</p>
<hr />
<p>I know about Gaelen, the mysterious child who seemed to belong to the cult, I didn\'t know these details:</p>
<p>\'Two longtime members of his harem—Pam and Mariana—lived with him, and Pam had taken ill with cancer. “She was basically dying in one room, while in the next room, he told everyone later, he was having sex with Mariana to conceive his baby—with Pam’s blessing, as she was literally taking her last breath.”</p>
<p>Keith had told a lot of his women that he’d father a child with them, that they were the chosen one, and that the baby would be an avatar who would change the world. Nine months later, the “Baby Avatar” was born.</p>
<p>But he was not Keith’s first child. A decade earlier, one of Keith’s girlfriends, Kristin Keeffe, gave birth to their son, Gaelen—and for years, Keith and the harem created a web of lies and mystery surrounding the child’s origins. A story was concocted that Keith had adopted the boy, a foundling, after his mother had died in childbirth and no one knew who the father was. At the time, Keith was presenting himself as celibate—which was ironic, considering he had a full-time harem. Keith’s foundling story, I thought, was the ultimate “Immaculate Deception.” \'</p>
<hr />
<p>My comment: Given that Rainere had a harem of young women he was having presumably unprotected sex with, one wonders how many babies belong to him and where they went. On the other hand, with a restricted calorie diet I understand for instance menstruation shuts down, so I don\'t know how fertile they really were.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Also didn\'t recall knowing NXIVM was into cryogenics. According to this when another member died, KR requested the body or at least the head to freeze. When the aforementioned Pam died:</p>
<p>\' “I was told by firsthand witnesses that Keith arranged to have Pam’s body snuck out of the hospital before a death certificate could be issued and kept her body submerged in ice in one of his bathtubs at home. No one knows what happened to her body.”</p>
<p>My comment: For a cult that\'s into reincarnation, preserving the physical body seems contradictory.)</p>',

            NXIVM is full of sick and disgusting practices. Watch the documentaries about that cult on 20/20.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have sex with a wide range of animals from cats to donkeys. And none of the women were allowed to trim or shave their pubes (Keith's preference).
The women in this cult were not allowed to have sexual relations with anyone except for keith...
           </p>
           <p>
            The more you dig into NXIVM, the worse it gets.

            Imagine what they think of the people who buy into the moral crises they fabricate. While I blackmail and rape women and kidnap their children, you sheep should argue about whether or not a baker is allowed to refuse to bake a gay wedding cake.

             what is the percentage of society that you think are trannies? is it just holywood that you think are trannies or like everyone? because i was talking to a guy who seriously thought it was like 30% of the world. i could believe that a large percentage of holywood are trannies although im not totally convinced. but the rest of society, no thats just nonsense.

                 lol nope. born with a dick and love fucking women. 100% biological male. you sir have significant paranoia issues. or a family with some insane genetic mutation that causes significant levels of mental illness which has resulted in so many of them being trannies and  you having a serious case of selection bias in your estimations. but its way more likely ur just fucking looney tunes.

                   i have no idea what you just said. but you probably are living in a paranoid nightmare world and its probably awful. the world is terrible and depressing enough without believing every other person you meet is a disgusting tranny. im not gonna say get some help because theres no way a guy like you will go to a therapist. but spend some time thinking about the logistics involved in &gt;30% of society being trans. think of HOW MANY doctors and pharmacists and other people would have to be complicit in the deception you believe to be happening. it is utterly unrealistic. like believing the earth is flat. there are too many people that would have to be involved in the lie.

                     theres more than one of you weirdos? interesting. so do you just believe theres like thousands of doctors performing surgeries day in day out? that the medicine the pharmacist is distributing like 30% tranny meds? how do you think that is just happening silently? do you just think 30-40% of the random people you see are trannies?

              "Main results. Our meta-regression model, based on 12 surveys covering 2007 to 2015, explained 62.5% of model heterogeneity, with a significant effect for each unit increase in survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10; b = 0.026%; P = .002). Extrapolating these results to 2016 suggested a current US population size of 390 adults per 100 000, or almost 1 million adults nationally. This estimate may be more indicative for younger adults, who represented more than 50% of the respondents in our analysis."

             Exactly.  What has been reported is the tip of an enormous, evil, powerful iceberg.  Wow!  Just noticed author us “Oxenberg” — iceberg.  She is not just Hollywood connected, she is royalty elite (mother is a princess).  This book, sensationalistic as it may seem, is very brave.  A mother’s love.  I read that India still spurns her mother.  Let’s hope there will be healing for them (abd all the others NXIVM brainwashed) soon.

              I do hope that. But it's ultimately ironic that the person who loves India and saved her from an alleged pedo/rapist is the one she turns her back on. It's what these monsters do. Find that weak point and twist your mind until you push away true love and crave evil.
