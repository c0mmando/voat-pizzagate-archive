            Here's one that stands out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Request Assistance with International Adoption Process 9/20/2009
           </p>
           <p>
            We are one of 65 families writing to you regarding our difficulties in adopting an orphan child from Kyrgyzstan. 16 months ago rny wife and l, began the process of adopting a {redacted} The referral we received came from an adoption agency that had tirelessly worked for accreditation from the Kyrgyz government for nine months. The Kyrgyz Ministry of Education was the government agency responsible for providing our adoption agency with the referral for our future daughter. Once we accepted the referral we were granted permission to travel to Kyrgyzstan to meet the child and spent 5 wonderful days with her and at the end of our trip signed the neeessary paperwork to Snalize the adoption. AII that was left was the court hearing in country that we were told would happen in approximately 8 weeks. With all the necessary paperwork in order and fees paid we left for the U.S. anxiously awaiting the phone call to retum to Kyrgyzstan to bring our daughter home. Shortly after our return home we teamed that the Kyrgyz Prime Minister was stopping the international adoption program amidst allegations of Illegal proceedings and possible child trafficking. After months of investigations, in which paperwork irregularities were uncovered with no child trafficking, and debate in the Kyrgyz Parliament it was decided that the entire intemational adoption program needed to be revamped and this has resulted in further delays in fi nalizing the adoptions of 65 children that the Ministry of Education has stated are legal and can be moved forward to completion. Currently the Ministry of Education has written new regulations govemIng International adoption but the Prime Minister had not allowed the adoptions of these 65 children to move forward while the government debates and votes on these new adoption regulations. This is going to further delay linalization proceedings while the 65 children in orphanages spread throughout the country and continue to suffer from lack of proper nutrition, emotional and psychological stimulation, and medical care. We and the other 64 families have been working with your Office of Children's lssues as well as the Ernbassy in Bishkek, but their hard work and campaigning of these children has not yielded much success. My wife and I respectfully request that you or another senior State Department official assist us as we continue to work with the Department of State, the Embassy, and our adoption agencies in bringing these wonderful children home to our great country and give them the opportunity to have a healthy, safe, and prosperous future. Wehave leamed that the Kyrgyz Prime Minister ls scheduled to travel to the US in the near future and would humbly ask lf you could contact him and discuss thls issue wlth hlm on our behalf. Having someone of your stature advocating for us could be the boost we need to heip resolve this Issue and get these children to their new homes. Any assistance you could provide would be greatiy appreciated by all 65 families. Thank you for time and consideration

            It's on the first page of search returns when searching 'Trafficking', under the heading "Request assistance with international adoption process'.

            The cabal ordered Obama to make Hillary his Secretary of State they wanted her in that job so she could do the most harm and expose the most secrets for sale and that's what she did she sold secrets she made a fortune all laundered through her Clinton Foundation it was a criminal enterprise start to finish. Whatever else is on Weiner's laptop the only way we will see the good stuff is if Wikileaks gets it.

What stood out to me was the dates - emails going back to 2002 and through March 2017 discussing EO on the travel ban and something called KPIF Taskforce(totally redacted): i found the 2017 e-mails odd as i thought they confiscated his laptop Oct 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't get to download, but saw a many early e-mails (from when she was a Senator)s with blood diamonds in topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also some on a 2012 ambush in Mexico of CIA agents (downloaded a few of these - marked Secret/Sensitive), and some on 2012 Canadian elections (heavily redacted marked Confidential/noforn)

1. DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF FIJI
HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF SAMOA TO
INQUIRE ABOUT THAT COUNTRY'S EXPERIENCE WITH YOUTH
REHABILITATION CAMPS AND THAT SUCH A PROGRAM MAY BE
OPENING SOON IN FIJI. CA/OCS/ACS FAXED POST REFTELS
WHICH GIVE BACKGROUND ON BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION
FACILITIES AND THEIR USE BY FAMILIES TO REIGN IN
RECALCITRANT CHILDREN FOR WHOM TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINE
HAS NOT PRODUCED THE DESIRED RESULTS.
2. AS REF A NOTES, AMERICAN PARENTS WHO SEND THEIR
CHILDREN TO THESE FACILITIES OFTEN SIGN CONTRACTS THAT
GRANT SOLE DISCRETION TO THE FACILITY FOR SCHOOLING AS
WELL AS DISCIPLINE WHICH CAN INCLUDE THE USE OF
RESTRAINTS, CHEMICAL AGENTS, AND ISOLATION IF NECESSRY
REVIEW AUTHORITY: Charles Lahiguera, Senior

PURPOSES OF THE PROGRAM. THEY THEN FIND THEMSELVES
ISOLATED IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITHOUT ACCESS TO
OUTSIDE SUPPORT. PARENTS TYPICALLY AGREE TO HOLD THE
FACILITIES HARMLESS (NOT LIABLE) FOR ANY DAMAGES
CAUSED BY MISTAKES IN JUDGMENT OR ACTIONS OF THE
PROGRAM STAFF. CHILDREN AND PARENTS CONTACT ONE
ANOTHER THROUGH A DESIGNATED CASE WORKER.
3. WHILE THERE ARE MANY REPORTED SUCCESS STORIES, THE
OVERALL TRACK RECORD OF THESE FACILITIES IS MIXED.
SINCE OWNERS ESTABLISH OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES WHERE
THEY CAN OPERATE IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF LITTLE OR NO
UNCLASSIFIED

GOVERNMENT REGULATION, THERE EXISTS THE POTENTIALILTLY
FOR NEGLECT OR MISTREATMENT OF ENROLLEES BY THE STAFF
OF THE FACILITIES. CONSEQUENTLY, ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE
AND NEGLECT WHICH SURFACE PERIODICALLY, MUST ALL BE
TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY BY POSTS CONSULAR OFFICER.
THESE CASES TEND TO DRAW HEAVILY ON PERSONNEL
RESOURCES, PARTICULARLY AT OUR SMALLER POSTS, AND HAVE
ALSO GENERATED HIGH PROFILE ATTENTION FROM THE U.S.
MEDIA.
4. SAMOA HOSTS THREE OF THESE PROGRAMS - "PARADISE
COVE", "A BETTER vvAr AND "PACIFIC COAST ACADEMY."
"NEW HOPE ACADEMY" RECENTLY CLOSED. PARADISE COVE HAS
BEEN SUFFERING FROM DECLINING ENROLLMENT, IN LARGE
PART BECAUSE OF BAD PRESS AND GOS INVESTIGATIONS INTO
ITS OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, PER REF C, THE GOS PLANS
TO ADOPT NEW REGULATIONS AND IMPOSE TAXES ON BEHAVIOR
MODIFICATION FACILITIES IN SAMOA. THE DIRECTOR OF
PARADISE COVE, MR. BRIAN VAIFANUA, IS REPORTEDLY NOW
SEEKING TO RELOCATE THE FACILITY TO A NEW SITE,
POSSIBLY FIJI.
5. POST IS REQUESTED TO CONTACT THE FIJI MINISTRY OF
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND OFFER TO REVIEW OUR EXPERIENCES
WITH THIS AND SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN SAMOA. POST SHOULD
ADVISE THE GOF THAT THESE PROGRAMS HAVE RECENTLY
GENERATED EXPOSE PIECES BY AMERICAN NEWS SHOWS.
SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT OF FIJI DECIDE TO PERMIT
ESTABLISHMENT OF A YOUTH CAMP, POST SHOULD OFFER TO
COOPERATE WITH THE GOF TO MAKE THE OPERATIONS
TRANSPARENT AND "BY THE BOOK." POST SHOULD DRAW ON
UNCLASSIFIED
PAGE 04 STATE 124313 020155Z
THE POINTS IN REF A TO REMIND THE GOF OF ITS
RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE FACILITY, TO PROVIDE FOR
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF AMCITS ENROLLED, AND TO
REQUIRE FACILITIES TO GRANT CONSULAR ACCESS IN ACCORD
WITH ARTICLE 36-1(A) OF THE VIENNA CONVENTION ON
CONSULAR RELATIONS (THE 1951 U.S.-U.K. BILATERAL

POST SHOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE GOF TO CONTINUE
CONSULTATIONS WITH THE SAMOAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH MIGHT
BE WILLING TO SHARE ITS IDEA FOR A COMPREHENSIVE
REGULATORY SCHEME FOR SUCH FACILITIES.

            Is anybody totally pissed-off???  My God, when is enough enough?  As society crumbles away before our eyes, we are barely being spoon-fed.  It WILL come to fruition.  Mentally, we are and have been prepared.  And the New Year?  Perfect time to start the physical preparation.

            After a first read it seems like there's not much here. Seems like more Russia stuff than Pizza stuff. Some digging is required. One message stood out to me: (Doc No. C06426462 pg. 28)

            Wanted to speak for a moment about Israel's announcement of changes to its Gaza policy.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you know, Israel will be spelling out a new policy in the next few hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have come a long way, and gone well beyond where we expected them to go. Clearly, they can go further. For example, there is no direct reference to increasing commerce between Gaza and the West Bank - something that the PA would like to see. We should keep pressing the Israelis to take additional steps such as this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know the Quartet envoys are discussing a statement in response. I believe a statement is important, because this is such a central issue and exactly the sort of moment where the Quartet's voice should be heard.
            <em>
             It can also add momentum to the process of reform of this policy.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            [...]
Through a properly balanced statement that responds positively to the specific steps Israel has announced and challenges them to imlement swiftly and to go further, the Quartet will be doing its job, and
            <em>
             can serve as an oversight mechanism
            </em>
            to make sure there is follow-through.
           </p>
           <p>
            [...]
I hope you will instruct your Quartet envoy to
            <em>
             work with our team on text,
            </em>
            and perhaps we can follow up with a principals call tomorrow."

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartet_on_the_Middle_East">
             The Quartet
            </a>
            refers to the Quartet on the Middle East of The US, EU, Russia, and the UN involved in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
           </p>
           <p>
            The timeline is important to note here. Not one month prior, Obama admin lifted sanctions on Russian state arms export agency, which had been sanctioned for exporting arms to Iran. Sergei Lavrov is the Russian Foreign Minister. MSM articles at the time said the lifting of sanctions was part of a deal to get Russia on board
            <a href="http://archive.is/q4hPe">
             for international sanctions on Iran
            </a>
            . Could Lavrov's input on the Quartet's Palestine policy be a part of this deal? pay for play?

             Why indeed are these foundations so important to these people? Spirit cultural exchange claims that it costs the tax payer zero money, but common sense tells me that it robs local kids from a summer or winter job. That is bad for America. Then they claim that private funders pay for all of this. If that were true then why would they need the Federal government's help to bring these foreign kids over? Now onto the claim that it brings tons of money into the USA every year. Folks, we have been duped since 1961.

              They tell these children that they will have jobs like waiters, beauty shop attendants, etc. A lot are used as slave labor in nail shops, chicken farms in the south or all out sexual toys for the pedos.  The NYT did a series of stories years ago where Asian girls were brought over to work in nail salons. They worked 14-15 hour days sometimes more and every day. They were all jammed into little rooms to sleep. Not much food and little to no pay. Said had to pay off debt for coming over and then would charge for food and room. They never could pay off their debt.  Kids working in chicken farms disappear and are never seen again.

            You know they brushed through this with a fine toothed comb before it was given out to the public. Anything pertaining to the pedophile swamp or the creatures that reside in it has been conveniently redacted or left out. FOIA is a joke unless you get lucky and someone didn’t pay attention to what they were taking the black marker to.

             Pizza stuff is definitely in there. Start with Paradise Cove and "embassies" that have access to "behavioral modification camps" to find the places that lock kids in boxes, burn them and have had WWASP camps shut down all over the world as a result of multiple lawsuits.

             Oh yeah... it's run out of Utah. Anyone remember the Pace Memorandum?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also... "Teen Escort Service" is involved. If you aren't familiar, it's a rendition program that kidnaps troubled teens to take them to these camps.

                 Tobacco is surprisingly easy to grow, and the actual farmers get nothing even when they own their land outright. Some of the best tobacco in the old days was grown in N. Florida, thus the still standing giant tobacco drying barns. History and Heritage - Gadsden County Chamber of Commerce

                 Sounds like a great marketing gimmick. 101, attach your brand to something popular. I would not. I am probably biased, but I buy my tobacco from native sources. It is also more affordable. Watch out for the ATF. Native Pride (tm) Seneca tribe is under 35$ a carton in Florida and most of the cost is taxes.

              all i did was click on the one listed as policy in mexico city, and when i tried to go back to the main page, all the emails disappeared too. i'm not very geeky, so i couldn't figure out what happened. i'm a little relieved that it happened to someone else too.

            <p>
             Tom Fitton, president of the center-right government transparency group Judicial Watch, said Friday in a statement that he wasn't surprised Weiner's computer contained material he was forbidden to see.
            </p>
            <p>
             'As we expected, there is classified information on Anthony Weiner’s laptop – thanks to Hillary Clinton’s illicit email games,' Fitton said.
            </p>
            <p>
             'The Justice Department should launch an immediate criminal investigation.'

            This will not end very well for Weiner and Huma. And hopefully Hillary too.

            This is going to be the core of the docs.  Don't expect PG stuff in there.  Or if there is, only "we" will understand it.
