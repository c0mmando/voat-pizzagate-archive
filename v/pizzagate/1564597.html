            Anonymous5 seems sketchy. If David Koresh was helping children escape why didn't he or anyone in that compound tell that to the press? It doesn't make sense. A better explanation is the tanks were brought in after ATF lost like 4 deputies during the initial round of fighting.

             Are you talking about this one? I mean there are probably more groups then "the jews". I bet there is some Chinese group is starting some shit as well. It makes ya think though.

              When the Chinese eventually reach the GDP per capita of Taiwan and unless the west brings them down through opium once again, they will dominate the planet, have no doubt. What they lack in an adequate elite they make up in sheer numbers.

            Can someone explain why it would make sense that these folks were doing this "underground railroad" style? There are tons of organizations that claim to be saving kids from trafficking. A fair number are likely making those claims falsely but why is the covert effort needed? It would make much more sense that they were maliciously involved, discovered and destroyed to stop further outside investigations to the strangeness of the compound. Just my 2C

             Stealing kids from kid stealers, rather than explain to authorities just cover it up. They could of saved most of the children there, but most of them ended up being dead crushed under the building, the fire, shootout, etc. That's how this theory goes.

            I've seen some evidence Koresh may have been running a brainwashing center of some kind. I'm not sure, so don't trust me, but look into it on your own.

             Yeah there are some conflicting reports of that while doing a search. But it makes you think how long has the government been trying to control the narrative through media. And what is the actually truth. There seems to be a justification for possible crimes for everything nowadays. I mean if I just watched CNN I would have thought freaking Assange was a pedophile if I was sheeple.

            In the comments section of the first link someone asked for proof of these claims. I see no proof has been provided. This is just nonsensical unless the next claim is going to be that David Koresh was CIA and using PSYOPS in his interviews to make himself appear to be running a cult when in fact he had an underground railroad going (which would mean CIA was running the railroad...but wait, because I thought CIA was RUNNING these pedophile rings???). Hard to keep conspiracy theories straight when you come up with so many of them. Perhaps people should stop.

             Shills bombard Anonymous5's way too much. Anonymous5 leads people to research on what he said first, then the commentators ask questions on it then he expands more info based on their research or helps guide them a bit further. He also trolls shills all the time in these threads.

             All you said here is just dumb haha. It was a cover up at Waco. CIA probably had no involvement working with David. Read the whole thread. Read the rest of his threads.

              <p>
               How anonymous5 does these threads is a more lenient FBIanon, he wants the people to research more on these subjects more than just spouting out information for you to accept as true. I said read the whole thread he replies to other people with information and asks them to dig deeper on what they already have, he agrees to a comment they made, or dismisses what they found. Anonymous5 also continues talks on these subjects in other threads because people still ask questions about it. Anonymous5 doesn't answer a question all the time straight up much like FBIanon, but hey sometimes he does. Information kind of supporting the threads details are throughout the comments. And similar to FBIanons AMAs sometimes we have to find the truths to a thread by ourselves. Its all intersting stuff in Anonymous5's threads I encourage people to read them. He kind of helps pizzagate investigators a few times in each thread, but he covers a various amount of subjects in other threads.

                Anon5 is not completely trustworthy. He sprinkles truth and interesting ideas but he never ever confirms anything nor even points where to look. I only find him interesting because he brings up other angles to look at events with but he clearly has his own agenda.

                I see. Well, here is the thing. FBIAnon proved himself, mostly because I was tied up with other research and did not get to his information until a few months after he posted, by which time many of his predictions had come to pass. So he has credibility. Conversely, there are too many people/entities calling themselves "Anonymous", and I have caught more than one such person/entity contracting himself/themselves. I am automatically suspicious for that reason.

                 Also got to add, I think FBIanon in one of his 7 AMAs said Anonymous5 was legit. High Level Insider not so much though.

                 I think Anonymous5 is legit, not so much any others, except FBIanon. Scroll through his archives start from one of his first threads then lead to his last. Some things he adds in there make you want to laugh though. You will see it around the beginning.

                 Well yeah everyone on 4chan is named Anonymous unless they add a specific display name for their thread, even Anonymous5 has some imposters in a thread with the same name. But its all having faith in these things, we can all discredit a piece or all of what FBIanon said unless you start reading everything and things start to make sense. And I don't think Anonymous5 made much predictions. His biggest is a possible E.U. Army. Its all good reads, makes you think twice about certain subjects he brings up. If you are real deal researcher then I guess take your time with the threads.
