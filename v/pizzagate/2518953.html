                 at one point, military was sending in advisors for the movies
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm thinking CIA could have been on deck as advisors too
                </p>
                <p>
                 read where Damon's going to be moving out of the US
                </p>
                <p>
                 Getting too hot for him?
                </p>
                <p>
                 and Affleck, he's been getting bad press too

                   If you look into it, the Clintons had a big hand in putting in Haiti's government

                   it's the same MO that was used in other Countries

                   They put people in that will turn blind eyes while collecting money

                   Saddam Hussein and  Gaddafi  wouldn't play ball and look what happened to them
