<p>Term <strong>&quot;pedophilia&quot;</strong> has not been introduced in any bills to the current 115th government and it\'s been rare in the history of the governments as well. You can find it mentioned in the bills only <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?congress=114#text=pedophilia&amp;sort=-current_status_date&amp;congress=__ALL__">8 times during the past 27 years</a> out of which every passed legistlative bill is related to limiting pedophilia out of disabled persons.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hconres107/text">an agreement to disagree on 1998</a> with an article by the American Psychological Association claiming that <a href="http://www.ageofconsent.com/comments/numbertwentyone.htm">pedophilia might be positive for children</a>. (not the original article)</p>

<p>ps. Stay in touch with your Senator. As an example, here\'s couple of the current bills to support: H.R. 53 <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr53">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr53</a> &amp; H.R. 436 <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr436/summary">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr436/summary</a> (There are plenty of others too)</p>',

            I've made a series of posts looking at all the members of the

            While I haven't reviewed their entire legislative histories, I've noted several who sponsored bills in this area, or who came out to support the issue in related ways like pushing through the confirmation of Jeff Sessions.
           </p>

            This is vital work, I hope you'll keep on with it. I certainly plan to.

             It's a minor sideline in my studies (mostly because the slow speed of the political edcision making), so I'm happy that you plan to. Let's keep each other up to date on related dots we run into.
