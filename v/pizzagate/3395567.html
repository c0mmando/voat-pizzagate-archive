<p>Hold onto your hats, folks, the Storm is upon us and Patrick Byrne is helping it sweep out the Deep State scum. He hinted at the FBI having a cabal of Deep State agents within the FBI ... and focused on one in particular who gave him \'\'fishy orders\'\' that didn\'t seem right. Well, now he\'s resigned from his company amidst threats that it, and his life, would be ground into dust and revealed the name of this Deep State agents on FOX and the name is: PETER STRZOK!</p>
<p>Holy shit! For those of you who thought this didn\'t have legs, this should prove the validity of what Byrne is talking about. There would be no way in hell he\'d resign from the company he built and dare put himself up against the very well-connected STRZOK without a very good reason to do so. It\'s not a position anyone would choose to be in because they were launching a new bitcoin stock?!!! No, I do not think so. </p>
<p>Byrne is the man! I say, &quot;Go, Patrick Byrne!\'\' If he really does have the goods on that asshole Strzok, he\'s just passed it onto AG Barr and that\'s good for all of us. It\'s the hook to get to senior people over Strzok and the beginning of some pretty interesting arrests. </p>

<p>Overstock founder and CEO Patrick Byrne, who resigned Thursday amid ties to a government probe related to the 2016 election, claimed he received &quot;fishy&quot; orders from former FBI official Peter Strzok.</p>
<p>Byrne said Thursday on &quot;The Story&quot; he\'d helped the federal government with investigations twice in the past, including to &quot;help them take down people on Wall Street.&quot;</p>
<p>Several years after Byrne\'s last contact with the government, he said FBI officials reached out to him in 2016.</p>
<p>&quot;I was given some fishy orders and I carried them out in 2015-2016, thinking I was conducting law enforcement,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>I\'m sure there are some that are still skeptical, but think of the way the Deep State works in putting wrap-up smears out to discredit people. They\'ve already down it with Byrne in news reports that label him as slightly loony. How the hell does a guy who creates a multi-million dollar business get labeled a loony tune? Well, a lot has to do with who they\'re going after and Strzok is one player this \'\'destructive Deep State\'\' does not want brought down.</p>',

             I'm not gonna get upset with anyone differing with what I'm posting ... or the perspective I'm viewing things through. Nothing's proven, but the nod Corey Lewandowski and Sara A. Carter make me think my hunch is correct and that this did indeed happen. But remember, he doesn't know the true story, he only knows what people told him and what he's extrapolating from it. I believe the true game is slightly different from his version of things. Waiting to see how this develops.

            Strzok's face , last summer in congressional hearings looked demonic......he was smiling inappropriately...arrogant and down right evil. The only face that I have ever seen to show so much is ex pope.......the one in exile.  If you watch videos of Strzok in those  hearings , you will see it too.

             I was just gonna post that the only thing that made me actually consider the reptilian/shapeshifter theory as possible was watching Strozk during that hearing.  Comical, yet bizarrely sinister.   It was like he was puppeteered into creating a whole vault of meme pics.

               Yes, and that right there is fishy so it backs up his story.

              <p>
               I mean, why didn't they have one of their operatives ''date'' her? Why ask him? And why ask anyone to ''date'' her?

               It's weird ... and then there's the reason for ''dating'' her. I'm assuming there was something they wanted to find out? The whole think ''stanks''.

                This guy pings my BS meter, too. One thing worth considering is: What did they have on him that got him to "help" them by dating Butina and doing the other stuff he did?  It doesn't make sense that a guy would risk the company he created -- either for a LARP or to "help with law enforcement." Doesn't add up.

                 Understood, but you're not taking into account his background. He's helped with the feddies before. That makes a huge difference. Those other times he's helped, nothing's gone awry, but this time, something did in that he received those "fishy" orders to reconnect with Maria Butina.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And, again, he's ''guessing'' at what happened. Have you ever been in a position either at work or in your personal life where you had to put pieces together to figure out what the hell is going on? I'm certain it must have happened in your role on Voat. You've had to run into times when you had fragments of a story, but not the entire one so you had to guess. Weren't your guesses sometimes really, really flawed? And looking back, didn't you seem a little bit flaky because you weren't psychic and couldn't put everything together flawlessly?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I know I've been there and done that and it seems to be where this guy is. But he does cough up names. And Comey is responding. And we don't know WTH Byrne had that he turned over to the DOJ. That's the unknown for us to make a really knowledgeable assessment. My best guess is that it leads straight to FISA and leverage for Barr to get to those reports being withheld by Wray.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But if we take your spin on things, okay, let's speculate that Byrne is being blackmailed. Okay, why have him come forward with this? A distraction? If it's a distraction, it's a pretty strange one since he loses his entire company in coming forth knowing that the distraction isn't going to last long. I mean, if he comes out with another statement in the next couple of weeks and the DOJ never responds regarding what he's dropped off? Or the indie ''friendly to Trump'' journalists never get a leak to tell us the DOJ is finding something pretty damned interesting in what Byrne dropped off, then Byrne goes away. He's history ... he drops in that memory hole where others before him have slid into obscurity and for what? Since this is your scenario, you tell me what they have to gain to do this? I'm assuming you mean Comey &amp; Co. so why did they have him come forward and tell his story, when what he's really saying is that the FBI committed treason by infiltrating three presidential campaigns WITH NO CRIME. Remember, there was no crime they were following up on, and for the FBI to investigate and infiltrate private citizens, citizens that were, again, running for president, they would be committing treason because of what was at stake. It would be proof of them working for info to blackmail these individuals or control them? So how does floating a ''fake'' story about what is most likely a ''true'' story, in that, they most likely did try to do this, helping anyone? All it's presenting to people the possibility that this happened. But maybe you have a reason so I'm more than eager to hear. Why? What did they hope to gain? And why blow a huge asset like Byrne on something trivial that really works against them?

            Trust the DOJ.....not even for one minute. Barrs daddy hired pedo/vore Epstein . Go back to the Bush years,and see Barr do nothing but collect a tax payer funded paycheck. Trust the plan..my ass. 20 bucks says airplane accident. Heart failure.

             It's really not that simple. And I do trust Barr. I may regret that decision, but the Deep State is not happy.

             Never thought of it that way, but it would make a great movie. Especially with the way Byrne was dragged into being an asset through a murder investigation.

              Matt Damon clearly has to play Byrne... And there's gotta be a fight somewhere in it. Peewee Herman can play Peter Strzok and Alec Baldwin as Comey.

             It is.
            </p>
            <p>
             He's pushing all the buttons that make this credible. Most especially, is his involvement with Maria Butina. Does anyone think Russian spies become sexually involved with someone w/o a good reason? It's like that Q post about celebrities not marrying for love. How would he have even attracted her attention? And she was called out by this Russian Witch Hunt and convicted?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, no, no! That does not happen without a reason. And she was with PATRICK BYRNE! But let's look at this another way ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Patrick Byrne did some dicey things ... things he evidently wouldn't have done w/o these ''orders'' given by someone. Now presumably, he's not the flake the propagandist news is making him out to be and he saved the communications. If he didn't, what would he have been handing over? So we can read this one of two ways: (1) the orders were given or (2) the orders weren't given and he's trying to fake a chain of command to get his butt out of a sling for doing illegal activities.

             If it's the first, hey, YEAH for our side! We have Peter Strzok's butt in a sling! If it's the second. YEAH for our side! He had to be doing this for a reason and the reason would still tie back to this WITCH HUNT!

             I see this as a win-win whichever way it falls. One way, he's a hero. The other, he's scummy as hell. But it all reflects and is another reason for AG Barr to open an investigation and get to not only Strzok, but Comey! And if you get to Comey? Skankles is going down!

                Oh that was Wayfair.  Not Overstock.  My bad.  The NRA thing is interesting as they have had Russian honeytraps inside the gates before.  Unfortunately, I can't publicly substantiate this, I only know from seeing it first hand 20+ years ago.

                 I'm sure Russia and the Deep State would love nothing better than getting their hooks into that organization and reducing it to walnut sauce to spread over their agenda when it's crammed down our throats.

             Why wouldn't someone in business say that? If it's being looked at out of context, anything could look suspicious. But Buffet pretty much equates with big business and making money so this is not surprising.

             Definitely was for HER protection. If anything happened, the FBI would be all over it and run interference for her. It also kept them in the loop as to how players in the cabal were behaving. Look, she had to have had help and who do you think were helping her?

             This is not a big enough story to memory hole Epstein ... not yet anyway.

             And Epstein was memory holed when the body was found. That's the way it is. The ''suicide'' took care of erasing it. Nothing could be more effective than that. If the person at the center of the controversy is removed, so is interest.

             You think so? By naming Peter Strzok?
            </p>
            <p>
             It really doesn't surprise me that Skankles was under surveillance. She was their Holy Grail and the only one that could effectively carry the message of perversity and genderless depravity and make it normal enough for people to elect the candidate representing it. Rubio, Cruz, and Trump we knew about. And Clinton, well, she actually was supposed to be under surveillance because of the email deletions. They had to control and at least make it look good, so I'm not worried about that, but can see where some would be.
            </p>
            <p>
             It could well be what you're saying, but right now, I don't see that. if Byrne's story is true, there's a very legitimate reason for him to have been called into play and used as a patsy.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no sense of loyalty to him if he turns about to be another disinfoist. I've already cut one wanna be disinfoist out of my picture. But if he is what he says, then, yeah, we owe him a lot. I think we'll all be able to tell more as we see how things play out.

              I now agree with your observations and conclusions, all the way, Sir. This is borderline gamechanging. He says there are other people with similar stories? There’s a shitstorm coming. And there will be deaths. (Koch just died, maybe he decided to just take off a bit early?)

               I am VERY upset about that. Really bad timing ... really bad. But then the people fighting for truth don't have access to the "immortality serum" the cabal is injecting. And even if they had access, they wouldn't take it since it involves torture and deaths of innocent children and babies.

               You are getting exactly what I'm talking about. This just has all the buttons going for ... including it being so bizarre. It really does feel like he was dragged into this ... and he was.

                   It is. And I think what some people are missing is that this is what Byrne is CONCLUDING ... NOT what he was told!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Like blackmailing Skankles, that's conjecture on what he's piecing together on what he knows and what he was given to do which is still a big secret. But when ''I'' look at it, I see that he was supposed to:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    Patrick Byrne, who just resigned as CEO of Overstock.com today, said the FBI "got hijacked" and the "Men in Black," those at the top, were part of a conspiracy to set up Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Rubio, and Cruz.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Byrne said after he reported contact from Russian national Maria Butina to the federal authorities he was approached by "the men in black" and encouraged to have a relationship with her. The businessman said Butina was being set up by the "men in black" to approach and build contacts with people in the Trump campaign, Clinton campaign, and even with Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   So while he sees SKANKLES being targeted, all I see is that they're trying to infiltrate the Republican party. Remember that Byrne is saying he's not a Republican, he's a Libertarian. So he's maybe seeing this from a different perspective ... or he was set up to believe the FBI (or the CIA or both because we don't exactly know what the CIA involvement was either) wanted him to contact in all four groups, but what if it were three? In other words, the excuse for contacts would be, hey! All three are running whereas Skankles was selected as the candidate. So again a snippet:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    MACCALLUM:  So, do you think she was set up by the men in black to approach people in the Trump administration?  Is that possibility?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    BYRNE:  It was all a -- 100 percent.  They knew she was trying to approach, and her instructions were, to approach -- she had to build a contact with anyone in the Hillary Clinton, Rubio, Cruz, or Trump.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And they knew that because she told me and I let them know.  And they let -- it all happened.  I could have told you in December of 2015, I had a suspicion forming in my mind -- It was really quite strange, because she had initially checked off -- she doesn't like, she’s -- Democrats, she is much more of Republican and a much more of small L liberation -- she's a Milton Friedman fan.  I’m a Milton Friedman guy.
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   You see how MacCallum is picking up on this being about Trump and Byrne shying away from it. And Maria, she's a Milton Friedman guy? Really? Why do I doubt this? Obviously, someone had done their homework on Byrne and knew HE was a Milton Friedman guy. This is Setting Someone Else by Pretending a Common Interest 101.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So everyone that's picking up on him being a little out there, he's might be, but the real problem is that he's guessing at what the pieces mean, but he's absolutely sure that these MEN IN BLACK tried to set up presidential campaigns when that is absolutely illegal and treasonous for the FBI to be engaged in. That is not their job to set politicians up. NOT.

              sometimes FBI looked like good guys like when before the election comey, head of FBI, announced he was investigating emails on weiner's laptop between huma and hillary, was kind of based at that time. I think it was definitely done by him to hurt her in the election. Speaking of strzok, he changed a memo comey wrote to make it go from showing hillary's emails were illegal to saying they weren't. He was the mole, Comey seemed like he knew he couldn't fight the system but went and did a based press conference where once the info was out there it couldn't be taken back like pandora's box, he couldn't arrest hillary but could hurt her campaign.

               Well, we see things differently. You're painting a rosy picture where I believe he positions himself in the middle. It's how he survived a long career with the FBI ... by walking that tightrope and playing both sides. But he's done enough things for me to believe he's a dirty boy.

                definitely don't think it's super rosy, comey was just one guy where most of FBI was and is corrupt. Just some of his moves were not bad. You're right he survived a long time in FBI but then made some decent moves then no longer did survive. He went and did say russia colluded then trump fired him for it. I think he got pressured into saying russia collusion was real, esarlier before the election he refused to say that, so he did lie and say it but after it didn't matter, he probably thought that would be ok.  Trump said comey better hope there are no tapes of his conversation with him, I bet in the conversation with trump Comey said stuff like he knew russia collusion wasn't real but said there was to make others happy. Trump probably said that is unacceptable and he'd better go backj out sand tell the press there was no collusion or comey'd be fired, he refused so got fired. Comey was probably worried about being epsteined. Comey is troubled, super christian, but worked at FBI and had to do dirty things, he probably sits at home now with a troubled conscious.

                 No, this did not happen except in Comey's addled brain. I can just picture him standing in that cornfield ... Barr will have an easy time finding him there.

                  I mean comey said it, I do agree it was a fake news hoax. And I think he knew it. He didn't say this before the election. Sometimes I think Obama knew Hillary was terrible too and that is why he didn't take russia collusion seriously before the election. Also Comey's daughter was a prosecutor of epstein, I think that is one of the real reasons he was getting prosecuted again in the first place after getting slaps on the wrist before.

                   The Manchurian Candidate's problems with Skankles has to do with them both wanting the same position. But TMC had the "race" thing going for him. It meant the press and everyone else was pressured to lay off of him. Skankles had the "woman" thing, but it's not hardly the same. So TMC was installed to put the US on the path of destruction, and Skankles was given the honor of the coup de gras. All she had to do was open up those borders between Mexico and Canada, and you turn the US into a parking lot and giant mall. We immediately lose our identity and sovereignty, not only from having no actual territory anymore, but from foreigners streaming in at will. Look at what happened with the immigration that has taken place. Scum like Omar and Tlaib and Cortez have been elected.

                    I hear you on all that. One thing I didn't like was during Obama's president years, press went easy on him, now are rabid dogs on trump. I think when Trump was running against Hillary, he went and looked back to 2008 and saw how Obama had run against her in that primary and won and got tips. Obama called her corrupt, and it was true so he got popular, but then put her in as sec of state which looked bad. He probably had no choice, being a manchurian. Obama was CIA and worked at business international. Bill Clinton was also CIA. With Hillary, just too brain addled, was just Bill's wife, pretty dumb herself, not an actual CIA agent herself, she would have been controlled by Bill and also Huma who is CIA.
