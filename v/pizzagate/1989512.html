<p>An official with the Department of Homeland Security volunteering at the event said there are hundreds of cases of prostitution and labor exploitation in southeastern Wisconsin, and described Kenosha as a “stopping spot” between Chicago and Milwaukee.</p>
<p>“Human trafficking is an issue everywhere, and we need to do a better job of educating the public about it,” said Kenosha Police Officer Jeff Wamboldt. “Twelve and 13-year-olds are the primary target, that’s middle schoolers. We need to get the word out to parents and teachers.”</p>
<p>Wamboldt recommends parents pay attention to their child’s demeanor and social media accounts. “If your child is being targeted, there is going to be a change. Dig around and ask questions,” he added.</p>
<p>Chris Oertel, director of Royal Family KIDS, a local camp for abused children in and around Kenosha and Racine counties, attended the event and said she hopes it will encourage locals and law enforcement officials to focus more attention on child sexual abuse.</p>

            There was much  much occultism in Germany.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adam Weishaupt was considered German.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very damaging man.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was initiated into the Masonic Lodge.
           </p>
           <p>
            He loved to do damage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people consider him  the founder of Illuminati
(My opinion is:  organization goes back to before the birth  of Jesus.)
Weishaup was also a Jesuit I believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand many many Germans immigrated to Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Wisc.even has a city named Germantown.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have visited Wisc.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing that stuck out to me
was how many German 
restaurants there were around compared to where I lived.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also  heard from reliable source: the German Wisc. 
Catholics as a whole hated the German Wisc. Lutherans.
And vice-versa.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean hated.
Was very very  stunned by that.
Because I considered both Christians.

            There are quite a few Catholics in Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wisconsin archdiocese had many many  sexual abusers.

           <p>
            Just my opinion ok?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think CIA used Catholic Priests to traumatize and 
prepare children for  MK Ultra Training n the 1950s and 1960s.

              This great work has evolved.
Founded in 2003.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was started by survivors and some benefactors
so I understand.

             <p>
              I think it is priceless.

              They update very very frequently.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have found it true and reliable so far.

             This is why they brought Timothy Dolan from St. Louis to Milwaukee to cover up the catholic church corruption and pedogate scandals, and he was rewarded with a promotion to Archbishop. He may be in line to be the only American Pope. Since they already control the Vatican, now they are now using all denominations in their circle of corruption with groups such as Racine Interfaith Coalition including corrupt satanic churches, islamic groups, veterans groups, senior groups and family services organizations. They leverage corrupt non profits and organizations like United Way and Rotary International as part of their control mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
             A real key to unlocking the bigger picture are the Foundations used to launder, extort, embezzle, evade taxes, and control local, regional, national and global initiatives. There are several in Racine alone that are also tied to the Clinton Foundation, McCain Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative and others. This all connects to the United Nations Agenda 2030 and the lie of Sustainable Development which began in Racine, Wisconsin. They are also using Sanctuary Cities as part of the system of rigging elections, hiding abuse and trafficking, and sheltering mafia and gangs involved including MS-13.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recently they started another organization to control the narrative and investigations into Pizzagate and human trafficking called The Fight to End Exploitation. This is directly linked with corrupt area churches, the mafia, local corrupt foundations, corrupt law enforcement, groups affiliated with Blink 182 and Penn State University, Arizona State University, McCain Foundation, Gates Foundation, Clinton Foundation, and with Ashton Kutcher and the Hollywood elite.
            </p>
            <p>
             The central groups behind all of this who are connected to Racine are the Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, and Council of 13. It goes back to Black Nobility and Kabbala which is how Ashton Kutcher, the Podestas and the Emanuels are all involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are set to control AI and the masses through imprisonment, enslavement and all means necessary to further their agenda.

               There was a bit of a stir regarding the owner's hatred of Trump, and the company is based in Marquette Mafia land in Wauwatosa near Milwaukee where Scott Walker is from. Mafia and freemasons rule the area along with many Foundations.
              </p>

               Here is a related group that does have some overlap with Penzys Spices and area Foundations through the Urban Ecology Center.

                Yeah, back in winter I commented on FB about on one of the PG debunkings. I didn't say PG was real or anything, just that the debunking was bunk and that debunkers should put a little more effort in since reality is not so easy to prove these days. Some lady  with a their logo as a profile pic gave me some cheeky, sort of cryptic reply. Anyway, found the trend of child abuse going unpunished, including a DA's son, continues in that town and county. Plus, they use disney font and there logo is sort of heart within in a scribbley heart. Also, the spice biz, travel and import &amp; export, along with the family's military connections, seemed like a useful front for trafficking. I'm far, far away from WI though, so never went further with it.

                 Look at SCJ's global locations including Pakistan, Haiti, Ghana, Brazil, and many other hubs of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. They are a private corporation with a history of pedo and trafficking crimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Racine has a fully controlled international airport, harbor, interstate, and corrupt police force. It is a main hub for trafficking, and those who are acting as if they are investigating it are the ones involved such as with the recently formed group The Fight to End Exploitation. Ashton Kutcher (real name is Chris, he is involved in Freemasonry and Kabbalah) was supposed to be a front man for the group but backed out of a recent event because they know the real truth is being exposed about Racine, Wisconsin and its ties to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                 See more global ties with United Way and Rotary, and to United Nations Agenda 2030 based on the lie of Sustainable Development which was formed in Racine with the Clintons. There are foundations throughout Wisconsin that are involved alongside corrupt corporations, corrupt churches, PACs, secret societies, and the mafia.

             You should know by now that everyone we have written is true about Racine (and Kenosha). The entire area is controlled by the mafia, secret societies, foundations, PACs, Rotary clubs, United Way, and corrupt organizations and corporations engaged in all levels of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Please help shine the light on Racine and Kenosha. This is why corrupt Boy Scouts Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker have so much undeserved power. They are financed by and working for these groups. Many judges, attorneys and administrators are part of the Marquette Mafia which may sound strange but is connected with these other groups. It is a system of interconnected corrupt networks.

              Do you know as a child I remember sitting in a restaurant in Kenosha and an older man kept smiling and paying way too much attention to me.  Not like a stranger in the market, retail store, etc. I was probably 5 or 6 and I have never forgotten this incident and I am way much older now.  I knew as a small child that it was "different" in some way.  We will take these bastards down!

               The entire area is a cesspool of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. These communities are not normal. Anyone from outside the area will soon recognize that something is in the water, and that it is much like a real-world Truman Show. Kenosha and Racine are connected at the hip through the mafia, corporate partners, and secret societies. Those who are involved openly declare they are immune to all laws, untouchable, and that if you ask questions they will destroy you and your families. They are not lying. They control all local and state authorities, boards, government, industries, organizations, churches and foundations. They use foundations as a way to control program funding and put themselves in power positions to avoid being exposed at any level.
              </p>
              <p>
               They are also involved in brazen levels of embezzlement, evasion, extortion, fraud, bid rigging, election and vote rigging, trafficking, abuse, gang stalking, intimidation, retaliation, attempted murder and murder. There are many mafia families still active in Kenosha, Racine, and Milwaukee. They want everyone to know they are untouchable and protected by gangs, mafia, secret societies and corrupt authorities. They are completely out of control, which is why Racine has become a major weak link as a root to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. They are currently in deep cover-up mode with nearly every major official involved resigning in a long list of moves to hide the real truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those who are involved are deathly afraid of the truth getting out about Racine, Wisconsin. They are running scared. We need to shine the light on Racine for the world to see the real truth and their real agenda which is to control and enslave the world using Sustainability, Community Policing, AI, fear and other means.
              </p>
              <p>
               The people have the power to change the world, but our window is closing. Once AI takes hold, it will be too late for the world to know the real truth.

               That is correct. Here are the others in the U.S. below. Notice how many are in other known hubs for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption (including DC, Denver, Chicago, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Omaha, New Orleans).

               The Great Twenty-Eight
The 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States (listed below) are located in 18 states and the District of Columbia. The institutions range from major research universities to comprehensive universities; from smaller colleges and universities that combine the liberal arts and professional studies to one strictly liberal arts college. In addition to being among 221 Catholic institutions and 1,600 independent colleges and universities in the United States, American Jesuit colleges and universities are part of a network of approximately 189 Jesuit institutions of higher learning throughout the world, thus having the distinction of being at once local, national and international.

            Someone may have mentioned this.
Racine is home to old family 
owned company:
           </p>
           <p>
            Johnson  Company.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people confuse Johnson&amp;Johnson  (pharma) with Johnson
Wax. 
Racine's Johnson Company is not a public company.
It is privately owned.

             The main company involved is SC Johnson with their partners CNH, Modine, Twin Disc, Wheaton Franciscan, DuPont, Dow, Bayer, Monsanto, ConAgra, Cargill, and many others. They are connected to the Pilgrims Society through John Jeffry Louis and to the Council of 13 through the Rockefellers and Rothschilds.

ownership..

               There is much more to it, and also to shelter for their partners and associates such as Bayer, Monsanto and DuPont for example. They have been acquiring more companies and setting up more foundations. It goes back to John Jeffry Louis and the Pilgrims Society and the Council of 13. They are closely linked with the Rockefellers and Rothschilds.

            Royal Family Kids' Camps, Inc. (RFKC) (The punctuation is correct as it reflects the ownership of the camps as belonging to the kids. RFKC, Inc. is the corporate oversight organization and {City} Royal Family Kids' Camp is a local instantiation of the corporate model.) RFKC, Inc. is a network of camps, children's clubs, and child mentoring for abused, abandoned and neglected children in the foster care, system. RFK founded in 1985 by Wayne and Diane Tesch.[1] This ministry offers training and resources for local churches to sponsor a five-day summer camp for the children in foster care, ages 6 – 12. This is from Wikipedia.  If someone wants to look up the founders Wayne and Diane Tesch as well.
