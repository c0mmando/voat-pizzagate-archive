            , I do have to remove this, because you haven't included any links (like maybe to Podesta's shitty tweets? Colbert mocking folks with pizza?) or anything. Sorry. :-(

            If I were going to get such video, I would hire a pissed off middle-aged Latina to go in undercover as a house cleaner and dig through the underwear drawers and the vintage DVD collection for the CP. Set up some hidden nanny cams.

            This is simple vigilantism.  You are advocating a witch hunt and criminal activity.  It's not going to be productive and it's likely to get anyone who followed your advice into legal jeopardy as you are advocating several crimes: burglary, stalking, harassment, are all possible crimes you can be charged with.  So you break into someone's house and put a camera there.   Then what?  You break in a couple of days later to see what you shot?  And hope you got lucky?  Or you do already have surveillance cameras and transmitters and batteries and receivers, etc.

           <p>
            You might be ready, but I do not think you are a realist.  If you want a reality check take all your evidence and your suspicions to a lawyer and ask him if you have a case and if they are any problems with your plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to take your activism into real life, I suggest you look a local organization dealing with this issues and contribute or volunteer.   (and put aside the grand elite conspiracy that you believe is occurring.)

And you are right, they have to be caught in the act on video.

            That attack fired 59 Tomahawk missiles into an airbase without hitting a single plane or the runway. The base was back in operation 8 hours later. Do you really think that was for real or a smoke screen used to obscure the "battlefield"?

             I have been reading Semour Hersh for years.  No Fake News. Just True Journalism.  When I read that article about the sarin gas it was a slap to my forehead.  The story is that Thug Hillary and her henchmen stole the sarin from Libya and brought it through Turkey into Syria.  What a sweet chick.  I'm gonna love seein' her go down.

              That's what caused the Benghazi attack.  Stephens found out about it and was going to out her Middle East racket dealing Sarin gas and Arms for Oil. Constant MidEast turmoil breeds cash for the Clinton Foundation....if she won the Presidency.  Child trafficking, drugs, mangos, organ trafficking, hacking, etc. were the game, compromising politicians with child sex was the insurance policy to make sure no one cheated in the game.

               Yes, and it will all come crashing down on their heads.  We will not accept any less.  I just heard Trump say about the wall, it will keep out drugs, and human sex trafficking.  Chris Stevens begged many times for more protection and his requests went unmet and unheard.

            Agreed, and it's out there somewhere. We need undeniable evidence in video form, and a way of hijacking MSM channels to distribute to masses. A normie awakening that will shake the Earth and change history forever. It's time to advance as a species and it won't happen while we have degenerate Luciferian pedos running the show.

             the video will never get out. the NSA has too many hacking tools. We noticed this with 4chan when an Insectian Species of alien took a selfie and posted himself to 4chan and it was downloaded and immediately scrubbed from laptops and computers straight off the hardrive.  They can block anything so the only way to beat them is to infiltrate via become an FBI or CIA agent. Even if the best hackers in the world got together they still would never be able to get the resources they need to defeat the CIA FBI, NSA TSA, DHS, agencies. You would not be able to protect yourself without a hidden compound the size of Rhode Island. 4chan has the highest location and IP detection software so even when you change your VPN they can still detect you. It is the governments best hacking techology put to use because they all know many secrets can be shared on an anonymous message board on the internet. You don't think there has been 1 or 2 FBI agents that have tried to leak this on the inside? They just get killed. Many of us have to swear to secrecy and never say a word. Many of you patriots if loyal and skilled in deception can get a job in the FBI and use your abilities for good rather than the scum already in here. They have tunnels and weapons you have never seen before. YOU WILL NEVER GET THE VIDEO evil aliens run the surface of the this planet. And even if you get your hands on this footage you will be killed instantly by one of the biobody suits they use as temporary bodies.

              I agree with you as crazy as it may sound.. ive come to the conclusion "they" are way ahead of us technologically and they are just slowly rolling out this tech in baby steps to us in such a way as to make us dependent on it and also they must get our permission or at least get us to agree on some level to accept their technology.
Ive had some interaction with those entities that can jack-in to a sheeple and talk through their body.. Its creepy!
Just like in the matrix,, many who are asleep can be used as tools.. 
Also ive seen some of their tech.. many years back something happened in Wellington City NZ that I witnessed. 
An unmarked military type van that had cellular-like antennas on the roof was racing through a series of intersections with its lights flashing and loud siren.. it was in a hurry to get somewhere! It ignored all road signs and even oncoming cars and just drove right over the road islands and then disappeared down the highway before I could get a pic of it. 
Also we need to be aware that if you use the internet for income then dont be surprised if your PG research gets you blacklisted by google etc.
My dropshipping website is now no longer searchable on google and my secondary income is gone. They blacklisted it without any warning. The site is useless now. I cant generate any income from it. 5 months of work gone.
Also back around 2005 a anonymous hollywood producer made the first chemtrails documentary. 
It was called "Chemtrails: Clouds of Death"..
I was running one of those free websites from Geocities back then and everytime I downloaded this documentary it would get corrupted or just disappear from my hard drive. Every time I uploaded it to my website it would disappear with 24 hours.
This was before chemtrails were even known about.. Even hard drives that were off the internet seemed to be susceptible.. As soon as i plugged it into my laptop the file would be deleted, which suggests there was some background virus on my laptop that was waiting for me to plug in the external drive and delete that particular film. 
That was almost 15 years ago! It would be pretty tricky to stop this happening now. 
Im thinking film the doco from the monitor using a cam and then upload it with a name that doesnt raise any flags?

               You literally hit the nail on the head my friend. What you said literally just proves everything I said. If they could scrub stuff off your hardrives 15 years ago they probably can scrub your memory nowadays. My memory gets scrubbed all the time I've had it happen about every five years and then I turn to God and I develop a strong head again with memories. The only way to combat these beings is to get in on their technology and develop our own shit that can fuk them up. We need to get smart an infiltrate their bullsheeit. Otherwise it'll just be Star Wars real life and it will be Rebels against the establishment. "They" are completely secluded you have to have certain DNA to even get into the CIA. The FBI is not so strict in the lower levels cuz they like peasant humans doing the dirty work of solving low level cases but the higher ups require a certain DNA. It's fucked m8. Aliens are everywhere dawg people just don't get that their technology is everywhere already. It's why you haven't seen nukes fly in a while. The good Aliens confiscated all their bullsheeit nukes. Everybody knows aliens are here man. The suppressive technology explains why there are so many people that see stuff and have stories all the time but it's never recorded and shared.

               your not the only good hearted person to get their hands on the "smoking gun". Monica had the smoking gun of Black suits loading up kids in cages. and she wasnt killed she was vaporized with a gun so powerful it would melt your head right off.
              </p>

               Seth Rich had nothing compared to what some other people had. he had the anectdotal evidence with Podesta but no photos or smoking guns.

               You guys don't get it every single spy agency across the world works together. It's already tough enough taking on the United States, you have the Mossad MI6 China, Soviets etc.. all working together to make sure this sheeit never gets out. I'm not here to discourage you just tell you to change identities and get hired at the NSA, TSA, CIA, FBI, DHS etc.. and when you have enough people in there with you helping you take down the pedoophiles you will be able to ovveride all their systems and stop this madness. You will also need help from other people around the world for the British Chinese Israeli intelligence forces.
