            You would also have to have safe foster homes and halfway houses, otherwise you would be taking children from one bad situation and placing them into another.  I think this situation requires a lot of citizen oversight, not just complete trust in Law Enforcement.

             Yes, I appreciate this idea in followup. However, we could start at the source, again: the allocations of protection funding, to reduce... possibly almost eliminate... the traumatizing of children and their closest, strongest, most natural family and community supports.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe the problem of cutting off this downpour of children into the drain starts at the beginning. LE officers are highly trained to recognize suspects while identifying and documenting crime. On the other hand, I have seen unverified pedo-type "investigators" of the current most-commonly funded sources make children extremely uncomfortable, not to mention the damage the children suffer to their reputations (i.e., yes, the child's reputation and how everyone treats him or her, fully and directly due to their own subjected family's investigation), their relationships with actual ongoing professional service providers, their surrounding family, etc. etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Quite frankly, as much as I want to believe citizen oversight involves more than strong but very temporary feelings of "isn't that cute," our culture has been found to be extremely critical of parents (i.e., especially then critical of mothers, of course) based on perceptions that have nothing to do with fact:
             <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/16/were-really-bad-at-judging-risk-to-kids-were-really-good-at-judging-parents">
              https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/16/were-really-bad-at-judging-risk-to-kids-were-really-good-at-judging-parents
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, this is where the trained LE officer or even the
             <em>
              PD-employed
             </em>
             police social worker is going to do wonders for determining if and when children are in danger. Nothing is more annoying that witnessing when a police social worker has accurately categorized a situation in a quick, much-less-traumatizing way and then has to give authority over to some silly, nonsense-based, goofy social worker to finish up the child's life based on... a ""more specialized"" ""investigation"" (double quotes for such stark real meanings of professional words are all intended).

              Just to be clear, not saying amateurs jumping in and having direct contact with children.  Saying citizens have input into the process and take complaints about the system, and help identify what resources are needed.  You are so right that this is an area that only the most skilled professionals should interface with the children and parents.

            Based on how government agencies and large corporations operate as hierarchies to compartmentalize everyone, I don't think that your low level and mid level employees (officers, etc) are often even aware of funding issues except what their higher ups want them to know about. These systems are set up exactly for that reason- keep people in the dark unless they absolutely need to know. It's easier to manipulate and control them and they aren't as likely to connect the dots so to speak.

             Thank you; I agree, especially at first; everyone is just very excited to be selected through a competitive process (with exception to the social worker, in general, who is often told that job-related benefits make the job desirable and thus "competitive"). They mostly just want to get started on the mission for which they thought they were employed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Empathy and undeniable experience relation is where I have understanding for the newest social "services" personnel, but after a while, one works up the ranks. This can happen pretty quickly as qualified individuals quickly move on and out after finishing degrees... or maybe sometimes that's an excuse when the truth just becomes as bright as pure daylight.

             Such described funding is firmly in place; verifiable so. I realize that if the problem were so easy to solve, we would have already. This can bring us back in full circle to cutting off the flow at its source: the children, and the strong funding incentives of unalterably damaging (or is that ""saving"" for the interventionist?) children's lives.

            Ok, Please don't be afraid to speak out.  We are going to stand behind you and protect you.  I and possibly many others on here expect that your funds are being taken away to decrease your power in exposing mainly the elite and any pedophiles that may be compromised.  Let's talk about how we can all work together to get better training and help for our children.

             Agreed with your suspicions, although I am not currently in LE. However, I have seen multiple children hurt from such socially oriented and targeted "investigations"—and from past professional experiences have a rather clear, first-hand view of who is trained to do what.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the flow could be cut short, then the pedos would have to make other actions more obvious and take more risks. Can you imagine how absolutely simple it is to violate the rights of children for whom no one has their eyes on? Heck, there are plenty of allegations that these "missing," "runaway" children are even being outright sold. Sick!
            </p>
            <p>
             Currently normed child "protection" generally involves taking away everyone and everything a child has for true lifetime support and replacing that with temporary "care" from paid persons for whom the child is nothing more than a warm body in their budget roles. Oh sure, I forgot, some of them "care" so much about children—that's nothing but a temporarily, fleeting feeling of "oh, how cute" while being paid in a temporary "job."

             Tax revolt. It's the only thing that ever makes the ruling class do anything they don't want to do. It's the only power we, as the people, actually have. Everything else is theater.

               Every single human has the right to opt-out of paying taxes. I would recommend spreading awareness of the crimes of our "representatives" then instilling a demand-date in which everyone would opt out of paying income taxes (say 2018) everyone head to the HR department Jan 1 2018 and opt out / claim exempt for 2018.
              </p>

               Would only be a week or two before drastic changes would take place. First people to stop getting paid would be government employees. Cops would hear "pay cuts"  and freak the fuck out. Imagine cutting off welfare, how bad that would effect the ghetto lizards, then imagine the ghetto lizards populated 65% of the nation (middle-class)... Drastic changes would occur very quickly.

              Taxation Without Representation.  That is what we had then, and what it has come to again now.  Now we do not even have representation.  They have given us fake news.
