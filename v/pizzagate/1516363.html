            "Anything they accuse you of they are fully guilty of themselves." Which seems to lead to some over-the-top denunciations (protesteth too mucheth), and over-the-top whistleblower punishments,   This double standard on the side of protecting free speech among pedophiles while censoring folks wanting to save children and slavery victims  --  that's going to be some karma-load.
           </p>
           <p>
            And note: So far the principle elite rapists etc that have been called out by so many orgs, and not one lawsuit. Hardly any mentions of them at all except to say they're Russian hackers. If false, it would be one of the easiest lawsuits to win, esp with their lawyers. But they obviously don't want this in court.
