            I don't know about this, but from my experience with Catholic Childrens Aid, they've been helpful at times. I know because I was one of those kids removed from my family when I was about 12, after ditching school in grade 7 and living on the internet. There's Catholic Childrens aid, and there's Childrens aid,  but I don't know the difference. I was sent to a group home operated by a non profit org for 5 years or so, and they were great. Catholic Childrens aid was basically non existent at these times but they assign you a worker and they come to see you once every few months to check in. At some time they start to give you money until you hit 18. I was getting about $950 CAD a month. But everything I learned and did was through the non profit. In a way, the childrens aid that I was with was like a government handing out welfare checks through your assigned worker. At 18 you are out on your own, cut off from all services. I ended up being homeless for a year before I had to move back to family, then homeless again living on welfare before finding a decent job and a basement unit, where i am now. I wouldn't be surprised if this were true, but then again, I was with Catholic Childrens Aid, not Childrens Aid.

            I'm not saying I believe wikipedia, but they usually site their stats.

           <p>
            This is in line with what I know. But I don't know what I don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the 12-month period from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008, Ontario’s Children’s Aid Societies provided child welfare services to communities across Ontario. There were 77,089 allegations of child abuse and neglect investigated in Ontario. 27,816 Children were in the care of Children's Aid Society for protection from abuse and neglect. Of the children who were cared for by a society during the year, 9,468 came into care upon completion of abuse investigations. Of these,6,565 children had not previously been in care and 2,903 children were returned to care due to new child protection concerns. Less than 1% of Ontario’s 3 million children were in the care of Children’s Aid Societies last year.[6]
           </p>
           <p>
            Conversely, during the 12 months between January 1 2007 and December 31, 2007, The Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario reviewed 91 cases including 18 Medical and 73 CAS cases that had received service during that time or up to 12 months previously. The causes of death were determined to be: • Medical: Natural, 17; Accident, 0; Homicide, 0; Suicide, 1; Undetermined, 0. • CAS: Natural, 10; Accident, 23; Homicide, 10; Suicide, 8; Undetermined, 15; Still under investigation, 7.[7]
           </p>
           <p>
            73 of these children died while in CAS services including children served in the family of origin and placed with families or "kin", during this time, which accounts for a loss of roughly 0.26% of the total children in CAS care and custody. This mortality rate (2.6:1000) is less than the national child mortality rate average of Canada (5:1000) which has the second highest infant mortality rate in the developed world.[citation needed]
           </p>
           <p>
            On their website, a Children's Aid Society makes the claim that most of the children who they visit remain in their homes; The number of children coming into care each year has continued to decline, in line with the general downward trend in Ontario’s child population. In 2007/08 9,468 children came into care, a 26% decline compared to 2003/04. The rate of admissions into care was 3 children per 1000 of Ontario’s children population.[8]
           </p>
           <p>
            Children’s Aid Societies also provide assessments, crisis intervention, counseling and services to prevent child abuse and neglect. In addition, Children’s Aid Societies help vulnerable families protect and support their children. Many prevention programs are offered in partnership with other community agencies. Child protection workers also work to support families in crisis where their children are not in need of protection. A child protection worker remains involved with the family to ensure the appropriate supports and community services are in place. In 2007/08, 24,955 families received ongoing support from Children’s Aid Societies where a child was in need of protection.[9]

            This is horrible. But the wikileak attachments are what? There are a bunch of canadian email addresses and the attachments are higglety pigglety. The one you site, is an individual case of a child stolen from her family. And then one of the bulleted facts in the file is the 50% paragraph with no outside source.
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay I really want to hate on CAS. I tried to adopt a family of kids that are in the system. I went through there training and my hubby and I were refused. We were refused because of some back pain. At the same time we went through the training a gay couple were also in the training and one of the guys had back surgery before their adoption and that was okay.

            The Children's Aid is one of the most monstrous, anti-child entities in Canada. They answer to no one. They have absolute authority and they use it to terrorize families. If someone ever turns their eye on you, God have mercy on your family.

            My wife works CAS Belleville for 24 years in intake, protection and family services. There is no way that there is any kind of institutional pedophile rings established within these organizations. The people that work there would not stand for it and the system in place would catch it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I realize having the CAS climb up your ass can make you hate them forever (it has happened to me too) but you are looking in the wrong spot. Anyone in the system as it currently stands is protected.  I can vouch for Toronto CAS as well as I know folks there and the system is province wide

             I think you are someone to be watched.  Explain your vast knowledge on why there is no way it could be involved institutional pedo ring?  Because your wife says so.   shilling for CAS or just can't accept the fact your wife was enabling this sick crap? knowingly or not.

             You really beLIEve the underlings would know the true nature of this private corporation? Do I know what my bosses are doing at my place of work...nope....underlings are on a need to know basis. Your  wife might think she is important and does a great job, but she isn't in the know.  Like all corporations it is compartmentalize.

              I just read the article.  There is no source for the 50% claim.  The abduction they are talking about is the CAS taking the child into care.  The whole thing reads like a deranged screed of a unbalanced person.. the kind of person that tends to lose their kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              My wife had one of her foster kids die in a car crash when he was 19 and in first year university and out of the system.  She went to the funeral and was pretty shaken up about it.  There is no way that she is losing half her kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              In fact a fair number of current CAS workers are former kids in care who are paying back.  I know at least three. These are success stories by any definition.

               These 3 workers you know of,  how do you know they weren't abused by the system they work for?  People who are abused will sometimes even try to protect their abuser/system.  Is there profit for putting kids into protection who most likely don't need protection or creating files on families?  answer YES that's how these private corporations get paid.  Are you starting to see the problem here? your turn

                Actually I grew up in Cambridge- tbh the kids in KW that I knew had gone through CAS did have depression and anxiety issues and were often absent from school, so.. there might be something to this.

            Gangs make sense. You had Pakistani gangs in the UK doing the same shit. No doubt they had links with higher level pedophiles. What was especially interesting was that the Council of Rotherham knew about these gangs and didn't say anything about it. Their reason: "We didn't want to be accused of racism". What a load of shit. In light of what we know, pedo-gangs and politicians are most likely related.

            No its not natives. Where did you hear this from? Official channels? The same groups that divide us and kill our children? Loving the native blame as if somehow natives care less about their children than everyone else. You're buying into the narrative of the elite, who always blame the da whitez, da blax, da jewz, da moozlumz, da nativezzzz. Anyone but the majority group in a country. They've been doing this for thousands of years and you still fall for it. Its not them. Just because pedophile cops who rape and murder children say it, doesn't suddenly make it true.

             I get what ur saying, but the people in power often use marginalized minority groups because they are vulnerable, less likely to be believed and more easily bought. Its an easy target, it would be relatively hard finding a white kid to buy, but go to a reserve with alcohol,drug,poverty problems, very easy I'd imagine.

            The fact that all these files which are in the public domain have not caused an complete overhaul of the systems in place is really really telling. There seems to be a concerted effort to not do much about this. A point was made by another user how do these numbers compare to other at risk youths I think would be a very telling metric.

            Anna G has done some research. It looks like these are botes for a custody battle that turned into a rabbit hole. We have thousands of missing aboriginal women and children in Canada, and yes, the fatality rate of kids in foster care is alarmingly high. Plus there is probably more to the Pickton pig farm than we were told.

            Dont forget that a lot of the aboriginal children that have been taken and abused by Priests especially in the North of Canada. Even today they still hide it. See John Furlong for example.
           </p>
           <p>
            Throw that in with how Institution Racism against them wrt to RCMP, older writings etc have been to treat them as throw aways. It is slowly changing but there is still the highway of tears alone.

            It would be interesting to see if there was and abduction network based around prominent reserves.

            Sovereign countries have been infiltrated and subverted by a Masonic cult of  blackmail, torture and murder as well as an industrial child farming system. The entire system is against the children and protecting this unholy sleaze. This is beyond the pale. We will never see things the same again. And we will never let this subject go.

             In fact, it have a lot to do with masonry and societys like that (excuse me for my english, trying to help from spain). This satanic lodges are ruled by some rites, like the memphis one, that for scalating in the degree table, you need to do some bizarre shit related to satanism. Im pretty sure it is there where they get the footage for the whole blackmailing thing. Thats why there is so many people envolved. Not because everyone is a pedophile, it is because to become someone relatively important in this societys, you need to do evil things, and of course they will be recording you.

              Jew Conspiracies real. Pedo conspiracies not? Is that what PedoCTR is pushing next? That kids are worse off with parents, and should be taken into care, where you and your masters can get at them?

               So are pedo conspiracies and masonic conspiracies real and Jew conspiracies fake? Rothschild and Masons go hand in hand. What he's saying is don't let the evidence STARING YOU IN THE FACE be swept away because you're afraid of being called "anti-semitic".

             North American's need to know that the US and Canadian elite coordinate their actions.   It always ends up being the same  result with a different face.   The cps is the same in both countries and were implemented for the same purposes.   Whatever the one country does the other will not be too far behind in one form or another.  I won't mention all the examples as they aren't appropriate to the topic, but   even though Canada is a commonwealth country,  tied to the UK, it also is the little brother of the US who gives over its lunch money.   The 2 systems are entwined from mkultra to cps and many points in between, and tied to the UK.

             That's why I believe this is a north American issue and a global issue.

             Yes.  Bill Clinton signed into law a bounty on every child the CPS takes from the home.  Once the child is in the state's custody, that law makes it much easier to sever the parent's right to the child.  The child can then be easily "lost" in the system.  And, I bet our statistics are much worse than Canada.  Our government won't even count the number of missing kids in the US.

              You are absolutely correct and it's extremely lucrative for the states to remove children.   Not only is there a  bounty but an incentive for states to increase their removals every year because they are given adoption bonuses if and only if they increase their adoptions over the prior year.   No increase = no bonuses.   The bonuses range from 4k-10k per child depending on age and other factors which result in millions of dollars to add to their state coffers.  This was all enacted with the Adoption and Safe Families Act back in 1996 which HRC takes credit for and her husband WJC signed into law.
