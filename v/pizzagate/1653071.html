            I think this is interesting...!
            <br/>
            Yeah, he cut him a plea deal, after "a year-long assult on the prosecution and prosecutors" by Epstein's lawyers, whom he called the most "aggressive" he's ever dealt with. Who knows how they may have threatened him. Acosta also says new evidence has surfaced since then, and more victims have come forward.
            <br/>
            This guy knows a lot about the case, and says he regrets the outcome.
            <br/>
            Either he will be questioned and details will come out, or their silence on the issue will be deafening.
            <br/>
            We can get the blue-pilled in on this easily. "Evil Trump picks a man that goes easy on pedophiles!" Get moms and grannies and SJWs to protest this and demand answers!

            Holy shit.... this new video from Victurus Libertas VL mentions Epstein being a CIA/Mossad operation
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWT9tUvzLDc">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWT9tUvzLDc

           </p>
           <p>
            Could this be a 5D chess move from Trump and crew?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did Pudzer resign or withdraw his name?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's entirely possible Trump knows exactly what this man's past is all about and grilling him in the Senate would raise awareness and draw more questions to PedoGate before the whole thing breaks open.
           </p>
           <p>
            Holy shit... this is crazy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit***
           </p>
           <p>
            From the article: Acosta acknowledged to the media in 2011 that he came under extreme pressure from Epstein's high-powered defense team, which included legal heavyweights such as Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Florida criminal defense attorney Roy Black.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under extreme pressure from known creep Alan Dershowitz.... was Acosta basically threatened and now this is his payback?
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow....

            Ohhhhhhhh, I think I see what's going on. More 4D chess!
           </p>
           <p>
            For background..
           </p>
           <p>
            4D Chess; Example 1: DeVos
           </p>
           <p>
            DeVos was a completely devisive nominee for head of the Dept of Educ. That was intentional. Trump selected her for one reason and one reason only - to dismantle the Department, in part fulfilling his campaign promise to cut bloated beaurocracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            H.R. 899 was introduced the same day DeVos was confirmed by the Senate. The bill is only one sentence long: “The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2018”
           </p>
           <p>
            DeVos is so despised that many on the Left will begrudgingly get on board with that, some even begging for the Dept to be eliminated just to get rid of her.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            4D Chess; Example 2: Flynn
           </p>
           <p>
            General Flynn was put into the position he just resigned from as the "canary in the coal mine."  Trump knew about his "enemies," of course and all the leaks.  Float some classified info out there about Flynn and Russians then sit back and see who leaks it.   It was like a sieve.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know that
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">
             r/Pizzagate
            </a>
            was banned but we popped up over here.  We were down but not out.  Flynn resigned but he was immediately shadow moved over to the very, very highest US Intelligence Organization.  He's down (resigned) but he's hardly out.  That was always the plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand that the felonious reporters have been or shortly will be visited by the FBI, who are not there for coffee and cake.  After their little meeting with NBC's Deborah Turness, she immediately resigned and overnight popped up in Europe.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            4D Chess; Example 3: Acosta
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that it was never meant for Acosta to actually become Sec of Labor.  Nominating him, though, knowing what we now know, was the goal.  It puts pizzagate front and center - talked about everywhere. Congress has to mention it and grill him on it. Trump has trolled them. The child molesters have to question and vet one of their own. Hahahaha!  At the same time, shining a spotlight on the issue they're guilty of and have been trying to hide!! Hahahaha!  Brilliant!  Best  news yet!!
           </p>
           <p>
            This lifts up Pedo Island, the Lolita Express, Jeffrey Epstein, Alan Dershowitz (a regular at Pedo Island AND Epstein's defense attorney in this case!) which was decided totally behind the scenes - immoral, unethical, borderline illegal if not fully illegal in some small ways, etc), Prince Andrew, of course Bill Clinton - AND HILLARY! --- who I understand joined in the fun a few times herself, plus tons of other people.
           </p>
           <p>
            It shines a bright light on the means and methods used by these people (pedo Island is a Mossad operation - Israel's equivalent of the CIA ) which involves compromising everyone who goes there because there are 30 cameras and mics every step of the way in the place. I understand that it is all incremental. Take the pols to pedo island on the lolita express, the first time the boys/girls are over 20, next time, 18, next time 16... until you get the age waaaay down there. Bingo, you've got them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll just BET you that Acosta was compromised himself long before he prosecuted the Epstein case. For all we know he's a pedo and a Spiritcooker himself!!! My bet is that he IS! Hahahaha!  Trump, you sly fox, you!
           </p>
           <p>
            (And, yes, I am 1,000 percent aware that pizzagate is no laughing matter.)

             I also admire your analysis....gut feeling is Trump may just let us down when we needed him most. Flynn is gone unless you know something we don't.

            As a prosecutor he couldnt have been happy with that deal.  If he was corrupt there would have been no need for the powerhouse lawyer team...

            Bad news...or great fucking news!! Remember Epstein had Dershowicz and other powerhouse lawyers up against him..   and maybe he went easy because he doesnt want to cross the wrong people and die..   and maybe.he was picked because he knows its real and knows epstein..

             Saw this discussed somewhere else today. If source was right, he was one of the only ones actually pushing against the system. Some people very high up the food chain were trying to make it to away and save Epstein's ass.

            Not sure about this. He knows the case -- we don't. The evidence might have been inconclusive and, as mentioned, the prosecution outmatched by the defense team. Maybe this was a way to get a conviction. I mean, would it have made sense to go through and have Epstein skate? I'll reserve judgment. I don't think Trump would pick a pedo protector for this spot.

            My first reaction is that -yeah, this is bad...Especially since it's Jeff Epstein. However...if this guy has to go before a committee and he gets grilled about his connection to Epstein than all we need is one or 2 republican (or any good ppl from either side) to bring up Bill and Hillary Clinton's strong connection to Epstein and go on record with that. I dunno...this whole thing is a spider web inside a maze
