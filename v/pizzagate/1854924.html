            Someone want to explain what this means? It makes no sense:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Is Pizzagate their tool, by design, to use the blackmail they gathered on the elite guests brought to the homes and procured young girls for as a threat? It would have been very easy to circulate blackmail evidence with the simple hashtag #Pizzagate. In effect, they could have used the highly publicized “conspiracy theory” as a vehicle to threaten those blackmailed into submission during the 2016 election.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If you "circulate blackmail evidence" you lose the ability to blackmail anyone with it. Is this a subtle attempt to once again delegitimatize Pizzagate?

             I think what VT is trying to say that they want to keep the subject in the news, to keep their 'operation brownstone' perp's in line.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps someone should tell this fucking MOD, that its impossible to circulate evidence of child-rape on this forum, it would be deleted by MODS, and the Cops would be notified.

              What an interesting red herring you've tossed into ring, JewCock. You know very well that wasn't my point. The minute ANY info being used to blackmail someone is made public ("circulated"), blackmail becomes impossible. Why would someone pay to keep something quiet that has already been "circulated." Makes no sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              Instead you divert the conversation with the evidence-free "mods are shills" meme. Why, I wonder, do you not want me pointing out the logical inconsistencies in this article? Because the article is disinformation?

              You must work in government -- private industry wouldn't pay for this poor of a persuasion effort!

            The 'Jane Doe' Katie Johnson so called Trump rape story was a fabricated tabloid story searching for a buyer, exposed as fiction, turned down a couple times, picked up by a George W. Bush and Jeb Bush political donation bundler during the primaries to try to hurt Trump's campaign... it's been fodder for shills and trolls and tends to show up when either the Neocons are freaking out or the DemCommunists are freaking out.  Don't ask for proof Alfred, I did the research, exposed it over a year ago (not here) and am not wasting any more time on that shyte.

             I’m amazed this site used the blurred face video as “evidence”. That video could have been produced by anyone these days. If what “Katie Johnson” (great name) says is true.. and that’s a BIG if, then Trump could actually get off to a handjob from a glove wearing 13 year old girl.

            Does this mean that Judge Acosta would put Trump in Prison for 40+ years given he flew to Orgy-Island 100's of times to fuck children?

           <p>
            Funny that the owner of the island  Epstein, wasn't ever charged by Acosta, the question begs to be asked "DID ACOSTA ALSO FUCK CHILDREN, DOES EPSTEIN MOSSAD HAVE SHIT on Acosta?"

            Epstein’s little black book was published by Gawker when it turned up in court proceedings after Epstein’s former house manager Alfredo Rodriguez had tried to sell it in 2009. About 50 of the entries, including those of many of Epstein’s suspected victims and accomplices as well as Trump, Love, Barak, Dershowitz, and others, The people of interest had been circled by Rodriguez.

            Considering the number of people circled in the book and not questioned publicly, and those implicated but never charged such as Ghislaine Maxwell, we really have to wonder about Acosta. Will this case ever lead to a thorough investigation and questioning of everyone circled in the black book, as justice demands that it should?

            Maybe there is some light at the end of the tunnel.

            Finally get some more answers to the plea deal that could be concealing sex-blackmail of many important people, including some very prominent politicians.
