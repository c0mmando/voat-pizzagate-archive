            Someone want to explain what this means? It makes no sense:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Is Pizzagate their tool, by design, to use the blackmail they gathered on the elite guests brought to the homes and procured young girls for as a threat? It would have been very easy to circulate blackmail evidence with the simple hashtag #Pizzagate. In effect, they could have used the highly publicized “conspiracy theory” as a vehicle to threaten those blackmailed into submission during the 2016 election.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If you "circulate blackmail evidence" you lose the ability to blackmail anyone with it. Is this a subtle attempt to once again delegitimatize Pizzagate?

            <p>
             Perhaps someone should tell this fucking MOD, that its impossible to circulate evidence of child-rape on this forum, it would be deleted by MODS, and the Cops would be notified.

              What an interesting red herring you've tossed into ring, JewCock. You know very well that wasn't my point. The minute ANY info being used to blackmail someone is made public ("circulated"), blackmail becomes impossible. Why would someone pay to keep something quiet that has already been "circulated." Makes no sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              Instead you divert the conversation with the evidence-free "mods are shills" meme. Why, I wonder, do you not want me pointing out the logical inconsistencies in this article? Because the article is disinformation?

            The 'Jane Doe' Katie Johnson so called Trump rape story was a fabricated tabloid story searching for a buyer, exposed as fiction, turned down a couple times, picked up by a George W. Bush and Jeb Bush political donation bundler during the primaries to try to hurt Trump's campaign... it's been fodder for shills and trolls and tends to show up when either the Neocons are freaking out or the DemCommunists are freaking out.  Don't ask for proof Alfred, I did the research, exposed it over a year ago (not here) and am not wasting any more time on that shyte.

             I’m amazed this site used the blurred face video as “evidence”. That video could have been produced by anyone these days. If what “Katie Johnson” (great name) says is true.. and that’s a BIG if, then Trump could actually get off to a handjob from a glove wearing 13 year old girl.

            Does this mean that Judge Acosta would put Trump in Prison for 40+ years given he flew to Orgy-Island 100's of times to fuck children?
           </p>
           <p>
            Funny that the owner of the island  Epstein, wasn't ever charged by Acosta, the question begs to be asked "DID ACOSTA ALSO FUCK CHILDREN, DOES EPSTEIN MOSSAD HAVE SHIT on Acosta?"
