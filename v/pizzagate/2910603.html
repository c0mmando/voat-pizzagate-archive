<p>Many cults and evil sects have ripped skin from their victims – the Hampstead whistleblower children even described a special tool used by the alleged cult for the extraction of the skin from the babies which were slain in sacrifices.  Tools such as this have existed since the time of the INQUISITIONS which were financed by the Vatican. Inquisition torturers delighted in the tearing and ripping of skin.

Often, the ripping tools were heated to red hot temperatures and used on women’s breasts and in the genitalia region.</p>
<p>A British website entitled HUMAN LEATHER has been discovered that sells items such as belts and bags made from human skin ‘which has been donated by people who had died’ – and each item costs thousands of pounds.  The site is allegedly run from a Hampstead address, and the registered name of the website owner refers to the sexually provocative book the KAMA SUTRA.  It is obvious that a very wealthy and occultically in sired clientele frequented this HUMAN LEATHER website.</p>
<p>MAGIC BOOKS wrapped in Human Skin are featured in many mainstream media productions;</p>
<p>For example, Mayhem’s 1994 album De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas references books bound in human skin in the title track.</p>

<p>In the Disney movie Hocus Pocus, the eldest Sanderson sister’s (played by Bette Midler) fictional spellbook is bound in a patchwork of human skin with an enchanted, moving human eye embedded in the cover.</p>
<p>In the video game Shadow Hearts one of the characters is able to use a book bound from human skin as a weapon.  This game also features the real and accurate sigil symbols of the grimoire known as the GOETIA which is the leading text used by Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis.</p>
<p>The titular book in the Canadian television series Todd and the Book of Pure Evil is allegedly bound in a Negro’s skin.</p>
<p>The judgement on the Hampstead whistleblower kids claims that there is ‘NO CREDIBILITY’ to the allegations, and that the children had been trained to lie. However, the whistleblower kids have been proven CORRECT on three counts; 1. HUMAN SKIN is indeed used by satanic and secretive cults 2. Baby body parts have indeed been found in DHL courier boxes, and   3. a neighbouring school – UCS/Phoenix –  has indeed been exposed as having a pedo-ring operating inside, as witnessed &amp; alleged by the author Jonathan Self – just like the Hampstead children said ‘there are other Hampstead schools involved’ in sexually abusing children</p>

<p>Some researchers have stated that the actual original bulls are written in blood-based ink on vellum made from the skin of human infants.  It is said that this weird ritual is a form of magic that gives the words \'life\' and makes them binding on our reality.  Certainly, this process is true of certain spells and charms in various black magic rituals, and given what we know about the Vatican\'s proclivity for young children, it would not be surprising, though shocking, at this point to find it to be true.</p>

            Tool for extracting skin.....
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, errmm, so, they also make shoes of skin, of the baby’s skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            P:  They’ve got a special tool and they put it in the skin, like, in the baby’s skin and then they take it off.  Then they put, …
           </p>
           <p>
            Q: and then they stick it, cause the blood is all kind of sticky and they stick it on the shoe, on the sole, and the flip flops.  They stick it on the flip flops.
           </p>
           <p>
            P: They’ve got flip flops and they, those shoes like, the ones that I like.  The ones I showed my mum.  In the shoe shop in Grand Cross.  Those ones with the big, they’ve got a big star, on the baby skin … not like, it’s not, you can do it coloured, but it’s a bit see-through there.

            It seems to be a major facet of the occult activities we've uncovered.

            , you need to provide linked support for a number of highly unbelievable claims, or repost this in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . The links you've provided do not satisfactorily source these:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             a British website called HUMAN LEATHER sells belts and other paraphernalia for thousands of pounds
            </li>
            <li>
             the Hampstead whistleblower children even described a special tool used by the alleged cult for the extraction of the skin from the babies which were slain in sacrifices
            </li>
            <li>
             Inquisition torturers delighted in the tearing and ripping of skin. The Vatican’s inquisitors learned a human being could live until the skin was peeled down to the waist when skinned alive. Often, the ripping tools were heated to red hot temperatures and used on women’s breasts and in the genitalia region.
            </li>
            <li>
             HUMAN SKIN is indeed used by satanic and secretive cults
            </li>
            <li>
             Baby body parts have indeed been found in DHL courier boxes
            </li>
            <li>
             a neighbouring school – UCS/Phoenix – has indeed been exposed as having a pedo-ring operating inside
            </li>
            <li>
             the actual original bulls are written in blood-based ink on vellum made from the skin of human infants.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Serious claims require serious evidence. Therefore, please do not cite obscure blogs or "some researchers claim" as support. That does not meet the evidence requirements of this sub.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will give this the 24 Hour Grace flair. This can be posted as-is to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . When you add links, please do so adjacent to the claim they support, or as an embedded link of the claim itself. Thanks.

            I've seen the interviews with the children.  They tell the truth. They are so open in the way they tell what happened, what they know 
about the rituals.  To not believe these children is to either be involved in the abuse, or being blackmailed/threatened to 
not prosecute.  I wonder if they'll be able to talk again when they're of majority age.  Hopefully, they don't meet with 
"accidents".
