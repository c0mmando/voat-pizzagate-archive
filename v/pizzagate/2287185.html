            No doubt this physician was suicided.   Doesn't make any sense.  .Dr. Lorich was the Chief of Trauma Surgery at NYC's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, the #1 hospital in NY and had additional hospital appointments.  The lawsuit with the ex-Giant football player would not have caused him to take his own life.  He would have been covered by the hospital's malpractice insurance to include personal coverage. When a physician gets sued for malpractice, it's not just the doctor who gets sued, it's the hospital and staff on duty at the time. Obviously Trauma Surgery is a very high risk medical specialty and therefore carries top tier malpractice coverage.  Columbia Presbyterian hires cream of the crop physicians, and for him to be in leadership role as Chief, this doctor could handle pressure like nobody's business.  The ex-NFL player lawsuit story is bullsh#$ cover-up.

            Surgeon who exposed Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti found dead in apartment with stab wound to the chest

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             MANHATTAN (INTELLIHUB) — A well-known surgeon who exposed major inadequacies in medical trauma care promised to the Haitian people by the Clinton Foundation after the non-profit raised over $30 million dollars in donations following the devastating 2010 earthquake was found dead in his upscale apartment Sunday with a stab wound to the chest.

             Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Within 24 hours of the earthquake, Dr. David Helfet put together a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and operating room nurses, with a massive amount of orthopedic operating room equipment, ready to be flown directly to Port-au-Prince on a private plane.
            </p>
            <p>
             We thought our plan was a good one, but we soon learned we were incredibly naive. Disaster management in Haiti was nonexistent.
            </p>
            <p>
             The difficulties in getting in -- despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and Dr. Helfet's connections with Partners in Health and Bill and Hillary Clinton -- only hinted at the difficulties we would have once we arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
             We started out Friday morning and got a slot to get into Port-au-Prince on Friday. That was canceled when we were on the runway and was rescheduled for the next day. We were diverted to the Dominican Republic and planned on arriving in Port-au-Prince on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p>
             That Saturday morning slot also was canceled and postponed until the afternoon. The airport had one runway and hundreds of planes trying to land. But nobody was prioritizing the flights.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once we finally landed, we were taken to the General Hospital in Port-au-Prince with our medical supplies. We had been told that this hospital was up and running with two functioning operating rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once we arrived, we saw a severely damaged hospital with no running water and only limited electrical power, supplied by a generator. Surgeries were being performed in the equivalent of a large storage closet, where amputations were performed with hacksaws.
            </p>
            <p>
             This facility could not nearly accommodate our equipment nor our expertise to treat the volume of injuries we saw.
            </p>
            <p>
             We quickly took our second option: Community Hospital of Haiti, about two miles away. There, we found about 750 patients lying on the floor. But the facility had running water, electricity and two functional operating rooms.
We found scores of patients with pus dripping out of open extremity fractures and crush injuries. Some wounds were already ridden with maggots.
            </p>
            <p>
             About a third of these victims were children. The entire hospital smelled of infected, rotting limbs and death. Later on, we would judge our surgical progress by the diminishment of the stench.
            </p>
            <p>
             In our naïveté, we didn't expect that the two anesthesia machines would not work; that there would be only one cautery available in the entire hospital to stop bleeding; that an operating room sterilizer fit only instruments the size of a cigar box; that there would be no sterile saline, no functioning fluoroscopy machine, no blood for transfusions, no ability to do lab work; and the only local staff was a ragtag group of voluntary health providers who, like us, had made it there on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
             As we got up and running and organized the patients for surgery, we told our contacts in the United States what we needed. More supplies were loaded for a second trip. Those included a battery-operated pulse lavage, a huge supply of sterile saline and the soft goods we needed desperately in the operating room.
            </p>
            <p>
             The plane landed as planned Sunday night, and the new equipment was loaded onto a truck. Then that truck, loaded with life-saving equipment, was hijacked somewhere between the airport and the hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             We worked for 60-plus hours without stopping. The plane that would take us home would bring with it not only a new medical staff, but also equipment that was nonexistent in the hospital, or even the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Tuesday morning, a huge number of new patients arrived. The Haitians had heard we were trying to save limbs, and families were bringing their injured loved ones to us.
            </p>
            <p>
             The hospital was forced to lock down, closing its gates to the angry and frustrated crowd outside. On Tuesday morning, we saw that many of the patients we had operated on were becoming septic and would require additional surgeries.
            </p>
            <p>
             We decided the situation was untenable. Our supplies were running out, our team was past exhaustion, safety was rapidly becoming a concern, and we had no firm plan to leave or resupply.
            </p>
            <p>
             A hospital benefactor helped us get to the airport. First, Jamaican soldiers with M-16s escorted us out of the building as the crowd outside saw us abandoning the hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that the military could not or would not protect the critical resupply medical equipment on Sunday, or allow the Tuesday flight to come in, is devastating and merits intense investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was no security at the hospital. We needed a much higher level of security with strong and clear support of the military from the very beginning.
The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters. We came to understand that our isolated operation may work in a mission, but not in a disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
             Surgeons who expect to show up and operate will be mistaken. Without a complement of support staff and supplies, they are of limited to no value.
We left feeling as if we abandoned these patients, the country and its people, and we feel terrible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our role back in New York is to expose the inadequacies of the system in the hopes of effecting change immediately.

             The disinfo flair refers to the content of the yournewswire article, not just the claim in the title.  All yournewswire links will get that flair, because there is broad agreement among the community that it's a disinfo site.  I suggested to OP that he delete and repost with a different source.

            This was taking out a Clinton Foundation witness and using him to send message to any others thinking of ratting...will these murderers ever be stopped?? I cannot believe Presbyterian Hospital would accept this and not demand investigation!

             This man did no work with the Clinton Foundation in Haiti and that is not what is article is about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why do you claim he's a witness?   This source of this article is not a trustworthy source.
            </p>
            <p>
             He went down to Haiti for a week and worked in a hospital as part of the international response to the massive earthquake there.

             Have a question for you Carmencita 
Just found out my grandparents old home in a NY boro is a foster home for SCO 
Do you have any suggestions for me. Would not know from the street, blends in with all the others
I have the exact location but don't know what to do with this lead.  The listing says it is a home for the homeless, aged and foster children,  THat makes me suspicious.

              Would report to FBI or nearest Police Station.  Be careful though, for some police are caught up in this mess.   It is good to try to bring these things to light, but you must protect yourself.  Do not try to sneak around there yourself for there could be cameras and you could end up in jail instead of them.  Also if these are children, Child Protective Services is also compromised.  Be very careful and send out feelers while talking to possibly see if they are receptive or may be protecting the other side.  It is a changed world from what we once thought we had.

               Ok thank you
I have been on here at least six months and trust you
Thank you for all your hard work
My sister actually knocked on the door not knowing anything about pizza gate and they told her there were children inside so she couldn't look around. 
There is a park and a school down the block.  It is possible it is good but there is potential for bad
I don't have anything bad to report about it.

                If you and your sister and maybe a male friend or relative could be outside maybe in a car to see if any of those children leave their building and attend the school, that would be about the only way to check this out.  If there are children and a school, some should be heading there in the morning.  DO NOT go by yourself.  Taking a male along is better than to have two females sitting in the car alone.  You did not relate what kind of hood this is.  Is it relatively safe?

                 The neighborhood is relatively safe
South prospect park Brooklyn
Intersting a phone number was listed under "hours" and a woman
Answered "east 10th street"
I told her I was interested in giving a Christmas donation and she said she was not allowed to accept only the soc headquarters.    She told me she had six children ages 18-21
My sister is now 5 hours away
And thank you for your concern I will not go there alone but currently do not have anyone to check it out with me.  I live an hour away and with bridges it costs over $20 to travel in and out.  I go in twice a year to visit the cemetery around the holidays for my grandfather
The only thing I can think of is that
It is relatively small and 6 plus people can be overcrowding something fire or police may follow up on.  Long shot though

                  Most definitely try the police and fire dept. first and don't mention anything we talk about on here.  Just that you are concerned.  Not all LE is compromised so good luck.  But be careful what you say, just in case.  Do not give them any personal info about yourself like address or ph#.  Just ask them if they know if the place is on the up and up or if they have had infractions against them.  You need to protect yourself.

            YourNewsWIRE? So you are new? Seems everybody in here is new day after day. YourNewsWire is a fake news site that encourages people in the truth community to make the foolish mistake of forwarding their bogus stories on facebook and social media. Then it becomes obvious that there is no evidence backing their story, and said truther looks gullible and is now ignored.  Are you gullible, new, or just a disinfo piece of shit?

              His criticism was they were overwhelmed by the chaotic situation and that no one was in charge of trying to manage the chaos, or to support this medical mission and thus they couldn't do their jobs as well they had hoped.

             This does not support the claims made in article you posted.  Here's the summary from the email.

              <li>
               <p>
                The complete lack of any organization on the ground. Noone was in charge,
we had the first functional up and running hospital in the P OP area yet noone and
I me NOONE came to the hospital to assess what we were doing, what we were
capable of doing and what we would need, to be more efficient. The fact that the military could not or would not protect the resupply equipment on sunday or let the tues flight come in says it all.
               </p>

              Great find. Hard to believe that a human being with this level of consciousness and sense of "morality" would kill himself in such a way that his daughter would find him. Doesn't add up to me at all. As others said, with his access to drugs he could have done it in a more painless way.

             The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters. We came to understand that our isolated operation may work in a mission, but not in a disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
             We first thought we would support those at the helm but soon realized we were almost the only early responders with the critical expertise and equipment to treat an orthopedic disaster such as this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Still, nobody with a clear plan is in charge, and care is chaotic at best. Doctors are coming into the country with no plan of what they are going to do, and nobody directing them how to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Surgeons who expect to show up and operate will be mistaken. Without a complement of support staff and supplies, they are of limited to no value.
            </p>
            <p>
             We left feeling as if we abandoned these patients, the country and its people, and we feel terrible.

             Helfet himself had connections to Hillary and Bill Clinton and their Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time, the foundation was active in Haiti. Bill Clinton was also the United Nations special envoy for the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             Helfet received “intelligence” from Partners in Health, a non-profit partially funded by the Clinton Foundation, that the General Hospital in the capital Port-au-Prince had two functioning operating rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
             He put together a team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and technicians, 13 in total, to fly on the Synthes plane to Haiti and help however they could.

             You'll be shocked to find the CNN article does not mention the Clinton Foundation whatsoever, nor does it talk about corruption or mapractice.  What the article talks about is chaos in the wake of a massive earthquake.

             Doesn't seem very plausible, does it?   He's also a physician.  Could have access to any number of deadly, non-painful ways to die through medicines.   Why something so violent, bloody, and painful?
