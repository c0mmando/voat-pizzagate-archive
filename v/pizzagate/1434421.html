<p>this goes back to 2000, and actually long before that with Boys Town and Straight, Inc.</p>
<p>Robert Lichfield and friends - many donations to the republican party including the Bush\'s and Mitt Romney</p>
<p>WWASP[S] - World Wide Association of Specialty Programs [and Schools] (the \'schools\' part was added later) - founded by Lichfield and his wife, Betty - these are \'behavioral modification\' programs for &quot;troubled teens&quot; - lots of deaths, torture, &quot;suicides&quot;, &quot;accidents&quot;, abuse, etc.</p>
<p>WWASPS can be tied directly to Washington DC, certainly through Lichfield, but also others</p>
<p>this whole thing seems to be centered around a faction of the Mormons - the Lichfield\'s and the Romney\'s are both Mormon families (also look into &quot;the lost boys&quot; - boys which are kicked out of the Mormon community so the old men have more young girls to rape)</p>
<p>Straight, Inc. - WWASPS may have been derived from Straight - Straight goes back to the Ford era i think (i think it was pushed by Betty) and was also very abusive - i remember the commercials</p>
<p>i do not enjoy remembering this shit, but i suppose some examples might help...</p>
<p>there was a \'Brown\' kid (Lane or Lyane or something) in a WWASPS facility, possibly Carolina Springs - he was pepper sprayed daily for much of his stay at the facility (just over a year as i recall) by Randal Hinton - his mother basically said that his behavior was so radically altered that he requested permission to go to the toilet - there was a video interview with him on the www and it is very painful to watch - his sole was just sucked out of his body by these bastards - he killed himself the day after he was interviewed</p>
<p>a teenage girl apparently spent her stay of many (18?) months at a WWASPS facility being forced to lie face-down on a ceramic tiled floor - this happened to many kids and there are (or were) photographs of it on the www - if they misbehaved, sometimes their ankles would be stepped on (pressing the ankle bones into the hard floor)</p>
<p>another boy was at the Tranquility Bay, Mexico facility (several facilities were outside of U.S. jurisdiction to escape U.S. laws) - one relief from the abusive treatment came when someone escaped - when this happened, the facility would essentially be shut down and the kids could do whatever - knowing this, several of the kids tried to drown this small boy in an attempt to get the facility to close -- there is a very good docu done by a French media company that centers around this boy that may still be on LiveLeak (search for \'Tranquility Bay\') - i think the previous 2 cases i mentioned are covered in this docu also - TB was eventually shut down as i recall, but new ones were always popping up when the reputations of the old ones drew too much negative media attention</p>
<p>at another place, kids were kept outside in chain-link fenced dog pens under the sun in a desert environment when they misbehaved, or forced to run laps around the facility - this place was shut down by U.S. authorities</p>
<p>at least 2 kids were apparently &quot;hit by a train&quot; while trying to escape the Robert Land Academy facility, many others &quot;drowned&quot; while escaping other facilities</p>
<p>some of these tortures often happened under a program called \'Observation Placement\' (OP)</p>
<p>there are many more facilities and hundreds more cases like these that have been documented - there was a table that listed them on a very well known anti-WWASPS site, but apparently it has been taken down (these people have a lot of political clout)</p>
<p>there is another connection here that goes way back - i think it was \'Boys Town\', which, as i recall, was a front that gathered young boys which would be farmed out as sex toys to wealthy pedophiles, including government officials - how this tied into WWASPS i do not recall, but i think there was a link</p>
<p>there is something with the Mormons and i don\'t think i ever got the full picture, but understand that, to my knowledge, there are basically 2 factions of the Mormon religion and only one is involved in this shit</p>
<p>i mention WWASPS and this faction of Utah Mormon\'s because i believe it is likely that they are involved in pedophilia and may be connected to PizzaGate-like activity</p>
<p>WWASPS and Lichfield may be out of business or changed business names, but regardless, i\'m sure these programs still exist - <em>way</em> too much money (i read these programs were one of the fastest growing business in the U.S.) and politics involved for it to just disappear and Lichfield\'s donations to Mitt Romney not so long ago is evidence he\'s still in business</p>
<p>there have been people who may well have been killed for investigating WWASPS too deeply and publishing their findings in the MSM and certainly many that have been persecuted through legal channels and otherwise - these people and companies have a huge amount of political clout, but that shouldn\'t scare anyone here investigating at this level ... i never received any threats after spending over a year exposing the abuses at these facilities</p>

            the interwebs should reveal enough leads to find the guy - might have to write some emails and make some calls
           </p>
           <p>
            ... and while i was writing this i was looking through some old info i had saved and the kids name wasn't Cory, it was Colby L. - makes me angry that i forgot his name, especially since i was in contact with his mother for a while, scheming on how to get the kid out of TB - he was the smallest kid there apparently and she was extremely scared and upset, to put it mildly, but she didn't have custody
           </p>
           <p>
            if that name sounds familiar, let me know - i don't know what happened to him because i abandoned the scene not long after he was transfered - it was all too emotional for me
           </p>
           <p>
            one more lead for you and the reason i was looking at my stuff while writing this - put the word out on the anti-WWASPS/survivor forms that you want to contact "MightyArdvark" - he can likely help you if he's still around - if you link to this post, he may remember who i am and be more willing to help

             Cross Creek Programs, Youth Foundation Success Academy, and Riverview Academy are currently operating under the Youth Foundation, Inc. umbrella and Jade Robinson has replaced Karr Farnsworth as the director.

            so Jade might be another lead

           <p>
            the Cory i'm referring to has a last name beginning with L - small kid - was in Tranquility Bay, then transfered, and it may have been Carolina Springs or Cross Creek ... or neither - i don't really remember

            i was never in these programs - i got involved in the anti-WWASP community after seeing the French docu

            look inwards - meditation - and don't allow anything negative in your life (friends, family, music, movies, etc.) - that would be the best i can offer - also wwaspsurvivors.com
