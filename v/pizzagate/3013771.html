            Here's some background on Bittencourt's involvement from the Australian press:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "The activist believed to have given voice to the abused is Sabrina Bittecourt, a Brazilian currently in hiding somewhere between Europe and the Middle East.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bittencourt says complaints about another Brazilian healer, Prem Baba, hit the air waves at the end of August, prompting her to ask in a Facebook post who was helping the victims emotionally.
            </p>
            <p>
             "To my surprise, women began writing to me. In one month I received 103 complaints from victims of 13 spiritual leaders, including Joao de Deus," she says.
            </p>
            <p>
             She understood the magnitude of the problem, she says, and began working to help mobilise volunteer therapists and lawyers, contacting the media, lawmakers and human rights organisations.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I did it in the most organised way possible because I knew I was staring at the biggest allegations in Brazil's history and there could not be slip ups or people would die."
            </p>
            <p>
             In total, she says she has helped 82 victims of Faria alone. Bittencourt says the women's suffering has brought back memories of her own sexual abuse experiences as a child at the hands of Mormon church member and that she is again, in fear for her life. She says some Faria's aides or supporters have threatened women who raised complaints.
            </p>
            <p>
             She had been told of several Australian victims, including a woman who has taken her own life, but declined to give more details. The claims could not be independently verified.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone who knew of these rumours or knew of some of the victims and worked to transform this man into a myth are complicit. Many people collaborated to ensure the women stayed silent and in fear.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It is time to stop turning people into gods. Today we send probes into Mars, but socially it seems like we still live in the Middle Ages some times."
            </p>
            <p>
             She promised to help more women find their voices in 2019, revealing abuse by other spiritual healers.
            </p>
            <p>
             "If something happens to me, other wonderful people will continue this work. It's a strong group."
            </p>
           </blockquote>

             Yes it is weird and confusing. I'm glad you're involved here. Please keep us updated on what's coming out in Brazil, as we're somewhat frustrated by the language barrier.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just posted somewhere else in a comment that John 'of God' was sort of a national treasure for Brazil. Isn't that so? I imagine this must be a big blow to New Age and alternate spirituality people there.

            Vilanova Grand Marina is in Barcelona, consistent with reports of Bittencourt's supposed suicide in that city. However there is some confusion:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The details of the death of activist Sabrina Bittencourt who revealed allegations of sexual abuse of John of God and other religious leaders are still uncertain. One day after the activist's suicide allegation, her colleagues and her family give different answers about where and when she died.
            </p>
            <p>
             The news was announced at 11:24 Sunday 3 in a note signed by Maria do Carmo Santos, founder. the NGO Vítimas Unidas, in which Sabrina participated. According to the statement, the activist committed suicide in Barcelona on Saturday around 9 pm, leaving a letter of goodbye.

            <p>
             Gabriel Baum, the eldest son of the age of 16, is the only close relative who talks about death. According to him, the mother died in Lebanon and will be buried in this country.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gabriel also stated that he had met his mother for the last time in Paris, before she went to Barcelona and, later, to Lebanon with her girlfriend.

             Today's Blind Items - Killing Spree
            </h2>
            <p>
             People are focusing only on the big name in all of this. The thing is, there were others killed first in this spree. Oh, and they were all killings. There was no suicide. The claim of suicide was made by relatives to try and ensure their own safety. No one actually believes there was a suicide.
            </p>
            <p>
             Was it arranged by the mogul? It isn't like he hasn't protected child molesters before. It isn't like he hasn't protected billionaire sex traffickers before. It isn't like he hasn't helped out his one named A++ list friend when they have needed it before. It isn't his first time being involved in deaths to cover up secrets or to do a favor. I think this was more revenge than anything else. You don't run through the list of victims that were in hiding, all helped by the "suicide" victim and then kill them all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each killing was accompanied with a message to the "suicide" victim. They were coming for her. She knew they were coming for her. She reached out to people to spread the word they were murdering those closest to her. She knew they would come for her family unless she gave up herself to them first. You know the term suicide by cop? This was pretty similar. Show yourself and get yourself killed or the family goes and then they will come and find you anyway after.
            </p>
            <p>
             They launched their killing spree from a yacht moored in Vilanova Grand Marina. Guess who the yacht is registered to? Yeah, the same name he uses for all the yachts he bought with this internet tycoon several years ago. This one he has not bought out, but he is still co-owner.

               "The same name he uses" implies yacht is not registered under his own name. "All the yachts" and buying them out implies more than two.

                Well, he says the attacks were "launched" from the yacht in Barcelona, Spain. He doesn't say when, or whether that's just where they met to plan everything.

                 Bittencourt's denunciation video has been out on YouTube for at least a month. Of course she might have been identified as a loose cannon before that.

                 Looks like the Rising Sun has been around St. Barts since New Years, according to celebrity gossip reports I've found.

                   Yes, and the Daily Mail article says Barcelona. However her son says she died in Lebanon:

                    I have a hypothesis. What if the location of the death is irrelevant to the blind?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    What I’m getting at is the equipment on the offending yacht is what matters.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If the comms equipment is sufficient to quickly send out orders or communicate murder plots, then where she died is less important than the posistion of the offending yacht to the blind.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The blind does say the yacht in question is not registered.

                     No, the blind says the yacht is registered but implies it's under some other name. Note Geffen is known to own two yachts, the first, the Rising Sun he co-owned with software magnate Larry Ellison then bought it outright. He is not known to have co-owned other yachts with Ellison or co-own any yachts currently, as the blind implies.

                    <p>
                     I'm looking at this story, but am skeptical. For me it's just a bit too pat: in the past week or so Geffen emerges as a hot topic of interest in discussions as a leader of the Hollywood Gay Mafia, which has been in the forefront of subverting and inverting societal morality. Oprah parties on the Rising Sun at the end of January. This blind implies G. ordered a hit on Bittencourt and drops the name of a marina in Barcelona, when press reports say she died in Barcelona (perhaps erroneously). There's no other evidence of G.'s yachts in Barcelona so far. (I hear what you're saying, location doesn't matter, but the coincidental location was one of the big 'facts' in this blind.)

                     The blind talks about multiple killings. Here's something to support that:

                      Could be a case of truth plus faulty reporting (likely from sources sending this stuff very early on in the incident before all the information has been verified). We’ll have to wait and see for if this gets revealed.

                      What I suspect is true are the identities of the culprits/victim (Geffen is a monster, I wouldn’t put anything past him). What is wrong is the location of death and the yacht’s posistion.

Yeah, the same name he uses for all the yachts he bought with this internet tycoon several years ago. This one he has not bought out, but he is still co-owner.

                       It's possible someone might use VHF to run comms for an operation they didn't want tracked over cell phones, but that is risky because anyone monitoring the right channel would be able to pick up the broadcast. I would think burner phones would be more secure.

                 According to this tracking site the Rising Sun has been only at ports Koolbai and Philipsburg since December 17, 2018. There's also celebrity gossip reports saying Les Moonves was on it at New Years and Oprah Winfrey at the end of the month. (Ports apparent in St. Martins, most press reports mention St. Barts.)

                    Yes. It's one thing to hint about rumors about some Hollywoodian and another to capitalize on and further mystify Bittencourt's death.

                    I would hope all of the deep, dark CDAN posts would be sincere, but I suppose Enty could be the victim of a rumor also.

                     Yes, fully agree. What bothers me is that this reads as a threat that could be meant to intimitate victims and witnesses. Not good.

              Sure did.  It has certainly been on my mind and awful lot. Pretty interesting how Geffen and Oprah are plotting assassinations from The Rising Son to cover their tracks with this John of God character, watching the new MJ doc on the yacht, and this new character assassination attempt on Fionna Barnett.
             </p>
             <p>
              I certainly agree with Entylawyer that most people looking into any of these events are not focusing on the entire cast of characters.

                 I have to admit I do as well and there is no way that I can come to her defense except for simply letting what has already been exposed be the truth that allows her to remain credible. There has been some very extreme infighting in what seems to have been devastating blow to many of us in the SRA/SA conspiracy/researcher community simply because of the innate lack of trust between us all for the obvious reasons. Not only have the seeds of doubt been heavily spread throughout our community there have been massive litigious and personal attacks from many different nefarious groups intentionally aiming for this end result. It's only an inevitability and we just have to be steadfast and sure in our convictions and be careful to judge.

                 I'm just as confused as you are but be strong in your own guiding light and what the truth tells you.

                   That whole John of God thing is so vile and disgusting...I don't think the proper words exist to describe it. I tend to think it much more likely that someone on the ground locally had Sabrina murdered than Geffen did. Although, it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was Geffen who ordered it given his history.

                    I think that there was a gang of killers sent to Europe to kill all victims and witnesses that have been hiding there.

                    I'm not sure whether it's helpful to suggest it was a wealthy US billionaire, if this part of the story is fiction. This might only be a distraction.

                    The baby trafficking started two decades ago, but Oprah only got involved with John of God from 2010 onwards. Maybe she is involved in baby trafficking (I wouldn't be surprised, tbh), maybe not.

            When I have time, I will do a megapost with EVERYBODY that Sabrina Bittencourt has denounced before dying, it includes João de Deus, Ge Marques, Sri Prem Baba, Derose Yoga Method (very common up here, also inside bjj gyms), Ayahuasca Temples, Umbanda Temples, etc etc. 
I wish I could do something more than denouncing but I DONT TRUST no one. I am even afraid of not hiding myself more up here, with SOCKS5 or VPN ...
One important fact, Sabrina was asking help for OPRAH on her website:
            <a href="http://coamebr.tk/">
             http://coamebr.tk/
            </a>
            . As I told you all, here in Brazil reddit or voat arent very popular.

             You might mention the overall religious landscape in Brazil. It's not at all analogous to the U.S., I was surprised when I learned. There's a few Afro-Brazilian religions (you mention Umbanda) with lots of 'syncretism' (adoption of the Virgin Mary and Christian saints) and spiritualism (Alan Cardack). Quasi-Christian religions such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons (Bittencourt came from a Mormon family) are big there, I understand. Many of the Christians are involved in big-money evangelical operations.
            </p>
            <p>
             By the way, I'm curious, what were the religious affiliations of JdD? Did his operation relate to other religious entities throughout Brazil? (I read a rumor he had an Israeli passport, so Jewish.)

              JdD was a spiritual healer with a syncretism of Christian and Spiritualism. Most sort of Chico Xavier. I remember when I was younger like 20 years ago and saw him on our biggest tv channel, globo (runned by jews), he was shown just like a true god and with that sort of operation without blood.
Chico Xavier was also a fraud AND ALSO A FRIEND OF JOAO DE DEUS (this is the official link from JdD place that mentions his friendship

              But my friend people here are so ignorant that you can say an A against Chico Xavier. Poor People!

             People are focusing only on the big name in all of this [JOHN OF GOD]. The thing is, there were others killed first in this spree. Oh, and they were all killings. There was no suicide [SABRINA BITTENCOURT]. The claim of suicide was made by relatives to try and ensure their own safety. No one actually believes there was a suicide.
            </p>
            <p>
             Was it arranged by the mogul [GEFFEN]? It isn't like he hasn't protected child molesters before. It isn't like he hasn't protected billionaire sex traffickers before. It isn't like he hasn't helped out his one named A++ list friend [OPRAH] when they have needed it before.
            </p>
            <p>
             It isn't his first time being involved in deaths to cover up secrets or to do a favor. I think this was more revenge than anything else. You don't run through the list of victims that were in hiding, all helped by the "suicide" victim and then kill them all. Each killing was accompanied with a message to the "suicide" victim. They were coming for her. She knew they were coming for her. She reached out to people to spread the word they were murdering those closest to her. She knew they would come for her family unless she gave up herself to them first. You know the term suicide by cop? This was pretty similar. Show yourself and get yourself killed or the family goes and then they will come and find you anyway after.
            </p>
            <p>
             They launched their killing spree from a yacht moored in Vilanova Grand Marina. Guess who the yacht is registered to? Yeah, the same name he uses for all the yachts he bought with this internet tycoon several years ago [GEFFEN/BARRY DILLER/LARRY ELLISON? RISING SUN]. This one he has not bought out, but he is still co-owner.

             maybe this whole thing will explode and might need its own subverse here on voat.  Maybe pizzagateBrazil or similar name.

            Oprah was probably grooming little girls or boys for the spirit cooking parties or hot dog parties at the White House with Jay Z and Podestas. Didn't Oprah have an orphanage in Africa or a school for children without parents???
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow.  What an assessment.  Well Oprah did have a school for older girls and one of the girls was pregnant and they found a baby in her gym bag/satchel.  Very interesting.

             Great to see this thread on Oprah, these people think they are untouchable but it looks like I am seeing some nervousness among their crowd finally.

              It would be fantastic to see Oprah and her devotees get the shock of their lives.  That being, the deepest understanding of what is meant by child trafficking through this false prophet and then deeply understanding what is happening worldwide.  Would Oprah cry for the souls, would her devotees be saddened?

              However, the brainwashing is deep to those who watched the exalted idol for 25 years and unfortunately some still do it seems.

              I hope they are having sleepless nights.  We need to rattle them up more often.  This should not be allowed to disappear like others.  We need memes on Twitter.

            Unbelievable.  Dr. Wayne Dyer and Oprah with John of God  Joao.  These are very short videos. 3 &amp; 4 min. and less.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2012 Oprah Winfrey made the journey to Brazil to experience the powerful energy and healing that is available at the Casa. Watch here her talk with Medium Joao.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her visit enabled her to see first hand the work of the entities and the palpable presence of healing in the current room.
           </p>
           <p>
            WAYNE DYER:Wayne Dyer received work and healing through the Distant Healing procedure which contributed to his recovery from leukemia.
           </p>
           <p>
            WAYNE DYER:Wayne explains his healing process through John of God. Please note that Distant Healing and spiritual interventions such as Wayne Dyer had are equal in their effects.
           </p>
           <p>
            These Two Fakes are pushing the Flim Flam of John of God  Bogus Healings.  What's in it for them?  What are they getting?  Money?  Or something else. I can't really believe they actually believe what they are peddling.  A complete sham.

            Wow, just watched her video about the sex slavery/baby trafficking/murder allegations the other day. She seemed very sincere and impassioned; video was quite dramatic, filmed at night in a windy location, she wearing a headscarf.

            It seems that the son of John of God, Sandro, now got arrested as well. Sabrina Bittencourt wrote in her last letter:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On Saturday, Sabrina even made a statement about the arrest of Sandro Teixeira de Faria, son of João de Deus, in Anápolis (GO). He is accused of coercing witnesses who denounce the sexual abuse of the medium.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I confirm that Sandro Teixeira has threatened our witnesses, coerced, entered the house of the people, forbids me to speak with me, Maria do Carmo Santos and Vana Lopes, of the United Victims Group. We are protecting several of these victims and witnesses, "she said.
            </p>

            She said she got death threats from this guy: Paulo Pavesi, an employee of John of God, and that he had several men who would try to find her, and harm her.

             Hi think! Mr Paulo Pavesi is a very controversial person. He got mad (literally) when her son was killed by 7 doctors for organ traffick. He wasnt a Joao de Deus employee. He was exilated outside brazil because of his denounce. 3 doctors were arrested. He was against Sabrina Bittencourt because he was supposed from right wing party and she as left wing party. None of them could ever understand that here, in this shithole, there isnt left or right, there are freemansonry and jews behind every kind of power, politics, media, church, police,arts, etc (Note: I dont have prejudice against jews, I ve took a DNA test and found out that I am fortunaley or unfortunately part jew, before someone shouts that I am a neonazi, it's only a fact)
