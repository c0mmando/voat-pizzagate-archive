  'formattedContent' => '<p>I assure you, I am not LARPing. Unfortunately, and I guess unbelievably, all of these things I\'m about to say are either true, or things I have come to believe. I believe &quot;Pizzagate&quot; is falling prey to the same paranoid distractions that have kept most of America diverted away from the real \'conspiracy\' of 9/11-- that it was funded and carried out by high-ranking Saudi Arabians, some of the United State\'s closest &quot;allies.&quot; I won\'t go into that here, but I\'m using this as an example-- Whether or not it\'s intentional distraction and misdirection doesn\'t matter. Conspiracy hunters get caught up in the puzzle pieces, and miss the larger picture. And I am fairly certain Pizzagate is missing the forest for the trees, because the forest, in this case, will sound crazy to some.</p>
<p>I am going to cut to the chase, and then explain how I came to believe it-- not just because of my experiences, but because of my past; my heritage, and being in the [right/wrong] place at the [right/wrong] time.</p>
<p>Currently, I am writing about this and intend to publish using my real name, because I believe the time is coming for these things to come to light, and I am far from the only one, though I am one of the most public-facing [bold/stupid] ones.</p>
<p>Magic is real, but it\'s not quite what you think. The Illuminati is real, but it\'s not quite what you think. Ceremonial pedophilia is real, but it\'s not quite what you think. And the world, and our species is about to change very dramatically, and it\'s more profound than \'draining a swamp\' or \'financial collapse.\' It could be good or bad, depending on if we can begin to see what\'s going on, before it\'s too late.</p>
<p>I have what has been termed PTSD, ADD, Bipolar Disorder, and manic depression. I believe I have symptoms that could be considered signs of schizophrenia and disassociation. I do not want pity. I do not want handouts. I do not want help. I want to be heard, more than anything.</p>
<p>In the longer version of this-- my book-- my dissertation-- my series of essays, whatever, I will go into what I believe is the scientific explanation for all of this and more, but I want to keep this focused on the themes surrounding the unfortunately named \'Pizzagate.\' (How can you expect outsiders to take this seriously with a name like that?)</p>
<p>So you know where I\'m coming from, I voted this year, but I voted for the write in candidate &quot;none of the above.&quot; I think both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are disastrous choices, and we have entered a no-win situation, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">kobayashi maru</a>. Like Captain Kirk, I am attempting to reprogram the game so \'we\' can win--  we the people.</p>
<p>I have been pulling on this thread for four and a half years. Not only was I witness to violence at a young age, I believe very strongly that I was sexually abused at a very young age. I have a very spotty memory of my youth, and I have been aware of sex for as long as I can remember. I have vague memories of one experience, and not unlike Pizzagate, there is a significant circumstantial evidence that might not have been the only time.</p>
<p>Four and a half years ago, I was a hardline atheist, having been raised as a ultra-conservative Christian Evangelical. I also am of Jewish descent. Not only that, but one grandfather is associated with the Freemasons-- not the shriner\'s club kind, but the secret club kind, and his father in law was a member of the KKK, rumored to be a Grand Wizard. That bloodline is said to go back to Charlemagne. On the Jewish side of my family, I have the surnames of the Jewish preisthood-- more than one.</p>
<p>Most of the coverage of \'Pizzagate\' has focused on the disgusting, abhorrent behavior of pedophiles. I am not suggesting this is to be ignored, rather this is \'bigger\' than simply that. I have \'traveled\' far and wide as a human, and I have a very diverse life story, but this isn\'t the place for that, except to say, I believe this is the reason that I can &quot;see&quot; this.</p>
<p>Here is a video talking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WbRKAyn4-I&amp;t=1s">ritual masonic abuse</a>. This particular guy tries to link it to Crowley, and while that may or may not be the case, I\'m certain this goes on long before Crowley every showed up. I believe that \'magic\' is neither good nor evil, it is simply called different things by different people, and used in selfish, harmful ways, or for the betterment of one\'s group/country/planet. That said, there is plenty of \'dark magic\' in the world, and the vast majority of us agree that raping, torturing and killing children is about the worst thing you can do.</p>
<p>In that video, the man suggests that Masons do this so they can &quot;live forever.&quot; They intend to cause disassociation in the children who are victims, and this also creates a cycle of abuse-- it\'s well known that those abused as children are more likely to abuse children themselves. My theory is that if one\'s development is sufficiently arrested at a given age, their emotional attraction slows or stops at that age, creating a shattered self, carrying a \'dark passenger\' who needs connection, and is locked into a certain age.</p>
<p>At the core of my theories is something that should not be too controversial-- we are animals, just like all the other animals on this planet. We have observed close knit flock and herd and schooling behavior in all manner of creatures, where groups of animals behave as if they were one organism. Humans seem more individualized-- and I believe we are, considering the control we have on the planet, but we haven\'t lost those connections entirely.</p>
<p>I believe many of these connections are through microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses etc. (Simply look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis">Toxoplasmosis</a> to see how much a single parasite can affect the cycle of multiple species.) By raping a child, one mixes blood, semen, and bacteria in two directions, creating a link between the two. I propose that this is more than psychological, it is biological. As disgusting as it is to imagine, injecting one\'s fluids into a digestive track, especially a growing and developing one could very well modify that child\'s development. If you\'d like to see an example of how a protein can modify cognition dramatically, simply look up &quot;mad cow disease&quot; aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy">Bovine spongiform encephalopathy</a>. Not all of these interactions would be &quot;negative&quot; per se-- but influential either way.</p>
<p>I have neither the time nor the desire to go into my grand theory of cognition in this place, but consider the possibility that rather than being simple computers that process input-output from our sensory organs, our brains are actually more akin to radio receivers, tuning in different frequencies of energy-- which we know is the basis of our existence anyway.</p>
<p>This sort of exchange in a developing child would \'tune\' the child to particular frequencies if my theory is correct. And once I began to look for &quot;my kind&quot; I found them in various places, both online and in real life. We can see it in each other\'s eyes. This is not a joke. There is a kind of \'eyelock\' where a kind of deep communication is established. Sure, certain drugs can induce such connections, \'tuning in and turning on\' as Timothy Leary once said, but once you &quot;go there&quot; and get a &quot;larger view&quot; you can go crazy. And I did for a while. Like John Nash in \'A Beautiful Mind.\' Leary also had a third instruction-- \'Drop Out\' and many took that to mean \'drop out of society\' but I believe it suggests to come back to the real world, actually the opposite meaning.</p>
<p>Now, this is only part of what \'The Illuminati\' is-- for I believe that it holds many names, the \'higher ups\' who control our species are ALL Illuminati of one kind or another-- Be it the Vatican, The Kabalah,  the \'Wizards\' of Wall Street and worldwide banking, Powerful Hollywood Producers,  Politicians, and even the likes of Kanye West. I understood exactly what Kanye was saying before he was committed-- when you see \'the thing\' it\'s almost impossible to communicate it-- it\'s maddening-- that\'s one of the reason I\'m holding things back here, you have to let it out a little at a time.</p>
<p>Not only the rich and powerful are in these clubs-- and they are more than back room meetings, though I\'m sure that\'s some of it-- But I have come to believe that the highest levels of &quot;Intelligence Agencies&quot; are completely unspoken-- an uber-hivemind if you will-- several of them doing battle, even. (Again, lots more to say on this some other time.) See: Egyptians, Nazis, Mossad, CIA and on and on...</p>
<p>I believe the highest levels learn to &quot;tune in&quot; certain frequencies on certain channels, essentialy vectors in spacetime, and these are representative of \'Gods\' throughout the ages. Just like the Romans married their pantheon to gnostic Christianity, and kept the weird stuff for the back rooms of the Vatican, and made a version of Christianity to keep their subjects in line, so too are every hierarchy. This is the pyramid scheme that runs our species-- and it always has. This is the Pyramid symbology. You are climbing towards (being or merging with) the all-seeing eye. The Holy Roman Empire just told you never to climb the pyramid, just worship the eye at the top.</p>
<p>I cannot go into specifics here, and I am sorry, but I have been following pizzagate for mainly one reason: Marina Abramovic. She is unquestionably a very powerful witch, and I had no idea until many pieces came together for me. I realized that I had been caught up in her magic. (I\'m sorry I can\'t say more here, it\'s both a long story, and a bit close to home at the moment)</p>

            It sounds like we're grasping around the same of both things. To me, it's "the everything" and "the singular" and life is a balance. We are in a time when those who seek too much for themselves are pulling "too much" out of the system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Influence. Exactly. A network of influence, on many 'levels'
           </p>
           <p>
            And yes.  A collective of us.. It goes in and out. We don't know if we're tuned to the same frequencies but we know it's a real thing. But this also sounds like a lot of different religions/spiritual different stuff. People like me are slowly trying to unwind it.. No single worldview can be 100% right.. that's kind of the point, and creates the problem with those who seek to define it in a "singular" fashion.

            You just admonished me about red string and newspaper clippings. I think you misunderstood me. And perhaps I misunderstood you.  I too have plenty of yarn, scissors, and articles.  OF course you need to link all that stuff.  You've missed my point.. or the forest you might say..
           </p>
           <p>
            Our miscommunication or inability to connect here IS ITSELF as important to observe as the things we are saying. The message is in the meta.  Everything is in the Meta.  Are you with me at all? Your last response to me showed some promise. We're not as far away from each other as I initially thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am by no means saying I'm perfect, and my theory is that anybody can be wrong about anything at any time-- and understanding, accepting, and internalizing that is one of the most important keys to 'moving forward.' It's a paradox to stand up for/make a case for the 'thing you believe' while fully acknowledging you may be 'completely off.'
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing that unifies 'the new ones' as far as I can tell is an ability to mutually admit complete disagreement, but a desire to understand anyway, if even 'around the edges'.  It's the tie that binds us.

            You underestimate the masses power, their value, and their capabilities. You think too highly of yourself even as you accuse this of being my 'ego.' You are pious and sanctimonious to define the "we" for the masses.  Total destruction of the ego is to give up individuality completely.  If you wish to go back to the hive, you go. But you will lose something you will never regain.

            I'm well aware of confirmation bias and must admit, I posted(and replied to you) before noticing the extra comments that extend the original post(in which a flimsy Harry Potter metaphor is ''shoehorned in').
           </p>
           <p>
            I do believe the op is on a similar or same line of inquiry as me and that they are indeed sincerely trying to share important information. A confirmation bias of it's own, sure enough, but I certainly agree that spouting it half-cocked and with flimsy metaphors/citations, dilutes the underlying message - hence why I'm more inclined to hold my tongue for now - the practical side of things is what's important; identifying and exposing the international scope of things and who is involved and above all, saving as many lives as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something to conisder also, as exemplified by FBIAnon, is the purposeful injection of fantasy into fact - so as to maintain plausible deniability. There is indeed a very dark twisted side to all of this, it's not just a matter of bribery and fetish...
           </p>
           <p>
            However, without a solid case in the practical realm of things(who, what, when, where) though, any attempt to explain the why, will come across as delusional - not to mention the target that it may very well paint on one's back at any given point.
           </p>

            It's like having the beginning and end of the story, while waiting for the middle to write itself.

            Unsure if you're a troll or a shill(noticed you're being rather aggressive/dismissive), but, assuming for a moment that you aren't, perhaps you can take a moment to appreciate the need to be accurate and constructive with any claims that are made? I'm sorry if you feel that I'm deliberately holding out (for whatever reason), I'm simply trying to be sure before I post something totally outlandish that does more harm than good.

            If you really think there's nothing here that 'isn't to be learned 100 other other places' I DGAF. You aren't getting what I'm saying, then. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ I literally don't give a shit anymore. Almost everything is there if you can read between the lines and understand. Good luck to you. It's not a 'simulation.' You don't even understand. I'm tired of all this.

            Good read, I disagree with the mental connection you talk about, and the magic. I belive its drilled behavior, triggered by symbols and keyphrases. I agree that this is huge, there are millions of mindcontrol slaves and if they try to break free, they often go to a psychologist, or ritual abuse expert, who is involved and brings them back in line. Most people cant belive that you can program a young brain like a computer, but it is possible and they do it, and the victim doesnt even remember. Cant wait to read more of you and your point of view.

            This brings me to the "other" kind of Illuminati-- There are countless anonymous and ominous youtube videos showing "Illuminati messaging" in Hollywood films, implying that this is some intentional, human plan. It is not. I am a 'creative' person-- I make 'creative products.' Once I learned to see the pattern, I went back and looked at things I have made, which turned out to be downright prophecy for my life, and I believe, beyond myself. 'Creativity' is connecting to the collective unconscious, and this is the 'magic' that creates reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like in the video game Civilization, there are different kinds of powers and victories-- and there are different 'soldiers' in each 'house of magic.' Storytellers are propagandists-- Coin from Hunger Games, or most of 'liberal hollywood.' They believe they are acting in the greater good, and don't see themselves as manipulative. Many storytellers are, in fact, good-- turning visions of dystopian outcomes into guides that help humanity avoid pitfalls of destruction. Sometimes they are selfish and ultimately manipulative in a negative fashion. Just as any of the other houses-- Scientific "visionaries" can get too far ahead of group morality-- this is also a kind of 'magic' It is the intuitive idea that comes from seemingly nowhere, the "a-ha!" moment. Visual artists, poets and musicians just let words and pictures flow out of them, almost in a trance, and they resonate with meaning to others that the author never saw or intended, but that pairing taps into the same "hivemind."
           </p>
           <p>
            Armies and radical fundamentalists beat everyone into a kind of perfect rhythm that responds as a single, autonomous brain-- hypnotized by rhetoric, also developed by a pyramid hierarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like in Harry Potter, there are several houses.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, these houses perfectly align with the 'Meyers Briggs' quadrants.
           </p>
           <p>
            J.K. Rowling, as are most writers, is a MBTI "NF" idealist-- therefore, she wrote the Idealistic Gryffindors as the heroes. The coldly logical Slytherin are the NTs-- That would be both your scientists (with Nazis at the extreme end) and your Financial 'Wizards' who trade on 'futures' for their own gain, rather than that of the whole. The Ravenclaws, the 'ST's, are the bean counters, the nitpickers, the rule-followers-- here you'll find your Army soldiers, your bureaucrats, your police officers-- the kind of scientists that collect data, rather than those who hypothesize. The Hufflepuffs (hobbits) are your SF's-- the sensory driven artist hippies of the world-- not only do they grow the plants, they make the foods, and the art, and feel the energy of the world around them-- And they are sensitive caregivers on the one to one bases (nurses) instead of on the global scale (NF Authors, Lit professors, etc. etc.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Each of these are also pyramids. It's a constant game of March Madness, and once you reach a certain level-- you begin to 'see' things-- and they can very much drive you mad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, I hate to be a tease, but I also believe I have worked out the mechanism of this as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point is, the 'kings of humanity' not only realized this years ago, this has always been the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me bring all this together.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much of this power is 'intutive.' It's just following a 'spirit' -- and these things are labeled by religions and by psychologists as good or bad, but they are all ultimately vectors in a giant math problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is HOW META AWARE ARE YOU?
           </p>
           <p>
            We are in the middle of a massive awakening, and the structure you feel crumbling is crumbling everywhere, because we live in a world of complete interconnectivity and also, ultimately a world that is becoming increasingly impossible to keep secrets.
           </p>
           <p>
            You all smell it. You know something is rotten. I believe that most in the press are not actively trying to cover it up-- while there certainly is some amount of 'infiltration' it is more driven by an instinctual need by many to hold up their existing worldview.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, we are experiencing 'Apocalypse.'
           </p>
           <p>
            And it's a big one.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are reconciling all these worldviews, and nobody is completely right-- Each of the religions thinks theirs is "the right one" even the occultists of varying flavors, and the hardline atheists don't "feel" the things other people can, and have labeled it 'false' always focusing on the mechanism rather than the bigger picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of us are ahead of the curve, and have different pieces of the puzzle-- and many of us are 'the crazy ones.' And it's easy to fall down the conspiracy rabbit hole-- I'm not saying that these connections that have been dug up aren't real or in many cases, valid, the idea of linking them all to one single conscious vast conspiracy is a mistake, I believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            The force that is pulling them all together is subconscious. They really don't know. They are just doing battle for their worldview, and in denial that such things are even possible. Many people are ashamed and hiding, in denial to even themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            But there are 'spirits' but they are not anthropomorphic characters-- they are VECTORS IN SPACETIME. When one learns a 'spell' or mechanism to tap into one of these, one gains power. When one share's one's power in a small group of compatible but contrasting others, that group becomes a 'coven' Whether it's 12 disciples or a pentagram, or an ennegram or an egyption pantheon, or a cabinet, or a board of directors-- it's the same idea.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing is, every once and a while a paradigm shift comes along where we see the whole thing in a new light.  Whether or not there was a historical Jesus of Nazareth doesn't matter-- that name "Jesus" is an avatar for a paradigm shift, where mankind gave up on the sacrifice of animals, to find a more constructive path of forgiveness.  The 'casting out demons' in the bible, was honestly psychotherapy.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there was a 'Jesus' that dude did the rounds, right? He hung out with the lowest of the low and confronted the priests in the temple. He was a prodigy that showed the hypocrisy in the temple, and then proceeded to go on a journey to see all sides of humanity, picking up a diverse group of followers that each added their unique viewpoint to the discussion.
           </p>
           <p>
            And maybe he got too full of himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            But also, maybe the gnostic Christians got some stuff right.  Maybe the 'Body of Christ' is a way of connecting to a hivemind-- and when those stories were bundled together 300 years later, they created a map-- A map to human evolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is the separation of the sheep and the goats if not evolution?

             We are experiencing a transition of power-- the moneychangers in the temple are being overthrown. But they're being overthrown by a bull in a china shop who certainly seems to be hiring a bunch of the moneychangers himself, along with some downright idiots.
            </p>
            <p>
             But don't mistake Trump's magic-- He is a Grand Wizard, too.  He rides the seas of emotion, and speaks not with logical words, but simply in the language of tone. He hypnotized a large portion of the country. Go back and look at his TV interviews when he was a candidate for the GOP nomination. In EVERY SINGLE ONE, he keeps glancing at the camera, as if to include the viewer on the conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
             He's an emotional hypnotist. He reads the zeitgeist and takes control of it. That's it. And the zeitgeist is nearly universally unhappy right now-- and we have elected a wizard of chaos to bring it all down.
            </p>
            <p>
             Abusing children is a sign of power, a physical connection to 'another plane,' a secret handshake of mutually assured destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
             This all connects back, but we have no way of knowing how conscious all these people are-- Does Abromovic KNOW she's really doing powerful magic, influencing the most powerful people in the world? Or is she just going by gut, 'creating art'?
            </p>
            <p>
             At the core of this are two brothers-- the Podestas, who we KNOW have something wrong with them.  We don't need evidence. And that's the problem. We are caught between a witch hunt, which is unacceptable in modern times-- and for good reason, and an over-reliance on empirical data-- there's just as much scientific fundamentalism these days as religious fundamentalism. We are forced to choose sides, but I believe-- I hope-- that most are just caught in the middle.
            </p>
            <p>
             It has been my mission-- It continues to be my mission-- to try to show people what I've seen, because I've been to all sides of this-- or most of them, anyway. We are experiencing nothing short of a modern day
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">
              Tower of Babel
             </a>
             , and our species has entered a period of radical, accelerating evolution, with no combined morality to hold us back.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have held back the 'twist at the end' Sixth-Sense piece of the puzzle that brings this all together, but I can see people putting it together all around me.
            </p>
            <p>
             I feel horrible that some guy fell into this rabbit hole, got emotionally entangled with what is probably some kind of ritualistic abuse, and essentially lost this movement it's last shreds of credibility.
            </p>
            <p>
             My hope is that anyone who makes it this far can take one step to the left and see this with a new paradigm-- I'm trying not to deny any of the work done here, other than to say "vast, vast" conspiracies spoken aloud are far too difficult to keep under wraps.. but there are 'forces' that guide these things.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am in the 'Chapel Perilous' and have been for quite some time. Feel free to google that yourself, and go down that rabbit hole if you wish-- but beware, if you get caught, the paranoia is crushing. I will give you the key I found thanks to a man named Robert Anton Wilson-- He said many things about this journey, but the one that helped me the most was 'When you enter Chapel Perilous, you come out either paranoid or agnostic.'
            </p>
            <p>
             Paranoia is terrifying and a road to insanity and destruction, outward or inward-- just like the guy who took a gun to a Pizza joint in DC. (Again, I'm not saying that there's not something going on there-- but that was foolish as hell, and anybody who immediately jumps to 'false flag!!!' is just as paranoid as that guy. That shit happens.) Agnostic, though-- that's my username.. It doesn't mean "I don't know if there is or isn't a God."  It means-- be switzerland. Be neutral. Don't assume one side is good or bad at all times, everybody is playing the game with their own agendas, whether they know them or not.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have been led down this path by someone or something and it has resulted in the most terrifying administration in modern history, if not the entire history of this country. Don't get me wrong-- I fought tooth and nail against Hillary Clinton. I believe she is a criminal and guilty of treason-- but whether it was the Russians, or some kind of species-wide lemming switch, we are in for a VERY bumpy ride.
            </p>
            <p>
             And both Hillary and Donald are Voldemorts. We were forked in chess by someone or something.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will leave you with this:
            </p>
            <p>
             Everything is energy. The only combined language we have a a species right now is financial-- those who have the most power, are the ones who have learned to profit from that system. Money is nothing more than stored energy. It is a unit of measurement that is exchanged for goods and services-- all created with energy using energy and resources, which are themselves energy that is mined using energy and was created with energy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like wizards with wands, we fight for the control of the energy using our various spells and talents.
            </p>
            <p>
             4chan, 8chan, Reddit, and now Voat have created hiveminds of hiveminds that can rally the collective processing power to create great magic. The Kek thing is real-- in that it tapped into something in the universal unconscous.  But beware, we are presently opening pandoras box in SO MANY ways.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't get too distracted. It's like ancestry.com-- if you've ever played around with that.. You WANT to make connections and build a giant family tree, but sometimes you make some connections that are dodgy in the name to building an extensive lineage. But if you miss one step, the whole thing is invalid.
            </p>
            <p>
             This has become a giant game of Ancestry.com. There's plenty of real dirt in here. I want to find ONE real publication that will probe the Podestas, their relationship to Freud, and that Madeline McCann thing. The suspect photos are just too similar, and Tony Podesta is clearly into some very, very weird shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             I like art. I am an artist. I went to art school. Art uncovers your soul and your subconscious,, both as an artist and as a patron. Those guys and James Alefantis downright reek. But we have no idea where any transgressions, if there were transgressions took place. One can only hope that somewhere, there's some serious investigators in the FBI who are less worried about their personal repercussions than finding out the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the same thing goes for Trump. He's dodgy and dishonest. While he may not have been involved in a pedophiles ring, why haven't we been able to open his taxes for scrutiny?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's time for a change. It's time to blow the doors open wide and shine the light of truth on all of this-- but we have to realize what we're doing. Are we ready to find out all the dirty shit everybody's been doing for generations? And that the world may be "not as it seems"? At that this might  be a real "Apocalypse" (Not THE Apocalypse, but AN Apocalypse.)  Because those are the threads we're pulling on.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you've felt what I've felt-- when you've seen what I've seen, you KNOW there's something more, and that everybody calls it different things and is ready to die or even worse, kill themselves to kill others on behalf of WHAT TO NAME THESE THINGS, that's when the bottom of your stomach truly drops out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Be careful what you wish for.

            The witch thing by me also. For someone of European decent to look like that at. 70
Plus remember the Eastern European nobility used to bathe in the blood of her victims.

             Fun story. My Grandfather's (German) side of the family came from the Black Forest area of Germany.. And I found the records tracing them all the way back there.

            Yea, I believe in some Easter  philosophy believe that you retain some energy/ tied to whomever we have sex with.
           </p>
           <p>
            These so much YES in this great post.
Also they believe that doing this they retain a sort of wildness no boundaries while maintaining tighter boundaries on the populace

            You're not alone, in belief or spirit/mind.
Like you, I can not say much more on the subject - not yet anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            I for one, at least, can assure you that the bigger picture is what is on my mind at all times - these smaller pieces of the puzzle, the ones that fit anyway, are still important in building a case that can be presented to those who would consider any or all of this to be too fantastical to be believable, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            The advantage 'they' depend on, is the ability to be considered imaginary, or otherwise mocked via so-called 'meme-magic' - this advantage is also their Achilles Heel though, as more and more people are indeed treating this as plausible reality - rendering their advantage moot when those people begin to understand and/or utilize the 'magic' that they were taught to believe is fantasy.
