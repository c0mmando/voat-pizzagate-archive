            This man, according to then secretary of the elders Larry Fisher, confessed in 2011. He was retained as a member as long as "he not have anything to do with children.‚Äù  according to the aforementioned source. The congregation was not informed of this until after Nick got arrested in 2013.

            The pastor was asked called up by the Hawaii Tribune Herald, the newspaper claims he didn't respond fast enough for his answer to be included in the newspaper. To this day I can find no formal response to these events from the pastor.
           </p>
           <p>
            He plea bargained, pleading
            <a href="http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/child-molester-sentenced-five-years">
             guilty
            </a>
            to 13 counts of third-degree sexual assault.In exchange the state  the state dropped two counts of continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of 14, which would have carried a penalty up to 20 years
            <a href="http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/child-molester-sentenced-five-years">
             guilty
            </a>
            and was sentenced to five years. Which Sounds pathetically short, he will be out in no time. He came from Moscow, Idaho where he is alleged to have abused a developmentally disabled girl starting when she was 9, he left before she could formally lodge the accusation against him.

            Krivanek even played santa at community and church events.
           </p>
           <p>
            With Krivaneks connections to the church I would have expected the state to do a formal investigation of the church, but even this year I have come up with nothing indicating that such has occurred.
