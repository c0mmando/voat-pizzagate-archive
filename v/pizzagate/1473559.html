<p>The children seemed forced to be acting like they were having fun. </p>
<p>At one point multiple adult men walked in a back room, after which the children stopped playing and went in the back room to join the men. </p>
<p>After some time, the children came out, but the men exited through the back doorway into the alley. </p>
<p>Now what would explain that? Let me briefly give you my own assessment as to how this operation is being conducted.</p>
<p>It is a process that spans three locations within the facility. </p>
<p>First location: dining area, containment area for normal customers, but for clients it is the payment area. 
Second location: ping pong room, containment area for child prostitutes. 
Third location: the &quot;party room,&quot; where you enter and the child follows you inside for sex. </p>
<p>FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN UNASSUMING CUSTOMER </p>
<p>You go in, order a pizza, eat, and leave. Seems perfectly normal, and you can\'t understand for the life of you why people are making such a big fuss about pedo activities happening at a &quot;beloved family kid-friendly&quot; restaurant. Must be &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>
<p>FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A CLIENT IN THE KNOW</p>
<p>You go in and order, as a returning client. You are told what kind of slices are available today. You respond with your preference. A slice of (literal) pizza is brought out to you and you make a payment. While you are finishing your literal pizza, the secret pizza (a child) is prepared for you in the backroom (that is, the child is given instructions to play by the fusball table and follow you in the party room when you arrive). You then make your way to the back room to &quot;leave&quot; through the party room. </p>
<p>Once inside the party room, you wait a couple of minutes, and the child of your choice enters. You then engage in sexual relations with the minor. The camera in front of the party room ensures nobody is approaching and the solid black curtains give you privacy. After you are finished with the child prostitute, you dress the child and you leave through the alley way. The child returns to the ping pong area. </p>
<p>Watch the person\'s description in this video now:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJrkbgiETzs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJrkbgiETzs</a></p>
<p>Now who provides these children? Believe me, there is not some basement where dozens of children are being held. No, it would be &quot;foster parents&quot; who escort the children there, and take them back home after a day\'s work of prostituting. </p>
<p>If this is all true, it explains why Alefantis is so comfortable in asserting &quot;come in and see for yourself, there are no children being imprisoned here.&quot; Folks, it bears all the indications of a low-level child prostitution front, and that is why we should not expect there to be a &quot;basement&quot; with 100s of children locked up. There IS a basement at Buck\'s, and whatever was in there was certainly cleaned up weeks ago. </p>
<p>Now given what was said in the video, and if this is all true, it would mean that one can scour online history and find any children who appear to be foreign and who are playing in the ping pong/fusball room, and then cross-reference them with missing persons reports or, more likely, adoption records. </p>
<p>Here are just a few. We must be careful before saying that these children are being forced into prostitution, and we hate to speculate on such matters, but we have been forced into this position because Alefantis has signaled pedophilia so much. Thus we only want to ensure that these children are safe and in good hands. If you can help verify these children are safe, please let us know. </p>

             I did this 30 years ago! You will kill more children trying to be a hero than to accept that you can't do it all! Do not promote any engagement and you might as well forget that place now. I posted requests for a lab tech to grab some food samples from the places a week ago to sneak in some DNA tests looking for human DNA but nobody responded and by now there will be nothing. They are not fucking retarded morons, these creeps have grown up do this, their parents did this, their grandparents did this.

             It is always the same families. Try to figure how many of these families are and how they are connected. That would constructive. Disassociate this from "pizzagate" and raise awareness of human trafficking and pedophilia.

            so glad you are pursuing this. I think we need a thread for all the children who have appeared in photographs, in suspicious circumstances. they should have been accounted for by now. there has been nothing, that I know of...

            Yea fair call she had a face on trying to gain from the post, can we identify the kids in the video? Is there any way to cross reference the kids pics
With missing kids? Surely we can do that some how if Facebook can do it with your display pic

            This seems shill like, the girl presenting this video seems waaaayyy too normal and calm To be worry about a serious situation, yea there is the odd pic here and ther but way too many cuts and edits and she doesn't seem offended at all!
