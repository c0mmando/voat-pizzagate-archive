<p><strong>Parallel construction is a law enforcement process of building a parallel—or separate— &quot;evidentiary&quot; basis for a criminal investigation in order to conceal how the investigation actually began.</strong></p>
<p>An example of parallel construction would be if your cell phone is unlawfully tapped to track your activity and whereabouts at a time, t, during which you committed a crime. Because this is an <strong>unlawful</strong> means by which to link you to the crime you committed at t, it would not be admissible in a criminal court proceeding. Thus, a separate (lawful, and thereby admissible) chain of evidence would be developed to show the court that at t you committed the crime. Both evidentiary paths lead to the same conclusion, but only one be <strong>used</strong> to show that you committed the crime. </p>
<p>On the basis strong inductive evidence, it is virtually certain that the Podesta brothers are involved in child abduction, and that the eFits are an example of parallel construction. There are three obviously shady features of the official &quot;eFit story&quot; worth keeping in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>The eFits were supressed for five years.</li>
<li>The witness testimony they were based on is dubious. </li>
<li>The private investigation company that helped produce the eFits is being hunted by the Clinton-appointed DOJ.</li>
</ol>
<p>What likely occurred is this: John and Tony were being monitored unlawfully, possibly by the NSA, or some other intelligence actor. Whoever found out what they did, wanted to leak the truth to the world, but could not reveal the means by which they found out. Thus they created the eFits as parallel evidence. That is why we now have the eFits. </p>
<p>It is a leak. And someone on the inside wants to help bring down this organized human trafficking syndicate. The Podestas might be key players in the syndicate. Outing them would create a domino effect. </p>
<p>It is a multi-billion dollar human trafficking red market operated by international regimes and cartels. Pedophilia, organ harvesting, blood storage, forced prostitution, psychiatric and pharmacological experimentation, sextortion blackmail, human donations, and yes sadistic torture for fun -- you name it -- that\'s what these children are put through. </p>
<p>It needs to be brought down efficiently while preserving continuity of government, otherwise there would be a national security crisis and multiple declarations of war. </p>
<p>What is our role in this? To spread the information as widely as possible. We are conditioning the public for the forthcoming crash landing. It will be talked about for the next 100 years or more. </p>

            when i got to this topic a week late, the first thread i read was a note from supposedly a firmer comet employee. mentioned it's much worse than we can imagine. fbianon has said same thing. author said to stop eating pizza, especially dominoes. another poster found over 80 orders for dominoes pizza specifically by DNC during campaign. i wont let myself make this connection any darker as ti what could be driving their thirst for this specific pizza but it scares me to the core as to possibly why.

            Theory:  They recognized the Podesta brothers (knowing them through Clement Freud) and got some b.s. explanation at the time.   Therefore, they decided to hide the eFits.

            I think it is worth noting that one of the stuffed animals was a teddy bear, which is referred to as a "pedo bear" in the pedo world and also there is  place called The Endless Summer Bar &amp; Pizza in Portugal that has a spitting image little girl lover FBI pedo symbol. I'm not sure of the distance from where the Mccann's were on holiday to this place but I think it is worthy of some investigation to see if their is any links to pizzagate.

            I saw this somewhere, not my original thought. Just thought I would pass it on. Truthfully, I am 64 years old, and feel just helpless in this. It was such a twisted thought, almost laughable, but kinda makes you think with all this going on, that even the implausible can be possible.....

            Point is, they would surely be aware of the unique eye condition. I remember back at the time when she went missing thinking how stupid it was of them to publicise this, as such an identifiable feature would clearly panic a kidnapper and put the child at increased risk.
I now do not believe for a second that Madeleine was kidnapped at all. Those sniffer dogs do not lie.

            The documentary referenced in this thread says the McCann's were provited with the eFits and 'handed them over to authorities.'    Why weren't the eFits publicized immediately when created?  Why were they deep sixed for FIVE YEARS?

            Madeleine McCann had a unique feature on her right eye, which was heavily publicised at the time. You can see it here

            The same British government so many people claim are in the occult from the VERY top? I highly doubt it.  I have not really looked into them as much but I don't get a good feeling.  I definitely think something is up.  I was down a rabbit hole a few nights ago and stumbled on Jon Bonet Ramsey autopsy photos and noticed she had a heart drawn in the inside of her hand. I really am not trying to draw people away from pizzagate and I have been scolded by people on this site for bringing up Sandy Hook and such but there are so many links that just take me back to these places whether I want to be there or not!

            This is one of those areas that make me wonder if it's really all that wrong to 'construct' the case in a way that will allow for justice to be served if it's due.

            I came across this site. It has all the historical flight records back to 2002. If the Podestas were in Portugal, they would have had to land at Faro airport. Since Podesta has his own plane it would have been logged. An International flight plan would have had to be logged . Plus the pilot would have had to fill out his personal logbook.http://www.oag.com/flightview/historical-flight-status

            This is a brilliant and important bit of research here, and i follow the logic of it clearly. 
A lesser known development in the alleged kidnapping was the fact that 2 dogs, trained to scent blood and bodies indicated the lounge floor at the window for blood, and the bedroom cupboard for body. This suggests that the child was not kidnapped but died in the apartment. The McCanns were very quick to dismiss this piece of evidence when it came to light. The dogs also indicated the hire car that was used by the McCanns for blood.
I feel that there may be a possibility that the detective, already being at odds with the Clintons, produced these efits as a warning shot for them to leave him be. This seems to fit with the narrative that you give, combined with the dog evidence. The presence of the small mole suggests that these were sketched from a photograph, rather than the memory of a witness as a guide.
Podesta had numerous properties, one in Venice, Italy for example. Perhaps he and his brother would be less guarded about their activities whilst abroad, making the locations outside of the US that we an connect him to a potentially more fertile ground for research. 
Either way, the thrust of the OP stands and I join the many others complimenting the writer for it. 
This is a great source you have here generally at this site, and the quality of research in this, and many other posts is first class.

            a) the efits could be of the people who commissioned the snatch and were arranged, as insurance, by the ones who were hired to do the snatch.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            b) The efits could have been arranged by underworld figures, who know previous activities of the efit characters in that space, and used as blackmail or to extort money.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            c) same as b) however opportunistic underworld figures carried out a snatch knowing those in the efit were holidaying in that area and it was the perfect blackmail/extortion opportunity

           <p>
           </p>

            We should treat these images the same way law enforcement does in our presentation to the public (our "court of public opinion"). We can't convince someone of this parallel construction...it's too circumstantial and seems to be reaching to someone unconvinced of all the other damning evidence. So this should just be used as confirmation for us, and leads us on in the investigation, but should not be part of our presentations (memes, aggregations, images, etc.) to the public. It's not convincing evidence by itself and should not be submitted to the "court of public opinion".

            You're correct, that is their intention, to discredit. Twitter is flooded with infographs of pizzagate and each one has the e-fits and some retarded caption about the brothers and Weiner GUILTY! it's fucking ridiculous and the fact that the mods here are letting it go on despite a month of simple facts being presented is very discouraging.

            What do you mean by the forthcoming crash landing? We hope there are plans in place by people who do not want to enslave us. At least I speak for myself. Can this be elaborated upon? I assume also you are talking about the so-called "global currency reset"?

            This is all wild conjecture, but please bear with me. I'm just repeating what I had read that is out already out there (somewhere), may have been on Voat in comments or in a blog, whatever. I'm just floating it out there. It would need investigation by someone qualified....I also remember FBI anon saying something about not only following the CF but also Big Pharma.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I remember reading somewhere a comment Madeline McCann had the same genetic defect that Soros had (what that is I don't know, but I do see a defect in the iris in her eye and having just been diagnosed with a genetic eye disease myself it stood out to me). Also a comment that she was conceived in-vitro - have no idea if any of that is true or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I'm thinking, with the stuff about the blood bank and the hypothesis about young peoples blood perserving life...what if she was connected to that important, rich and powerful person via in vitro conception, and we know that important person is connected to people in the DNC, who would do some dirty work (kidnapping). She would have genetically the same blood/stem cells or something and her blood could be harvested (ongoing) for blood transfusions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wild and crazyy for sure and I feel a bit like an idiot for even thinking this. But after seeing what I've seen, who knows? I just want to go back to my stupid little life.

             I've heard that she really don't have that defect...only put there so if they were questioned with the child they could say no it's not her just look at her eye it's normal...but who knows! Crazy indeed

            This makes total sense. I suspected they knew this. I thought it was too weird that they were called one man in the press when it was very clearly two different men. And so spot on. Do you know who runs findmadeleine.com? It seems to be a local law enforcement agency in the UK. So they likely are on board.

            The day will come when the unsung hero can be honoured appropriately. But for now, there is a war that we need to win. The worst thing is that due to the secretive nature of what is being investigated, we don't know exactly who the main enemy is or what their true motives are. Many of us were led onto delving deeper into #PizzaGate not by our mutual hatred of paedos, but scepticism about globalism, that took a turn for the worse. This could yet become something worse than child abuse or corruption alone.

            How can the E-fits be of the same man when they look nothing alike, plus whoever even noticed a mole. It's spitting image of the Podesta brothers, the only way it could get any closer is to have real pictures.

            What's going now is living history. And it would have been swept away had Hillary won, and Soros et al had been able to continue their globalist agenda. This shit would only have rooted deeper into into our culture. It's all sickening and scary, but we do live in amazing times. Great people and greater sense of ownership of our society and fundamental, undiluted culture is emerging out of this shit.

            I hope one day we can officially recognize the people who leaked all this data as the heroes and amazing human beings they are. I think we lost our great middle-man Assange in this war. Hopefully we won't lose too many more before this finally gets broken open.

              Most likely. Everything points to him being dead (or possibly secretly captured). Unless anything happens to prove he is alive and well (we can only hope...) then unfortunately, the most likely scenario leads us to believe he's dead.

            Thanks OP,  good post, seems like a logical theory.  The e-fits are practically photos of these guys.
Do you have any more information on:
3. The private investigation company that helped produce the eFits is being hunted by the Clinton-appointed DOJ.
So many whistle blowers dying...

            I feel like this IS really them and they were really the ones who kidnapped her! I think that's part of their adrenaline high!  The excitement of possibility getting caught drives them.  It probably was a computer generated sketch from a photo or video.  The photos were released in 2013.  I feel like it was not by accident that it was John Podesta's email that was hacked.  Someone did it because they knew what his emails would expose.  He's high level whatever...probably higher up the good chain than the Clintons if it gets right down to it.  He's in the center of it ALL even going with Bill Clinton to get Laura Ling in North Korea when she was investigating human trafficking on Steve Bings plane.  He's the glue that keeps all these creeps together!  Tony Podesta is even a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia!  I think it's even him in this picture in this post.

            Nothing wrong with speculation, but it's certainly not a "breakthrough." The fact of the matter is we have no idea why the eFits match the Podestas so well.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not so much that what OP is saying can't be proven -- it's that I could easily concoct a million other theories to explain the available evidence just as well. There's nothing in the post to strongly suggest that OP's theory is particularly interesting or likely even if it can't be proven.
           </p>
           <p>
            The real answer is probably a little more complicated than "the good guys did it."

            There are plenty of very accurate police sketches. And you're forgetting the one about Anthony Weiner.

            They look identical, something which I found quite extraordinary as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the mole part though, I keep seeing that being pointed out...in the eFit the mole is on one side of Tony's forehead but in the picture it's on the other. Why is this being trotted out as more confirmation? Isn't that just a detail which is off rather than a further confirmation?

              I'm a Nazi. Outside of the left/right illusion. The only way this jewish destruction of western civilization and the White race will end is if the people rise up and create a unified, total resistance. Trump is the first step towards Nazism and I hail him as a hero in that way. And he does have some basic morals and is against this stuff.

                Alpha male. Authoritarian personality. Steadfast struggle in the face of total evil and degeneracy. Dog-whistling about race and Jews. Using language that is very similar to NSDAP about internationalism. Not to mention we, the alt-right, pretty much got him elected, we created the vanguard culture. We were his most steadfast supporters from the start - no one else was even close. I mean, I could keep going.... But most important is that he is creating an environment where Nazism can rise up in a few years after people recover from their brainwashing and the next generation grows up under a Trump admin.

                 Thanks for taking the time to reply.  Objectively looking at your examples, I see him maybe being the presidential politician most closely aligned to Nazism, but only because the others are not even close.   Saying that the alt-right got him elected is a stretch.  A lot of former Obama supporters flipped and voted Trump, that was the decider in the battleground states.  That's not to say there are plenty of white superiority supporters who see him as a leader of their cause.  But I think he is really more about getting rid of illegals, not any specific race.  Because he is a business man, and the illegals are dragging down our economy.  Just my two cents, and I admittedly know very little about Nazism.  So I could be wrong, just stating my perception based on what I know at this time.

                  Of course he is not 100% Nazi. But the immigration thing is pushing implicit whiteness to the very limits. And I don't think the core culture can be underestimated. There is also the fact that just about every Jew in a position of power was screeching against him for 2 years.

            This makes perfect sense as I highly doubt they were physically responsible for abducting her. I'm sure they would leave the grunt work to some low level criminal.

             Right, but it encouraged people to join the dots didn't it? Who knows though. I think they get a thrill from how much they can get away with. Its all a big game to them....like serial killers giving clues, it feeds their ego.

            This is the video put out 3 years ago:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9OukW44mOw">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9OukW44mOw
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The parents sued a newspaper in England that suggested they (the parents) had suppressed the evidence of the E-fits or not given them to the authorities.   The paper printed a retraction that the parents had, in fact, handed over the E-fits to investigators but said oddly 'within" a date which was a year later.   So it was vague.  The parents eventually settled for 55k L.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some thoughts:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Wouldn't the parents want these images out AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to the abduction?   They were the best lead.
            </li>
            <li>
             Wouldn't the authorities want these images out instead of sitting on them for years?
            </li>
            <li>
             I agree the images are just too dead on (including the mole) to be legit eyewitness recreations but are likely a CIA/FBI leak.   I distinctly remember them coming to light on 4chan and Reddit within DAYS of the election.   That was a bomb someone was waiting to drop at the right time - and it was a big one.
            </li>
            <li>
             Some 4chan thread later said 'FBI Anon source confirms' the Podesta Brothers were in Portugal at the time.   Would seem this could be verified.
            </li>
            <li>
             4chan chatter now that John Podesta is currently in Japan at some island and it's the same one he suggested Hastert go to and hide.   They also had images of his brother (Tony) having been there decades ago.   Town/Island called 'Nose' Japan?  It's on 4chan.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Excellent post though and one of the best thus far on this site.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note also the investigator group hired by the parents were later convicted of squandering hundreds of thousands of pounds improperly running the investigation    Who told the parents to hire them?

             That has never been verified. Plenty have asked for verification but none has ever been produced. Yet  it is being spread as fact.

             No, they were involved. Pedophiles themselves, along with their travel friends. That isn't a mystery. Please look elsewhere for info on this case. If you do that it'll be the first thing you find.

             The UK police helped to cover it up. The pope helped. Max Clifford was in charge of the cover-up and he had years of experience helping Savile cover his crimes. He almost went to prison for life a few years ago for being an accessory to Savile but he's too big to jail.

              If parents were involved (IF - I can't imaging something that sick) would explain them hanging out with Clement Freud after AND choosing to not make the eFits public.

             My understanding is the original investigation was focused on a man seen carrying a child sometime in the 9 PM hour.  However years later, they found this man and he was carrying his own child to bed.  The suspect in the efits was seen in the 10 PM hour, but was originally dismissed because they thought the earlier man was the suspect.
            </p>
            <p>
             They basically started the investigation over and came to new conclusions and that's when they released the efits and did a TV special that night.

            A couple thoughts.. 1) I always assumed those were made off of actual pics. The entire story of "this is supposedly TWO different witnesses recollections of the same man have never made sense. A witness doesn't usually interpret the weight of a suspect so incredibly differently than another witness to the same person. 
2) After these were released no further evidence has turned up related to Podesta's or to those images, so was someone caught out and silenced? Meaning, if we are to assume someone was attempting to steer the investigation toward them that person stopped pushing that narrative after the images were released.
3) The Freud dinner connection is simply too convenient. Why would a known pedo, who's also semi famous, insert himself into the middle of what was an international media shitstorm yet no one was aware of the dinner until Kate McCann wrote about it? I have never been of the opinion that the parents were involved. More likely there were cops on the take who obfuscated the investigation in the media or they were just plain incompetent. My guess is if they had been "in" on something as nefarious as has been suggested (in cahoots with Freud/Podesta's) than their "acting" would have been more in line with what people would
            <em>
             expect
            </em>
            from parents in this situation. Most of the criticism against them had to do with their supposed off behavior.

             Their behaviour was fishy, they looked strained, no indication of guilt obviously, by maybe an indication of pressure placed upon them. Or maybe I'm being overly suspicious of parents who lost a daughter amongst intence media attention.

              Well I'd just point out that the media also leads your emotions in those cases. Now that you're red pilled you may view it differently? Oftentimes it is the lens through which we are viewing something that is dictating our opinions and the MSM has done a fabulous job of blue pilling everyone. For instance, what if the talking points for the McCann's was all about how their behavior was odd and Kate wasn't crying enough ect? Then that's how we view it and absorb the info. But, if the talking points were "Kate has been heavily sedated and is in shock. She had been so hysterical the first night that they had to call in a Dr to administer meds to calm her down. They have two other children who are confused and needing stability so they are trying to remain in control of their emotions so as not to alarm them"? Also remember the Brit press is BRUTAL. (Ask Amanda Knox). And Kate in particular seems to have a classic Brit disposition where you don't wear your heart on your sleeve. Just my two cents! 😉

            The only part I disagree with you on is the continuity of our government. We need to abolish the CIA and institute a new government. We need a fresh country. Our's is 200 years past its expiration date.

             Yeah I agree. Abolish the CIA, abolish the Federal Reserve. I think that the perpetrators should be studied to find out what kind of brain damage/abnormalities they have so that we can find a way to make sure no one like that ever exists again - find a cure for it somehow. Once that's done, toss them all into a meat grinder feet first, as I saw someone had suggested on another thread.

              The main problem with the US Constitution is that it attempts to redefine the law of the land. Due process involves proper investigation.

              Well let's re-evaluate the constitution. You have to dig something up from the roots. You can't leave the roots there, because very clearly, they are damaged/faulty. Soil needs to be rebuilt and reinvigorated with life before things can take root. Let's keep what we want and change the rest. Females need equality written into the foundation document, and we should even question the point of keeping the federal network itself together as such. We might do best as regions. I think we can think bigger, more visionary, while retaining what we know is good, such as press freedom. I think religious freedom cannot go in. Men abuse people under this and it is at the root of pizzagate. Let's keep thinking and pushing harder.

               To have press freedom, media ownership needs to be broken up. It needs to be illegal for one person/corporation to own more than one or two media outlets, otherwise you end up having a dictatorship without free press without realising it - it's just your dictators are CEOs instead of government.

               COMPLETELY disagree! Religious freedom stops when it infringes on someone else's civil liberty.  It's already like that.  Most immigrants came here for being persecuted based on their religion.  Shirah law is used in Muslim countries not here.  Most Jehovah witnesses believe if a woman is raped and doesn't scream loud enough it's her fault.  Again, currently, in this country rape is illegal no matter what! Read it.  My dad used to carry a copy of the Constitution in his back pocket.  It's not the constitution that's the problem.  It's our corrupt court systems that do not follow it.

                Except that religious freedom gives men the right to control females, period, since the beginning of patriarchy. 
Are you so blind to this, as it manifests right here in Pizzagate, in so many ways? Rape is legal in most countries within marriage.
Rape is not prosecuted when it is illegal. I mean, honestly, get a clue. You have GOT to understand this from the female side.

                 Not following.  Can you give me an example where in this country someone was able to rape a woman by claiming the first amendment? I'm not saying there aren't some nut case men who tell there wives that but actual case law that supports what you're saying.

               The problem with the US Constitution problem can be seen as a conflict between common law and civil law. The civil law originated in Rome, and from Rome comes symbols like the eagle and fasces and political ideas like the separation of powers. The common law comes from England, but it is misrepresented by the political class as being nothing more than case law or judicial precedent.

            The fact that they're linked to paedophilia and child trafficking doesn't mean that that they were personally involved with the McCann case. The efits, the email timing, and the anonymous tips could all have been part of a plan to frame the Podestas.

Where did you catch the info about blood storage?
I ask, because today I posted two articles, that indicate that blood transfusions with blood from young people may be/become a HUUUGE black market:

             You should go to podesta emails and search WYSS. You'll get 4 pages of results. Note the tone of some of the emails. Pretty shady stuff.

               Interest in the case has been driven by the fact that Wyss, whose net worth is estimated at $6 billion, is politically connected to the Clintons and to John Podesta, her national campaign manager.
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Golden, age 67, died when Chapman
               <strong>
                inserted a bonelike cement into her spine that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Four other patients died on operating tables when the company conducted the same operations.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               The
               <strong>
                human experimentation charge
               </strong>
               was repeated on Monday by the lawyers for Golden’s daughter Cynthia Wilson, who is suing on behalf of her mother.
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Unbeknownst to Golden, Chapman was not an independent surgeon but was a paid consultant to Wyss’ company and received a $2 million “endowment” from Synthes for a chair at the University of Washington where he still sits.  The university is a defendant in the state case.
              </p>
              <p>
               Prior to using the substance on people, Chapman conducted tests for Synthes by inserting the material into pigs.  All the pigs died.
              </p>
              <p>
               Despite his company’s disregard for federal safety laws, Wyss enjoys political connections to prominent Democrats, including those in the Obama and Clinton administrations.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 2013 Wyss committed $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and has given at least $4 million to Podesta’s Center for American Progress.  The Swiss citizen has a seat on CAP’s 12-person  board.

             Well if you've just started you better buckle up because you're in for a ride! And not a good one! One you'll lose sleep over and have trouble eating! Documenting the facts is more important than anything BUT I think putting forth hunches in this forum for other people's eyes is not bad either as long as we don't mislead them as facts.  For instance this is my post
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1455529">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1455529
             </a>
             I have a lot of experience with investigating serial killers and other psychopaths and there is something about the photos that give me that feeling!

              I feel you. To me it is about having the informatoin gathered so it doesn't get lost over time, other than those memes, article and posts that are just as important in playing their own role. Also, having a place to understand pizzagate without relying on hours and days of investigation. I've spent four days straight doing  just that from the first moment I decided to give this some attention. Now I udnerstand the severity of what it means and the importance of bringing forth major changes. The only thing I can do is be the example I want in this world, and I don't have many other options anyway (I would do something radical if I lived nearby, or ask a friend to, where I live people are much more eager to act in service of civil justice if you know what I mean).

               Well I believe in bringing people to justice in a court of law and I think it needs to be be done in somewhat of a Geneva Convention type of tribunal.  These are against so many laws that reach far beyond our borders!  Something like the Nazi Trials!

                True, however I'd like to see them incapacitated NOW. They should at least have their freedom taken NOW. Think of the innocence of life they defile.

            So this whistleblower just said fuck it when nothing happened for years after releasing the exit?  This is like Bush supposedly framing Saddam about wmds -- you couldn't possibly fuck it up. By that I mean theres still precisely zero evidence implicating the podestas until its confirmed that they knew Freud or were in portugal. The evidence on that page is weak as fuck including the email wipe ,,,.D, &gt;&gt;79487289..

             See, honestly I feel like you except for let me just take everybody down a rabbit hole for a second if you will. Freud was a well known British cook, Podesta is into spirit cooking, and the parents stated they were with some friends for dinner as well as they ate at Freud's house. See where I'm going with this? I honestly believe that the small details as to what happened to that poor baby is all laid out right in front of us. They done a spirit cooking of their own daughter and had Podesta and Freud right in there with them.

              Oh God No.  I cannot think about it.  I want them caught. Someone posted on here that the flight records of lobbyists are not recorded for some reason.  They are both lobbyists.  J  Podesta supposedly has not been heard from since Nov. 7th.  Where is Tony?  Do they have both of them already?  What a Christmas present their arrest would be.

            If the efits were intentionally created to point to the Podestas, then the
            <em>
             other

            option would be that it was a planned psyop.

            My view from the beginning was that the efits were such a perfect match for the Podesta brothers that they looked as if they had been drawn from photographs not witness recollection. I'm baffled as to the motive, however, particularly when everything would suggest that John Podesta, at least, enjoys getting his hands dirty (i.e., he doesn't seem to leave the nasty stuff to others), and therefore may actually have been involved in Portugal. And there is the additional fact that John Podesta appears in a photograph with a girl who, in my opinion, probably does look like Madeleine McCann would look now. Why would they do this deliberately, when it's only by accident (the attention Wikileaks drew to John Podesta) that most of us have even heard of him?

              Podesta leaks weren't accidently given to wikileaks. Podesta leaks were an inside job,  wikileaks said it was not Russians (by replying to a comment saying something like it's not nice to credit the wrong people). Separately, Wikileaks referred to the Dems ship is going down bc it has a
              <strong>
               leak
              </strong>
              like the titanic. Or something about Dems, titanic, leaks.

              We don't know. It's pure speculation. The DNC leaks I think are likely to have come from Seth Rich - but this, too, is speculation.

             It could also be an eKit for someone who both knows the podestas and knows they did it, but is not prepared to provide testimony (which would put them in mortal danger). So as a substitute for assisting in the prosecution process they have provided the identity, the cops have then made the ekit from photos.
Although what Legionwill has not seemed to account for in this 'parallel construction' is the news that both US and UK intelligence separately know they stayed at Clem's house 1 kilometer from the abduction site.
I also wonder whether the truth behind madeleine's parents being under suspicion for a while: perhaps they 'loaned' her to the podesta's, expecting to receive her back, but the podestas got carried away and they never saw her again - that when the parents broke rank and went to the media, hoping others would connect the dots for them.   If madeleine's parents are fully innocent then i am totally sorry and mortified that we have to entertain these kinds of things

              Don't apologize. The vast majority of people familiar with this case agree that they were involved. We only disagree on minor details. The Portugese detective in the case, Goncarlo Amaral, was convinced and any Portugese will tell you that entire town is on his side. He lost his job because of it and then was harassed, followed, threatened, sued, you name it. He wrote a book about the case which is banned in the UK and more recently in Portugal. It may soon be for sale again in Portugal because the lawsuit the McCanns won against him was recently overturned and they have to pay him now. There is an english translation online, let me try and find it in case someone is interested. Meanwhile, here is a short vid that showcases the book.

             Would you like to give me a quick introduction of Portugal? I've seen it mentioned before, not sure how it fits into this.

              Are you telling me you don't already know that the Podesta brothers are the chief suspects in the 'abduction' of Madeleine McCann in Portugal in 2007? If you don't know you'll find a fair view videos on YouTube about this subject.

               On this board maybe, but not in the real world.   When the sketches were released the police said it was two sketches of the same person, a man between 20-40 years of age.

               I'm doing something not many people do which is to document the facts. I'm working on the wiki, not another video or blog one of countless. Not saying those are less significant, contrarily they are highly useful. However I only rolled into this this week so I am behind on most of it. I also think the attention will increase and increase and that relatively few people know or care or looked into it. That means there is a lot of room for additional confusion, disinformation, hours of lost research on already known topics, and play space for shills. I think at this moment it is imperative to organize, before it becomes Really viral (like the thing everyone talks about at home around the world).
              </p>
              <p>
               Many, many people are yet to take their first peak into the rabbit hole, and I'd rather they do so without having to waste hours of research without knowing what they've gotten themselves into. It would be better to have a public space with a well organized, multi demensional wiki that disseminates the many topics in this scandal. This is why I think it this is the right moment to try to learn the relevant facts and get them into central articles, where clueless people can learn Pizzagate without having to do additional research.
              </p>
              <p>
               It might sound like I'm overstimating this, but the thing is yet to blow up when very big media outlets are already turned against us. This is a war and we the feeble resistance must do what we can to get people on our side. Information is therefor what I think the main importance (aside from physical intervention which I cannot do living abroad).

               Be careful when pointing people to 'Youtube videos', there is a whole plethora of videos and some of them are batshit insane.

              <p>
               Send these people to a specific channel like 'Reality Calls' for example, she does pretty good videos where she provides all of her sources.

            I strongly believe that Snowden was a CIA plant to cripple the NSA. They talk about the NSA going out of their role of National Security and were investigating foreign leaders and even charities like UNICEF.

              Its interesting that it appears that on the day of Madelines disappearance. In 2007 that someone else was using Podestas e mails. Was this because they couldn't access the internet I note that at the present time most places down there, have public wifi if you have your own machine. But back in 2007 I would guess that getting on line in Portugal might have been difficult. Especially outside the main centres. But smart phones, and laptops, couldn't do the trick back then.?

                DO you know where the evidence is that he was in the same place at that time? I haven't seen that yet.

                I think Madeleine's parents are involved as well, and people in the UK establishment. Sir Clement Freud, convicted paedophile, has a villa about 10 mins away from where the McCanns were staying, he even invited them over after the disappearance and media were there and stuff. Also nearby Cliff Richard has a house, and he's been implicated in a UK establishment child abuse scandal, although he was cleared at some point, but his name was in a guest book at a house that was used for high profile paedophiles to abuse children in.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, Gerry McCann the father is a Freemason and has high up connections in his area apparently, and the Prime Minister at the time, sent Clarence Mitchell, the government's top PR person out to help the McCann's immediately, like on the day the story broke, which is a bit strange - they don't normally send that kind of person for cases like that, people at the time thought it was odd. The British government also got involved and interfered with the Portuguese investigation etc. So I wouldn't be surprised if they sold her or something and used all the publicity etc to get more money and to help cover it up.
               </p>
               <p>
                Or, if the McCann's didn't know, and it was the Podestas who did it, then people in the UK establishment were tasked with helping with the cover up - basically they're all part of the same evil, criminal organisation. I hope some solid links are found to people in the British government, because those people are just disgusting sociopaths, so vile every time I see them on tv I almost expect them to shed their skin or something.

               We need to find her.  Her name is Elizabeth Cooley Nelson.  I've researched her quite a bit but can't find her for the last few years.  It looks like she grew up in Florida.  Lived in Washington state.  Then she moved to Texas.  She sent John a letter that had her two kids dressed up for Halloween.  Looked pretty innocent to me though.  It looks like her sister in law was driving the car when she had a wreck that killed one of HRC's besties.  I haven't seen a trace of her in a couple of years but I might be missing something.

              There was a story floating around the first few days.  That the sketches were actually computer generated based on video evidence.  I never understood wtf that even meant and I never found a source for it.

              I fucking love you guys.

             I remember seeing them in the news back when they were originally released. Although I have to admit I was not paying too much attention at that time.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I am going to play devil's advocate here... I am not sure where the suspect photos came from. Were they released by a police agency? So why not send the appropriate agency photos of John and Tony along with a note saying -- "Found Them".  Sounds really stupid I know. Bt then again, wh would have ever believed half the shit that has happened this past year?
