<p>And this talking about Andrew K Dolan Class of \'67, where he majored in political science, same as Tony Podesta and Hastert: <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/promotions/chi-ugc-article-attorney-andrew-k-dolan-joins-uics-liberal-2015-12-15-story.html">http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/promotions/chi-ugc-article-attorney-andrew-k-dolan-joins-uics-liberal-2015-12-15-story.html</a></p>
<p>Dolan worked in Seattle as an attorney most of his career. This is an odd case where Dolan was representing the Boy Scouts in a matter of a child abuser that was masquerading as a scout leader after he had been suspended (may be irrelevant): <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Qa5vScH5fPEJ:https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/549139/richard-c-jonasson.pdf+&amp;cd=9&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca">https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Qa5vScH5fPEJ:https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/549139/richard-c-jonasson.pdf+&amp;cd=9&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca</a></p>

<p>A few oddities about Helen:  She wrote an article about male lactation and breastfeeding... &quot;Anthropologist Helen Marieskind, who studied a Zulu Chief in Africa who helped his many wives breastfeed his children, noted that three conditions need to be fulfilled for successful male lactation: the desire to breastfeed, the opportunity to breastfeed (to achieve nipple stimulation by putting a baby to the breast) and the high cultural status of breastfeeding.13 Although it can make the task easier, you certainly don’t have to be female. Nor does a female need to have just given birth: she can be a grandmother, or just a woman who desires to lactate and has the time and resources to apply herself to the task.14&quot;  <a href="http://biography-ebooks.com/_/_/628420/wheres-the-mother-stories-from-a-transgender-dad">http://biography-ebooks.com/<em>/</em>/628420/wheres-the-mother-stories-from-a-transgender-dad</a></p>
<p>Marieskind also has a program working with under-5 year old kids, with a grant from the Bill Gates Foundation: The pilot project aims to prepare Yakima\'s youngest and poorest children for kindergarten, readying them for the classroom and setting them up for academic success through elementary school and beyond. &quot;Everything we do is oriented to getting kids ready for school,&quot; says executive director Helen Marieskind. &quot;Personally, I\'d like to reach every child in east Yakima and their parents.&quot; (Yakima, Washington is a farming area with a lot of migrant fruit pickers and their families) <a href="https://www.pddnet.com/news/2009/06/ready-five-five-star-project">https://www.pddnet.com/news/2009/06/ready-five-five-star-project</a></p>',
