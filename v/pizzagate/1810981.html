             From my understanding, your direct image links start in "i." while regular links start in "www.".
            </p>
            <p>
             Also for whatever reason, one thing I noticed is that the file-size for the image you uploaded is larger. (155.4 kB vs. 107.6 kB)

            I never post in here, but calm yourself. He deleted his original account for a reason I can't remember why off the top of my head. And I don't feel like coming through his shit on mobile to figure it out. 
If you need to ping him see below.

            Last couple weeks there's been a drop in visitors at a time and excessive amount of Mods. I think because they have done stuff to the site so we are like auto censored by codes or whatever they probably have in place so they don't need to use as many resources to babysit us. Someone even mentioned they put an invite only for the sub...probably only shills are allowed in now and have multiple accounts to be assholes to us.

             You think mods are comprimised? I haven't been keeping up, but have heard rumors. Are you speculating or do you know for sure? Also what do you mean by an exessive amount of Mods?
            </p>
            <p>
             With way the rules are set up (mods must comment explaining their deletion), and with how we have moderation logs, you'd think it'd be pretty transparant no? Sub activity has certainly gone down, but it could be completely organic.

              the mods here have been working to control the pizzagate narrative (or destroy the integrity of the sub) here via selective censorship/promotion.... we need mod transparency.. we need to know who the mods are as users and contributors... this is an investigative sub... it needs complete transparency.

              the mods are pushing division and fear here... we all should really take over, for the sake of preserving the integrity of the sub.

              There was recently 15 to 17 mods which was athe least 3 times as many as other subs and they take the job of finding reasons to delete posts very serious around here....meanwhile there's still a bunch of crap and repeats taking up space.

             It's great to have alternatives, but hopefully we get to the bottom of this. Image hosts are dropping like flies, and It's a significant impediment to the research community. :(

                 At this point I'm really not sure what to do. :-(

                 If you manage to get something uploaded, Archive.is may serve as a dependable fail-safe. You can archive image links with it, but that's clunky as hell. Others will probably chime in with better ideas than that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do wonder if it's that these hosts are receiving calls/visits from law enforcement and are being told to shut up. OR, more sinisterly, if they're being physically threatened by someone that's got ties to Pizzagate like perhaps within the deep state/shadow government.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Eventually all the smaller hosts come down like like rocks. I'd STILL like to know what happened to Sli.mg. Those guys were a part of Voat history (the FPH migration) and they just disappeared.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I know tons of "E-celebs" have already received calls and been told to move on from Pizzagate.

                  And indeed, I fear they are being visited or threatened also. What happened to Sli.mg is anyone's guess. Alien abduction?  They did literally disappear off the face of the earth.
