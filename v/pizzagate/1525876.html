            I think this is all rubbish. He was a child at heart he endured loads of abuse and I think he truly wanted to be a kid because he never got to be it was beaten from him. I truly believe they murdered him in the media by saying this bs of him. They also said they found photos of cp then later it was discovered bullshit. MJ knew too much and leaked info he shouldn't have through his album art work cough cough but through other things as well but this is based off my own research so of course if you disagree you are entitled to that but I ask you to question all things spoon fed to you by what you believe to be called news.
