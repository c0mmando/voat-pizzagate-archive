Also, it has been found to repress paraxial mesodermal fate via fiberblast growth factor (acts like stemcells) . - -more or less they take people with papillorenal syndrom, they like invetro serogate mothers via craigslist, the kidneys develop until age 2 (PAX2 in concentration), The goal in may cases is to use this protien to stimulate the production of Fibroblast growth factors.

            Excuse me dood I am not a ctr nor a wasted hunter Thompson fan, handel is a snarky asshat radio doosh and has never been to VCU nor worked for VCU.
Your genetics fantasies run into the brick wall of the lack of any other known coloboma ( note spelling please ) sufferering disappeared children except McCann, who hasn't been definitively linked to pizzagate. As pointed out elsewhere, the late surfacing efits resembling podestas could be plants for blackmail or simply a "message." It does not prove anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            You really ought to drop the fantasy side of your activity here, because your efforts among to trolling, whether you intend this or not. Thanks!

            I do find it odd that podesta is interested in surrogacy and stem cells but this is so weird that it might be too much to handle at the moment.  But we do need to look into Qatar and London

VCU Qatar is real.

You are an idiot.
Please don't repost this again.
At least learn how to spell.

            But Antarctica?
At least a code word... 
dig up something more instead of reposting this though. 
By the way McCann is the only one mentioned in all this with coloboma so that angle may tickle you but could be a bit of a stretch

             You're an idiot for making an obvious troll statement like  'Clintons are bad'.  yeah, bad...  that's an understatement.

             I've noticed these people put their money in bio/chem, children funding   and tech research  (Caris studies at University of B.C.)
             <br/>
             They're all getting old and the quest for vain immortality runs deep in these  blood suckers.

             One of their goals is to completely change the structure of humanity through implementing  programs that introduce change and desensitization and acceptance or tolerance.

             Handel's  VCU  had a counterpart in  Canada,  McGill University and Caris department at  University of B.C.  (U.B.C)
I wonder if they moved it south because of exposure.

              It may not be as strange as it sounds. The Allen Memorial Institute there has a history of forced human experimentation and at one point, perhaps still, had a secret laboratory.
             </p>
             <p>
              McGill University began these experiments with the CIA, working on captive human subjects, and exposing them to “electro shock, sleep deprivation, memory implantation, memory erasure, sensory modification, psychoactive drug experiments, and many more cruel practices.”

              “The Nazis became employed CIA agents, engaging in clandestine work with the likes of George Bush, the CIA, Henry Kissinger, and the Masonic P2 lodge. This is but one of the results of Operation Paperclip. Another umbrella project that was spawned from Paperclip was MK-ULTRA. .”A secret laboratory was established and funded by CIA director, Allen Dulles in Montreal, Canada at McGill University in the Allen Memorial Institute headed by psychiatrist Dr. Ewen Cameron. For the next several years Dr. Ewen Cameron waged his private war in Canada. What is ironic about Dr. Cameron is that he served as a member of the Nuremberg tribunal who heard the cases against the Nazi doctors.

              “When it was at its height in drug experiments, operation MK-ULTRA was formed. This was the brainchild of Richard Helms who later came to be a CIA director. It was designed to defeat the “enemy” in its brain-washing techniques. MK-ULTRA had another arm involved in Chemical and Biological Warfare (CBW) known as MK-DELTA. The “doctors” who participated in these experiments used some of the same techniques as the Nazi “doctors”. Techniques used by Dr. Cameron and previous Nazi scientists include electro shock, sleep deprivation, memory implantation, memory erasure, sensory modification, psychoactive drug experiments, and many more cruel practices. continued on link.
