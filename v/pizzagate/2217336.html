<p><strong>Kind of makes you wonder</strong>, in this age of relatively open and accepting society, <em>why it took so long</em> for <strong>Kevin Spacey to actually come out?</strong></p>
<p>Could it be because his <strong>record of abuses is so extensive</strong>, his practices are so <strong>dirty and licentious</strong>, <strong>that it simply just can\'t be  exposed?</strong></p>
<p>Could it be that he is actually not to nice to his victims?</p>

<em>&quot;I know a guy who knew a guy who was a friend of a friend of a waiter at Applebees where Kevin came in &amp; ate one evening. He said Spacey was eyeing him from his table all evening. Anyway, this guy was taking a break, nursing his diet mountain dew, and turned his back for 1 minute. He woke up in the restroom, having blacked out, &amp; there was Kevin arms outstretched, blocking the stall\'s exit. &quot;I\'m gonna rape you!&quot; Spacey said menacingly. My friend screamed, &quot;RAAAAAAPE!&quot; and Kevin said, &quot;I slipped you a roofie! It\'s 2:00 AM!&quot; He then turned around, dropped his pants and said, <strong>&quot;Besides, in Spacey no one can hear you scream!&quot;</strong> It was terrifying to the poor guy.

<p><strong>Sleepers</strong>, starring <strong>Brad Renfro</strong>, filmed at <strong>Fairfield Hills State Hospital</strong>, about 4 young boys that suffered from sexual brutalization by prison guards, as seen above starting at 2:19 are the creepy tunnels that have since been destroyed. The hospital is right down the street from <strong>Sandy Hook and Newtown</strong> and is also one of the homes of the Mk-Ultra mind control program and the infamous \'Dr. Green\'. Unsubstantiated reports say that \'Creepy\' Gene Rosenburg may have worked there. J.D. Salinger wrote Catcher in the Rye in the area at the height of the MK-Ultra program.\'</p>

<p>In a 1997 lawsuit, several underage actors claimed <strong>Singer forced them to film a shower scene in the nude.</strong></p>

The kid ran out of the bathroom - without even washing his hands!! #2 looks at me and says "Kids have no sense of humor." I still hadn't peed, but decided to leave. (We're all making these stories up, right?)"

            The bulk of what Singer does for his clients—at various times with me he pegged the number at 70, 90, and 98 percent—he says no one ever knows. Most of them first encounter Singer under what Stone called “dubious circumstances.” They are in trouble—not existential trouble, maybe, but about to be embarrassed, or outed, or harassed, or exploited, or extorted. Through guile, bluster, finesse, intimidation, and money, Singer makes their problems disappear. He scares off or placates the reporters, the parasites, the crazies, the opportunists, the aggrieved. He keeps an unflattering documentary on Bruce Willis off the air, gets Arnold Schwarzenegger gun-toting bobblehead dolls pulled off the shelves, or, by settling a hit-and-run for her, lets Halle Berry go off to make (and win an Oscar for) Monster’s Ball.
           </p>
           <p>
            Around Hollywood, his letters to anyone about to report anything nasty about one of his clients are as familiar, and predictable, and apocalyptic, as the Haggadah of Passover, recounting the smiting of the ancient Egyptians. (This magazine has received its share of them over the years.) They repeat the guts of a proposed story—that a celebrity is linked to the Mafia, say, or approaching a nervous breakdown following a stint in rehab, or hitting on under-age girls (or boys), or neglecting animals, or abusing the help, or tossing chicken bones around a hotel room, or having sex in a stairwell during a Bar Mitzvah—then explain why such things couldn’t possibly be true, then list the plagues that will rain down on anyone daring to publish them. “Proceed at your peril” or “Govern yourself accordingly,” they inevitably conclude. They spook the uninitiated and the uninsured. They impress the press, which invariably calls Singer the “Legal Pit Bull” or “Stealth Rottweiler” or “Doberman” or simply, in a nod to his first two initials, “Mad Dog.” And, to those who get them most frequently, they amuse. “You’re jamming my shredder,” a tabloid editor once jokingly complained to him.

            is a fictional character,” she said. “You call Marty because you need someone like Mike Tyson in the Holyfield fight.” And with that she made the sound of chomping into something, like an ear, then spitting it out. “Marty is such a badass motherfucker,” she went on.

             “When people give me a hard time, I just c.c. Marty,

             At $950 an hour (likely to rise this year)—and ever on call, even while playing golf at the Brentwood Country Club (the place took a record two years to admit him) or on a cruise—Martin Dori Singer, 64 years old, born and raised in Brooklyn, is Hollywood’s concierge consigliere. He has remained so for 30 years or more.
            </p>
            <p>
             Geeky-looking and heavyset (a Marvin Hamlisch type) and utterly unaltered. Singer is a throwback: the scrappy, working-class, self-made son of European Jewish immigrants (his mother a survivor of Auschwitz), who studied nights at C.C.N.Y. and Brooklyn Law School.

            Being very used to lies from both the MSM but also the historical record (which is often their handiwork), I got to thinking about "the angel of death." That seemed a bit melodramatic, even for a man like Joseph Mengele. So I began to research him for a planned documentary. Surprise, it was all bullshit. None of the claims about him had any substance and there was plenty of evidence that he was a gentle and normal doctor of the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, whenever I read about the exploits of "Dr. Green," paperclip or his involvement in MKUltra, naturally I view it all with great skepticism. But I understand why my view may be rejected. He IS an integral component of the grand WWII legend and fraud.

            It was not that long ago that this A list actor who stars in movies and an almost television show and really should probably be just a G short of an EGOT but is missing two parts almost brought down a secret society all by himself. I'm not saying it would be a bad idea if he brought it down, but it shows that it depends on its members and their guests to follow the rules. If they don't disaster happens. At the annual meeting of this society, no cameras are allowed. Sure, some have been sneaked in, but there are no cameras or phones. If you bring one you are to put it in a locker and you can retrieve it when you leave. Well, our actor likes to record first sexual encounters with guys for later viewing material and he wasn't going to let anything stop him. The society stocks their event with barely legal gay men who make some very big money for some very closeted big money men. Our actor is closeted and he loved every second of his time there until someone discovered he was filming. The s**t hit the fan. The member who invited him got a three year suspension. Other members who also knew but didn't say anything got suspended. Our actor tried to apologize and did apologize - apparently sincerely which is why his member only got suspended for three years and not expelled. The actor had to turn over all the recordings. Some involve other members and those will probably be used to blackmail them. This is the craziest place and that incident just added to the craziness.

            "Anyway, we all ended up back at the Hilton Garden Inn where JoAnne was staying, drinking from a case of Michelob Light that Joan had brought in, when who showed up but "K.S." himself. He immediately made a fool of himself all over my friend, who was already feeling a bit woozy from three Mickey Lights and a shot of the butterscotch schnapps Dame Joan always kept in her purse. Well, "K.S." offered to walk my friend back to his room, and that was the last we saw of him that evening!
           </p>
           <p>
            Weeks later, I ran into my friend and he said he'd awoken with a stabbing pain in his rectum, as if he was being violated without lubricant. He attempted to scream, but realized there was a wet rag stuffed in his mouth. Groggily he rolled over on his side to find Dame Joan Plowright violently sodomizing him with a strap-on black dildo, grunting like a feral pig in heat!
           </p>
           <p>
            It was years after that when I ran into JoAnne at the bar at "21" and she confirmed the story... La Plowright's dressers were well aware of her penchant for wearing sex toys strapped under her stage costumes. JoAnne said "Plowright" was actually a playful nickname given to her by the late great Sir John Gielgud.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I guess this story doesn't have much to do with "K.S." after all. But I hear he can sure be mean!"

            Lol it is fucking hilarious how you're all super skeptical about the sky being blue or your mother being a grey alien but have no reservations about the "nazi death camps" where they defied physics to cremate millions of bodies in a couple years.  There's no excuse for being this dense.

               So is this the REAL donkeyhote? If so, why were you locked up? What did your sick ass do? Or, did your gender reassignment surgery not go as planned? 🤔
              </p>
              <p>
               What post did I gush about? I've never been secretive about who I am. If the CIA wants to know about me, they would have my info anyways. Are you trying to make people think I'm a guy? I have a couple of internet friends here that I've talked to on the phone that can vouch for me 🙄
              </p>
              <p>
               I see you are a coward with a brand new account. Anyone can make one. Are you DomKeyhote too? If this is the real donkeyhote, you can prove yourself by commenting in pizzagatewhatever with one of HIS profile names. If not, the STFU.

                 White brother? White people larping under the cover of "jews" are flooding white european countries and the U.S. with immigrants. Their main goal is to dilute and abolish the white race. They are not "jews" they are race traitors. Plain and simple. You are helping them by calling them jews because that makes the battle racial and religious which is a battle they will absolutely win. That is plain and simple too.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They do not consider themselves part of the rest of the white race because they believe themselves to be superior to all that are not in their club. That obviously includes white people that are not in their club.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You are helping them destroy the white race by giving them cover as jews. Congratulations, that makes you no better than them.

             My ancestors were caught up in the camps. My Great Uncle and his family and his family were worked to death in Auschwitz. I'm not saying I have evidence of Jews being gassed and whatnot, but I have found evidence of mass graves being photographed outside the camps, which at the very least worked Jews and the blacks and gypsies until exhaustion and kept them undernourished, which
             <em>
              at the very least

             caused them to be worked to death and/or starved and/or die from diseases much more easily. There is evidence of that much.

                That dude just agreed with ME NOT YOU LOL! If the allies cut supply lines that explains the starvation.  Doesn't explain why inmates marked for death preferred to flee the Soviets WITH THEIR GERMAN CAPTORS WHO INEXPLICABLY TOOK THEM ALONG WEST!

                 It was a neutral addition. Although when someone starts a sentence with "especially", it tends to follow along from a previous point made. My point was that
                 <strong>
                  at the very least
                 </strong>
                 , Nazis were mistreating Jews and forcing them to work under horrific conditions and allowing them to die from diseases, and he adds that they couldn't get supplies to reach them? Seems fairly neutral, and I'd love to see you rebut my claims, much less the entire Holocaust narrative of persecuting minorities with Mein Kampf taken into account.

                  Whether he realizes it or not it supports my point.  No "extermination camps" which is the central part of the only statistic EVERY SINGLE DIMWITTED CHILD MANAGES TO MEMORIZE BY AGE 9.  That alone is enough to debunk the toll lol.

                  Forced labor is exactly what Martin Luther recommended to do other the Jews.  Protestant work ethic? This is a theme of history.  Poster Nuremberg b.s. history is of course writtrn by the Victors

                   Do you ever wonder why no one likes you? I said it earlier - I don't know why I bothered. You're a lost cause. It takes a very special case of dipshit to get -72 CCP in less than a month. Enjoy being discredited forever by your lack of credibility.

                    Lol what are you a teenaged girl.  I didn't say Jews are exploitative and need to be taught the value of honest labor, Luther did.  Who gives a shit?o You gonna cry about it?  There were no death camps, the sign said ARBEIT MACHT FREI,  and you are a lesser man than many honest Jews who fight Jewish and Israeli tyranny.

                     Stop spamming accounts, you window-licking spastic. No one will ever listen to your fabrications or verbal diarrhea ever again - no one even reads past the name at this point. Give up. Your attempt to sully our reputation will never work because everyone knows what kind of a person you truly are and what kind of bollocks you bring to the subverse. Fuck. Off.

                         You made a claim, but it was not a fact. You will never be able to prove any kind of claim ever again. No one here cares what you have to say, and don't make the argument that all I'm doing is making an attack on your character - you ruined your own reputation! Go play around on Reddit where someone might be gullible enough to actually listen to you. Maybe AntiFa would accept a nutter such as yourself.

                          You obviously don't know the history of your own people's shoah: it's Eli Wiesel himself who (as a sick prisoner no less, why were there even hospitals at death camps lol) was evacuated with the Germans from invading Soviets, an action utterly incongruous with exterminating Jews.

            It was not that long ago that this A list actor who stars in movies and an almost television show and really should probably be just a G short of an EGOT but is missing two parts almost brought down a secret society all by himself. I'm not saying it would be a bad idea if he brought it down, but it shows that it depends on its members and their guests to follow the rules. If they don't disaster happens. At the annual meeting of this society, no cameras are allowed. Sure, some have been sneaked in, but there are no cameras or phones. If you bring one you are to put it in a locker and you can retrieve it when you leave. Well, our actor likes to record first sexual encounters with guys for later viewing material and he wasn't going to let anything stop him. The society stocks their event with barely legal gay men who make some very big money for some very closeted big money men. Our actor is closeted and he loved every second of his time there until someone discovered he was filming. The s**t hit the fan. The member who invited him got a three year suspension. Other members who also knew but didn't say anything got suspended. Our actor tried to apologize and did apologize - apparently sincerely which is why his member only got suspended for three years and not expelled. The actor had to turn over all the recordings. Some involve other members and those will probably be used to blackmail them. This is the craziest place and that incident just added to the craziness.
