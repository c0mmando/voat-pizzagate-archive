<h2><strong>==Q is AUTHENTIC and REAL - So many shills in here spewing nonsense, they\'re desparate==</strong></h2>
<p>Q has presented so much evidence as to having insider knowledge.
Why is Q authentic? Because Q proves ahead of time an event, headline or something posted by high standing people Q is working with. (POTUS.) Only a person with extensive inside knowledge can know these things head of time.
People who discredit Q have no proof and are vague. They often link to opinionated content lacking specifics and facts.
Look up Q\'s posts and look up the corresponding news for a given day of a prediction. See it for yourself.</p>
<p>One example of many:

<h2><strong>== We need Small Pizza Bites ==</strong></h2>
<p>We need the best things that prove all our points, small sizable bites at a time and make them the most visible part of the board for newcomers.
I know we have the big and comprehensive thread <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1497611">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1497611</a></p>
<p>But question yourselves (mods too) is it enough? Are the newcomers, who might be a bit clueless at first going to go through that big chunk of Mount Everest sized piece of information? I don\'t think so. We need appetizers too. (Almost wanna say small pizza bites lol)</p>
<p>I guess this is why it\'s so nice to link to NeonRevolt\'s blog (<a href="https://www.neonrevolt.com">https://www.neonrevolt.com</a>, props to you). He splits it up and has a neat format. Easily consumed information which goes around the main point over and over with different evidence. Details are awesome, but peaking the reader\'s quriousity is event better. It wakes the reader want to find more. To question the piece of information.

            you got your ASS handed to you in this thread. This is the best Q debunk thread ever. And from the looks of ground pounding you been taking from down votes on other threads since you pinned this and announced you and your Q buddies were taking over it looks like you pissed off a lot of people. Prolly those "brigaders" you trying to mine salt from.

            Q is a US intelligence Psyop. Don't believe anything said by Q or Q promoters. All shills.
Anyone pointing all the fingers at Hillary and none at Trump is a dead give away of a shill operation. Trump is dirty as fuck but according to Q, Trump is wrapped in a US flag taking down the deep state. If you believe all this craziness, you will be a million miles away from the truth. Trump is the deep state.

            where does a thread go when the sticky is removed? The only way I found it was because of a saved comment. It is not in the deleted submissions or in the main forum. Where does a thread go when the sticky is removed?

             Where did you look for it? HOT, Top, or New?  It was brigaded pretty badly, so the minute it was unstickied, it may have dropped a couple of pages back. I felt we needed to keep the Awan trafficking hospital thread from being slid from the front page, though. The shills have been at a fever pitch lately.

             , choose Options, put "pizzagate" in the subverse box and click the box for searching post body as well as title, then search for any keyword. You can also search by username.

             This whole thing sounds so sophomoric.  I have tried not getting into the Q thing, well, because I was hoping it would just die down, because people had their own sub.  I never go there because I am just way to busy over here on PG.  The threatening has to stop.  Also there seem to be more and more references to Q and more Q posts popping up.  I see nothing wrong in mentioning Q if it somehow pertains to the post.  Seems like some are so taken with Q that they get almost rabid when someone complains about a Q post.  The language also is completely out of line.  I think that really makes newbies have a very low opinion of our board and also of us.  Forcing Q upon us is  totally unfair when there is Awakening sub that took so many of our researchers.  Possibly that is the point of running more posts over here.  Taking more of us away.  Idk, just trying to make sense of this nonsense.  That makes sense.  Nonsense makes no sense.

              Exactly. And Vindicator wants to bring this clown car show into a child abuse research sub. I saw your post about him not being stupid enough to still believe in it and I agree with you. He has been around here too long to be that naive. So that begs the question....."why?"
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              He will probably come call me out and accuse me of oppressing his free speech, as he tries to oppress my free speech.

             <p>
              The comment section is a free speech zone but posting is not a free speech zone and that is why we have RULES. RULES keep people from posting schlock shit and is not designed to be a free speech zone unless

              Pulling a psyop into the house is not permitted by the rules. When he wants to oppress free speech he asks for "evidence" but when he pushes his agenda he rarely has any.

            Really, I'm getting disheartened again.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's been absolutely no progress. Our POTUS signs a denuclearization treaty with NK and gets zero respect. Then there's the former Walmart immigration centers where children are head being used to attack our POTUS when they've been in operation for years and have nothing to do with him since the dems refuse to sit down and change the damn laws. Now our POTUS is reported as saying he'll sign an amnesty bill?
           </p>
           <p>
            There've been zero arrests, there's been zero progress, zero swaying of public opinion, zero evidence to start the shift of the polarization that exists. There's also been zero evidence ... and I'll say that even though the IG report dropped. The IG report is again something that the dems can spin. It's not definitive in this minds -- it's definitive in ours. I read dem tweets all day yesterday about how it doesn't mean anything and why. And The Kenyan knowing about the private email server? That was something else that should be definitive, but somehow isn't. As is the money drop, etc. None of this matters to the ''blue wave''.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like I said, there's been no irrefutable proof. No solid punch to the veneer this scum hides behind. No outing of what The Kenyand, SKANKLES, and others have been involved with. Hell, there hasn't even been a PedoWood outing and look how the hell many pervs that involves!
           </p>
           <p>
            No video drop ... no promised alleged Kenyan real identity drop to prove that he is not who he pretends to be ... no Abedin drop ... no Awan progress ... no Lynch ... no DWS ... not even a Rosie O'Connell arrest for alleged illegal campaign contributions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just nothing.
           </p>

             Wow. I wasn't expecting that from you. You and I actually agree on something now. Q was the hopium used to try to control our narrative. I'm glad you're seeing through it now; maybe there's hope for others. Trump and Q both have said many, many things that our confirmation bias loves to hear. But when you go back and look at it objectively, you see a whole different side of things.

               Eh she basically said fuck Q, in a nutshell. That no high-level arrests have been made and that she's losing faith, that type of thing. I wonder why she deleted her comment.

                She didn't delete just the comment but her whole account. Personally hope she comes back since she's a pretty good writer that knows how to dig. Would be interesting to see what she does without being driven by faith in an anonymous "high-level" insider that wants you to trust and follow etc.

              Hey, I call 'em as I see them. No one will ever be able to accuse me of not speaking the truth as I see it.
             </p>
             <p>
              There has been zero proof that Q is real. Zero. Nothing he's ever hinted at has ever come to pass, and the wild goose chases never had a conclusion. Like Long Beach port and helicopter crashes ... then there was As the World Turns ... Wendy and The Kenyan ... The Kenyan not a Kenyan, but a Muslim white guy ... The muslim white guy holding and firing a gun ... Raw vid 5:5 ... Roy Moore having to lose to prove election rigging ... oh, and the white rabbit ... that was what again?
             </p>
             <p>
              All nice diversions that had us all digging and for what again? The strongest evidence, and something that's not letting me cut the cord, is our POTUS drawing a Q in the air -- not once, but on two separate occasions.
             </p>
             <p>
              So there's been absolute no proof of anything, general melee and chaos receiving reports that end up being redacted, no action taken when authorities willfully withhold those documents,or are proven to have lied. Oh, and now we have amnesty ... the one thing that the people voting for Trump didn't want. But Q touts the elite are on the run and panicking? Really? Even Weinstein's out of jail! And now a ''rumor'' that Bryan Singer is singing like a canary ... remember that ''rumor'' about Allison Mack? Mack I could see doing it -- which she didn't -- but Singer has what reason to turn on his buddies that have allegedly protected him over the years? Oh, that's right. He has ZERO reason which means it's DISINFORMATION.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Assange's definition of disinformation: A story that answers a question that was never asked.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Did anyone ask if Singer was singing? No, we were asking why the hell he isn't in jail!
             </p>
             <p>
              But we know the answer to that. NOBODY'S going to jail. Everything is safely protected ... securing the bag ... and we've made ZERO progress in unsecuring the bag. So, yes, we did elect a president who has taken action. I'm not getting on him ... yet. He has put things in place ... and signed legislation .. and been working amazingly hard, but there is no proof. When there is proof, I'll will be the first one to say there is and laud whoever drops it.

                 That was a headline in a forum post about the latest Q drop and not verbatim "Q Intel", that is what the Q followers extrapolated it into. Q also blurbed about the Clintons and something about kids from the IG report. None of us knew that, Nostradamus strikes again :)

                   Astute analysis. Your term "MQ Ultra" has bounced around in my mind since you said it. This Q thing seems to have been well planned with the intentions of building a cult from the beginning. Some of the people we encounter are genuine believers and many are operatives working for the scammers and are pretending to be believers. A lot of the true believers resort to the only defense they have which is insult, ridicule, and immediately branding all non believers as shills and alts because it is all they have. Cults use the same methods, ostracize and ridicule all non believers. Did you notice that the body of the OP in this thread has been revised, and a "proof of Q" added? I looked at the "proof" and it made me feel very sad inside for the people who are under this spell.

             migratorypatterns it is not often that we agree but that post is great and it demonstrates why the the truth movement MUST migrate back to where it was before Trump was elected. The truth movement was firmly aligned against both political parties and it has to be that way for us to ever get any success. Q is like MQ Ultra and it operates like a sort of Scientology cult. Its all faith based like a church. Until the truth movement reunites against both political parties and takes it actions against both parties we will stay locked in a ping pong game of left versus right and the people who believe Q is connected to some sort of white hat group are lost in "faith" spinning their wheels. The truth movement has to direct their energy at both parties and MAKE DEMANDS.

            "Pizza streamer live" posted this thread and Vindicator stickied it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What are you streaming under other names Pizza Streamer Live? Patriot Soap Box type Q info? Selling merchandise? Taking donations? Your name says it all. Are you Farmer Funk, Pamphlet, Pam, or Baruch The Scribe?
           </p>
           <p>
            THEY REASON THEY PRETEND NOT TO LIKE PEOPLE MAKING MONEY ON THIS IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CONTROL THE TRAFFIC AND MAKE PEOPLE LEARY OF SITES THEY DO NOT CONTROL
           </p>
           <p>
            People pretending to be Q were outed long ago. They make a lot of money from this scam and are scamming a lot of innocent patriots out of their money. With this information readily available you have to wonder why Vindicator continues to promote this scam.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fakers pretending to be Q are scrambling to get "proofs" circulating because they are desperate to keep the money coming in so they don't have to get a real job. The "proofs" these people produce are cartoon quality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vindicator there are enough proofs that Q is fake for a rule guy that if you keep pushing this fraud we can then focus on you and wonder why you keep pushing it because there is something really strange about a person who is such a stickler for rules that would push this narrative. What is the reason Vindicator pushes this scam? How come a person that is supposed to enforce strict rules is so willing to promote this?
           </p>
           <p>
            What is the motivation? Strange? "There are no coincidences" according to "Q"
           </p>
           <p>
            We don't like it when innocent patriots get scammed. We don't believe Vindicator is dumb enough to believe Q is real.

            For a logical and rational mind this video can blow enough holes in Q that it won't float in an inch of water, when compared to the "Proofs of Q." And isn't odd that people have to scramble so desperately to make Q "legit"?

             But do we believe these people when they say they were in on the scam? Or, rather, do we believe the picture that is being painted that Q is the work of some private individuals, somehow connected through 4chan and the like?
            </p>
            <p>
             When Defango says he wrote half the original questions, we may have good reason to disbelieve him but, by the same token, should we believe what these other 'former insiders' are coming out with? The reason why I favour seeing Q as the work of the alphabet agencies is that it just got such a massive push - it was suddenly everywhere. Was the Youtube algorithm backing the phenomenon 'blindly' or was Youtube pushing it 'consciously'? The whole thing seemed/seems very organised across multiple platforms (including this one.)  Surely you would need a big organisation to pull all that off? And how do we explain the fervent Trump support? - after all, if it was a bunch of private individuals wouldn't they be expected to have different views? It seemed/seems like a party line being followed. Then there's the link to Cicada 3301 (as Defango originally claimed, and seeming to be somewhat verified.) Surely CIcada is some kind of intelligence front - and not some private association of fun-loving puzzle-solvers? Plus the CBTS people were promoting Luciferian propaganda films like 'I Pet Goat II' - they seem to be occultists (just like Defango) and this again leads us back to the intelligence agencies. It's a different question: not 'is it a scam?' but 'what kind of scam is it?' and, while we can spend too long on the Q-rabbithole, I think it's worth asking.

              Interesting observation. Did you watch the video I posted of how their marketing is set up? The guy that made this video said he found some occult looking stuff attached to the marketing arm of this fraud. I know that the mod Vindicator is a Zionist gatekeeper because he and I have been round and round about Zionism and he is a supporter of Israel and defends Zionism, and has to me in several debates over the last few months.

               I haven't  seen that - I will take a look. Yes, occultism and Zionism - these seem to be two of the major ingredients in the psyop. And, of course, they were also major ingredients in 9/11.

            The phrase 'proofs of Q' is deliberately vague and disingenuous. Proofs of Q as what? Proofs of Q's existence? Proofs of Q being somehow aligned to Trump? Proofs that Q is a team of people using different writers at different times? Proofs that Q has made numerous inaccurate predictions since first appearing? Proofs that Q is one more massively-pushed and strenuously-protected product of the alphabet agencies?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want proof that Q is a Deep State project, look no further than this forum and the special treatment Q always receives. Those supporting the Q-team always treat the material reverently, in an entirely uncritical, cult-like manner. They don't acknowledge (or seriously downplay) inaccurate predictions, narrative inconsistencies, and the financial exploitation linked to the project. This is not how ordinary citizens behave. This is how agents behave.

             That is one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole mess. Total dismissal of all the things gotten wrong, or that don't happen. Out of a thousand vague inferences this makes up the bulk of "Q intel drops." None of that seems to register or matter to the Q followers. It operates just like a cult, no doubt about it.

            You just branded and told the LARGE number of people that don't want to turn pizzagate into a game of riddles that they are "brigaders" and have dismissed them. All that large group that disagree with you are only "brigaders" and obviously idiots huh?

            He communicated with me while I was trying to help get rid of Falcon and get you installed as the new lead mod. I supported you, and he supported me. Might be the oldest Voat account I ever saw. Yes I was behind you all the way as new lead mod and you know it.

            I don't know who that old Voat account was, but he was right. Read what you wrote. You just told a HUGE portion of our readers to go fuck themselves. Welcome to the throne, New Dictator. You wrote that shit yourself. Its your words.

             Vinicator is worse than MF. Vindicator has always been the problem here. MF was clumsy and obvious, and likely still here as another mod name.

            My thread designed to be a mega thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            Contains a sizable chunk of the pizzagate armory arranged by topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point: Regardless of whether one believes in Q or not, gathering all our threads/leads and organizing them for further use in red pilling people is something we REALLY need to do. Our Executive Summary Of Evidence thread is VERY behind and out of date.
           </p>
           <p>
            We as truthers and patriots of all nations need to stand united against our common enemy. It is the natural duty of a species and a society to protect our young against the evils that stand against them. If we cannot unite for something this important against an evil so invasive, then humanity truly does deserve extinction.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is time for all of us to stand united under a single banner of truth, justice, and valor.

             U mention banner of truth...
But no one here is willing to address truth about the legal matrix..which is the only way u will end this debt game..
All it takes is half an hour to learn the basics of the legal matrix...which will give the solutiin of turning the US corporatiin into to ur debtor ..both individually and collectively..so as to be in a position to instruct it to investigate..amongst other powerful rights u will have as surety over the US corporation
yet people ignore this and spend hours and hours researching ..qanon..whether trump is rothschild driven or not..waiting for their messiah..meanwhile kids are still being procured ..and raped and killed by the elite classes who live off the debt game u fund with ur labour credits loaned to their banking system..
..the game is so simple ..the elite are actually afraid u will catch on to it..they invest and sponsor distractions..
..to weave their magic...at the same time they give out clues to the game ..and what they r about..with confidence the public hypnotised with their mouths wide open and eyes wide shut..wont pick it up..
...
The game run by CRS consumer re creation service

            </p>
            <p>
             The solution to the game is hidden in plane sight in thw movie wizard of oz..
..its so blatant only those who have taken sometime understanding the commercial legal matrix can pick it up..
Voat has turned into a cinsumer recreatiin service..
Maybe that was the plan from the beginning ..a pyramid within a pyramid ..is two pyramids..the symbol of voat has two pyramids..
The pyramid within a pyramid..denotes fractal science..how they use fractal projection within projection ..dream state within dream state to mkultra the public to stay inside the game..

             Its subconsscious security or surety to keep their dream world of debt running with our consent and minds..
Voat uses the same methodology..through its varied and layered distractiins away from the
Real sollution..which only takes a dollar a month to activate..
Anyway a negative vote will prove

I believe the movies and especially trailers are tapping into the future timeline..via the creatives...
It as if the trailers are trailing the future that has already happened based on us waking up...we are moving into a different timeline..
By our own collective thoughts we already write our existence into the collective future ...and a metaphor of it ...the signals ..gets picked up by the creatives..or anyone who r

               Whybdo u think 3 downvoated this comment...something in my comment on the game has pissed them off..
Got under their skin..
..do u not think this forum is being set up by the pedoempire freaks themselves...
They know the apocalypse is round the corner...
They can sense that the rules of the game they were hiding has been hacked ...
Are u aware that there is a group called the redemption group that has been trying to hack the legal code since the 80s..
..one knows alex jones is a shill..because he completely avoids even the basics like legal defintion of the person..and how it is separate to the flesh and blood man..its a legal trust...
The pedoempire freaks have been moving parallel to this trying to scupper the hacking of their commercial code..and im sure there are some here..who makensure its not touched...if it is then thats their endgame ..
They need our consent to lend our names to their debt game to have a legal hold where they can legally place a charge on the name ..

                Because you don't belong to their church of the savior Q and its that simple. They will down vote any comment no matter how reasonable it is if you don't belong to their Q Church.

               How many mods are there for this forum..
If this is run like a parliament there should be more mods or at leastt sub mods..
How does one set up a separate sub forum..to keep track of connecticut avenue..
..the legal solution is so simple ...but powerrful...it has to be diwcussed as well...it will literally turn the US war corporation into our debtors..literally our instructions can shut down and occupy connecticut avenue..by instructing the military..
The president is a debtor dummy corporation..but taking instructions from the creditors..at the moment it is the. Bankers...hence the chaos.but when we reduce debt ..by law we become the creditors..
We can turn this war corporation and aim the guns at the banker pedofreaks...
It takes sometimw to understand the legal game of war that haa been aet up by the merchant bankers..but the implementation is sime....instead of relying on banks to surrender ur money and assets to..to get them to pay ur bills..we use our money to reruce debt at the US treasury..ive already emailed them ..
The aim is to leave the debt payment system..and thus turn Rome into our debtors forever ..that is rhe agreement of the birth certificate..its an obligation of Rome to us ..to take care of us..but unfortunatley they trick us to lending this obligation into a collective war game ...set up in 1452 by the fugger and venerian merchant family who had taken control of Rome..
We are not meant to save this world ..we are meant to leave it..

               This forum was not set up to be a free speech forum...it was set up to investigate pizzagate..
..which is centred in the machinations and logistic hub of connecticut avenue..
              </p>
              <p>
               When did james alefantis and the establishment find the need to have him on mainstream media..when the focus was on connecticut avenue..
...the reason u dont see him on media after that is becaause the focus was directed away from that logistics hub..
..
If this forum is called pizzagate ..the mods should make sure the majority of the topics is about connecticut avenue and legal solutions geared towards getting the authorities to inveetigate and imprison this pedoring..
The rest of the forum should be allowed to rate how the connections like qanon..or tucson..that come up every now and then ...and then moved to a separate sub forum..
              </p>
              <p>
               All roads to connecticut avenue but this forum mods...dont take up the cue.....just bend over and take it up for Q

                One of our mods has a forum especially for Q called
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/greatawakening">
                 v/greatawakening
                </a>
                but but thats not good enough for the lead mod here at
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                 v/pizzagate
                </a>
                and he would turn this sub into a 24 hour Trump/Q newswire if he could get away with it. He won't go play in the Q sub for some reason, no, he wants to turn this sub into a pizzagate/Trump/Q hybrid of some sort.

                  Anybody can set up any forum they want as long as it is not illegal and does not break any laws. So the people that believe in their savior Q can set up as many forums as their heart desires. A poster in this thread described Q followers as a "faith based belief" and that is exactly all it is. They have "faith" and faith is not research and this is a research sub.

                  The mods appointing process is kind of topsy turvy. Whoever is the lead mod appoints junior mods to help. If the lead mod over steps their mandate and starts ignoring the rules it is almost an act of God to get them demodded but it happens because it just happened here a few months ago. When the lead mod gets demodded one of the junior mods takes over. All the mods are in the right sidebar of the forum page. The "O" are called Owners and are ultimately in control but don't take an active role unless they are actually hiding under a Mod name. You will also see "M" for Mod and "J" for Janitor.

             I agree. I like the idea of showing the proof as hits for specific topics like countries, pedophilia cases covered up, etc..

              Even if no one here believes there is a "Q", this is still a great idea. I feel like a lot of important research gets buried within the noise and comment sliding. I won't embarrass anyones intelligence by naming names.

             Channel 10 is a dining room. There is a black child (likely male) on the center table being eaten. My theory is that this child is Haitian.

              I don't think so and they have started deleting some of their greatest blunders. They are editing and manipulating things said in the past to cover up inaccurate it all is. Hell me and you could watch the news, make a thousand vague implications, and then let peoplel's imaginations fill in the blanks. Its lunacy.

              If you want some tangible intel on how deep the marketing and merchandising fraud is with the people pretending to be Q you can watch this. This is a little tedious but it is an exercise that anybody can repeat if they take the time. Its all laid out in a trail you can follow. Bit coin address, billboards, merchandise sites.

              There is no such thing as proof because my opinion is that it is a total scam. I spent the last two decades of my life helping build the truth movement and it has come a longgggg way. In the last year the partisan politics from Trump fans and the Q movement have done more damage in a short amount of time than any other time I can remember.

              Its like watching people tear down a nice house that I helped build and shit on the remains. It is very disheartening and frustrating. I used to spend all my time spreading information now I spend my time combating disinformation. I don't like doing it, its miserable work, but it equally important as spreading the truth, and maybe more important. It makes me grumpy and unhappy and its no fun.

                 I don't see any point in arguing about your position, since it can't be disproven by any amount of evidence. No matter what happens to Beck, no matter if he gets fired, starts his own network, gets into financial trouble because his network has low ratings ... no matter what, it's all some sort of cunning plan of the Jews. Likewise with Trump. No matter how much evidence anyone offers that his getting elected was not planned by anyone, you're sure it was planned by the Rothschilds because everything is planned by the Rothschilds.

                  The erroneous notion that those "sealed indictments" pertain to elite Washington D.C. criminals or are in any way tied to what the Q people think they are tied to is exactly that, an erroneous notion. Many different types of documents are sealed. Warrants, cases involving minors regardless of what they are about, and other things can be sealed. People have jumped the gun, due to wishful thinking, and have convinced themselves that they know what is sealed. Nobody knows and it won't be a huge sweep of famous Washington D.C. power players and right now that is only a fantasy living in a lot of people's imaginations.

                  Ahem, not to be rude, but you are also describing "confirmation bias" which is how the majority of the answers to Q riddles are arrived at. Throw a bunch of wild possibilities in a hat, pick the one that fulfills peoples desires, and presto it becomes the new answer. Do you really think a high level intel asset for the U.S. government would grovel around begging to be validated like this? After Tracy Beanz, Pamphlet, Baruch, and the others got outed by insiders a ton of people jumped from the Q bandwagon. They need new followers desperately. Those of you that stayed onboard are being recruited to go find new members.

                The truth community was united against the common enemy for a long time. That common enemy was both political parties. There is really only one political party pretending to be two. They use the Hegelian Dialectic to confuse us with the illusion of choice. They don't care which side of the road we travel on as long as we stay in the road. When we say "neither" it wrecks their whole game. When nothing of significant value has happened for the common American peoples standard of living after Trump is gone will finally understand that.

               <p>
                I'm not sure I really understand that question but Q has set up a ruse in which Q cannot be wrong. Everything Q gets wrong or does not happen is just intentional disinformation to confuse the white hats. Anything Q stumbles into with the hundreds of vague implications makes Q Nostradamus. Using this scam it appears as if Q is never wrong. Its a perfect scam. I can name three almost exactly like it that Q is modeled after.

                Nesara, Omega, and the Iraqi Dinar scam. All were dropping "high level intel" and promising that "its happening"....any day now, any day now....its happening. Q scam is pretty much identical.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Most of the things Q gets "right" is simply confirmation bias filling in a desired answer. 90% of the truth movement is watching this with a mixture of bewilderment and irritation. The broader truth community turned its back on this scam long ago but a lot of Qbytes have not lifted their heads from the bubble to notice.

                 More generalizations and high level assumptions... not a singular link or specific/concrete example... just as I assumed. Throwing around random percentages like "90% of the truth movement" really does you no favors. Care to qualify anything? Because I'm sitting on a pile of some extremely specific proofs - these included images, predictions, timestamps and news articles that ARE specific. Being that we're in "The Great Awakening", the burden of proof is on your shoulders to DISPROVE. Not to add conjecture.

              What you don't know, PizzaStreamer, is that Esoteric is virulently allergic to Q and wants more than anything on earth for all discussion of Q -- ESPECIALLY PROOFS -- to be bullied out of existence. You got 8 downvotes within an hour of posting this. Be encouraged. :-)  There is a small team that brigades all Q threads in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              , because we have such a large readership. It's the same usernames that always show up and spew vitriol in every Q thread here.

               You just branded and told the LARGE number of people that don't want to turn pizzagate into a game of riddles that they are "brigaders" and have dismissed them. All that large group that disagree with you are only "brigaders" and obviously idiots huh?

                Gosh Esoteric, now you're overdoing it, really. Why can't you just accept that a part of the community is interested in 'Q'.?
               </p>
               <p>
                Is the Q story a psyop? Yes, imo it definitely is.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do I sometimes roll my eyes because people believe in what 'Q' says? Yes, I do. Permanently, in fact.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do I understand why people trust 'Q'? No, I don't. I don't understand it at all.
               </p>
               <h1>
               </h1>
               <p>
                But as a mod I see that parts of the community here are interested in Q. And Vindicator happens to be one of them. So we have one 'M' mod who is non-partisan and thinks Q is a psy-op, and one 'M' mod who thinks Q is telling the truth, and supports Trump. So what?
               </p>
               <p>
                That's actually great, because it mirrors the community. The majority of the community here is pro-Trump, in case you've missed it.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I don't want to expell those who are into Q. As a mod I feel people from as many backgrounds as possible should feel comfortable here.
               </p>
               <p>
                So if you don't like Q - ok, great. Leave comments, downvoat Q threads, or just ignore them. I usually ignore them.
               </p>

                a 'dictator' is just pathetic. It really is. We often discuss via PM how we can manage to let posts stay up, and how we can help OPs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember that I proposed to introduce the 24 hours thread? Shortly before MF got demodded? Actually I proposed to introduce a period of grace of 30 minutes. (LOL) It was

                </a>
                who said we should try a 24 hours period of grace. That's hardly a thing a 'dictator' would do, would he?
               </p>

                unnerve me. Because I see how much time he invests here, and how much he tries to help people. I gladly accept his passion for Q in exchange.

                Maybe you haven't noticed, but you are slowly turning from a sharp guy who contributed to the community discussion in a normal manner into a grumpy old guy who spends his time harrassing all people on the internet who don't happen to share his political views. That's actually very sad.
               </p>
               <p>
                Spend some time with your fisherboat over the weekend, clear your head, and come back on Monday, with a more peaceful attitude. We need critical voices, but we don't need harrassers.

                 It’s supposed to be Free Speech here. We shouldn’t have to stay quiet about something  we believe in because someone disagrees or because it might offend someone. If people don’t like that topic, then don’t read those threads. You’ve never lectured me or tried to make me change my mind. I appreciate that,

                  Pizzagate is already confusing. Give me a good reason to make it more confusing by turning Pizzagate into a never ending game of confusing Q riddles.

                  So when did we have the last Q sticky before the current one?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Four weeks ago? Six weeks ago? Or maybe eight?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And we have only a couple of Q posts per week here on
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                   v/pizzagate
                  </a>
                  .  I don't have the time right now to go through the submissions, but I guess not more than half a dozen posts that mention Q in the headline.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And you get rage fits because of that?! Really?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What about some tolerance for people who have different opinions?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Do you reallly expect that you can push everyone to share your stance?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At the beginning, I was really glad that I saw that someone - you - shared my non-partisan view.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now I'm horrified when I read some of your comments. You are terrorizing people, calling
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Vindicator">
                   @Vindicator
                  </a>
                  a 'dictator'.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You posted three submissions where you knew that they don't belong in this sub and even stated in your OP that 'the mods will pull it' - a total waste of our time - but then you complain that people post Q submissions that don't make sense? Really?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What the fuck happened with your mind?!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Calm down,
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/ESOTERICshade">
                   @ESOTERICshade
                  </a>
                  . I really meant it when I said take a break, go fishing, enjoy real life, and then calm back with a peaceful mind.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Most people who are doing Q posts have left, and post to
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/GreatAwakening">
                   v/GreatAwakening
                  </a>
                  now. I'm not bothered by a few Q posts a week. If you can't even tolerate that much, I feel really sorry for you.

                    In fact, you are terrifying newbies and keep people from posting here (I don't mean Q posts, but people who'd like to post other PG stuff.)

                     You have mistaken me for a person that is not calm. Its common sense not to mix something that attempts to do research on a narrow topic, child abuse, with something that throws darts in every possible direction and at thousands of topics, very seldom has answsers, and most of which the "answers" are only wild guesses. I call that common sense. You mix Q into this, and in a few months, this sub will be a dim memory of itself. When it happens you guys can thank yourselves for it.

As I explained in my series of posts last fall, it started as a cover-up of the 2013 Glenn Beck whistleblower episode. When I exposed the cover-up, "Tory Smith" launched the Q psyop

                           In my Q assessment six months ago, I challenged him/it by asking, "How will you dismount this tiger you are riding?" This, such as it is, is the plan he came up with. Writing as ESOTERICshade, he rants furiously that Q is an obvious psyop and that the people taken in by it are idiots. Writing as think-, he soothes everyone with an open-minded calm. But it's all a meaningless puppet show, much like all his previous puppet shows.

                          <p>
                           Now, to be clear: This elaborate drama is not meant to save the Bush-Clinton crime syndicate. There are 35,000 sealed indictments, Sessions is hiring hundreds of additional prosecutors. That ship has sailed. This ridiculous six-month LARP was not even meant to save "Tory Smith" and his helper Alexandra Meadors of the CIA front Galactic Connections from being prosecuted. (After all, while "Tory Smith" is a fake name, Alexandra Meadors used her real name in promoting him. So arrogant! But clearly that ship has sailed as well.)
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           In my judgment, the disinfo campaign fell victim to serious diminishing returns the moment that (a) I outed "Tory Smith" and Alexandra Meadors, and (b) the sealed indictments started piling up. If it won't stop Sessions and the DOJ, and it won't save anyone from prison, why keep doing it? I think the point is simply this: "Smith" &amp; Meadors need to spread sufficient confusion, and keep the uproar going for long enough, that when the arrests start, they aren't among the first. They're relatively small fish, who carried out a poorly conceived disinfo plan like they were ordered to. They (and David Brock) desperately want to avoid being blamed for the syndicate going down. Because while they will presumably at some point go to prison for being part of a child sex trafficking ring (or flee, or plea bargain) the syndicate would kill them in a big hurry if their blunders brought added public attention.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I realize it's kind of arrogant of me to take credit for triggering the whole Q phenomenon, but if you reread my series and look at the dates, you'll see that I thoroughly exposed HighLevelInsider/Senate Anon/"Tory Smith", and you'll see that he disappeared the same day that Q appeared. Where did he go? What has he been spending his time on? And again, to be clear: The reason that I have been so quiet over the intervening months is that I don't think bringing these two degenerates down is the most important task now. Sure, it would feed my ego to go on 4chan and 8chan and reddit, and tear his stupid charade apart -- and you know I could have done it, you sorry weasel -- but frankly, launching the Q psyop was like a white flag. It was them admitting that the jig was up, that the only goal left was not getting suicided by the Clintons.

The spirit of this board has completely changed. Most people now appreciate the ruleset instead of just being frustrated at it's difficulties. She is also a great researcher.

                             Again, this cover-up is a large, well-funded joint operation with numerous websites of its own, as well as numerous YouTube channels. The part that I exposed has been operating since 2013, and there are elements of it that date back decades. The people that I identified do this full-time, and they have the very well-founded fear that if they don't succeed in smothering my voice, if my claims go viral, they will be killed. They are very highly motivated. The advantages of being made a mod are worth the effort of actually doing the mod job well. (Plus if you're going to monitor Voat 24/7, the incremental effort of providing mod services is pretty small.)

                             I won't keep on about this. I'll just leave you with this thought: Don't think of these people as mustache-twirling cartoon villains. Don't think of them as psycho cases, or even as criminals. Imagine some perfectly ordinary college graduate who has no social life and spends all his time on the Internet. Imagine that the one thing that matters in this man's life is to fool people, to keep a complicated LARP going no matter what. Now imagine that I posted his picture and made a long list of the lies he had told.

                             I agree and have said so many times, but nice try at pitting me at think- against one another. I also pushed for Think- to become a mod and so far I don't regret it because think- is a better mod than you are.

                             You started this by calling me out by name because I said I didn't think a high level intel asset would be begging for validation. You called me out by name and started saying that I was allergic to Q and all your other BS. I don't like your "i will do as I please" attitude and I made it known.

                             You had the gall to say that "We have validated Q many times, psyop or not." So in your mind even its a psyop, simply because you like Trump and believe he is saving the world, its ok to drag a psyop into the forum. Don't say you didn't say it because you did and I can dig it up.

                             You don't drag a psyop into this forum just because YOU think Trump is great. Have you understood some of the things you say lately and do you understand that you are not only exceeding your mandate but saying stuff that sounds crazy like that? You need to check yourself because you are swirling off the path.

                            This is coming from the same person that says Tory Smith (who died) was working with others in a big conspiracy against voat. I’m case you forgot,

                            You are the dumbest troll I have ever encountered. Every time you come here you pick out known people and accuse them of being the same people. Your hero is Glenn Beck. You are either insane or a troll.

                             This guy's theories are always weak, weak as in not much or nothing in the way of support or of no consequence even if true. (Personally I doubt your an alt acct kind of guy tho or a shill). Also, Glenn Beck played an important role in the establishment of O.U.R. btw. Something to think about, or not.

                             Nah. As I explained, we're just climbing different mountains at this point. I don't think what you are doing as Q, or with any of your other sockpuppets, really matters. I don't think Alexandra Meadors and her CIA front matters either. I was actually working on a lengthy history of the Bush-Clinton syndicate and its 50 year relationship with the CIA. Mena, Barry Seal, all that stuff. It would put your cooperative relationship with Meadors into perspective. When he was governor of Arkansas, Bill sent one of his troopers over to be his eyes and ears in Seal's drug smuggling operation. He was a sort of ride-along. That's what Meadors is to you: She's your CIA ride-along. I was also going to do an in-depth analysis of

                             , because he practically bragged to Ryan that he is being protected by the CIA. It's really interesting stuff. But the evidence suggests we are now well past that point. I'm keeping all my drafts, just in case. But I think we're going to see big events quite soon.

                             It isn't just that there are 35,000 sealed indictments (or rather, 35,000 items, many of which are motions and maybe a third of which are actual indictments). What is just as telling is the eerie silence concerning them. Why hasn't the
                             <em>
                              New York Times
                             </em>
                             said anything about them? No matter what they contain, they are a gigantic, one-of-a-kind event, the biggest federal conspiracy case in history. Why hasn't CNN mentioned them? They have been throwing every kind of accusation at Trump, nonstop, for two years now. These are incredibly alarming numbers. They would scare even sane people who don't suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. And they keep going up, another 5,000 every month since last November. We do get coverage of the ongoing confirmations of U.S. attorneys, and Sessions' plan to hire 311 new prosecutors. So why hasn't CNN asked the question: What the hell is the DOJ doing with all this sealed stuff?

                             They haven't asked because they all know. At the top level, anyway. Brian Stelter knows and he's not going to touch the subject. The only people who blurt out references to the sealed items are fringe outlets like the
                             <em>

                             or the

                             . It's one of those weird moments in history where nobody wants to say it, to draw attention to the terrifying shadow. The media still talk 24/7 about Mueller or Stormy Daniels or whatever, as if everything isn't going to be completely overturned once the unsealing starts. Ironically, it kind of

                             So I'm not going to fight very hard on this. Our little contretemps will all blow over in another day, and you can get back to denouncing Freemasons and doing whatever else. But until the great unsealing actually occurs, I think it's prudent to remind you that I'm still out here. It's the job of Trump and Pence and Sessions to smash up your gang. My very small job is to keep making you look over your shoulder until they finally do.

                             YES! I proved it in the comments of their lame post. I used pictures of his declining health as he withered away. It’s messed up that this person has no respect for the dead and had made so many accusations about him.

                             Well,

                             , and then Alexandra Meadors claimed to have confirmed it. However,

                              as I explained in my original post about him

He claimed to have been healed by a variety of alien technologies, and to have the psychic ability to "read" someone's DNA at a distance. He claimed to know about thousands upon thousands of rapes and killings involving 70 Senators and most of the U.S. government, operating in collusion with Lucifer. He didn't offer any proof of any claim he made.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             It's not really much of a feat to act out of breath, as he does in his last video. And you may want to consider the date of that last video: July 13, 2016. That's important because it was an big day for the man who he spent his whole career attacking as a child-raping, child-murdering monster, Mike Pence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             July 1st, Tory Smith made his next-to-last video, unshaven and acting tired, in which he once again attacked Pence, as well as Pence's wife, his attorney general, the head of the Indiana State Police, and numerous individual troopers of the ISP. He also referred to feeling ill, but then as I said, he had always talked about being ill, and being raped, a lot. It got him a lot of sympathy from his audience: Poor Tory, they make him suffer so!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Pence had met with Trump on several occasions earlier in the campaign. He came out to New Jersey and he and Trump went golfing together on the 3rd of July. Until then, Pence had not been considered a strong contender for VP because he had publicly disagreed with Trump on several issues. He was also running for re-election as governor, which involved a July filing deadline. But the media widely publicized the golf game and speculated he would be the VP pick.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Then on July 12, Trump flew out to Indiana and appeared onstage with Pence at a fundraiser, where he even more strongly implied Pence would be VP. That night, Trump had Paul Manafort (then running his campaign) alter the schedule so he could meet again with Pence at the governor's mansion the next day. Pence flew to New York on the evening of the 14th, and on the 15th (just in time for Pence not to file for governor) Trump tweeted that Pence was his choice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Now, if you discount all the impossible and incoherent stuff that Tory said about magical "Blue Avians" and continually being infected with anthrax, you really only have two options here:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             1) Tory Smith was a veteran with PTSD and other health issues, and he raved about galactic aliens intervening in child sex trafficking, and being raped by Rand Paul, because he was out of his mind. He knew nothing about actual sex trafficking, and his announcement of his impending death on the same day that Mike Pence met with Trump was just a coincidence. It was also pure coincidence that Senate Anon and HighLevelInsider also insisted, without offering any evidence, that Pence was a traitor. (This, by the way, was a major tipoff for me. So many people defying the Powers That Be to warn us that Pence is bad, and not one of them ever offering any evidence.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             2) Tory Smith's videos were a disinfo campaign designed to smear Mike Pence and discredit anything he might say about the Glenn Beck whistleblower episode,
                             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2218774">
                              in which he had been a major player
                             </a>
                             . Smith was an operative hired by David Brock, and funded by Herb Sandler,
                             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2236529">
                              as I explain here
                             </a>
                             . He faked his death at that point because the smear had failed; Pence had shared what he knew with Trump, and Trump was going to make him VP as life insurance and to help sweep the pedos out of government. He had taken a serious risk in showing his face, and it was clearly time to wind down that part of the project. He then continued to toss out occasional anti-Pence propaganda as Senate Anon and HighLevelInsider.

                   If you want to destroy what you helped build, go for it. You didn't answer the question but just hurled insults. This is a unique environment, and the definition of pizzagate does not say that pizzagate is a never ending game of confusing and cryptic riddles.

Vindicator just slapped a perjorative label on all those that don't want pizzagte to be a game of riddles and gleefully announced that he is "mining their salt." That is a huge "fuck you" to everybody that disagrees with him. Its his own words. He wrote the shit.

Nothing egregious has just happened - Vindicator just flared a post about Q anon with a Q anon watch flair. That's it, nothing more. But of course, this is the straw that broke the camel's back - you used to support this guy but now

                   8Chan bakers, who pretend to be Q, were losing market share. Too many people going to sites they can't control. They blew Corsi and Alex Jones out so they could redirect the herd to sites they control, and make Shekels off of.

                    Hey, retard; Alex Jones is a shill. Jerome only stopped following Q when he realised he wouldn't be able to make profit any longer - another shill. Since these guys have clearly just been dancing for money and spreading disinfo, there is no employable logic that connects outing them to any kind of wrongdoing on our part. Oh, and make no mistake, when I say he condemned making profit off the truth, that involves your shitty t-shirt obsession as well.

                        . Cernovich was tweeting out some good stuff about human trafficking by the UN so I posted in in PizzaGateWhatever. I'm not quite sure what you're complaining about, really - especially with the Muslims. Wherever Muslims go, pedophilia follows (eg. Sweden).

                       They were distributed into the community by Wikileaks who has a stunning history of accuracy. Are you comparing Q to Wikileaks? Because if you are no wonder you are so confused.

                        I'm saying that they are both investigations and that, since Q has been proven connected to the President on multiple occasions, this is related to the initial investigation that Wikileaks started. Info from an online user who is definitely connected to the President is worth investigating. Only a fool would censor the conversation.

                           Pizzagate is a research sub dedicated to researching child abuse by very powerful people. A specialty sub and one of very few of its kind that exists. Very specialized in focus.

                           Q is a never ending game of cryptic riddles from an anonymous group of people, or person, much of which is steeped in partisan politics, international affairs, and happenings in Washington D.C. Every once in a while there may be a cryptic smattering of child abuse related stuff but compared to the bulk of the material the child related stuff is few and far between.

                              You aren't giving responses that I could possibly reply with evidence. When all you say is "riddle" and "I'm confused" and then a bunch of shill buzzwords, what am I supposed to say to that?

                Attacking people for Q is like attacking them for Religious beliefs. It's pointless in a free society. It does nothing but bring division. Plus E-Shade you get personal in attacks, which is a negative vibe we don't need around here. It's like a fight in my hometown years ago. Half the Churches thought Halloween was demonic. Two said All Hallow's Eve was for praying for the dead, and worshiping the Lord. Other Churches joined in town wide Halloween celebrations and handed out candy. The only thing that arguing between the two groups accomplished was that it made all the adults bitter at each other. The prayer meetings turned into a bitching session about all the other churches and they were hindered from prayer. And the adults in the other churches were upset, it became the talk of the night, so it hindered them from having a truly good time with the kids.
               </p>
               <p>
                Each group should have been focused on their beliefs in their own minds. Whatever you believe believe it unto God without worrying about everyone else's beliefs!
               </p>
               <p>
                My advice, You need to quit being a pharisee- a "Grammer Nazi" except for beliefs. Aren't you a big enough person to ignore the faith based differences of opinion and join in focusing on the Mission. If you'd put as much effort into writing about pizzagate as you do correcting everyone about Q think of all the knowledge that could be revealed!
               </p>
               <p>
                Q is interesting to me. I don't have to believe in Q to be intrigued by him. The whole movement has encouraged people to dig for answers themselves.
               </p>
               <p>
                So you're gonna have to decide

                </a>
                Are you going to correct everyone for their faith based beliefs? Might as well tell all the Jewish folks here not to celebrate Hanukkah, tell the people whether they can hand out candy or not Oct 31st, Tell the secular crowd not to have Holiday Legends, and tell us all what to think concerning our own faiths and traditions.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pfft! Who the Hell gives that right to ANYONE to dictate personal beliefs or cultural traditions on this Forum???
               </p>
               <p>
                You don't have that right to be a "QAnon-Nazi". So QUIT. Grow up and quit letting it get to you. Focus on what YOU PERSONALLY want to investigate about Pizzagate and share THAT. If you don't believe in a lead that someone else is following, state your case without being a DOUCHE, and focus on the leads that YOU believe.

                   faith based beliefs? Might as well tell all the Jewish folks here not to celebrate Hanukkah
                  </strong>
                  , tell the people whether they can hand out candy or not Oct 31st, Tell the secular crowd not to have Holiday Legends, and tell us all what to think concerning our own faiths and traditions.

                 Thanx for that. Faith based beliefs? This is not a church for "believers" it is a research sub.

                 This forum was not set up to be a free speech forum...it was set up to investigate pizzagate..
..which is centred in the machinations and logistic hub of connecticut avenue..
                </p>
                <p>
                 When did james alefantis and the establishment find the need to have him on mainstream media..when the focus was on connecticut avenue..
...the reason u dont see him on media after that is becaause the focus was directed away from that logistics hub..
..
If this forum is called pizzagate ..the mods should make sure the majority of the topics is about connecticut avenue and legal solutions geared towards getting the authorities to inveetigate and imprison this pedoring..
The rest of the forum should be allowed to rate how the connections like qanon..or tucson..that come up every now and then ...and then moved to a separate sub forum..
