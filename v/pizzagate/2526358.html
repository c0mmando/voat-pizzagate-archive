<p>A new bombshell report from Deadline shows that a law specifically enacted to protect child actors from sexual predators has largely gone ignored since being signed into law in 2012.</p>
<p>Enacted five years ago thanks to the pen-stroke of Gov. Jerry Brown, law AB 1660 protects child actors by requiring &quot;publicists, managers, acting coaches and headshot photographers who work with child actors to be fingerprinted and pass an FBI background check to screen out registered sex offenders.&quot; Should they pass the screening, only then will they be issued a Child Performer Services Permit.</p>
<p>&quot;A Deadline investigation, however, has found that not a single Hollywood publicist who represents child actors has obtained a permit,&quot; reports the outlet. &quot;Dozens of managers, acting coaches and photographers who work with child stars have also failed to comply with the law, which is punishable by a year in county jail and a $10,000 fine. And yet, no one has ever been charged with breaking it.&quot;</p>

I hope you remember my background.
I cannot say which state I currently practice in, or which county, or which side I am on, prosecution or defense, but I can say the only way criminal actions come to court are when CITIZENS report crimes to law enforcement. Law enforcement then brings the case to the prosecutor who files the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, dont just assume that the police are sitting back and researching every Nickelodeon show creator named Dan. If you see a crime, report it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you would have to show for this crime is that the person is regularly around children with work. Sometimes show creators are hands off, so that wouldn't work. Sometimes, however, they are very hands on, visiting the set daily and posting pictures and IG photos with the stars.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, how do you report?
You could call LAPD Hollywood division at 213-972-2971. They might or might not pick up. Or you could go to www.lapdonline.org/report_a_crime
You can remain anonymous.
What you will need: an explanation of the law because the officer taking your call or reading your email won't know this law. This relates to California Labor Code section 1706 which makes it mandatory that any person who provides services to a Minor artist first apply for and receive a Child Performer Services Permit. For argument sake let's use a fictional person... Dan S. Dan S. Works with minor artists as seen on IG posts at [fill in the blank] web address and as seen in this interview in such and such magazine. After searching the publicly available Child Performer Services Permit database, found at
            <a href="https://permits.dir.ca.gov/cps/searchCPSPermitAction.action">
             https://permits.dir.ca.gov/cps/searchCPSPermitAction.action
            </a>
            Dan S. Is not listed as having a permit as of [today's date].
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you ask for a report DR# (unique report identifier).
           </p>
           <p>
            Then follow up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either a criminal charge will be recommended and forwarded to DA OR they won't recommend a charge and you have interesting evidence of potential police misconduct if they refuse to file.

            So basically, nobody checks whether they comply with the law. What could be done about that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Could a citizen's action group report all those people to authorities?
           </p>
           <p>
            Could those of us who are on Twitter initiate a campaign?

             ~~One of the key California laws designed to protect child actors from sexual predators has gone largely ignored and unenforced since it was enacted five years ago. The law requires publicists, managers, acting coaches and headshot photographers who work with child actors to be fingerprinted and pass an FBI background check to screen out registered sex offenders. Only then will they be issued a Child Performer Services Permit.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Deadline investigation, however, has found that not a single Hollywood publicist who represents child actors has obtained a permit. Dozens of managers, acting coaches and photographers who work with child stars have also failed to comply with the law, which is punishable by a year in county jail and a $10,000 fine. And yet, no one has ever been charged with breaking it.

               Except that I often use other sources alongside it, check up on the references/claims provided and even disagree with some of what's espoused in certain wiki entries.

               Anyone can also check for suspicious edits.

               But, you already know these things, right? Dunno why you'd suddenly flip on me and try to discredit my work, when I've only been nice to you - doesn't matter, I know there's no problem with taking the time to read wiki entires that are ignored by others. Your aversion to wikipedia is your own problem and that of the person who upvoted your reply, not mine.
