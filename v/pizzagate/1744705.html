            This isn't a case of being afraid of elite as you have said it is a case of Alex Jones who is using an alias been subpoenaed to go to court for a lawsuit and it be revealed his identity is actually Bill Hicks.

             It sure is a pattern. They speak up, then just shut down on it and go quiet or in AJ case apologize. Whatever happened with Ben Swann's "trust me" ? Are they all being threatened or blackmailed? Are James Woods and Flynn Jr still on board?

            It was prepared by attorney for sure to avoid litigation. Curious why he said a few weeks ago to "bring it on" and now the about face. He had said he had death threats, private investigators following family etc.  I also wonder if that info from intel wiretaps has gathered some type of blackmail info and they are now using against him or family.

            Fuck that. I will not be careful. I will be vigilant and faithful. Right is right and I will not bow down to nor curtail my research into these sick fucks. Fuck fear. That's their tool; they need it. They prey upon our fear and use it for fuel. Understanding this is the first key to unlocking their system.

            Demand the investigations. If Alex had balls, and if he were truly on the side of right, he'd welcome the lawsuit. Any opportunity to have PizzaGate materials entered into the official record, in official court documents, should be seized. We should be suing Alefantis, Podesta, Hillary, etc.

             But regardless, we should be careful not to be the judge and jury and claim he is in fact a baby-eating-satanic-pedo, even though one could make the argument. We should gather information to convince the public and law enforcement to prosecute James and Comet Ping Pong but at the same time be very careful in wording each claim we make.

            I remember when pizzagate first broke and two weeks after people were saying "stop investigating James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong is a dead end"...I think Alex Jones also said that.  And then they said "dont talk about Satanism this investigation has nothing to do with Satanism"...well it turns out it has everything to with some form of Satanism...
           </p>
           <p>
            But it really doesnt matter how much evidence you gather against any of them because it will never be enough...even if James Alefantis was caught mailing baby body parts to David Brock he would say it was a "prank" or "art" and get off...case in point;

             That's not true. AJ IS spreading the knowledge about satanic cults (British prime minister).
He also keeps talking about the perverse Podesta mails!
He shifts the focus from the single pizzashop to the bigger picture. And that is GOOD!
            </p>
            <p>
             We will see, if he keeps up this strategy or if he dumps #pedogate, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             And if AJ is trustworthy enough for Larry Klayman with the probably biggest whistleblowing about illegal surveillance (47 HDs, 600 million pages, illegal supreme court surveillance, surveillance of 167 judges, ...) - because laywers from top whistleblowers trusting him - and AJ has the courage to bring it - then he is good enough for me to watch and listen carefully, what he says.

            It's because of Jones big mouth and irrational fashion altogether, over time, and taken together that has finally come back to haunt him. His bloated style, right leaning good old boy gun toting conservatism is what is being used as a catalyst for the motivations of pizzagate shooter Edgar Welch. All of it is being squarely blamed on the incendiary notions of Alex Jones. This is because Alex Jones hopped on the story too quickly and didn't do his own research on the matter and passed on the allegation of sensationalism current at the time from disinfo agents and hyperbolists.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've never agreed with the overblown premise that Alefantis was trafficking children out of his space on Connecticut Ave. But through subsequent investigations into the artistic preferences of the establishment's patrons, its late hours, and no age limit events most discerning adults would agree that this is not the safest place for children, night or day. To suggest he ran a sacrificial ring there and in his basement was ludicrous, to a degree, but certain authors and myself were cautious about over interpreting what WikiLeaks was implying. I tried many times to try and quell certain voices that were continuously trying to push fantastical and overwhelming imaginings to the front of the line. Of course the MSM condensed version made it even worse. Now we can say, with much certainty, that both these issues outlined above now effecting pizzagate, have counterintelligence aspects working in concert with each other. Shills and disinformation plant superfluous information, like underground tunnels, baby coffins and kill rooms instead of the relevant issues like artistic pursuits, influence lobbies and corporate social engineering, the likes of the ten essays by Yoichi Shimatsu.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike Alex Jones authors like myself and others we have not advocated impulsive, incendiary or even confrontational approaches to the pizzagate scandal. While I know that Jones does not either, his temperament and stance dictates otherwise, and I can see how easy it would be to stir up one of his more unstable fans. We've all been saying this about you for years now Alex, along with your current alignment with the 'far right' and  your 'roger'ized trumptards I would say that you have done your job right and a good portion of your fans are mentally and governmentally 'vetted'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of us were smart enough to avoid the sensationalism. And some of us are not out for profit (which is another reason we know you're a cointell shill is that you don't want to risk your huge member funded bank account to back up your fat ass) and your incorrect hurried claims, at least what Shimatsu writes about can be backed up by affidavit by simple internet sourcing.

             Huge mistake.
Just today: if AJ is trustworthy enough for Larry Klayman with the probably biggest whistleblowing about illegal surveillance (47 HDs, 600 million pages, illegal supreme court surveillance, surveillance of 167 judges, ...) - because laywers from top whistleblowers trusting him - and AJ has the courage to bring it - then he should be good enough for normal people to watch and listen carefully, what he says.

               Trump is a big jew lover, just got his 4th jewish grandkid.
And (((Boris Johnson))) came back for Brexit.
But Nethanjahu helped Trump to catch the (((19 year old))) in Israel who threatened Jewish centers with bomb threats worldwide! Old jewish tactic. But never before the perpetrator was prosecuted and stoppd - by the jews themselfes.
              </p>
              <p>
               To me it seems there is a split within Jewry and a huge battle going on! And AJ only apopogized to JA - but he is spreading awareness about the pedostanists and their global power structure, just like he is redpilling people about the globalists.

            Oh my gosh, you said what I have been thinking and said it very eloquently!!  I totally agree.  We can't be making accusations against people if we do not have 100% proof especially when it involves someone's "good name".  Also, I would like to vent a little to the pedo accusers on social media.  It really pisses me off when people who have been blessed with a really large following and have the power to influence, fritter it away by getting booted off social media for antagonizing powerful individuals and accusing them of crimes when there is not 100% proof.  Don't get me wrong, I realize some people got booted off for no good reason, but I am specifically talking about the people who use their social media platform to troll.  I would like to see people use their social media to focus on red pilling as many as they can.  Don't risk a large following by poking bears.  Use it to get as many people woke as possible.  The victims need woke people.  Why don't victims come forward?  BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID NO ONE WILL BELIEVE THEM.  That is what happened in the Franklin Case and the McMartin Case.  We need as many people woke to encourage victims to come forward.

             No, we don't need "100% proof."  "100% proof" of pedophilia would be a VIDEOTAPE of the perp committing the act.

              Well if you want to accuse people knock yourself out.  I'm just thinking that since we have already established via a FOIA request that this has not been deemed worthy of being investigated by the DC police that we would be wise to protect ourselves.  Also to avoid losing any platform we may have of educating people about pedogate.

            I think I might be able to put this in context a little bit. I remember vividly what happened. Joe Biggs was contacted by someone who was later found out to be an employee at a Washington DC PR firm. At the time Joe Biggs didn't know that at the time. He just accepted a secret pedo menu as if it were real without doing much of anything to confirm it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Long story short Joe Biggs pulled a Dan Rather. And when you accept "evidence" without doing some due diligence and report on it you SHOULD get fired.

             Thats just it! Right now the people of America want an investigation that needs to take place when there is (((evidence))) of misconduct and we have found secret code in many emails, that matches pedophilia secret coding, along with many many other forms of evidence that absolutely points in the direction that sexual assault of minors and trauma to many might very well be taking place in high places. And the complete WAR on Pizzagate and disinformation agents like yourself ONLY MAKE us dig deeper with more understanding that there is absolutely a war against justice!

               when you accept "evidence" without doing some due diligence and report on it, you SHOULD get fired. Then almost every mainstream reporter should be fired according to your law. Then why arent they?

             Joe Biggs did some commendable work and will be remembered for it, but that menu was obviously fake and planted into his hands for the very purpose of discrediting everyone. It worked like a charm, setting Jones off course and necessitating the firing of a tough and loyal employee.

            That apology was most definitely written by a lawyer, probably more than a few. Agree peeps should mind their Ps and Qs to avoid being pigeon holed by the machine as some alt this or alt that or some other label or frame to justify ignorance or even to be accused of libel.

              In issuing this statement, we are not admitting that Mr. Alefantis, or his restaurant, have any legal claim. We do not believe they do.

             That is absolutely from a lawyer, either that or Alex Jones knows law well enough to personally verse it. It is most certainly a legal matter, and this was probably a forced apology in order to prevent litigation from Alefantis.
            </p>
            <p>
             It might additionally have been to prevent censorship by YouTube, and Google in general, and also to avoid being labelled by the authorities and media as a purveyor of "fake news". It could well be that Alefantis has been in communication with Google so as to censor this subject and that Info Wars became a serious subject - so it's maybe an "apologise to me or Google whacks you" kinda thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             I personally feel that this is a very bad precedent, not only regarding the interference by Alefantis, Google, potentially the authorities and who knows what else, but also regarding the willingness of somebody like Alex Jones to be a complete and utter wimp.

               he did a video

              (then pulled it down) where he was pissed (angry and slightly drunk) saying he was going to fight it, and that the truth would come out in discovery. It's sad AJ buckled, but he probably saw what happened to Gawker and didn't want to risk it. People who have discernment can see this.

               The trouble is, many people are the victim of this bribery and/or downright blackmail, and seemingly Jones is yet another one. This is how they roll, this is how they keep their agenda going. Blackmail. As for Jones, who knows if it was some dirt somebody had on him or even a threat of harm. If it's only about the money and/or reputation then he's not just a coward, he wouldn't exactly be interested in the truth. If he was unlawfully threatened then it might be the wiser move to just tell his viewers, it would act as insurance - even if he gets hit, at least everybody will know about it and it would 100% validate our cause.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm in a similar boat, I have pretty much been forced to cause virtually the entirety of my own country to become aware of me and my dilemma, due to years of harassment and psychological warfare against me - I've had to force such a situation so that if anything happens to me then everybody will be talking about it and asking questions which the authorities don't like being asked in the first place, let alone put in the position of having to answer. This is what Jones should do, he should just say it how it is and deal with the consequences later - the truth is far more important than one's own reputation or fortune.

                This is what we all must do. Whistleblowers die silently. Until everyone is willing to stop exposing all of this it will not stop. If you jumped on Alex you fell right into JA &amp; the CIA trap. They are laughing hysterically. This is called psychological warfare. Do you want to turn the tables? Whoever they attack we support make them heroes watch their shows as much as possible...he'll even buy mass doses of male virtuality if that is what he sells. Buy his shirts were them everywhere make him a hero....and David Seaman also prop him up demand interviews put him on YouTube. Make him a hero for the work he has done so far. Stop falling for their games. Whoever they attack or prop up on YouTube is our friend and their enemy.
