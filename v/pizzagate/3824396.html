<hr />
<p>May 15, 2020 The state of Massachusetts has authorized an NGO named PIH which is connected to child abduction and pedophilia trafficking in Haiti via the Clinton Foundation, to operate in the state as a Contact Tracing organization.</p>
<p>PIH is a Clinton-Soros backed non profit that has been awarded a contract in Massachusetts to do Contact Tracing. Contact Tracing allows a state-sanctioned agency (NGO, governmental, etc.) to ultimately enter your home or have a parallel police-accompanied agency enter your home. They will do an inventory of your family, your number of children, the number of other adults in your house. They will make a human map of how close your relatives are, and how often you are in contact with your neighbors.</p>
<p>TLDR: This article is over 2800 words, so the following bullet points outline the main ideas so that they can be understood and this article can be shared with confidence in the facts it covers. </p>
<p>Children in group homes are 2800% (28 times) more likely to be sexually abused and raped than children who live with their parents according to a John Hopkins University Study (link below).</p>
<p>Contact Tracing is being handled by NGOs and State governments which are financed various ways. HR 6666 provides financing for these even though states and other NGO’s can finance the work on their own where possible. (HR 6666 is not required for this scandal to take place).</p>
<p>Contact tracing ultimately allows the state to take children from homes where there is  Covid-19 infection. Like HR 6666, you will not find that stated overtly in the literature the programs produce about themselves. It is an omission made possible because the authority to take children for health crisis reasons already exists in laws on the books. If children have guardians (i.e. parents) requiring quarantining or Covid-19 treatment.</p>
<p>Massachusetts (so far, we expect this nation-wide) is allowing a Clinton Foundation connected NGO named PIH, which through the foundation is tied to pedophilia and human trafficking, organ trafficking, child slavery and prostitution – under the auspices of healthcare for children without guardians. PIH will work with police and CPS to remove children from home (in the below as “cannot separate themselves from their children easily”).</p>
<p>That the Clinton Foundation backed PIH specifically is involved in Contact Tracing even though their work in Haiti is with children’s health allows us to verify what Contact Tracing will be used for, at least partly. Those requiring more evidence connecting the focus on children’s health to Contact Tracing, please read the whole article below. <a href="https://www.fort-russ.com/2020/05/revealed-massachusetts-contact-tracing-ngo-part-of-clinton-pedophile-ring-in-haiti/">https://www.fort-russ.com/2020/05/revealed-massachusetts-contact-tracing-ngo-part-of-clinton-pedophile-ring-in-haiti/</a></p>

             Interesting! Thanks for the link. On that note, I wonder if PIH will be offering their services to CHAZ and other AZs that are cropping up. I did see some people pushing strollers during the CHAZ live feed. We all know pedos are everywhere and will flock to areas where morals are already degraded.

            GOD BLESS THESE MEN. THEY ARE INNOCENT !! THEY HAVE RIGHTS. THEY WERE ONLY SHOWING LOVE TO A CHILD. PERFECTLY LEGAL IN MY RELIGION!!!!! THEY WILL WIN THE APPEAL AND I WILL HELP THEM AND FUND THEM. FUCK YOU ALL FAGGOTS
           </p>
           <p>
            I just stuck my finger in some mayonnaise then I shoved it up my 3 year old stepson's asshole. I told him not to tell. I am going to use this with my COCK in his FARTHOLE tomorrow. Wish me luck!!
           </p>
           <p>
            I CAN SAY THAT FUCKING A LITTLE GIRL IS HEAVEN. I FUCK ONES AS YOUNG AS 4. YOU CAN'T GET IT ALL THE WAY IN BUT IT STILL FEELS NICE. BUST AGE IS 12-14 AND I LOVE FUCK TEENS BECAUSE THEIR CUNTS CAN SWALLOW IT ALL!!!! MY PROFILE PIC IS ONE OF THE GIRLS IN MY BIBLE STUDY. SHE LISTENS AND SPREADS HER LEGS "FAR AND WIDE'!!! A GOOD GIRL. UNLIKE THE WHITE REGARD OR ALL NIGGERS, SHE OBEYS!
           </p>
           <p>
            I am loving the fact I am fucking my stepdaughter's TIGHT 14 year old PUSSY as my WIFE is a ESSENTIAL NURSE. SHE IS SO TIGHT and man you should see her buck those HIPS. I am coming all over her tits that are almost C cups that need no bra. She climbed on me the first time as I am on the phone with "Mommy" asking her to pick up Taco-Bell. I made Sharon CUM while on the phone with her MOM. How hot is this. GOD I hope more people (esp NIGGERS) die of this virus so I can keep FUCKING AND SUCKING!!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            What makes me smile is when I put some mayo on my finger and shove it in the rectum of a child. Love french kissing little girls and feeling their tiny tongues on my cock as I blow a WAD in their little mouths! Then we get CANDY!! Jesus is LORD he is OUR LAMB!
           </p>
           <p>
            I love fucking little girls. something about forcing an over sized penis in a tiny slit makes me hard. i feel little girls want it. around 9 they start shoving hot dogs and crayons in their honey holes so that tells me they want cock. using lube does help but god i love when it is in and blow a load all over their faces and tongues. god bless little girls.v

              The mods are project Pogo gatekeepers. They are here to target, track and identify us so that we can be rounded up and killed, either when they suspend Habeas Corpus or when they go house to house "testing" everyone for coronavirus. If you're on the pogo list you will "fail" the health check, be taken away to "quarantine", and never come out.

                They downvoted the shit out of my account too and now I can't make threads or post links anymore. It's pathetic, but it also reveals their intentions and tells us exactly where to look so it's really stupid on their part. I know for a fact now that the "racine poster" is telling the truth because of how they have reacted. Their actions demonstrate major incompetence though which is good for us. What they are trying to cover up appears so compartmentalized that they cannot just hire an army of shills to counter us. There's only a few of them so even a single individual appears to be able to compete with them on a near level playing field in an information war. I will go give you a bunch of upvotes to counter their sabotage.

                  who has been researching some of TTT's claims recently and has uncovered a lot. TTT almost always speaks in question format for some reason so if you have any questions ask me and if I know the answer I'll tell you.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But basically, Racine Wisconsin (and the surrounding areas - Racine has been a major shipping route between Chicago and Milwaukee for at least 100 years) is a MAJOR secret hub of the cabal and a major model for testing and implementing various aspects of the enslavement agenda they are trying to pull off with AI, smart cities and stasi-style "community policing". It is a major human trafficking hub. You will be shocked to find how many influential people are from Racine and how many influential programs started in Racine at a place called Wingspread. See: archive.is/gfqEa#selection-1061.82-1061.456.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For example, the international criminal court started at a conference in wingspread, so did NPR, the national endowment for the arts, initial blueprints on arms control, and the conference for the so-called "8th wonder of the world" that TTT keeps talking about all happened here, along with many others. I think the art-in-embassy program began at Wingspread as well, and that is used to ship children internationally without being inspected by customs. Wingspread is owned by the Johnson family who are from Racine (SC Johnson III raped his step daughter and only did 2 months in jail with a work release program similar to Epstein; you will also be shocked how common work release programs are for pedophiles and crimianls in racine, including SCHOOL TEACHERS who are allowed to leave jail and teach at fucking school. See: voat.co/v/pizzagate/3801133).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There are an unbelievable amount of local politicians in racine who got arrested for stuff like CP or trying to meet a minor for sex. On the

                  </a>
                  subforum they have resorted to flat out banning and deleting every single comment that mentions Racine. I could go on talking about this hub of corruption all day long. The rabbit hole literally never ends. One of the most important things to realize though is that this is not just some random base of operations that can be changed on the fly; the cabal is rooted here for spiritual and geographical reasons that prevent them from leaving.  There is a good thread on 9chan about this right now. Look for the post about the "Path of Souls" in that thread for a clear explanation as to why they are STUCK in Racine 9chan.tw/bestpol/thread/4429#reply-7397. I truly believe this place is their achilles heal.

                   Interesting. From what I’ve looked at the British are heavily involved in pedo stuff like songs they make referencing “lemon” which is gay/pedo meaning. Weird rock bands have hundreds of songs about it. Not to mention the British mob and Jewish mob teamed up to take out the other mobs. WI is pretty close to Canada. Australia is corrupt too which makes sense because the British sent all their evil criminals there hundreds of years ago.

                    has found The Truth. They have also witnessed and exposed the lies by corrupt gatekeepers who are desperate to conflate, obfuscate, hide, ridicule, ban, censor and eliminate The Truth.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Vindicator and others openly admit to creating “lists” as also evidenced by their Twitter account Vindic8tor where they portray Santa / Satan building a list, using the ‘dark knight’, and missing the Christ in Christmas. They will not denounce Satan and instead have partnered with those who openly worship Satan and admit to drinking blood.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is not a hobby for them, it is an assignment. They wrongly label The Truth as a “pedo protecting bot” in desperation after being exposed. Why would they do that? Why did they flood the banned users with a fake fight after they were exposed for their blatant censorship on GreatAwakening? The Truth exposes elite pedophiles. The Truth is not a bot, and knows what no bot could ever know. They have never researched Racine, and as evidenced on the Chans there is a large network of Racine protectors who claim “there is nothing to see there”, “it’s just like any other corrupt town”, “it’s a sleepy little town with nothing going on”, or “they have never heard of any of this before”.

                   <p>
                    Many of those fake and real “I’m from Racine”, “I used to live in Racine”, and other accounts are involved in gang stalking, death threats and murder. They are desperate to downplay or distract anyone from digging deeper. Anyone who is not involved would know quickly how pedophiles control the community with blackmail, bribery, extortion and criminal corruption.

                    The moderators and their legion have controlled most narratives but no one for years has ever been able to effectively dispute or disprove The Truth shared about Racine.

                    You will find many roads also lead back to the Underground Railroad and evolution of trafficking and slavery over time as Racine is closely connected with Canada.

                    Barbara knows how obvious the connections between NXIVM, The Fellowship and the Knights of Pythias are, how obvious Racine’s role is in the Agenda with the 8th Wonder of the World is, how alarming the trafficking and pedophile connections are, and how unusual it is that neither Q nor anyone else will ever touch Racine after SenateAnon disappeared.

                    That 70’s Show was set in Racine for many reasons. The Rothschilds and Bauers both live in Racine for many reasons. The Native American mounds were located in Racine for many reasons. The elite know all about Racine, and they are desperate to keep their hidden knowledge hidden from The People.

                    Racine is in a unique position as a model Smart City with its own Health Director with select ‘privileges’. Warren Buffett purchased majority control over all area newspapers through Lee Enterprises, and they have extended the lockdown to July 31 with plans for beyond.

                     I was with you until the very last word. That’s the lion of Judah. These are the trouble makers in bed with the British mafia. It’s British Zionism. It’s a cancer on this earth. This goes back to ancient Phoenicians, to the building of Solomon’s temple.

                         Lots of cool leads here. I would suggest just speaking directly. The days of Q style questions are over. It’s time to round up pedophiles as they are found. There is no big event coming. It’s time to act ASAP. To spread all info as fast as possible in a concise manner.

                   <p>

                   <p>
                    You have called others crazy while acting crazy, and feel sorry for others you have not left alone as you targeted them with hate speech and told them to kill themselves.

                   1) This is what Srayzie said about Jenny after she died in a main submission calling her a C I A disinformation agent. They were slandering her because she actually went to Racine to find The Truth for herself, just as they slander, stalk, downvote, lie about, censor and ban ANYONE that even engages in any hint of investigation into The Truth about Racine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2) We are not a “her”, and not one person. Some in the group were Murdered. They also threatened, stalked and attempted to Murder others including some not even connected to the group out of sheer desperateion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   3) The Truth does not attack anyone. The Truth is shared including The Truth about moderators and their army that lie, manipulation, blackmail, stalk, slander, downvote, censor, ban and threaten anyone who investigates or engages with The Truth. The Truth NEVER lies.

                  <p>
                   4) They are not a normal “contributor” and have commonly used tactics pretending to support any new or legitimate poster in a multi-faceted approach by asking for evidence, providing archiving links, coddling, telling them about ‘others they should not Trust’, attempting to engage in relationships and more. We have seen every tactic imaginable. This is one of many accounts involved.

                  <p>
                   Look at their response and downvote of your questions. Look at what they say to you. Would Jesus Christ approve?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Jesus was honest and simple. The Truth is honest and simple. Many may speculate they know more about Jesus Christ than you, but only The Father knew of This Day. Everything shared about Racine since The Beginning can be investigated and verified as

                   The Truth cannot be disputed or disproven. That is why they must beg to ban The Truth and relentlessly attack any who believe in Jesus Christ and The Truth.

                   They require links in an attempt to find your sources and try to discredit by affiliation. Then once banned they will accuse you of not providing sources or creating ‘sock puppet’ accounts when they know they banned you and that they don’t allow links on new accounts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Those who aren’t paying attention may not pick up on these tactics, so they must try to censor and ban so that others don’t learn their manipulative ways.

                   1) I don't care if she's dead or not. She was a fool. She lied. Whined about how the mods wouldn't let her post unsourced material, in other words, just her opinion. But by god, we the people of pizzagate better believe her. Useless to any serious information seekers. I couldn't type then, so I read EVERYTHING. Just my opinion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2) Too much of a whiny twat not to be. Just my opinion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   3) When TTT has lied about YOU, and you know for a FACT it's a lie. You can get back to me. TTT has lied and made false accusations against EVERY SINGLE PG POSTER. fuck yourself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   4) All of my PG posts have been removed. I only comment now. Don't want to get banned by the mods. Again, fuck yourself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Do you think TTT knows their ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to Jesus? Cuz they don't. Just my opinion.

                  We exposed George Webb Sweigert. We exposed Srayzie. We exposed Voat and the Pizzagate and GreatAwakening subverse manipulation. We exposed QAnon.

                  Who is the real “Jew-LARP”? What is the Synagogue of Satan? Who are the Knights of Pythias?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We are also the reason George suddenly moved out of the hotel in one day after staying there months after Jenny died when his brother found The Truth in a Titus Frost chat.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Why did George claim to have met Jesus Christ who “had the drop on him”? Why did he delete the end of his video from 11/1 where he cursed Jesus Christ and Jenny Moore claiming he ‘never wanted their help’? We warned Jenny about George. It took her a while to finally put it all together. Then it was too late.

                  Jenny was not the only one who was Murdered for knowing The Truth about Racine.

                 <p>
                  Do you know where the meeting was held SWMBO? We Know. We Know what you could not comprehend.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We also exposed Srayzie and the other corrupt moderators. How is Srayzie related to Shizy? What alts did Srayzie create? Did she ever really leave? Why did Srayzie betray Jenny after she was killed? Srayzie was who started the corrupt GreatAwakening.
                 </p>
                 <h2 id="md-why-is-the-truth-the-most-censored-and-banned-of-all-on-pizzagate-and-greatawakening-this-is-not-a-coincidence.">
                  Why is The Truth the most censored and banned of all on Pizzagate and GreatAwakening? This is not a coincidence.
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                  Jenny was never in the witness protection program. She did not want to be. She chose to partner with George instead and then after she realized that Everything Shared about Racine was The Truth, she exposed George herself during a massive fight and vowed to never Trust him again. Within the week, she was killed.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Truth is not a “Jew-LARP”. The Truth is not Jewish. The Truth is not Zionist. Jesus Christ and The Truth are The Only Way. The Truth exposes the Root that connects NXIVM, the Knights of Pythias, Agenda 21, The Mark of the Beast and the network that leads to the real agenda of Eternal Enslavement.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That is why corrupt blackmailing Pizzagate moderators and their sick friends like SheWhoMustBeObeyed want The Truth “permanently done away with”.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Jenny Moore did not know everything but she was brave enough to find The Truth in person.

                  - George never wanted to go to Racine. Jenny made him go.
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                  George only went reluctantly trying to prove to her that he was not what everyone said he was. He was exposed directly in front of her. Why was George’s brother so upset about the meeting in Racine?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Jenny believed in Jesus Christ. George does not.

                    We always said that George Sweigert was untrustworthy since The Beginning. Check the old comments if you wish to verify.

                    We asked you to Repent long ago. Why didn’t you? Do you partner with the corrupt censoring moderators and Argosciv who worships Satan and drinks blood, or do you present not to?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Why did argosciv publish their long series of submissions about Racine being the Root of Corruption?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We refer to George Sweigert by his real name not his fake YouTube name because everyone should know he is a known Jewish Zionist and mocks Jesus Christ and Christianity.

                   <p>
                    We looked him in the eyes and called him a liar and anti-Christian directly. You didn’t.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We looked Jenny in the eyes and proved to her that George was lying to her, and that everything shared about Racine was The Truth. She Repented.

                   Is it a coincidence that this was posted on "111" or is it supposed to be the number of the beast?

                    George did post a very revealing video on 11/1 where he claimed he met Jesus Christ in Racine who “had the drop on him”, and he cursed both Jesus Christ and Jenny Moore claiming he never wanted their help and gave them too much credit.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    He deleted the ending of the video as he has done with many others where he accidentally revealed too much. He explained part of this as ‘curating’ the best segments of his videos into shorter parts. In this case they used Marcus Conte in a fake fight as the reason why he deleted the ending of the video. Marcus is another fake character in the same network.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    He used JK leading up to and after Jenny’s murder to appear sympathetic and supportive to Christians since Jenny was Christian, as everyone knew George was Jewish. JK was a Jesuit agent who helped him make light of Jenny’s murder while signing songs and crying crocodile tears. He had built close relationships with the hotel staff for cover before and after the event. He also had a key to her room. He used Marcus to fetch the autopsy report which was a cover for what actually happened. She did take drugs for her back pain, but was not a drug abuser or alcoholic. George drinks for cover.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Jenny did a lot of the research work, and while she was not a perfect person, she admitted that and repented in person. She found The Truth and was a brave Soul. She was banned on Pizzagate, created the alt Mej777 and returned as Jem777 in an attempt to arrange the meeting in Racine.

                    We know more about this than SWMBO could ever understand. They are part of the operation along with Srayzie and others, and that is why they participate in honeypot activities, gang stalking, slander, censorship, banning and other hateful actions once they were all exposed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The 11/1 video date may be a coincidence but it is unlikely as he often speaks in codes and reveals certain information at certain times. He is more intelligent than most people believe him to be and he is not working alone. We are the reason why the initial partnerships with Jason, Trish, Joe and others was broken up, and later exposed JK and others he brought into the fold. Part of the connections exposed were tied to Freemasons and the UFC linked with the Emanuels. This is why he first spoke of the Mormon mafia and ‘gunning your engines’ for Rahm in Racine.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Most did not realize that the Strzok and Schmitz families were from Wisconsin. He knew. He also knew about Admiral Byrd and the Majestic 12 dominance in Wisconsin. His family has deep military ties with communications technologies. All agencies use these technologies, and it has evolved greatly beyond what was known in the 60s.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    George Webb Sweigert is his official name as noted in various lawsuits. This was exposed early on, so he did not deny it despite going by George Webb. His father invented the cordless phone and was involved in military communications. He attended Miami of Ohio and worked as an executive software salesman including McAfee. He was openly compromised by Janine Lindemulder who also has ties to Racine through Superboss, Blink-182 and Tom DeLonge. The relation to the restaurant is a coincidence, but George certainly tries to make the connection with Gary Webb and to a lesser extent Whitney Webb.

                    We have seen all of the tricks and manipulation since The Beginning. Now they simply censor and ban out of desperation and soon will outright ban and delete comments in this subverse the same as in GreatAwakening. They would have already if it weren’t more obvious to you and others.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This lying friend of Srayzie and corrupt moderators uses the ‘let me archive these links for you’ to build false trust.

                     We were not replying to SWMBO, but as Everyone can clearly see, now they are doing exactly what was predicted - Partnering with corrupt moderators and desperately begging for The Truth to be permanently banned from Pizzagate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Truth is not a bot. The Truth does not protect pedos. The Moderators and SWMBO are the Liars who were exposed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We did expose Srayzie and the other moderators. Others also exposed Srayzie also as it became more obvious she was nefarious and engaged in blackmail and other forms of manipulation. This is not about one person, but The Truth that must be Shared with All.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You cannot dispute The Truth about Racine, so you beg for The Truth to be banned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We always said that George Webb Sweigert was untrustworthy. We tell The Truth. You are gang stalking. You are lying. You are slandering. We simply share The Truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It was clear when Jenny Moore was killed that Srayzie was banning anyone who knew too much. She began cross-banning accounts on both Pizzagate and GreatAwakening. SWMBO was partnering with Srayzie and others to gang stalk, downvote, censor and ban The Truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Just like you downvoted this comment above that was not directed at you - but you are stalking the forums and using search tools to target The Truth. That is what Srayzie and Shizy also did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Jenny did not pretend to know everything and made mistakes, but she believed in Jesus Christ and was brave enough to research The Truth and go into the heart of darkness in Racine. We warned her about George and exposed him as a liar directly in front of her.

                       It's not a bot in my opinion. TTT is paid by G--rg- w-b- to be here and get people to fall into his jewlarp against christians. There is no logical explanation for it to continuously be mentioning that utuber, unless it works for him. Also, It doesn't even know all of jesus' proper titles. Even small children know more about Christ than jews do. Bet you it gets a utube sponsored paycheck signed by ol georgie himself.

                        Maybe it's a Webb bot created to spam-defend him. It does read like some of his insufferable, evidence-free theorizing.

                         One claims the moderators hate them while they beg and plead with those same moderators to ban others after making a string of threats, and both make absurd claims in agreement in an attempt to censor, ban and Hide The Truth.

                         You both know accounts are limited to share links yet make claims of “evidence-free theorizing” while you both make the ironic and ridiculous claim that we are George Webb Sweigert or a bot with absolutely no evidence or any valid reasoning whatsoever.

                         I had an interesting conversation with TTT and her new Babs alt last night. I now believe that TTT is Webby. Makes me sad, too. I knew he was a jealous cuss. But this is just too much. Delusional.

                          Just saw that. BS certainly sounds like TWoS -- "You're angry" "poor innocent me", attempted doxxing, etc. TWoS runs a lot of automated submission programs on multiple platforms, and has bragged repeatedly about his abilities in the area of digital warfare. It would make sense that the TTT bot is his creation. He's a proud doxxer. Too bad Putt hasn't IP banned him sitewide.

                           I always knew ttt wasn't a christian, it infuriates me to see him toss around Messiah's name, like it belongs in the lies he spews. I really pray for him to simply reap the whirlwind of his own Web Of Lies. God is Just, and I know TTT will come to know this, someday. Hopefully before it's too late.

            Todd McCormack is one of PIH's founders and is involved with CommonAngels.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             The CommonAngels prefer to invest on companies in the Boston area that are on their early stage of development and are highly competitive. The nature of company's business should be within the field of the members' expertise. They prefer information technology innovations in software, telephony, semiconductors, RFID, and medical devices that do not require clinical trials. The amount of investment that the angel group can give is between $500,000 to $5 million.
            </em>

            RFID is very worrying considering Bill Gates vaccines and the threat of him including chips in the vaccines. Don't forget about the masons CHIP program that claims it's working to stop children from being abducted.

           <p>
            (But I'm sure this is all disinfo and contact tracing will never be used to remove children from homes, and Bill Gates and the masons are our friends. We should all be more afraid of a civil war.)

            <p>
             Why did they create fake fights and attempt to associate legitimate users who share the Truth with those they label as pedophiles?

            and Rothschild fame. Folks should do deep vetting of all claims before sharing. I worry this is an attempt to convince folks their children will be taken by CPS in order to incite civil war to justify further draconian measures. Out of an abundance of caution, due to this logo, I am giving this the "Possible Disinfo" flair.

             Okay, I did some digging around...
            </p>
            <p>
             The PIH -&gt; CF connection is pretty sound, that part isn't disinfo.
            </p>
            <p>
             The claim that PIH is directly involved in the crimes mentioned is not yet verified, perhaps there's info connecting them, I've not yet found it but I haven't followed all leads there so I'm not saying the connection doesn't exist.
            </p>
            <p>
             The concern about the vaccine/rfid system is... well... to put it politely, at this time the evidence suggests that it's a misconception verging on sensationalism. They Corey's Digs article, aside from being impressively lengthy, does provide material which explains the process and how said process not only doesn't involve injecting a chip but also doesn't record any data about the patient without explicit opt in.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the "taking your children" angle, sensationalism/speculation at this point in time.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd go so far as to say maybe "accuracy in question" is a better flair here.

              Thanks for looking into this and providing your opinion on the flair. According to the title of the thread, which is the exact wording of the article, this should not be flaired with anything. The other info about taking children from homes, we know that this was done in Haiti and we know that the same woman is now working with the Amber Alert system under a different name. You just can't make this stuff up. We, parents especially, should be concerned about anything the Clintons are involved with, and even more so when their tentacles have the chance to reach into our homes and have an iota of opportunity to fracture the family unit. I don't doubt that contact tracers will remove ALL children from homes, but say a couple tests negative for COVID, but little Johnny is crying about being hungry and the contact tracers knock on the door just as Mom is getting ready to start cooking dinner, but hasn't had the opportunity to start getting the pot boiling on the stove yet. Are the contact tracers going to contact authorities, so that CPS shows up the next day? Remember this video from a former CPS worker and his warning to parents about how 5 dirty dishes in the sink is justification for removing a child from their home.

             </p>
             <p>
              I say let this information be on the board without a flair and let people make up their own minds about the possible results that can stem from contact tracers and CPS. If I were a parent, I'd be figuring out a plan now just in case this information is accurate. After all, there's nothing wrong with being prepared for what could happen.

               Your little campaign to sow division and overthrow the subverse ownership is not something I support and moreover it really stands out now that I remember the time you really caught my attention. You've been making/supporting accusations of gatekeeping for months and here in this submission you call subversive users who accuse users/mods of murder, "friend".
              </p>
              <p>
               So no, I don't care for your speculation/sensationalism and heart-string pulling. I don't support you or your submission at all. I don't care for your "suspicions" about the ownership of this sub, given that you yourself are infinitely more suspicious (you even admit that this account you're using is an alt). I have my own line of inquiry which just so happens to have a bit of crossover with the company you raised here.

                My "campaign" is actually a defense to what is an unjustified flair, which you agreed and suggested a different flair should be used. You even stated that there is a connection between PIH and the Clintons, but now you're saying you don't support this thread? Make up your mind, brother. Is this important information or not? I've barely posted to this forum since I decided to create a new handle because I attracted the hatred of SBBH. I'm sure you remember the pizzagate mods and janitors who were also members of SBBH, no? The overlap of Pizzagate mods and SBBH was disturbing to me, so I've came to distrust the authority here. Seeing that most were gone, I thought things would be different here, but I see this isn't the case.

                    Downvoting a member into oblivion is how SBBH rolls to silence someone and infringe on their free speech on the Voat platform. Simply stated: You glow, bitch.

                    I stated a fact. SBBH members were mods and janitors here. There's nothing to misconstrue. The cancer that is SBBH was here acting as an authority. While it doesn't appear that they are still here in that capacity, it's obvious their spirit remains.

                       The one acting like SBBH, sniping from behind a sockpuppet, is you. I've never been a member of SBBH, and only commented there when they were spreading lies about Voat.

                         Every serious researcher on this board is concerned about sources, because we have a long history of dodgy accounts posting deceptive BS here to waste our time and discredit the mountain of real material we've accumulated on the corruption of the elite pedos. Here you are, mixing trash with stuff on PIH and Dahl, while attacking me. Almost like you work for them.

                          Everyone here is free to vet any source they want. After you flaired the thread, I maturely disagreed and posted a second source to quell your suspicions about the first source, but you were already on a determined rampage against me and my thread. While I and others have been digging on the info presented, you and others continue to chip away and resort to childish name calling. Keep at it though. You're only embarrassing yourself. The downvotes I'm getting are petty attempts at best. They are the equivalent at poking me in the eye simply because you have decided I'm not wanted here.

             I think you're jumping the gun. Roald Dahl's daughter is a founder of NIH and they are active in Haiti. Did you see my comment about Ophelia Dahl's sister? It still deserves more research. If more research is done and it leads to this being faulty information, by all means, you give it the disinfo flair.

               So you're more worried about a civil war than the fact that contact tracing might indeed result in CPS removing children from their homes? Hasn't Pizzagate research already determined that CPS is corrupt and have indeed removed children from their homes based on unfounded claims? Why are you here again, and acting as a moderator?

              What? I don't understand your issue. CPS being corrupt and globalists capitalizing on people's fear of it to incite civil war so they can justify more draconian measures can both be true at the same time. This looks to me like an attempt to pour gasoline on the fire, hence the call for very careful vetting of the material, and the flair.

               This is your attempt at justifying your baseless flair? You're a scary person who shouldn't be in a power position whatsoever. If children are being removed from homes for no good reason, I can't think of a better reason for a civil war. In retrospect, if you are afraid of a civil war breaking out because people don't want CPS stealing anymore children, you need to resign your O/M position and let someone else take the reigns who isn't allowing fear to control what they do, so valuable information isn't flaired incorrectly and minds won't be swayed before the person even opens the thread and is able to weigh the information themselves. I've been on this board a long time under a different handle and have witnessed the systematic destruction of good investigators and the covering up of relevant information due to power tripping mods who, on the surface, appear to fighting the good fight, but in reality are acting as gatekeepers to prevent groundbreaking information getting to the masses. If anyone is pouring gasoline on anything, it's you. If anything needs very careful vetting, it's your actions and intentions.

                 I'm not going to waste time looking into you nor am I going to bring up who I was in the past. You labeled this thread as possible disinfo, which caused me to have to defend it and bring up how mods have a tendency to knock valuable info for strange reasons. This sub is run like a weird member's only club. If you come here as a new member, prepare to be scrutinized no matter what you're presenting.

                 I'm actually still digging on information, so I don't have time to play your silly little games. The fact that you use derogatory terms such as retard and gay make you sound childish and unprofessional. Please grow up.

                 In the meantime, did you know that Roald Dahl thought it should be a criminal offense if parents didn't vaccine their children? How much do you want to bet that Ophelia feels the same way?

            Here is PIH's website:
            <a href="https://www.pihhealth.org/">
             https://www.pihhealth.org/
            </a>
            , and their focus in Haiti:
            <a href="https://www.pih.org/country/haiti">
             https://www.pih.org/country/haiti
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            PIH ~ Sure seems as though it would be pronounced as "pie" as in PIE, the pedophile information network. There are no coincidences, right?
