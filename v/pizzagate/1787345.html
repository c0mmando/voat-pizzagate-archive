<p>In the video, the Finders were caught when the strange combination of homeless-looking, disheveled boys and well-groomed adults was noted. For what it\'s worth, this photo was taken in the alley behind Comet Pizza, about a week after the &quot;shooting&quot;, on a school day, during school hours, when the restaurant was closed. The boys and man emerged from the back door of Comet, and when the man noticed the guy with the camera,  he shuffled the boys away quickly: <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CzMfLDfUkAA-nxW.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CzMfLDfUkAA-nxW.jpg</a></p>

<p>Many in alternative media are now denying that PizzaGate is a scandal. Some are calling it a &quot;psy-op.&quot; Meanwhile the MSM is calling it &quot;fake news.&quot; There is an extraordinary attack on this story now. I believe, as Christians, we should strive to protect children from any harm that could come to them. That is why I am investigating PizzaGate.</p>
<p>I believe history might be the best way of determining the truth about PizzaGate. While the MSM defends Comet Ping Pong, the pizzeria at the heart of the controversy with PIzzaGate, in 1987, they investigated and broke open a similar story about &quot;the Finders.&quot; The Finders were a group of men who operated a child trafficking network in Northern Washington D.C. In a U.S. Customs investigative report, I found that one of the addresses given as the headquarters of the Finders is approximately 2.5 miles away from Comet Ping Pong. It was at this location that investigators found several disturbing items including a large amount of diapers, children\'s clothing, and toys. They also found telex machines on the premise that were connected to other locations across the country and throughout the world. At the residence of the Finders, investigators met a Chinese national with a passport for the entire year of 1987. They also found telex communication between the Finders headquarters and a Chinese Embassy in Hong Kong. It appears the telex communication had to do with two children who were purchased with intended to be trafficked to a different location in the world.</p>
<p>Local police and investigations revealed a large amount of information that pointed to a scandal involving child trafficking and wanted to broaden their inquiry into the case, but the CIA stepped in and blocked them from doing so. The CIA claimed they had made the case an internal matter, which almost never happens unless something is classified and needs to be hidden from the public.</p>
<p>The Case of the Finders Cult broke open after 2 well-dressed men were found with 6 children in Florida. They claimed that they were going to Mexico, and were arrested. This is when authorities learned what was going on with the Finders. The group &quot;lived underground&quot; but owned properties above ground, throughout Washington D.C. Glover Park was one residence, but they also owned warehouses in Northwest Washington D.C. There was a conspiracy going on in the capitol of the U.S. with many people involved. The Finders were very well organized, well funded, very high tech, and had protection inside of the upper echelons of government (the CIA).</p>
<p>What happened to the Finders? The members who were detained for trafficking children were released. Despite overwhelming incriminating evidence, nothing happened to the Finders. From what we know, they continued to operate their trade without any repercussions or further arrests.</p>
<p>A comment on the MSM: The Washington Post and the New York Times have openly defended Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington after allegations were made that a child trafficking operation is being carried out there. Yet in 1987, the Washington Post and the New York Times, along with US News and World Report, wrote several pieces exposing the Finders cult. What changed in 30 years? The truth is that, because of the election and their ridiculous support for Hillary Clinton, the MSM has lost a huge amount of credibility. Discrediting Alt-Media is their only option. It won\'t work, however, and it will only accelerate their destruction.</p>

            They are running from the alley behind Comet, Bucks, Besta - and one of the kids IS MISSING A SHOE. That is why I am suspicious of your comment, though perhaps you just didn't look at the picture closely enough before weighing in?

             If you've ever had to take kids anywhere or direct them to do things, you know that you have to be enthusiastic when you're doing it. When I watched the video, it looks like he jogged ahead a little and was saying, "come on, guys." Not only that, we didn't see them exit the building. For all we know, he could've pulled a CNN.
            </p>
            <p>
             I guess the reason this video has been dismissed so many times before when you posted it was because these kids are running around doing little to no investigating going, "oh god, did you see that? That kid got in some car right after we talked to him. What are the chances?!" Maybe he was waiting on the ride the whole time... All we see in their conversation is, "Have you heard about that cpp thing?" "It's bullshit." If I lived nearby and probably ate there before and shit, it'd probably be
             <strong>
              very
             </strong>
             hard for me to believe too.

            I talked to the videographer. He was honest with me. He told me how they trolled us, and it was simply that they tried to make it seem like they explored a tunnel system connected to Comet by splicing footage and lying about where the tunnel (which was actually an ad hoc storage area) really was. I quizzed him hard, and he let his guard down completely. He had no reason to lie. He told me it was in fact very weird. When the camera guys went out behind comet to eat their pizza, they saw this little group come out of Comet and sort of huddle in the alley behind the restaurant, but the second the adult saw that this guy had a camera, he said something to the kids and they all shuffled off.
           </p>
           <p>
            If people doubt this is comet, they can easily check. If they doubt the kids came from comet, that doesn't make this any less weird. The whole comet area is weird, and full of CIA and pedo signs.

            Have you EVER seen a Hollywood or other staged act with even one, let alone 5 child actors that looked this real? Not only that, it's rare to even get this type of realism with the costume department. So it's impossible, absolutely impossible that anyone staged this scene. It is the most realistic look at what 5 trafficked boys would look like: possibly drugged, visibly emaciated, obviously not friends out having fun. The boys look a lot like the old photograph of the boys we've seen tied up and bound from the Franklin Scandal investigation, in some ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is just no way the guys could have staged this. It was a gift from God that this footage was captured. It was my red pill.

            You appear to have opened an account just to say this. I know that last time I posted this footage (from an old account), it got attacked more heavily than anything else before or since. So I expected this. In you opinion, these kids look dressed (and healthy enough) to go jogging?

              You know what I wrote it wrong ! Mismatched shoes. I can't play in slow motion. But I remember it was pointed out that one child wore mismatched shoes. Thanks for pointing that out.

               It can appear that way because the shoe is orange on the inside and grey on they outside.

               doesn't show it best but if you watch him walking you see it is a normal pair of shoes.

            Thanks V___Z.  I am glad to see that video didn't completely die on the vine.  I didn't think it was staged/faked necessarily.  I could go either way, but something seemed genuine about that video.  And yes, if that was the case, then it was 10X fucking weird to see some yuppie jogging with a pack of ragamuffins.

            What I believe we are looking at is the Reverse Underground Railroad.  It only makes sense.  In more rural areas they transport humans under the cover of agriculture.  Not so easy in DC.  And when you have the resources of the Federal government help you develop that infrastructure (think continuity of government, FEMA, etc.) for a minimum of 8 years and probably a lot longer.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if that infrastructure somehow gets them to a place like Mt. Weather, Greenbrier, etc.  Then agriculture just picks it up from there.  Secondary used market for well-used slave?  Disposal?  Rendering for disposal or consumption?
           </p>

            Out.  Looking forward to my breakfast : |

            The same can be said for cognitive dissonance.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you focus on discrediting everything about Pizzagate, you will begin to see the evidence for such everywhere.

           <p>
            I'm not saying that your explanation is not correct, just that there are a million other reasons for the guy to be with 5 boys.  How you can say that only you know the TRUTH is an equivalent logical fallacy that you attempt to condemn in your post.

            Agree...and why this forum is about way more than just a pizza shop in DC...who says finders were CIA?  That is likely...however...think on how out of it the FBI is...they had to have known about all these cases...and yet not one investigation...

            Much better post and I agree with you on the possible similarities between the 1987 Finder's and "Cometgate".

            James Alifantis is - or was - almost certainly the chief pedo pimp. I'm sure he gets his kids from many suppliers including the CIA. There was a surveillance video submitted here about a month ago with two guys goofing around behind Comet Pizza when they spotted a very nervous guy running off with about five young boys. Looked like a Finder with something for little Jimmy Comet.

              <p>
               Finders may be behind PRISM, via Booze Allen (the contracting firm Edward Snowden was working for), but not in 2007 as we are lead to believe. Not through the patriot act, as we are lead to believe. But in the 1980s, unconstitutionally
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, the investigation into The Finders was shut down. USCS, Washington DC police and FBI investigations halted - because it was handed over to the CIA as an "internal investigation". There's not a whole lot of ways to interpret that.

            That's the screenshot from the Comet underground tunnels video where those two guys walk around the parking lot, see those kids running, and even spot Alefantis getting out of his small green car.  Then they explore some underground room with old furniture.  I can't find the video anywhere I swear it was on youtube and now I can't find it.
