<p>Video Shows Angelina Jolie Describing Hollywood Illuminati Rituals</p>
<p>by Realities Watch · June 21, 2017</p>
<p>Video from 1999 describes satanic rituals</p>
<hr />
<p>Sorry about the amateur videography in the first few seconds. This vid has the least of that that I found. Angelina Jolie describes an occult ritual that she was involved in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1dBZxsmG3M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1dBZxsmG3M</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The video, which was filmed back in 1999, was part of secretly filmed footage in which caught Jolie seems to be talking about the Illuminati initiation she took part in as she tried to establish herself in Hollywood.</p>
<hr />
<p>YNW reports: Angelina describes in detail the gruesome ritual celebrities must go through to join the Order of the Illuminati. During the Illuminati ritual, you are tied up, raped, and tortured by other members. She compares the secret society rituals to S&amp;M, but claims there are differences.</p>
<hr />
<p>At times Angelina looks crazed and possessed while describing to her friends the experiences she had with the Illuminati Masonic secret society. She explains that she killed a snake as a sacrifice and was tattooed as part of the initiation ritual. It is well known that many Illuminati members get tattoos as part of the ceremony, as a way of sacrificing more blood to Satan.</p>
<hr />
<p>“My snake, I tried, I had to kill him,” Jolie said.</p>
<hr />
<p>It has long been claimed that Hollywood stars and other celebrities need to join the Luciferian secret society in order to establish their career in the cutthroat business and make it to the top, and in the secrets filmed video Angelina can be heard telling her friends that she has encouraged other celebrities to go through the initiation and join the Illuminati.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tape also reveals that Jolie showed a recording of an Illuminati rituals to one of her friends. Her friend, speaking in halting tones, describes viewing the footage, saying:</p>
<p>“I only saw that film that she [Angelina] bought over that night. People who are, like, darker… It’s great to be able to see everybody’s sexuality, but it’s so weird when you just… I have the most amazing compromising pictures of people.“</p>',

            When it first came out I too thought it was legit/wanted it to be so/ since I sent the link to others and had to recant.  I don't feel like looking it up for you.  But...buying into fake stories is just what is intended.  Keeps ppl from spending time looking into verifiable stories.  Now I verify stories before sending them out/and the amount of fake ones is pretty darn amazing.  I'm not saying any of this to upset you.  It's been a learning process for me also.

            It was months ago when this was debunked.  Why don't you search for it if interested.  Search debunked Angelina Jolie describing hollywood Illuminati rituals.  It's been debunked so many times will be easy to find.

            This has been debunked numerous times.  Granted she is into some weird satanic stuff but this is heavily edited/she is talking about BDSM.  Watch the full uncut version.

             @3:18 the camera is showing Jolie. Her mouth is not moving because it is "her friend" who is speaking - who is not in view of the camera. Just in case that was an honest mistake.

              It is definitely not her friend, it's the same voice as "Angelina" is using at the beginning. Also it's a bit of reverb on all the audio from the woman voice in the beginning as well as in the end, which is proof of a audio overlay.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the video I meant earlier which I had seen- another audio overlay.

               I spent awhile trying to search for the video being debunked, but didn't find anything. I disagree about the voice sounding the same, but that's just my opinion. Either way - hard to say for sure. Wouldn't surprise me if it's real, but it wouldn't surprise me if it is fake either. Guess only time will tell...
