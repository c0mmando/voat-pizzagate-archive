<p>This post is about a little girl that posed for Playboy at 11, and even the Spanish version of Penthouse! Penthouse is much worse. Her mother was an artist and loved to take photos of her nude daughter. This little girl had it much worse than Brooke Shields. </p>
<p>Ironically, the movie Pretty Baby, based on a character named Violet, was portrayed by a young Brooke Shields on Eva Ionesco. Brooke Shields was barely 13. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hugh Hefner passed away on September 27, but skeletons continue to spill out of the Playboy Mansion‘s closet. The man who was glorified as a sexual liberator stirred controversy when he allowed nude photos of Eva Ionesco to be published in Playboy magazine. Back then, Ionesco was only 11.
In recent years, Ionesco has displayed how those nude pictures impacted her childhood. Here’s how Eva Ionesco became the youngest and most controversial Playboy model of all time.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/838023a778/50694.jpeg">This was the perfect tweet</a> regarding Hugh Hefner\'s death. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eva Ionesco’s mother, the Romanian-French photographer, Irina Ionesco was infamous for her erotic photography. But Irina Ionesco’s most scandalizing work was sexualizing her own child in her portraits, the way she would do with her much older models. Ionesco found her daughter photogenic, and became her favorite model.</p>
<p>The photographs of Eva, now 47, were taken in the 1970s <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2250634/Eva-Ionesco-11-year-old-Playboy-star-sues-mother-Irina-Ionesco-taking-pornographic-photos-her.html">between the ages of 4 and 12 years old</a> by her photographer mother Irina.</p>
<p>Not only did Irina Ionesco take nude photographs of her daughter, but the famous nude photographer, Jacques Bourboulon also took pictures of 10-year-old Eva Ionesco in the nude. And at 11 years of age, Ionesco became the youngest model to ever pose nude for Playboy magazine.
She was featured in the October 1976 issue of the magazine’s Italian edition in a set of photos by Bourboulon. Her mother shot another set of nude pictorials which appeared in the Spanish edition of Penthouse in November 1978.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Irina Ionesco’s dysfunctional relationship with her daughter led her to lose custody of her children. So, Eva Ionesco was raised by the parents of celebrated footwear designer, Christian Louboutin.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, she has battled her mother in the courts for “emotional distress” as a result of her “stolen childhood.” She sued her mother for taking pornographic pictures of her as a child. And in 1998, French authorities confiscated hundreds of photographs of a nude Ionesco in sexually suggestive images from her mother’s apartment.</p>
<p>The movie Pretty Baby, based on a character named Violet, was portrayed by a young Brooke Shields on Eva Ionesco. Ironically, Brooke Shields was also a 10-year-old child model whose mother signed her on to be photographed for a nude photospread in the Playboy Press publication, Sugar and Spice.</p>

            That's horrible.  That's the problem with Comet, the parents bringing them there and luring them into the back rooms.  Now they have the fake sodomite parents raising kids and making lude jokes and suggestions to them constantly.

            This is incredibly sad. Those photos are all over the internet as I searched her name. Why are these horrid photos even allowed on Google? This poor child, her eyes are completely dead. Her mother was at this a very long time as u can see she’s from about 4 to early teen years. She made a movie about her relationship with her mother in about 2011. It would be interesting to watch because I highly suspect her mother was into the occult. Look at her tattoos and the images, they are very telling. I can’t imagine what this poor child had to go through behind the scenes. Christian Louboutin is the red shoe sole designer. U cannot tell me Roman Polanski didn’t do anything with her either. And the courts did not even side with Eva she was only given a monetary amount and no control of the photos, which are basically everywhere. This is so fucked up and sad. No childhood indeed. These people are beyond evil.

             Youtube was founded for the purpose of share nip pics from the Janet 'wardrobe malfunction'.  Google's ads from porn searches were a dark part of its founding/growth despite their do no evil phrase.

             I have a hard time believing the LAPD is going to start actually going after this shit, and after getting so close to actual hardcore proof of all the worst rumors (like, worst of the worst) they keep quiet, and don't raid his mansion upon his death.

            On one end of it, I could entertain the argument that ages of consent should reflect states of sexual maturation as opposed to arbitrary numbers - but she wasn't even pubescent by the looks of it.

             I totally disagree. Even if she were 13 and had reached puberty, she wouldn't be mentally mature enough to understand how that could affect her entire life. Just because someone's body develops, doesn't mean they are mentally mature. I had a few friends in 6th grade that had develop early and had big breasts.

              Mental maturity is a factor of sexual maturity; this is true even in the wild in terms of the capability to care for offspring.

              The bottom line is that different countries have different ages of consent. A 21 year old man dating a 16 year old might be counted as a paedofile in the US, but it's legal in Canada. Even way back in history, there was no such thing as adolescence. In many cultures as a female coming of age for bearing children some arrangement would be made and you'd be married off. Your early years were dedicated to readying you for being a mother and a wife.

              Who am I to say specifically what that magic number is? I would
              <strong>
               entertain
              </strong>
              a hypothetical argument that a young woman (say 16) could be sexually mature and sound of mind to the point where something like that is without a true ethical violation, in the same fashion that some 22 year olds might
              <em>
               not
              </em>
              be sexually mature / sound of mind. The magic number is a general rule (that differs by country) but a case by case analysis is still needed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Basically, if she looks and acts like an adult, it's passable. In this case it's not even in the grey fuzzy zone, this seems to be straight up for the appeal of paedofiles.

               Other cultures and throughout history, you are right, people may marry young and start having children young. That is a lot different than having photographs taken of your naked body because your mom signs a contract and allows your photos to be shared with the world.

              Hippies and flower children made public nudity more acceptable even for children in parts of the world. Selfish parents saw their kids as paychecks and responded to offers of family photographs, or siblings only shots. Increasingly the photos were less and less innocent.

              Today we don't like to think of adult relatives as pimps and madams. Yes they still exist even outside of Hollywood.

             would you send your kids to a school they don't want to go to, to learn subjects they don't want to learn, through methods they don't want to learn with, so that they can get a decent paying job in the future? if so, you are just as big of a monster.

              Well considering how you have submitted 52 posts to the younglady sub that is considered adult content and not safe for work, I can understand why your sick ass would think that way. You sound like a fool. Your comparison makes no sense pervert.

               people are forcing X onto children instead of Y. that is how i look at things. i use letters to represent things and then look again. when the letters are pertinent then i look at what those pertinent things break down into using letters. so for instance schools break down into "teaching subject of knowledge X over subject of knowledge Y" or instead perhaps "preparing for future employment in X over future employment in Y".
              </p>
              <p>
               in this manner i remove emotional attachment, and i look at the cold hard truth. the cold hard truth is that our society is dysfunctional. the public school systems prepare children to be functional cogs of a dysfunctional system. it does it in a way that the children do not want to experience. this is literally no better than any other method of preparing them to be functional within a dysfunctional system.

                There is a difference between forcing a vaccine on a kid and forcing sex on a kid. One of them is for the kid's wellbeing and the well-being of other kids. The other is for your satisfaction at the cost to the kid.

                I bet you lurk around your community leering at the underage girls you want to molest, greycloud. You probably secretly take their pictures. I wish your local law enforcement would bait you into a sting operation and put you in a jail cell with big brotha that hates pedophiles.

                    Do you look at pictures of underage people? Do you post them on voat or share underage peoples images? Do you look at child pornography? Since you think the way you do, it would make sense that you like to see it.

                     i like pictures that are not deemed child pornography by the US court system. i am smart enough to know the difference. despite your objections, the original pictures posted by OP on this page even when not censored are still legal.

                       nope, saving it, or passing it on is against the law. looking for it can be against the law. a lot of nudity is purely legal no matter what your particular opinions are on that. if you run across something illegal mixed in with legal pictures, just don't save it. if that wasn't the case than a lot of you pizzagaters would be in deep shit.

                      Assuming that maybe it happened from a dox, doesn't that give you a clue that your style of thinking is detrimental the healthy environment children need to grow up in free from sexual persuasion of adults with sex on their mind?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And don't bother to go into the X vs Y theories and all your other perceived abominations against children that do not apply to persuading children to think sex with adults is cool because its not comparable. We are talking about children who don't have mature adult minds yet, and no they don't have those mature minds at 15 or 17 years old.

                       imagine that i was in pakistan for a second. i am not very religious and i certainly don't uphold islamic values. what happens if i get doxxed their? just because the culture believes something doesn't mean they are right. of course children don't have adult minds. adults don't have children's minds. should that mean that adults can't consent to sex?

                         too young for what? also everyone is a child. by US legal standards everyone under 18 is a child, by biological standards everyone who is prepubescent is a child in the sense that they cannot have children of their own but that does not give them some magical pass where they were not born to other humans (and thus a child of those parents).

                           i don't touch them, i don't attempt to gain relationships with them, i don't take illicit pictures of them (legal or illegal). that is how i look at it legally. i have to stay within the laws of society, but it goes past the letters of the law and into the realm of social acceptance. i hope one day to marry a young girl. i find some very young girls (under 13) to be attractive, i find many more over 12 to be attractive. the age at which the highest percentage of girls/women are attractive is 16. biologically speaking almost all of them are adults by then. in most states they are legal by then (to have sex with), including the state i live in. i still don't pursue relationships with them even when they are legal because i believe that the narratives in society would harm them even if they were agreeable and i was as well.

                           people like you would talk them into feeling like a victim later on. people like you would undermine their own experiences. people like you would invalidate their own choices and you would poison their thoughts with your lies. in my opinion it is people like you who are the real problem. not necessarily you as a person. but rather the fact that you have a set of dogmatic beliefs that you will force on others.

                        Just proof that pedophilia cannot be cured and that you have to be locked up away from the rest of society so that you cannot harm children. Sorry but thats reality.

                Of course you remove emotion. That's what pervs do. That way they don't have to feel guilty for their victims. I'll use letters for you too...

                i agree with your assessment of society being dysfunctional and your criticism of the public school system, and i appreciate your attempt at logic, but not all 'letters' are equal.  making a kid learn algebra isn't the same as forcing them into child porn.

                   if it was a legal and viable path to success for her. but i don't think that is a reasonable path to becoming very rich anymore. brooke shields had a rare opportunity to become a star and i don't condemn her mother for doing so.
