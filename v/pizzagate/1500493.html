             I made a post about this being invite-only the other day
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1498757">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498757
             </a>
             there were many long-time users of Voat who came to comment on that thread - users who didn't normally post much or at all in Pizzagate. They were clearly trying to slide the thread and make people think this is great and wonderful. It's not. It is slowing our participation growth down badly. My thread the other day was deleted by phobos_mothership for being "bullshit" in his words. Voat is ridiculously compromised.

             Now 24 hours they have shutdown new registration, obviously now trying to block growth of pizzagate, given that it is the #1 usage on voat. Typically the hottest sub is
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/news">
              /v/news
             </a>
             with 150 users, while
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             can have 2,000+;
            </p>
            <p>
             IMHO most of the users on
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             are sleeping bots waiting to be activated by keyword's like 'jew,saudi,israel,aipac,kline', go ahead experiment with throwaway OP or comments and see how quick you can activate a hoard of bots. Another interesting thing is that highest BOT activity occurs when the MODS are active, prior the BOTS seem to flood the 'anti-semitic' bile, then the MODS use that as pretext to delete anything that talks of Israel or Saudi being linked to PizzaGate. It appears that Amalek is a useful tool of the IDF-Hasbara.

             It's now been CLOSED for 24 hours, here's the meat of the discussion 24 hours ago that was deleted by the MOD's, they think that users are idiots to hide this shit.
            </p>

             Don't worry they just do it for 8+ hours, next time they free it up make yourself a dozen throwaway's and quit talking like a butt-hurt reddit cuck
            </p>
            <p>
             A few days ago they shut it down for 12 hours, problem is the BOTS are DOSing their server so they have to stop this shit, the

             I already have more than a dozen throwaways! But sometimes you just need to make another. Anyways, I am just pointing this out for everyone because I am sure not many people know that this happens here (I wasn't here when they shut it down for 12 hours) Let's see how long they close the registration for... hopefully not for long.

             please explain why the fuck you need 12 or more throwaway accounts...

             It appears that they slam the door long enough to ID IP's to block on the incoming router, and change the code.
            </p>
            <p>
             U see that the robot-shills that do this "Ignore
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/xxx">
              @xxx
             </a>
             CTR Shill" shit come &amp; go, mostly bot's, you can tell because their comments never have context, only generalizations.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have not yet seen an registration get shutdown more than 12 hours, tends to happen at high load time around 6pm PST,
            </p>
            <p>
             IMHO they should require the google 'human test' for downvoats that would stop the down-voat bot brigade.
            </p>
            <p>
             The biggest problem is these sliders that come in on every OP and make a shill-bot comment, and then later on the bot-brigade slides that to the top ( with upvoats ) of the OP, then the bot-brigade down-voats the actual REAL GOOD Stuff and the entires OP become SHIT. They're doing that to all the posts here that talk about saudi, israel, kline, podesta,
            </p>
            <p>
             Obvious as well there should be a time limit on brigade down-voating on OP's when the BOT's downvoat like 10 down's per hour from a brigade the SW should b smart enough to mark these bots as bots.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thing I see is the new CTR-SHILL-IDF bots are created automatically by the 100's per day which is why we have 9,000 users, but only about 100 real humans on this site. When first born they go to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/whatever">
              /v/whatever
             </a>
             ( or equiv ) and say "OBAMA FAG", with a photo of 'O', that will get you 100 points in a day, then that bot is ready to come fuck

              I am glad you pulled up the old thread from last night. The particular mod that deleted it (phobos_mothership) has deleted a couple of my posts that were relevant and important to note (he always claims that they are irrelevant bullshit, when they are clearly important and should be allowed to stay up. ESPECIALLY when many users are engaging in discussion. I even made a post calling him out on this the last time he deleted one of my posts, and it became known that I was not the only one who has noticed his shill behavior.
             </p>
             <p>
              On my OP about the "invite-only" bullshit, there were several users who had accounts for ~1 year or more that came on to comment on my post, downvote, and insult (users who do not normally even post in Pizzagate, I might add). I also got mega downvoted fast. They definitely don't want it to be known that registration is turned off.  Notice that it has been way longer than "8 hours" - in fact, it's been almost 2.5 days at least since registration has been closed.
