<h1>Only deliver valuable submissions</h1>
<p>The more valuable your submission to the Pizzagate investigation, the more upvoats you can expect, thus the more likely your post will appear on “Hot” or “Top”, so it will be visible to more people which in turn can lead to more digging and even more findings – and to more redpilling!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This subverse has attracted thousands of new users lately, and only a small portion know all the details we have collected so far, so please create posts that also newcomers can understand and digest. Never assume that everybody knows what you already know and take for granted!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/new"> v/new</a> before you submit to see if your topic has already been posted lately. You actually hinder the cause when you submit posts that clutter up the subverse with identical messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often, a topic or URL has already been posted (and resolved) days, weeks or even months ago. To save you valuable time – and again to prevent the subverse from being cluttered with old information – do a search with your key words to find out (see “How to search Voat without the search bar?” below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Reminders” can be useful, but don’t overdo it. Make sure you explain why people should be reminded of a special topic right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adhere to the submission guidelines (“For Submitters”; to the right; if using a mobile, switch to desktop version). Repeated violations of our submission guidelines may result in a subverse ban (sadly, we have to do this quite often, see <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/about/bans/">banned users log</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In most cases, a “Discuss” post is much better and more effective than a “Share a link” post. We often have to delete link-posts because the user wasn’t able to provide an accurate description of the content in the title. By providing a link in a well-described discussion post, you help the case and save everyone a lot of time, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALL CAPS posts are a nuisance for most people, so better refrain from doing that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use logic, explain the why and how, and do this step by step. Structure your post as good as you can. Take people with you on your “journey of thoughts”. Tip: Start your post with “This will help the Pizzagate investigation because …”; if you find you have trouble ending this sentence, your post might better belong in one of our other subverses: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods">v/pizzagatemods</a> (for posts about moderation, meta concerns, the operation of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>, general discussion submissions; no sources required); <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">v/pizzagatewhatever</a> (for speculative posts and all other posts that lack supporting evidence required for <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> research posts); <a href="https://voat.co/v/AskPizzagte">v/AskPizzagte</a> (for posts asking questions for further research, lost evidence resources, best links to share, etc.); <a href="https://voat.co/v/PizzagateMemes">v/PizzagateMemes</a> (a breeding ground for viral content: for posts about how to spread the word about pizzagate and memes to do so)</p>

<h1>How to deal with shills, doxing, CP and other illegal content?</h1>
<p>Although at first glance, it may seem that we have a fair amount of moderators, quite naturally, we cannot spot all violations at any given time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you spot something that clearly violates our rules, feel free to report this by either pinging a mod (example: <a href="https://voat.co/user/nameofmoderator">@nameofmoderator</a>) or by sending a message to mod mail (make sure to include relevant links).</p>

<h1>“Why is the search bar not working?”</h1>
<p>Folks, we mods have no idea. We are not involved in the site development in any way and were just as surprised and irritated as you when the search bar vanished, then came back non-functioning. By the way, this is not something “Pizzagate only” – all Voat subverses have to deal with that.</p>
<p>We were able to find out, however, that the search bar uses quite a bit of site resources, and <a href="https://voat.co/user/PuttitOut">@PuttitOut</a> was doing some reviews of the depth/detail. We can only imagine that he is again or still doing this.</p>

<h1>Is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> being censored by mods?</h1>
<p>Time and again, Pizzagate moderators are accused of “censorship”, thus hindering free speech, a hallmark of Voat. Do Pizzagate mods hinder free speech? In one word: no.</p>
<p>Our job is to enforce the submission guidelines. Moderators did not choose these rules – they were developed by the whole Pizzagate community through a series of stickies over several weeks: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1541871">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1541871</a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://voat.co/help/faq">Voat User Agreement</a>, removing posts that fail to satisfy the submission guidelines is not censorship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I submit links to any subverse I want?</p>
<p>Each subverse has its own rules which are usually stated in the respective subverse\'s sidebar. If you ignore said rules, your account may be banned from submitting further content to the subverse or in some cases, globally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can happen, though, that we remove valuable, legit posts, usually because the user did not explain how something is related to Pizzagate. Many users assume the connection is obvious, but it is simply not possible for us mods to see every connection, much less to comb through long articles or listen to videos. Should you find a legit post in the removed submissions area, please ping the mod who removed and tell them why you think this was a mistake.</p>
<p>However, moderating is not a science. If it were, there would be no need for moderators because a computer could do that. Moderating is done by humans, and the submission guidelines are open to a certain degree of interpretation. Bear with us, we are doing what we can.</p>
<h1>“Where the f*** are the mods???” (What mods can and can’t do)</h1>
<p>We moderators do not own the subverse, and we don’t have any admin rights whatsoever. All we do is trying to take care that users adhere to the submission guidelines – as fairly and consistently as possible.</p>
<p>Mods are not supposed to delete posts because of quality issues. As long as a post doesn’t violate a rule, it has to stay.</p>
<p>Mods are also not supposed to delete comments, but there are a few exceptions (illegal content like threats or child porn, personal information about Voat subscribers).</p>
<p>We are all volunteers, moderating in our free time. Some of us are working nights, others get up early when it’s still dark outside. Needless to say, we all have a job and a family. Moderating this subverse means an additional workload for each one of us. We often get attacked with shill and spam attacks coming in so fast and in such great numbers that we cannot type and click fast enough. So if you ever find that your post was deleted, while another one was left up, one possible explanation is that it simply slipped us – we cannot always cover 24 hours.</p>
<h1>&quot;Why is this the sticky and not the Executive Summary?”</h1>
<p>As many of you have learned and experienced during the past days and weeks, this subverse has been under attack from shills and spammers, thus making the subverse look like a mess at times. With this sticky, we hope to clarify important issues.</p>
<p>For the time of this post being the sticky, you can access the Executive Summary <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1497611">here </a>as well as in the section “For Newcomers”, where it is most useful.</p>
<h3>Keep up the great work, folks. And don’t let the shills divide us.</h3>',

          <p>
           We moderators do not own the subverse, and we don’t have any admin rights whatsoever. All we do is trying to take care that users adhere to the submission guidelines – as fairly and consistently as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mods are not supposed to delete posts because of quality issues. As long as a post doesn’t violate a rule, it has to stay.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mods are also not supposed to delete comments, but there are a few exceptions (illegal content like threats or child porn, personal information about Voat subscribers).
          </p>
          <p>
           We are all volunteers, moderating in our free time. Some of us are working nights, others get up early when it’s still dark outside. Needless to say, we all have a job and a family. Moderating this subverse means an additional workload for each one of us. We often get attacked with shill and spam attacks coming in so fast and in such great numbers that we cannot type and click fast enough. So if you ever find that your post was deleted, while another one was left up, one possible explanation is that it simply slipped us – we cannot always cover 24 hours.
          </p>
          <h1>
           "Why is this the sticky and not the Executive Summary?”
          </h1>
          <p>
           As many of you have learned and experienced during the past days and weeks, this subverse has been under attack from shills and spammers, thus making the subverse look like a mess at times. With this sticky, we hope to clarify important issues.
          </p>
          <p>
           For the time of this post being the sticky, you can access the Executive Summary
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1497611">
            here
           </a>
           as well as in the section “For Newcomers”, where it is most useful.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Keep up the great work, folks. And don’t let the shills divide us.

            Pizzagatebot: I get very good results when I Google a topic followed by the term pizzagate. I'm not seeing any censorship. I pick up pizzagate posts and then some. Is it because I'm using other terms first then typing the word pizzagate as the very last term? Anyway, I get more info than I can possibly digest so I'm happy. And I agree that Duck Duck Go is even better.

              Hey, thanks. That's odd- I scrolled through all of them just now, or so I thought, and was surprisingly unable to locate it. Thank you for getting back to me. If I may, do you intend to return the executive summary to the top of the feed at some point in the near future?

            can happen, though, that we remove valuable, legit posts, usually because the user did not explain how something is related to Pizzagate. Many users assume the connection is obvious, but it is simply not possible for us mods to see every connection, much less to comb through long articles or listen to videos. Should you find a legit post in the removed submissions area, please ping the mod who removed and tell them why you think this was a mistake.
           </p>

            Is that supposed to be plausible deniability you fags? How bout if a mod is so ignorant as to not know someone's conne tion to PG maybe his faggot ass should search the PG wiki instead of deleting first.  Fuck this sticky you're not fooling Nyone.

             Make a meshnet and do research in your own hometown. Then just spill huge dumps onto 8ch.pl and voat.co so that it can't be censored because its size and cohesiveness attracts too many intelligent readers.

            This makes me feel better about the other day. If anything, you should've just deleted the post and linked here/reposted this and stickied this. This looks much better than, "hey guys, this is how you get around the rules."
           </p>
           <p>
            For future reference, there's a difference between, "we can see this post doesn't follow the rules, but we're willing to make an exception" which will cause complaints from people like me, and "I'm going to make this sticky post as a mod of the subverse so that we can have these meta discussions without people being upset that new accounts are coming here and enticing other users to circumvent the rules."
           </p>
           <p>
            This makes me feel a little bit better, although I think you guys handled the other situation pretty damn poorly.

              Oh, I'm probably not being fair. In your guys' free time, you probably hang out with your kids and manage mortgages and shit. I actually have free time to sit here and do this, and I get it's unfair of me to expect so much. But, there's not just one or two of you...

                But, I don't know. I suppose I've tried to do that before, but I gave up and just reverted back to calling people out and alarming the mods.
               </p>
               <p>
                Like I said a while back, I never came here with the intent to micromanage. I never wanted to do that.

               As explained in the sticky, even with the mods we have, it is not always possible to cover 24 hours. When I joined as a mod, I had no idea how exhausting this could be.

            Longtime lurker here. Excellent piece of work, made me finally become a little active here. If people seriously want to help the cause, they should put in every effort to do what this sticky suggests. The only thing I don't understand is why this post doesn't get more upvoats and is not commented upon more. Should be a fantastic opportunity to chime in with comments and suggestions and I will do that in due course.

            An observation - there is some kind of impenetrable wall, stronger than any Trump fever dream, between the site developers (haves) and the mods (border patrols), and us (have-nots).  It's as if we are all supposed to accept as some natural law that "The developers are literally locked away in a tower of ivory on the moon's far side, and no communication may occur."  Are they tripping inside "The Neverending Story"?    It is my humble opinion that the mods should ask for more transparency from developers, because this place feels like it is run by techs who refuse to pause and see how their decisions from on high about stickys and gadgets affect the hoi polloi.

            Thank you for all the helpful information.
 I'd like to add that when editing a post, after Edit add the edit date to help with time line research, i.e.Edit (m/d/y).
Can the save post function be incorporated in some way to assist in finding previous posts beyond saving on individual poster's accounts?
This in reference to none of the search functions working. Maybe a subverse of saved posts?

            Thank you, thank you, thank you. This was most helpful. I am a senior citizen and like Pres. Trump and Hillary, I am sorely lacking in computer skills. This stuff does not come to me intuitively. I spent many years in the 1970s sueing state agencies on behalf of foster kids. This was the exciting era of childrens rights. Thus I very much wanted to jump on board here. When the computer age came upon us, many professionals simply relied on our secretaries to master these new skills. So I appreciate your tips and I have one for you: You can simply Google a topic plus the word pizzagate and  get a list of postings when your own in-house search engine is down.. Thanks again.

             The problem with Google is that it's
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1580566">
              known to censor this topic
             </a>
             . DuckDuckGo is a similar search engine, but they don't seem to censor Pizzagate, and they're also pro-privacy.

              Google has censored a single link and that is voat.co/v/pizzagate/, so it is completely irrelevant in terms of using google to search
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               /v/pizzagate
              </a>
              . It literally says it censored a single link in the DMCA description
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In response to a complaint we received under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
               <strong>
                we have removed 1 result(s)
               </strong>
               from this page. If you wish, you may read the DMCA complaint that caused the removal(s) at LumenDatabase.org.

             <p>
              I'd be the first to notice if google was doing any deep level of cenorship. Right now, the search results for pizzagate are more reasonable than usual

              I've personally seen a click-bot docker farm in the size of 200k bots, they are used to manipulate search results and is a part of black hat SEO. You can rent them out like any other bot herd.

              Non-technical users seem to have blown that whole thing out of proportion, hilarious at first and then obnoxious, but whatever -

               Thanks for the clarification. I will still say it's a better bet to use another search engine (for this and in general), since Google as a company has been observed to censor content not only in their search results but on their other services like YouTube and Google News as well, and they've made it obvious that they don't particularly care about free speech on the internet, or your privacy. They also appear to work closely with the NSA, facilitating mass surveillance.

             I recenty reported this to the mod team already
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1785728/8745381">

             - Let's do what we can. How much control you have over the sidebar? For example adding
             <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Avoat.co%2Fv%2Fpizzagate&amp;t=ffcm&amp;ia=web">
              this link
             </a>
             below the search box might work as a nice quick fix, with something like "If the search doesn't work, this one should"

            Sorry for introducing some journalism, as I really don't want to disregard one bit of this great job. However, I found some details to make it even a better one, my version is introduced in the pizzagatemods sub:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1785728">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1785728
