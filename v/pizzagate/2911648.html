<p>COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - Newly released documents have revealed that one of the many Jesuit priests who have been credibly accused of sexually abusing children spent time in Columbia.</p>
<p>In all, 42 men have been credibly accused of child sex abuse spanning decades all around the country.</p>
<p>Officials with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston say Father Francis Landwermeyer served as principal of Cardinal Newman high school in the 1988 and 1989 as well as the 1989 and 1990 school years.</p>
<p>In a statement to WIS the Diocese of Charleston said: </p>
<p>“To the best of our knowledge, there is no record of any allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor made against Father Landwermeyer while he was assigned at St. Thomas the Apostle or at Cardinal Newman School.”</p>
<p>Officials are asking for potential victims to come forward.</p>
<p>Father Landwemeyer passed away earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Charleston said they will release their own list of priests credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors, dating back to the 1950′s. </p>
<p>We expect to receive the list by February.</p>

<p>There were 428 arrests over the weekend at Nocturnal Wonderland, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff\'s Department.</p>
<p>The legions of ravers booked at the event included those taken into custody for alleged offenses including being under 18, possessing drugs, selling drugs, assault, battery and indecent exposure.</p>
<p>More than 18,000 electronic music fans packed a local amphitheater on Friday for the first night of the festival. Crowds swelled to more than 22,000 for Saturday and Sunday performances by acts such as Bassnectar and Chromeo.</p>

            Colombia is considered a third-world country.
 Colombia has both absolute and relative poverty. Lack of education affects their poor.

            It is much easier to take advantage of you.  The Church goes there to spread the world but they rape the kids and get away with it..!.

             Totally agree.  They can hide it even better than here.  I believe the reason they get priests from there is because parents and their Children here have been warned and no longer want to joing the priesthood  Those joining now I believe are the ones that want to hide their gayness and have access to Our Children.  Sick.

            . Praying for the dead among the dead is very ancient tradition dating all the way back to the time of the Apostles, when the first Christians in Rome would gather in the necropolis just outside the city where the bones of St. Peter and St. Paul were interred to say Mass. There's still

             Wow.  Thanks for the history lesson.  I still get creepy vibes from catacombs though.  Reminds me too much of tunnels we have researched on here.  If I ever made it there I would be left behind on that tour.

              I visited the Catacombs of San Sebastiano in Rome. All the bones were long since gone from the areas we were allowed to walk, but you could smell the dead. It was not underground during the first century -- that happened later. It was one of the most interesting things we saw in Rome (which has a great many interesting things to see).

              Back in the gnostic roots of christianity, before it was co-opted by the Roman State, they were considered a dangerous cult and had to worship in secret. Worshipping in the necropolis is also likely because they did not believe in cremation and had to hold masses in public spaces, so they probably got more privacy there.
