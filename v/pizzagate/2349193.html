            Pizzagaters should use the FISA memo like a backpack or a Trojan Horse. D.C. wants us to focus on their drama. If pizzagate uses the FISA memo situation like a backpack, and stuff the backpack full of pedophilia information, pizzagate can ride the wave. With every Tweet about FISA inject pedophilia into it as well. If we keep doing that we can take advantage of their drama in D.C. Infect their drama with pedo information like a virus!

             has been sucked into the swamp of fake D.C. drama and will probably remain stuck there unfortunately. I kept warning this would happen and I pleaded for people not to fall for this to no avail. D.C. is a Jesuit drama theater. People do not understand who the Jesuits are and how clever they are. They invented the Magic Lantern which eventually went on to become the Hollywood film projector. Their partners in crime, the fake jew Khazars, are also crafty. Our politicians are stage actors. Trump had his own reality TV show for fucks sake. He has a Jesuit education too.
            </p>

             I highly recommend Walter Veith for people that want to understand Jesuits. Walter has a lot of good videos. Jesuits practically invented the art of drama, theater, and acting.

                So which is it ESOTERIC? Pizzagate is "fake D.C. drama" or a "Trojan Horse?"
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               The D.C. message is always manufactured drama for our entertainment. Pizzagate can use their drama as a Trojan Horse. If D.C. wants to contaminate the airwaves with all their manufactured drama we can attach the pizzagate message to it and make it harmful to them and beneficial to us. Its not rocket science. One FISA hashtag and attach two or three pedo hash tags with it. We infect their drama with our message and turn their drama into our own Trojan Horse we use against them.

               They just want us to stay between those two lines because they control both. In my opinion the answer is NEITHER which collapses their false paradigm. Their paradigm promotes infighting and it is intentional. Look what it has done to this sub. Left vs. Right pits us against each other on purpose.

                 My definition is simple. Pizzagate is an effort to get the truth out about a pedophile child trafficking ring that operates from within the highest levels of power that has tentacles all the way down to our own neighborhoods through Child Protective Services, corrupt local judges, medical, law enforcement, etc....

                Exactly. By taking ownership of their manufactured distractions (in this case the gov't shutdown and the FISA memo) we take their lemons (their attempt to distract us from Pizzagate) and turn it into lemonaide (raise awareness among the normies that Pizzagate is real). This is a smart strategy, and similar to how Twitter followers get around shadow bans by adding hashtags that point to celebrities.

            Trump's strength is the military- especially for using a military tribunal to lock up "you know who". Two House Republican's, loyal to Trump went on Hannity last night to push for PUBLIC release of all memos and supporting documents exposing Clinton cabal involvement in Uranium 1 and attempted coup using Clinton generated/funded "dossier" to illegally UNMASK candidate Trump. I think shutdown is last ditch effort by Schumer to prevent this.
Trump still has the upper hand as he will play it as Dems support ILLEGALS over U.S. military/citizens and their paycheck.
CALL ALL SENATORS AND TELL THEM HOW UNHAPPY YOU ARE WITH THIS OUTCOME!

             "THE ANTHONY WEINER/CHUCK SCHUMER CONNECTION
We know that Crooked Meemaw was mentored by none other than Sen. Robert Byrd (D-KKK).
            </p>
            <p>
             We've seen how she turned out. Crooked, corrupt.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also wise to remember that Anthony Weiner was mentored by none other than Chuck Schumer.
            </p>
            <p>
             What happened during Weiner's time with Schumer? How much of an influence did Schumer have on Weiner in his personal life?
            </p>
            <p>
             And, given that Weiner is in some very serious legal trouble, Fred advocates a look-see into whether Chuck Schumer is, or has been connected in any way with Weiner's illegal activites. We're they in touch? What did Schumer know about all of this, and when did he know it? Did he or his people try to obstruct any investigation?
            </p>
            <p>
             America deserves the unvarnished truth about any and all activites between these 2."

             "Recall that six weeks ago U.S. District Judge Denise Louise Cote had sentenced the disgraced 53-year-old former congressman to imprisonment for 21 to 27 months. Facing a draconian ten-year sentence if convicted (Of what? “Felony multiple ‘sexting’ with an underage female”?), the once glib poster boy for progressive Democrats plea-bargained guilty to one count of transferring obscene material to a minor, a “heinous crime,” so reported the New York Post. At his sentencing, Weiner did not stop crying until the courtroom emptied."
"How far has Weiner fallen? After working for then Congressman Chuck Schumer for six years, Weiner in 1992, in classic Democrat identity politics, won a “Jewish” city council seat on New York’s bloated (51 seat) city council, partly by smearing his main opponent, also Jewish, as aligning somehow with supposedly anti-Semitic African Americans. Six years later, when Schumer ran for Senate in 1998, Weiner was elected to Schumer’s congressional seat, and then reelected repeatedly, and overwhelmingly. But even the liberal media would later criticize the volatile Weiner for yelling and even throwing furniture at his understandably high turnover staff. A demagogue, he criticized UN diplomats for not paying parking tickets but used congressional privilege to similarly stiff the city of more than $2000."

             "It was reported today that Chuck Schumer pulled Visa strings so a CHILD MOLESTER could get into America! 
Fox News:
“A snowshoe racer from (muslim area) India whose entry into the U.S. to compete was made possible by Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer was being held Friday in a New York jail on a sex charge.
            </p>
            <p>
             The U.S. embassy in New Delhi last month rejected Tanveer Hussain’s application for a visa so he could compete in the World Snowshoe Championship in upstate. Local officials then intervened on Hussain’s behalf, appealing for help to the offices of Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. Their offices reached out to the New Delhi embassy, which allowed Hussain to reapply for a visa and granted that visa.”

            Sen. Jeff Flake was standing in a giant scrum with Sen. Chuck Schumer. He turned around and pointed at a senator and Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, a well-known deal maker, came over immediately. Then, Schumer and Alexander walked off the floor together into the Democratic cloakroom.

That is, I come for the comments, and stay for the commentary.
