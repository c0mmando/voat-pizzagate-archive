<p>However, the <em>players</em> involved in this episode of the Pizzagate saga seem to be just as interesting as the exchange that happened that day on the island of <strong>Martha\'s Vineyard</strong> off the coast of Massachusetts. Each and every one of them has had a massive impact on the socio-economic and political scene historically and currently but none of those characters are as interesting as <strong>Herb and Marion Sandler</strong> as illustrated by this <strong>Saturday Night Live</strong> skit that aired in <strong>October of 2008</strong> that was heavily redacted and censored after it\'s original airing:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/PulledSnlBankBailoutSkit">https://archive.org/details/PulledSnlBankBailoutSkit</a></p>
<p>This skit happens to blow the LID off of Pizzagate in the sense that in connects <strong>The Sandler Clan, George Soros, Nancy Pelosi, Barney Frank, and of course the Clinton Foundation</strong>, among other major campaign contributors, not only to <strong>Pizzagate</strong>, but to the <strong>Franklin Scandal</strong> as well, intimately. You will also find that these connections take it all the way, currently, to the top... as in to the <strong>POTUS, Donald Trump</strong>.</p>
<p>Before I delve into the Sandler Foundation to find some interesting links, let me point out to you by the above Saturday Night Live skit the running innuendo that is present and from what we have come to find out about these <em>\'influence rackets\'</em> run by Hillary Clinton and her team. The video suggests that there was some kind of COLLUSION on the part of <strong>Barney Frank</strong> and his oversight committee on these subprime mortgages and The Sandler\'s during the late 90\'s housing bubble crash. What Saturday Night Live could not say or did not know at the time was that Barney Frank had been \'under the influence\' of his predilections with young DC \'rent boys\' - THAT, ladies and gentleman, says it all - along with the unmentionable fact that Barney Frank was implicated by <strong>Paul Bonacci of the Franklin Scandal</strong> and stated that he had access to the White House living quarters . </p>

<p>What I stumbled on by that revelation will shock you , but not before I show you this picture connecting Barney Frank which is alarming enough, of the Franklin Scandal, of <strong>David Brock and Barney Frank, together, at the Rehoboth Beach LGBTQ \'retreat\' in Delaware:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.camprehoboth.com/letters/2000/july-28-2000-campshots">http://www.camprehoboth.com/letters/2000/july-28-2000-campshots</a></p>
<p>Yes, the page conveniently named \'campshots\' with it\'s pretty red heart and rainbow logo, located beautifully on the beaches near one of the worst pedophiles ever to be convicted in US history:</p>

<p><strong>Herb and Marion Sandler</strong> are two of the <strong>principal architects</strong> of a housing market crash that has made lasting marks that are still effecting people to this day:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Herb and Marion Sandler made billions of dollars in the mortgage business they sold, and many observers across the political spectrum have noted the harmful role they played in the housing meltdown. Yet their philanthropic efforts, tilted heavily to the far left, have helped them maintain respectability even among those who criticize non-leftist financiers They were the first to push an exotic mortgage product called the “option ARM” (Adjustable Rate Mortgage). It was, as some critics put it, a weapon of mass financial destruction..&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>“</em><em>This product is the most destructive financial weapon ever deployed against the American middle class,</em><em>” housing lawyer William Purdy told the New York Times. In 2006, when Wachovia was fooled into purchasing Golden West Financial Corp., the parent of the Sandlers’ World Savings Bank, that lending institution held $122 billion in ARMs.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The $2.4 billion the Sandlers pocketed turned them into royalty in the left-wing activist community. They gave about half of their profits to the Sandler Foundation. <strong>“Thanks to the Sandlers, Wachovia’s loss is the American Left’s gain</strong>,” reporter John J. Miller noted (National Review, Nov. 17, 2008).</p>
<p>The Sandler\'s, now, after bilking the American public out of BILLIONS of dollars, are now making the American people PAY ONCE AGAIN through their foundations, and are KEY in understanding where all of the &quot;NEW\' and &quot;Progressive&quot; leftist (immoral and licentious pagan practices) policies that are destroying this country are being created and funded from, but you\'ll be even MORE SHOCKED to find out who is running these organizations.</p>
<p>&quot;The Sandlers also helped underwrite the creation of the <strong>Center for American Progress (CAP)</strong>, a liberal think tank “on steroids,” according to its founder, John Podesta.</p>
<p><strong>Archived The Sandler Foundation (from the Handkerchief email) logo can be made into a double heart</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1439957">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1439957</a></p>
<p>The Sandlers established the San Francisco-based <strong>Sandler Foundation</strong> in 1991. On its website, the foundation describes its mission as being “a catalyst to strengthen the progressive infrastructure, expose corruption and abuse, advocate for vulnerable and exploited people and environments, and advance scientific research in neglected areas.” As of the end of 2014, the Sandler Foundation had made charitable grants exceeding $700 million, with the majority of the funds distributed since 2006.</p>
<p>Legally, the foundation is not the same kind of entity one normally thinks of as a foundation. Places like the Ford and Rockefeller foundations are “private nonoperating foundations,” <strong>but the Sandler Foundation is a “type 1 supporting organization,” which puts it in the category of a 501©(3) public charity.</strong> The biggest practical difference this makes is the significantly higher limit on tax deductions that donors can claim if they funnel money into a supporting organization, rather than a private foundation. When the Sandlers were deciding how to finance their philanthropy, the difference between the two types of giving vehicles would have had a lot of zeroes in the number, and the couple chose the side that kept those zeroes in their favor, but that\'s not all, <strong>and not the only reason</strong>.</p>
<p>The law requires supporting organizations to name the organization supported. In the Sandlers’ case, it is the <strong>Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin and Sonoma Counties.</strong> <a href="https://capitalresearch.org/article/no-s...-the-left/">https://capitalresearch.org/article/no-s...-the-left/</a></p>
<p><strong>The Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco</strong>, <em>undoubtedly</em>, has affiliations and interrelations with the <strong><a href="http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-637028.html">Chabad Lubavitch Society at San Francisco</a></strong>. <a href="http://www.chabadsf.org/templates/articl...istory.htm">http://www.chabadsf.org/templates/articl...istory.htm</a></p>
<p>&quot;Basically, the Chabad Lubavitch Movement is connected with ... the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal">God Baal</a>..</p>

His art tastes are as big as his wallet, I wonder how interested he is in the styles of art like those of James Alefantis, Tony and John Podesta?&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sussman">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sussman</a></p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;I was a partner in a hedge fund owned by Donald Sussman one of Clinton\'s main backers in the election and the &quot;godfather of the hedge fund industry&quot;. I have vast amounts of information on fraudulent financial markets which are fronts for dollar payments between criminal groups. The figures we are talking about are billions of dollars PER DAY in transactions going through these markets. The markets are operated by the Crown. I need to get in touch with researchers who can use my information. Please can you get in touch if you want to discuss this info. I have plenty of documents proving what I have to say. I was gagged by the High Court of the UK from sharing this info but my current circumstances place me outside their jurisdiction.

           The $2.4 billion the Sandlers pocketed turned them into royalty in the left-wing activist community. They gave about half of their profits to the Sandler Foundation.
           <strong>
            “Thanks to the Sandlers, Wachovia’s loss is the American Left’s gain
           </strong>
           ,” reporter John J. Miller noted (National Review, Nov. 17, 2008).
          </p>
          <p>
           The Sandler's, now, after bilking the American public out of BILLIONS of dollars, are now making the American people PAY ONCE AGAIN through their foundations, and are KEY in understanding where all of the "NEW' and "Progressive" leftist (immoral and licentious pagan practices) policies that are destroying this country are being created and funded from, but you'll be even MORE SHOCKED to find out who is running these organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
           "The Sandlers also helped underwrite the creation of the
           <strong>
            Center for American Progress (CAP)
           </strong>
           , a liberal think tank “on steroids,” according to its founder, John Podesta.

           The Sandlers established the San Francisco-based
           <strong>
            Sandler Foundation
           </strong>
           in 1991. On its website, the foundation describes its mission as being “a catalyst to strengthen the progressive infrastructure, expose corruption and abuse, advocate for vulnerable and exploited people and environments, and advance scientific research in neglected areas.” As of the end of 2014, the Sandler Foundation had made charitable grants exceeding $700 million, with the majority of the funds distributed since 2006.
          </p>
          <p>
           Legally, the foundation is not the same kind of entity one normally thinks of as a foundation. Places like the Ford and Rockefeller foundations are “private nonoperating foundations,”
           <strong>
            but the Sandler Foundation is a “type 1 supporting organization,” which puts it in the category of a 501©(3) public charity.
           </strong>
           The biggest practical difference this makes is the significantly higher limit on tax deductions that donors can claim if they funnel money into a supporting organization, rather than a private foundation. When the Sandlers were deciding how to finance their philanthropy, the difference between the two types of giving vehicles would have had a lot of zeroes in the number, and the couple chose the side that kept those zeroes in their favor, but that's not all,
           <strong>
            and not the only reason
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           The law requires supporting organizations to name the organization supported. In the Sandlers’ case, it is the

            If you do genealogy and I'm guessing  (pardon if it's inaccurate)  that you're speaking to people who know what you're genealogy focus is about,  then I'd ask them if they'd like to use some of their excess time to research the Rothschilds, or use some  bonding time with her family to research them.
            <br/>
            From my tiny bit of research I discovered that
            <strong>
             All
            </strong>
            Israel/UK/USA  roads lead to the Rothschilds, with other sub groups of people in Germany and the west and east upholding their goals.    Rothschilds,   UK Prime Minister Benjamin D'Israeli is a good starting point.
            <br/>
            I'd really be interested in the connecting names she gathers  cause I am clueless about genealogy research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe it's time to use those skills to bust the liars of history open and connect them with their current group.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know for a fact that many Jews don't have a clue about this history any more than the western or easterners do.  If they are aware of it they do what  everybody else does and ignore because we've been taught to accept or ignore things as  an  okay part of life.
           </p>

            I love how all of a sudden everyone is 'hopping off the trump train'- like it was some kind of amusement park ride. These people had all the information they needed right from the beginning and they chose to ignore it. That Paul Joseph Watson disgusts me, making his declaration after him and his employer helped elect the asshole. And you Aangirfan, ignoring prime intel on big issues that just aren't going to go away. What, just because a bright red orangutan got elected to office you think that the big bad specter that is the Bush and Clinton cartels that are still running the show and never stopped just disappeared? But all of a sudden since Foghorn Leghorn usurped the presidency the entire political panopticon is Donald McRonald's fault. Isn't it easy to see that he has been placed in that situation? You, Aangirfan, have done an exemplary job exposing Mr. Trump and his family, yet you continue to wrap us all up in this partisan charade that we all know dissolved a century ago. The worst part is that you don't even realize that you're doing it, or... don't even realize we notice. THAT is becoming the prevailing denominator that is confirming a controlled oppositional aspect of your existence. All of us, after having all this information at our disposal, could have been doing so much more, but no, day after day I come here to see the exciting developments that have continued to amaze me from you year after year and for years now. But now, it seems you have given up. It seems that if it's not reported by the DailyFail you are not reporting on it. You seem to be continuing partially in the same vein yet I still get the feeling you are

            "The Daily Mail is a British daily tabloid newspaper. First published in 1896 by the Press Barons, Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, and his brother Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, it is the United Kingdom’s second biggest-selling daily newspaper after The Sun. The mass media newspaper owner Viscount Alfred Northcliffe veiled and covered things up for the British Empire. Lord Northcliffe’s private secretary was the gay spy, Scott Moncrieff. The Press Barons were related to the Rothschilds through marriage, owned a number of newspapers including The Times and the Daily Mail. Lord Northcliffe was a war monger linked to the cabal that started World War I. Beginning in 1913, Wellington House in London was at the centre of a plan to “create” and manufacturer public opinion. Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, installed Lord Northcliffe as the Wellington house director. The operational staff of Wellington House consisted of legendary British Empire mass population propagandist Lord Northcliffe, Arnold Toynbee, Walter Lippmann and

            Lord Northcliffe on Propaganda, 1918 – Propaganda, he wrote, should be “the pace-maker for policy, and should form opinion without opinion realizing that it is so being formed.” This was the first and principal maxim of the principle of “government by the consent of the governed”
           </p>
           <p>
            "In February 1918, Lord Northcliffe became the British Intelligence, Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. British Intelligence and Lord Northcliffe had what they called “Nationals” who were in charge of coordinating propaganda in other countries. “Nationals”, most likely knights, were appointed for France, Russia, Italy, United States, South America and other parts of the world. These “Nationals ” met together in conference twice a week to discuss the details of their campaign. In May 1920, Lord Northcliffe published an article in The Times about the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” The article was entitled “The Jewish Peril.” Wellington House became the Tavistock Institute in 1921. In 1921, Northcliffe suddenly became ill. He complained he was being poisoned, then died."

            "His Brother, Viscount Rothermer, took over the newspaper empire. Harold Harmsworth first a knight, then a baron, then a lord and then viscount"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Viscount Rothermere was a friend of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. He also glorified and rained down praise on the evil little Nazi genius, Josef Goebbels. Harmsworth was so wanting and desperate to be a part of Hitler’s inner circle of “The Thule Society (Thule-Gesellschaft) that he paid an Austrian princess that Hitler highly respected and adored to keep him informed and up to date with the Third Reich"

            "Stephanie Julianne von Hohenlohe (born Stephany Julienne Richter) was a Nazi super spy close to Hitler and SS- 1 Heinrich Himmler that took all his money. She was an Austrian princess by her marriage to the diplomat Prince Friedrich Franz von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfurst, a member of the princely Hohenlohe family."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Viscount Rothermere directed the Mail’s editorial stance towards Fascism and Nazism in the early 1930s. Rothermere’s 1933 leader “Youth Triumphant” praised the new Nazi regime’s accomplishments, and was subsequently used as propaganda by them."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sir Mosley was absolutely no global fascist and Nazi British joke to laugh about. Lord Rothermere and the Mail were also editorially sympathetic to Sir (British knight) Oswald Mosley and, the British Union of (Nazi) Fascists."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Rothermere wrote an article titled “Hurrah for the Blackshirts” in January 1934, praising Mosley for his “sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine“, and pointing out that: “Young men may join the British Union of Fascists by writing to the Headquarters, King’s Road, Chelsea, London, S.W.”

            Jonathan Harold Esmond Vere Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere is the current inheritor of a newspaper and media empire founded by his racist New World Order war mongering family and fascist-Nazi great-grandfather, Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere. Recently, 4th Viscount Rothermere was publicly charged with documentary notice from Britain’s Foreign Office intelligence files of his forebears and the Daily Mail’s secret ties, collaboration, and glorification of Fascism, Nazism, the Occult, Luciferianism and the SS.

            The same goes for you VOAT. This world is crumbling day by day right before our very eyes, very calculatively and very precisely. The blueprints, clues, and reasons have been there right in front of our eyes the entire time and we all continue to waffle. There are going to be similar times in the future where the same scenarios are going to play out. There is not going to be any 'End of the World' in any truest sense and some human beings are always going to survive a cataclysm made made or natural, this cycle has happened many times on this earth and it might not never stop, but this time we have right now is OUR TIME, and I don't see very many of you fighting very hard for what you believe in. There are several reasons for this however all of must choose to rise up the right ways and rise up now because the great wave of the elite's depopulation efforts are most likely about to reach another climatic head. Any one that happens to be awake has to as much as they can and do it now. They've already taken everything that was worth any value now anyway, so what does anyone have to lose?

The worst part is that you don't even realize that you're doing it, or... don't even realize we notice. THAT is becoming the prevailing denominator that is confirming a controlled oppositional aspect of your existence. All of us, after having all this information at our disposal, could have been doing so much more, but no, day after day I come here to see the exciting developments that have continued to amaze me from you year after year and for years now. But now, it seems you have given up. It seems that if it's not reported by the DailyFail you are not reporting on it. You seem to be continuing partially in the same vein yet I still get the feeling you are

            It's a long fun article about the "Palm Beach lifestyle", which HST explained later to David Letterman. Roxanne Pulitzer's long and publicized divorce trial attracted HST - it was the perfect story for gonzo. A&amp;E produced an "American Justice" special about the case (minus HST) in 1996, and Roxanne wrote her own book about the affair, The Prize Pulitzer in 1987. She also wrote other "fiction" titles afterwards - namely The Palm Beach Story.
HST actually met Roxanne during the trial and ended up at her house for dinner. A friend told her not to ever read the article, and allegedly she never has [* Pulitzer read the piece at the HST Homecoming in Louisville]. A picture of Roxanne laughing while HST wags his finger at her appears in When the Going Gets Weird by Peter O. Whitmer. The article caused a huge sensation and was trimmed for libel purposes. Needless to say, it sold like hotcakes, but unlike Whitmer, I'm inclined to think it's mostly because of the Star Wars cover.
Whitmer draws some interesting connections between the two, actually; Roxanne was at a party in Aspen where she was served a plate with "Happy Birthday Rox" spelled out in cocaine. Both are friends of Jimmy Buffett, and, according to Whitmer, Roxanne resembled a younger version of Hunter's ex-wife, Sandy (Whitmer, p265). HST had his own divorce behind him (probably he has not written more than twenty words on the subject; yet wrote fondly of Sandy).
Roxanne was married to Herbert (Peter) Pulitzer, but the relationship disintegrated...threats about child custody and outlandish spending soon turned into shocking relevations of overindulgence of the most curious kind - group sex, booze, drugs, and lesbianism. The most hilarious accusation was that Roxanne had "slept with a trumpet". HST told the Palm Beach Post, "We all sleep with trumpets. The real question is, is Peter Pulitzer jealous of the trumpet?" (Whitmer, p265).
Ever valiant and able to report honestly in such matters, HST joined the throngs of journalists who crowded for a spot in the court room. There was one closed-circuit TV for those who didn't make the 7 AM press deadline, and even then, inside the court resembled a sporting event, with bleacher seats. The spectators were
a rowdy mixture of everything from CBS-TV producers to lanky six-foot women with no bras and foreign accents who claimed to be from Der Spiegel and Paris Match. It was a lusty crowd, following the action intently, sometimes cheering, sometimes booing. It was like a crowd of stranger who came together each day in some musty public room to watch a TV soap opera like "General Hospital". On one afternoon, when Roxanne Pulitzer lost her temper at some particularly degenerate drift in the testimony, the bleachers erupted with shouting: "Go get 'em, Roxy! Kick ass! That's it, Rox baby! Don't let them talk that way about you!" (Thompson, 1990, p194).
The nut of the story is an old one, a "tale of Cinderella gone wrong". A young working-class woman marries the middle aged grandson of the famed publisher. He realizes that he has made a mistake; according to him, she was nothing but a gold-digger and an "incorrigible coke slut" and an unfit mother to boot. Allegedly she stayed up late and "humped almost everything she could get her hands on", including a French baker, a real-estate agent, "self employed handyman", her dope dealer and a "pansexual troilist" (Thompson, 1990, p194-195). But, HST finds out, "Roxanne Pulitzer is not a beautiful woman...she looks more like a jaded senior stewardess from Pam Am". Her secret is her "good-humored, out-front sexuality". She is "clearly a woman who likes to sleep late in the morning" (Thompson, 1990, p195).
As HST sits in on the trial and tries to find the real meaning, he discovers that these are his kind of people, who report spending $441, 000 on "miscellaneous and unknown" while the figure for the previous year was just $99, 000. HST figures that it was spent on cocaine, a "genuinely awesome rate of consumption - something like thirteen grams a day" which is enough "to kill a whole family of polar bears" (Thompson, 1990, p198).
The story swings back and forth between these two extremes: the trial, and the "Palm Beach Express".
Towards the end of the article, HST feels that he has become one with the community. Instead of "I" he uses "we", particularly to describe the role of police in the area:
"The police are no problem in Palm Beach. We own them and they know it. They work for us, like any other servant, and most of them seem to like it. When we run out of gas in this town, we call the police and they bring it, because it is boring to run out of gas. The rich have special problems, and running out of gas on Ocean Boulevard on the way to an orgy at six o'clock on Sunday morning is one of them. Nobody needs that. Not with naked women and huge bags of cocaine in the he car. The rich love music, and we don't want it interrupted.
.
.
.
"We don't pay these people much, but we pay them every week, and if they occasionally forget who really pays their salaries, we have ways of reminding them" (Thompson, 1990, p206).
The problem with the Pulitzers, HST concludes, is that they failed "to understand the nature of the Social Contract" (Thompson, 1990, p206) and should be banished from the West Coast. The Pulitzers are such people, who disturbed the residential community and caused much unwanted attention. HST circles back to the beginning nicely in this way. He describes Palm Beach as a residential community with no "jails or hospitals". It is an "elaborately protected colony for the seriously rich, a very small island and a very small world". In a way, it seems like HST's home in Woody Creek - "the rules are different here, or at least they seem to be, and the people like it that way" (Thompson, 1990, p191).
Palm Beach is a place where reality does not apply, "money is cheap" and there is no "place for Horatio Algers". HST has tapped into a raw form of free enterprise where "hard work and clean living will get you a bag of potato chips and a weekend job scraping scum off the hull of your neighbour's new Cigarette boat" (Thompson, 1990, p193).
Nakedness is also part of the scene, and HST finds himself in a red Chrysler convertible with naked lesbians on their way to an orgy.
Bestiality is another aspect of the lifestyle, because it is felt to be a victimless crime in Palm Beach, even though it is technically against the law. This is where the title comes from. First, HST meets a woman whose friend makes $50, 000 a year (tax-free) to screw dogs for rich people; then HST meets a bartender who feels like a "beast". He tells HST, "I see those s--t-eating grins on their faces and I feel like a dog took my place." This leads back to the final ending where HST decides that it is better to get involved with animals than people, "because they will never call the police on you or take you in front of a judge or run off and hide with your money...Animals don't hire lawyers" (Thompson, 1990, p206).p
HST spent a lot of time in the early eighties in depraved tropical places. Two other Palm Beach articles that were unpublished appear in Songs of the Doomed:
"Sugarloaf Key: Tales of the Swine People" (p207-221) - HST gets revenge on the owners of the Sugarloaf Lodge by placing a pig head in the toilet (extremely funny)
"The Silk Road" (p211-226) - this is a small novella where HST tackles fisheads and gets involved in a bar-room shoot out. As he states in the overview: "The Silk Road" is a story about people who got caught in the fast and violent undercurrents and, finally, the core of the action of the great Cuba-to-Key West Freedom Flotilla in the spring of 1980" Skinner and his "hired fiancee" appear. In the end, a man named Colonel Evans is murdered.

            "Lindenbaum and Fred C. Trump were clandestinely using ... state funds to build a ... Jewish power base in Brooklyn."
           </p>
           <p>
            Big Time NY Real Estate Super Tower Lawyers, Bunny Lindenbaum, and his son, Sandy Lindenbaum were high priests of the secret ultra orthodox Lubavitch Movement and the Educational Institute Oholei Torah, the Flagship school of Chabad – Lubavitch, it owns the BJC edifice.  Basically, the Chabad Lubavitch Movement is connected with the Ancient Babylonian Talmudic Pharisaic Universal Noahide Laws of Nimrodic God Baal. The Babylonian Talmudic High Priests of the Order of the Pharisaic sun god worshippers of Baal are known as the Mystical Hassidic Chabad Lubavitch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rabbi Louis Finkelstein, the head of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1943, writing in the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, “Pharisaism became Talmudism …the spirit of the ancient Pharisee survives unaltered. When the Jew studies the Talmud, he is actually repeating arguments used in the Palestinian academies.” [55] In other words, the Talmudic Lubavitchers are reborn Pharisees. Many Pharisees belonged to the Jewish occult group, the Satanic “Cabal“.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lindenbaum and Scandalous Fred C. were clandestinely using HUD and state funds to build a haven and Jewish power base in Brooklyn for eastern European Mystical Hassidic Chabad Lubavitch Jews at enormous and substantial profits at the taxpayers’ expense.

            Jared Kushner attended Chabad House at Harvard.  "Israel wasn't a political discussion for him; it was his family, his life, his people," said Hirschy Zarchi, rabbi at the Chabad House at Harvard.
           </p>
           <p>
            Between 2003 and 2013, his family foundation donated a total of $342,500 to various institutions and projects associated with the movement. Especially endowed was the Chabad center at Harvard University, which received $150,000 in 2007 (the foundation's single biggest donation to a Lubavitch-affiliated enterprise) and then another $3,600 in 2013.  In addition, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has donated $11,550 to three Chabad institutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2006, Kushner's father Charles was sentenced to 24 months in prison for making illegal campaign donations &amp; witness tampering.

            Lurking behind the “Democratic Facade” (the so-called “democratic” governments that the public sees as the guiding hands in our world), are the Occulted Powers (OPs). The OPs are a criminal conglomerate of the local royal families throughout the world who are intermarried and/or interoperating with the global network of Jewish bankster families. Under this worldwide royal/Jew “elite,” there are a variety of secret societies (such as the Freemasons) and criminal gangs (such as the Triads) who recruit useful “commoners” into their conspiracy and run societies at the street level.

             THE TWO NWOs
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The key to understanding the globalists’ strategy in implementing the New World Order is to understand that there are actually two NWOs: a Western-fronted decoy New World Order and a BRICS-fronted real New World Order. Once you understand how and why the globalists created them and played them against each other, all of the confusing information floating about the mainstream and alternative media will start making sense.

             Putin &amp; Trump Following End Times Blueprint?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            April 11, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Researcher David Livingstone believes the Illuminati Plan is to fulfill the Book of Revelation, which they know is actually derived from Kabbalah. Albert Pike says as much, and bringing it about is their Great Work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Livingstone: "Because chaos precedes the End Times, they need to create it, to accelerate the coming of the Messiah.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both Trump and Putin are surrounded by Chabad, the criminal Jewish doomsday cult. Like Herzl said, the anti-Semites are the Zionists best friends, so they have both been recruiting the far right to achieve their objective. Putin to undermine the influence of NATO in Europe, and Trump to get the white vote.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was the Russian mafia, who are closely connected to Chabad-Lubavitch, who engaged in fake news to rally the conspiracy community and the alt-right behind Trump. The only thing they care about is not white identity, or America or Russia, but Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Chabad are now hailing both Putin and Trump as the possible messiah."

             ASolo I think when you add links or comments into your post, that was gaining traction, about the End Times and different interpretations it scares people. Have learned that here. 
You have an excellent post as I commented on just allowing others to dig into that will expose so much.

              I do understand sister. I do not do it to intentionally try to scare people of course and I know that you realize this, but this is the nature of our world. The specter is huge, and we need huge, brave souls to do this work. It is a very difficult place to be, having come to the realization of the enormity of the beast.

            Aaron Dover posted here on Voat and now he is dead. Do not get lost in his flat earth psyop. He came to Voat and declared he had information on the Clinton Foundation money laundering operations that also included the Hampstead Primary Church Satanic Ritual Abuse case in the U.K. that broke last year in 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            He named names including his own family members that are involved in Satanic Ritual Abuse &amp; mind control of children. His family are part of intelligence operations. Those children's interviews have been leaked and were on Voat. The father is Ricky Dearman connected to the CFoundation and Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aaron Dover was giving corroborating testimony with factual evidence that matched these children and included it could take down the "crown" That is the Royals in the U.K.  Now at 42 he is suddenly found dead. Might want to pay attention.

            You lost me at Aaron Dover saying he "was a partner in a hedge fund owned by Donald Sussman".
           </p>
           <p>
            Aaron Dover thinks the Earth is flat not round and that rocks can't melt which proves volcanoes are a conspiracy theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I'm a full on card carrying conspiracy theorist but let's keep things somewhat sane. The Earth ain't flat and rock will melt if its temperature gets high enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you taking Aaron Dover seriously is pretty sketchy to be honest. What am I missing?

             It's pretty clear that Dover was trying to save his own life by advocating Flat Earth, painting himself as a nutjob and creating plausible deniability. But it was too late.

              I had never thought of that. Thanks for pointing that out. You might be right. I can't wait until this chapter in American History is over. It's a tough read sometimes.

             I'm not going to defend Mr. Dover's interest in incorrect Intel inspired psy-op's. The only thing I can say is that most of us if not all of us get trapped or stuck at some point in our lives by incorrect information.  'Crystallized' in the word's of the Turkish mystic Gurdgieff, mislead, at the time, by what is evidently very persuasive to some. We also have to remember that perhaps Mr Dover, coming from a place of prominence and pedigree, was himself, somehow dysfunctional, as we all are in some capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Personally I believe this angle has all the merit in the world. I will have to do some subsequent follow up and retrieve the other piece I saw a contributor submit that verified this man's identify as having officially worked for Sussman.

             Just because someone is flawed doesn't mean his entire being is worthless.

              I totally agree. No one is 100% good or bad. It's just believing the Earth is flat greatly reduces someone's credibility.
