<p>Watergate took two years to play out. And it looks like PizzaPedoGate won\'t be any different. I\'m posting this here because understanding the Big Picture is highly relevant to this cluster fuck. Here\'s where we stand as far as I can tell:</p>
<p>We all met FBIAnon for the first time last July. It\'s now August 7th so it\'s just over a year. I took FBIAnon at his word but I\'ve come to the point where today I strongly suspect he was a limited hangout. George Webb is also a limited hang out. His <a href="http://i.imgur.com/L2MGGZF.png">&quot;Duper\'s Delight&quot;</a> is quite obvious now.</p>
<p>So why are those two limited hang outs? Because it wasn\'t just Deplorable Americans who dumped Hillary. That only happened because the Deep State dumped Hillary Clinton first. From what I can tell the Deep State effects events simply by tilting the odds one way or the other. They\'re like the dealer in Vegas. They\'re the House and as we all know the House only needs to tilt a game 51% in their favor and <a href="https://youtu.be/b3od7GXKokk?t=1164">they\'ll always win in the end.</a></p>
<p><em>1) So how did that work specifically?</em></p>
<p><em>a.</em> They sabotaged her campaign with slow leaks and limited hang-outs like FBIAnon who acted like runway lights to a landing airplane saying &quot;LOOK OVER HERE&quot;.</p>
<p><em>b.</em> Once they got people\'s attention they released John Podesta\'s <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">emails</a> on October 7th 2016 ONE MONTH BEFORE THE ELECTION. Wikileaks is a CIA limited hang out. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden are in on it I\'m 100% sure. (<em>if they weren\'t they\'d say 9/11 was an inside job which they have never said........because they\'re limited hang outs.</em>)</p>
<p><em>c.</em> George Webb came on the scene sometime between FBIAnon\'s appearence in July and the John Podesta email dump on October 7th. Given the fact he\'s still alive is all the proof I need the Deep State is using him to turn state\'s evidence...........on themselves...........which kind of makes sense given they\'re worried about the court of public opinion(read Deplorables with Assault Rifles. Full Stop.)</p>
<p><em>2) How did I come to this conclusion?</em> It started with Trump last week keeping McCabe at the FBI. That means Trump is in on it. </p>
<p><em>3) If Trump is in on it then why is he getting attacked so mercilessly in the MSM?</em> The only answer that makes sense is it\'s not the leadership within the Deep State (Kissinger) that\'s going after Trump. They CHOSE Trump after all. It\'s Hillary &amp; Co who are going after Trump.</p>
<p>Hillary is rip shit she got dumped. The Deep State dumped Hillary fucking Clinton and &quot;hell hath no fury like a woman scored.&quot;. End of story. At least that\'s my theory as of right now.</p>
<p>So Trump is in on it. There\'s another year of this Cluster Fuck to go. I think I know what\'s going to happen but I\'m not going to say it just yet.</p>

            I believe Assange is long gone, dead since internet-connection blackout, and i really hope Donald Trump got redpilled someway through.
           </p>
           <p>
            If one of those two things is true, we might still have hope.
           </p>
           <p>
            Julian was different before blackout, and first time ever, were unseen for MONTHS. Research what happened at the airport, the vans, first interviews after "coming back to life"..
           </p>
           <p>
            We got misspelled tweets from assange, info that wikileaks was being compromised,  ans a fucking DDOS attacking half states because of Assanges killswitch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wikileaks hasnt given anything concrete after blackout, and they killed Julian because he was to leak all the pizza to the rusty oven. "Can we just drone the guy?" -HC
           </p>
           <p>
            If Trump is in it, lots of mankind will die, simple as that.

             Thanks for the citation to my post on FBIanon. FBIanon and the FBI Twitter are probably my favorite "conspiracy theory."
            </li>
            <li>
             As crazy as your post sounds, it actually makes a ton of sense to me. I've been saying for a long time that there is a civil war in the deep state going on right now. And yes, the deep state seems to have turned on HRC.
            </li>
            <li>
             I would not be surprised if FBIanon was a member of NYC field FBI. I would not surprised if he and his colleagues manage the Twitter account. I think leadership hasn't forced them to alter/stop the tweets, because they are counter threatening to go public. Of course, if it is just a limited hangout, I could be wrong about all of that.
            </li>
            <li>
             If George Webb (and FBIanon - they seem like two parts of the same series of amazing leaks of information) are limited hangouts, then what are they hangouts about?
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            A. FBIanon said that the "entire" federal government is corrupt. He doesn't really focus on CIA.
B. George Webb does not discuss or criticize: Israel, Mossad, 9/11, freemasons, Greater Israel, the occult, or the worst parts of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              If Assange is a limited hangout, it is interested to ask when he was turned. He was raised in Australia with rumored links to the occult and OTI. But maybe he was only turned later, like October 2016.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              One thing I say all the time: it is very hard to know anything with high confidence about geopolitics, because there are so many different parts of the government, and they all blatantly lie to the public.

            <p>
             The CIA run Wikileaks. That means the Podesta emails were released by the CIA. FBIAnon doesn't focus on the CIA because they're the "man behind the curtain" of the Wizard of Oz fame.
            </p>

            <p>
             He was compromised since day 1 because he's denied 9/11 from day one. 9/11 is the key to all of this. That's the one "hot potato" they can't let the public know about. Even letting the public know about raping children in Brownstone Operations is better than letting them know about 9/11.

             We may need to modify our image of the Illuminati and see it as a worldwide criminal network like the Mafia. It probably conflates with the Mafia. It engages in a vast range of criminal activities including human and organ trafficking, drug trafficking, as well as depraved rituals like pedophilia and child sacrifice. The point is that everyone in power is part of it including the Clintons, Trump and Putin. What we think of as politics are really gang wars. Putin's enlightened foreign policy might in fact be resistance to the Western gangsters invading his lucrative turf.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are all criminals, equally reprehensible. But they fight each other by focusing media attention on the other's crimes and ignoring their own. Thus we have the Trump "Russian" investigations while the Clinton Foundation crimes which is far more egregious gets no attention.

             I agree Putin is as big an organized criminal as Trump or Hillary Clinton. I just think he's part of the Russian Mafia which will sometimes work with the WASP Mafia but not these days. Putin is going after Hillary &amp; Co for their war in Syria and because they created ISIS.

             You have a facile and myopic perspective of the complexities of our reality.  All possibilities must be considered and there are many valid paths of enquiry presented in this post.

             I sort of agree but I'm just spit balling here. And besides I'm pretty sure at this point whoever the "white hats" are who kicked off this cluster fuck don't know what the hell is going on either so I'm kind of forgiven for red lining the bull shit meter.

              Haha. Yeah it's a clusterfuck for sure. I haven't figured it out either, but I highly doubt it's a psy-op. The silence is very eerie though. Hardly any public figure is talking about it, but many of them have to know stuff. Shows you how much control the gov't has over everything.

              I think your theory is damaging because it undermines the white hats who have been working so hard for so long to lead this movement of truth.

             That's a good point. Maybe they're just dumping John Podesta right now. Remember Lynn Rothschild's

               Maybe but the Podesta's know a lot. Who knows though. All I know is the reason this cluster fuck is so confusing is because it was intentionally put together to be confusing.

                If the Podestas knew too much they would just get suicided and that would be rolled into the story. Maybe John goes crazy and kills his brother then kills himself because they were committing treason? The family wont talk after that and if they did they would be made to look like crazy conspiracy theorists by the propaganda machine. These people aren't afraid to kill their pawns and they aren't going to make up some elaborate 2 year story to get rid of a nobody like Podesta. He is a nobody in the grand scheme of things. He's puppet in the show, not a puppet master.

            (and other aliases) seems to run with him as a sock-uppet and a couple of others who use the same pro-pedophilia arguments.

            As for snowden being a shill - he may be right. I exposed the Jew's telling him what to do years before he actually did it. Snowden is saying Russia is anti-gay for not letting gay men adopt babies.

              Bee tee dubs have you read anymore European History before 1900 yet like I asked you to do? There's 1900 years of whiteness you really really really really need to get up to speed on to understand the present Cluster Fuck.

                Reducing the size of Germany by 1/3, killing millions of your own people(non-Jews) to kill 1/10 that number of Jews and single handedly destroying the Eugenics movement makes Hitler the "greatest western leader of all time"?

                      <p>
                       At its founding, the NAACP had one African American on its executive board, Du Bois. It did not elect a black president until 1975, but the executive directors, who were the chief operating officers, were primarily African Americans since the early 20th century. The Jewish community contributed greatly to the NAACP's founding and continued financing.[23]
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Jewish historian Howard Sachar writes in his book A History of Jews in America that "In 1914, Professor Emeritus Joel Spingarn of Columbia University became chairman of the NAACP and recruited for its board such Jewish leaders as Jacob Schiff, Jacob Billikopf, and Rabbi Stephen Wise."[23]

                       1909 to 1975 is actually MORE than 60 years.

             Dipshit I'm not dismissing the Pizzagate crime. All that depraved shit happened. I'm saying the Deep State are the one who put Trump in office. The proof of that is Trump hasn't fired Andrew McCabe.

                  That is the proof. you are denying that SB 42 is a law that forces American children in California to praise the "founder of the US gay rights movement" that happens to be HARRY HAY who has his own nambla page. Read the law and the reports about it. You are denying the gay lobby forcing children to HAIL TO THE NAMBLA king Harry Hay.

                   Dipshit, homosexuals aren't pedophiles by default. Homosexuals are as disgusted by pedophiles as anyone else:

                    US CDC says 1% of America is gay male - 1.7% total homos including dykes.
35% of all children who were abused were fucked by a gay male. Only a gay male can do a homosexual sex act with a male child. Look up the definition of homosexual - same sex sex acts.
So a homo is %3500 more likely to rape a child. But you can't call them pedos. Ok I'll call them tramua survivors. The only way to make a new homo child is to brainwash them or give them some child rape trauma. There is no such thing as 3 year old tranny kids who get their penises removed by the state in Australia. It's fucken politically correct faggot child abuse. You are going to deny that's going on are you?

            I'm leaning more and more towards this same conclusion
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/DarkMath">
             @DarkMath
            </a>
            . Here's why: if FBIAnon, Webb, Alex Jones, Wiki and these random people making strange vids and popping them here know what is going on and knowing kids are getting raped, tortured and murdered, why all the "puzzles", bits of info and codes?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why not dump everything and tell it all? Why hide in the shadows, protect certain people or promise to disclose later? It's not making sense and seems definitely like limited hangout. We are fed small pieces of the puzzle and dig in to research bcuz the expendable ones (HRC,Podesta) are no use for "them" anymore. "They" are still protected hiding behind the veil. I'm not saying all the things we have found out are not happening, but I believe the limited disclosure is happening for a bigger reason.

              If were spitballing like losers, hows this:  all/most the wikileaks dumps over the years contain emails we find PG clues in.  If PG was meant to be revealed in 2016 how would they know that some MAGA teenagers would spot the codewords but, say, Hollywood reporters wouldnt in the Sony or Stratfor emails released years prior?

             You're right about the speculatory masturbation, anyway. And the fact that there are now two new people who want us to believe all the evidence posted in the sticky and beyond is just a convenient fantasy. It's gaslighting of the highest order and, frankly, insulting. Time to move away from this bs thread and continue with the real work.

George Webb is also a limited hang out.

              It might interest everyone to know Fred Trump buying Tesla's property was not the first contact. When Tesla was found dead the FBI moved in and confiscated his property and writings under National Security. They then called John Trump (Donald Trumps uncle) and an MIT engineer to look at the work and determine if it had National Security implications. He examined it and told the FBI &amp; the top secret nuclear scientists it did not. 
Fred Trump then swooped in and bought up the property. You want to find something more mind blowing. Back in the late 1800's an author wrote a series of books about the adventures of a boy named Barron Trump. This boy lived in a very wealthy mansion called Castle Trump and was educated and trained by the "Master of Masters" a man named Don. They lived in New York City. Baron went on an adventure to Russia to discover unknown parts of the world before returning to New York.
             </p>
             <p>
              The last book written about Baron Trump was called "The Last President"  It is about Baron's return to New York when a presidential election had just been won. The winner was known as an outsider because the people were angry at the government. In the book terrible riots occurr by anarchists and socialists against the new president including at his home which was located on 5th Ave. in New York City.
             </p>
             <p>
              Where is Donald Trumps home?...5th Ave...New York City
             </p>
             <p>
              Now I am not saying I believe in time travel eventhough Tesla did but the above facts have to make you wonder. You can still get copies of those books with drawings of Baron Trump and all.

                Exactly what I was talking about thanks. I just learned of the Baron Trump books written in the late 1800's a few days ago. I knew of John Trump (MIT engineer) being called in by FBI to examine Tesla's work months ago. I found/find it very strange that no one in MSM has ever spoken about this almost as if ordered not to. Trump said on several occasions my uncle was an engineer at MIT but no follow up.
               </p>
               <p>
                The FBI &amp; the specialized unit in charge of nuclear power called on John Trump to make the determination....something isn't right about the whole thing.

            DarkMath, you're a brave man for putting this out there and get ready to take cover, but I'm with you!  Earlier today
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2045005">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2045005
            </a>
            was posted by a now deleted user and I commented that I believed Pizzagate was a complex psy-op that is years in the making.  Anyway here is some of that original conjecture:
           </p>
           <p>
            This will likely ignite a backlash of resentment but I'm curious to hear if anyone else would agree with the following statement. Pizzagate is an elaborate psy-op, years in the making and has been legitimised through its connection to WikiLeaks which itself is bogus, a controlled opposition front.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not to say that Pedogate, SRA, trauma based mind control and global child trafficking isn't real and conducted by TPTB (it is!) but the more I consider how and when Pizzagate broke the more incredulous I am to believing it. Do they have us chasing our tails?
           </p>
           <p>
            I would be very interested to see any docs that imply this (reply to user stating WikiLeaks is funded by Rothschild arm). I have long since stopped trusting ANY individual (Assange) or org that garners significant mainstream promotion and this fact plus other compelling reasons gives me reason to distrust WikiLeaks. I would never claim to have all the answers for why &amp; how things happen in the world the way they do but I am fairly confident that THE conspiracy is far more duplicitous and abstruse than the majority of us can conceive of and the possibility remains that Pizzagate may be a design of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do believe that through cultural Marxism and other social engineering initiatives lies the reasons for why and how the vast majority of psy-ops exist. If you look into the likes of Tavistock, CFR, Club of Rome etc you begin to understand the scale and complexity of these operations and how even the shrewdest and most discerning of people can be fooled. I am of the opinion that if they can elicit an emotional response and inculcate an affirmation in us rather than having to actually produce a physical event with moving parts, they will opt for the simple method. Hence why so many false flags/hoaxes are devoid of any real evidence of the actual event occurring i.e CCTV footage (Pentagon, Sandyhook, Orlando, Manchester etc etc…)
           </p>
           <p>
            IF Pizzagate is a piece of their narrative, I'm inclined to think that it would be for the purposes of demoralisation, desensitisation divide &amp; conquer and to taunt those who were morally outraged enough to investigate it. This would explain the complete lack of official investigation, the mocking MSM and the audacity of Podesta, Alefantis et al ignoring all requests for an explanation and opportunity to vindicate themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            IF Pizzagate is genuine in all its established forms, I do not believe it was leaked due to careless behaviour and unsecured email correspondence. This has always struck me as unlikely as the type of people involved (Podesta, Clinton, Alefantis et al) are not your average dimwits who make such monumental errors of judgement and then subsequently fail to implement damage limitation before a story can break (reminder: TPTB own the whole of the MSM and much of the Alt &amp; Indi so generally we only get to hear about stuff if they want us to!!) In this case (and I still stand by my convictions that WL is bogus) it must have been leaked intentionally and for the same reasons I mentioned above.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before down voting just because I hold a different opinion and viewpoint on the matter, please debate why you think I am wrong or right. Cheers.

             I agree. All the crimes are real. It's just their context that is being managed. The Deep State would very much like to lay all the blame at Hillary and the Podesta Pervert's door.

              I'm not trying to. I'm just trying to explain all the facts as I see them. Trump letting McCabe stay on at the FBI changed everything. It means he's not going to drain the swamp. Andrew McCabe is the fucking swamp's game warden for Christ sake.

                 DarkMath, you know that it takes time to make all this happen.  I have read you saying this and I agree.  I am one to let it all play out.  McCabe is dirty and knowing Trump, he knew that before the White Hats recruited him.  As they say, "Tick, tock."

            from pizzagate (based, no less, on the notion that what was obviously a real girl was a

            lololol xD).  So which is it? Is pizzagate a hoax, or was the Ohio State Fair accident a hoax to distract from pizzagate?  Your credibility is

             the Ohio State Fair hoax is still a hoax. It's being run by Hillary &amp; Co to fight off those in the Deep State who want her gone.

            Ya know... it's interesting that both of these posts, while completely contradictory, share one common link: they both seem intended to discredit pizzagate.  (The Ohio State Fair one does so by trying to associate pizzagate researchers with schizophrenic nonsense.)

             I'm glad you asked because that gets to the heart of what's happening. If my theory is correct and the Deep State dumped Hillary &amp; Co then it makes perfect sense they appear as a house divided unto itself. There are two factions and one is fighting the other. So the Ohio State Fair hoax is still a hoax. It's being run by Hillary &amp; Co to fight off those in the Deep State who want her gone.

             Basically there is a civil war going within the Deep State right now. I should add that to the post I imagine right? It's not too clear I think is what you mean.
