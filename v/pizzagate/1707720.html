            which received an amazing amount of collective, positive support from Christians to Atheists and every kind of us in between..everyone coming together as one, for the children.. this mass meditation/prayer was (co)incidentally(?) the same date as the march, one month ago..
           </p>
           <p>
            events like these (both the mass spiritual gathering events, and the mass physical gathering events) are going to prove more and more that our "global, diversified unity" is greater, stronger, and more effective than that of the opposition.... all kinds of everyone, dropping everything that divides us, to stand together on what unites us.. just like Narnia.. the side of truth has the
            <a href="http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Deeper_Magic_from_Before_the_Dawn_of_Time">
             deeper magic
            </a>
            the opposition can never gain access to.. through this entire progression, the side of truth and right has been able to take what the opposition started, and re-purpose it to work against them.. "They Will Not Divide Us"
           </p>
           <p>
            as long as we keep everything positive, peaceful and proactive  (basically the exact opposite of the feminazi marches)... we need to always be beyond reproach in our efforts.

            I'm very very apprehensive about public disobedience or protesting.  This issue is close to but has not quite yet reached critical mass awareness.  And I'm afraid and event can too easily be used as a driver to create a sub narrative about this investigation.  The headlines will tell the story, and if any media covers this those headlines will certainly take away from the credability of this cause.  The headline will read " conspiracy theorists gather to bother pizza shop owners on the debunked pizzagate conspiracy" and and efforts to convey demands or to deliver a message will be thwarted to undermine the cause.  Events are also too easily hijacked by rogue element.  Just look at MLK and cointelpro, the Intel community will easily control the narrative on any street action.  Even an honest effort can't amount to much.  A single act of disobedience like painting #pizzagate on Trump tower would have more affect of awareness outreach on this topic.  bE WEARY of protests, it's too early.

            I can donate, I can send prayers... but I cannot attend! Would it be possible for any of the attendees to livestream? Would like to be able to be a part of it that way as well, see the turnout and any possible shenanigens the guilty may try to pull.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please everyone, stay alert, pay attention to odd people and details and dont be afraid to peacefully address trouble makers or plants. That usually makes them run, or try to instigate violence. As we have seen in standing rock these people are experts and turning a worthy movement into a debacle and using it to provoke the un-educated or provoke a larger resistance through propaganda in the MSM. I would hope that one of the organizers can send out information on non-violent protest techniques so that people dont get baited for the cameras (if there is any MSM coverage, they will be looking to use it to negatively portray the entire movement) Livestream or take video (bring lots of extra battery packs &amp; memory cards) Be prepared to out anyone in the crowd that is clearly a plant. They will be there. They will make this anti-gay (as we have seen the false drama protest play out at comet) and try to tin-foil hat everyone in attendance. Carry yourselves with honor and good thoughts, good words and good actions of someone who is an upstanding warrior of truth. This is an important event and I would hate to see it hijacked. If everyone in the truth network are on board with non-violent protest tactics it will speak well for the cause. The plants will stick out like a sore thumb. Call them out. Be aware of stingray technology (get an app, or take battery out of your phone) bring digital cameras with no wi-fi to record if needed. We know from standing rock the tactics that are used and once they have your device locked, they are in for good (even if you wipe the phone) Some may see these precautions as overkill, but given what we know I would venture to guess they would stop at nothing to set-up and track as many people as possible.  Dont be in fear, but stand in truth and unity (and strength). I truly wish I could be there to document this from a citizen journalist perspective. We truly have to be the media and capturing a truth oriented perspective from our own eyes is the anti-propaganda that will surely follow) Prayers to all.  DONATE!
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone would like me to compile information regarding non-violent protest actions to share with attendees I would be happy to do that.  The children need someone to stand for them and the time is now!! I am proud of you all for your bravery and committment.
           </p>
           <p>
            There will most certainly be backlask so come prepared and watch each others backs!!!

            Fuck your prayers, god doesn't exist. If you think he does, why does he let all these kids get molested and abused by freaks? Because god has a plan for everything and everyone? Hahaha good one. Stop intertwining these investigations with religion. It's stupid, pathetic, and shows how weak of a backbone you have.

             WTF! Triggered much? I put the prayer part for people that do believe in a GOD or that are spiritually in touch with a creator and cannot attend. Fuck me? Nah bud you need to direct that energy to the ones we be protesting. You talk like that in a ReaL World conversation with people? If you do watch out people like to punch bufoons who spout off like a loud drunk in a BAR

            So there's one on 3/18 and one on 3/25. These should have been combined to have a better turn out. Can they merge these two events?

             If one is trying to help expose PIZZAGATE to the masses why delete a thread that's informing the public of a gathering in Washington DC to expose PIZZAGATE/Pedogate in the form of protesting and bringing awareness to the subject?

            Because your original submission was targeted at the mods for stickying your post, which is a meta concern. We haven't removed other submissions about this protest, in fact, they have been flaired.

            Not necessarily. If this turns into a violent act, possibly in an orchestrated way in the fashion of the CPP shooting incident, it provides grounds for smearing the investigation altogether one more time, never mind that people can also get hurt.

             I made a post asking for ideas to get the general public more involved (I. E. Creating infographics displaying the epidemic of human trafficking) and it got deleted citing rule 4. Can you explain why? All I am wanting to do is to try and create a bridge from the general public with the overriding issue, making a basis of knowledge to help ease them into the reality of things.

                Please read the Submission Requirements, you can find them in the sidebar. Your post is a clear-cut case of rule 4 and it is obvious you haven't read them before posting.

                  Basically, you will never see a post on this subverse that doesn't contain at least one link as a source to at least one claim. That is because this is an investigative subverse, we're primarily trying to build up evidence on here. Meta concerns, and general discussion posts without sources (like yours) should be discussed on
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                   /v/pizzagatewhatever
                  </a>
                  , another subverse created precisely for this purpose. But, again, all this is explicit in the submission rules, so please do read them once more. Thank you.

                   Thank you for the explanation. I guess I was reading rule 3. And didn't understand what "meta" was referring to. Definitely don't want my post to interrupt the good work this subverse is doing.  I'll be more careful from now on. Thanks again! I really do appreciate the help :)

             Fair enough answers. GOing against the grain is always uncomfortable but must be done to break new ground! Breaking the Dam so to speak and let the flood pour! Kinda like the Oroville CA situation

             Why was there tons of shit deleted yesterday that shouldn't have been? There was even a pause on threads going through. This happens regularly and you pseudo mods just stay silent and pretend like nothing happened.

             I thought of actually adding the flyer image to the sidebar, but wasn't sure we officially wanted to endorse this event. If we do, then I suggest we use the sidebar for more visibility.

              I see no reason not to support it.  I would suggest both a sidebar link and a link at top of sticky.

               And done. Unfortunately I won't be able to turn the banner into an actual clickable link as it's being put there with a CSS hack.

               To sum up, my main concern was that there is another protest happening on the 18th, in Washington, D.C. as well, and I'm not sure what's going on with these. The earlier one is endorsed by Becki Percy, this later one is endorsed by David Seaman, and they're apparently closely in touch, so it's weird to me that they wouldn't pick the same protest to attend, at the same place one week apart. My gut tells me that one of these will be a honeypot event. If that is true, then the one on the 18th has more potential to be that, given that it's both earlier than the presumably legit one, and got scheduled weeks later. With this doubt, I wasn't sure if endorsing any of them is a good idea, and I've been discussing this with
