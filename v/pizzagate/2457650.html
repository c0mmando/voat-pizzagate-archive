<p>However, Dawber also opened up about Williams’ alleged sexual behavior on the show, which helped skyrocket the actor to fame. “I had the grossest things done to me by him. And I never took offense,” she reportedly said. “I mean I was flashed, humped, bumped, grabbed. I think he probably did it to a lot of people … but it was so much fun.”</p>
<p>Dawber added, “Somehow he had that magic. If you put it on paper you would be appalled. But somehow he had this guileless little thing that he would do – those sparkly eyes. He’d look at you, really playful, like a puppy, all of a sudden. And then he’d grab your t--- and then run away. And somehow he could get away with it. It was the Seventies, after all.”</p>
<p>Mork &amp; Mindy producer Howard Storm, who was also interviewed for the book, reportedly said, “He’d be doing a paragraph and in the middle of it he would just turn and grab her a-- . Or grab a breast. And we’d start again.”</p>
<p>Storm allegedly added, “It was just Robin being Robin, and he thought it would be funny. He could get away with murder.”   WHAT?  Just Robin Being Robin?    He could get away with MURDER?</p>
<p>Garry Marshall, another producer, reportedly said that it was Williams’ mission to embarrass Dawber on set: “He would take all his clothes off, he would be standing there totally naked and she was trying to act. His aim in life was to make Pam Dawber blush.”</p>
<p>I am reading this as Robin Grooming Pam.  Grooming her to accept what he did as part of his comedy act.  Not Funny.  All the other perverts just pass it off as One Big Joke.  Is this how they also get away with it?  
</p>
<p>Look at the bottom of the article where there is a picture of Robin as a boy.  His father worked for Ford Motors.  Was Robin passed off?  Idk but Robin was one Messed Up Person.    Video Included.</p>
<p>Pizzagate connected because Robin Williams was part of the Hollywood Motion Picture Industry which we know is DC controlled.</p>',

             I think it is just a matter of opinion.  Humping and Bumping?  Taking his clothes off in front of her.   She did not sign up for  that.  This sounds like a reason to sexually accuse him if he was alive.  Gary Marshall was no saint either.  I think there was a certain understood climate on that set.  I don't think it is stretching to say that when someone accuses someone else of Humping, that it is stretching.   Just because they are doing a comedy show does not mean anything goes.  I would call this abuse, actually

             you'll find some Pizzagate connection. Otherwise, unfortunately we'll have to do it after 24 hours. Thank you.

             Thank you.   I really think of it as a more normalizing tactic by grooming her.  Grooming in order to get away with sexual things within the program.  I think she was loosened up to accept so much more within the script if she was "Groomed".   This was DC and their moguls allowing to infiltrate sex into our sitcoms.  I am not too good at figuring out the connections if you can think of a way let me know.  Otherwise I may eventually have to delete as you recommend.

              Carm, I think it is a worthwhile read, no doubt. It's a tiny part of the puzzle of Hollywood actors crossing boundaries they shouldn't have crossed, and a work environment which has been encouraging sexual harassment. It's just that I can't see a
