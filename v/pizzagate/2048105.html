            Tangential, perhaps, but Esther Freud, niece of Clement Freud, had her Hideous Kinky novel reissued with cover art provided by Oliver Hibert (

            ), the artist responsible for some of the sickest satanic artwork out there (although his art's disturbing content is camouflaged/offset by its cheery, dayglo psychedelic colors and kitchy style) which has been used extensively by Flaming Lips:

            whose associates (including Miley Cyrus have made a number of disturbing and incriminating pizza gate-related posts on social media. Once again, the Freud family is connected with satanic pedos.

            After reading a little about the NHF (not exhaustive at all) I do believe there's a big difference between Clinton's SJW recruitment center Partner The Opportunity Institute (Too Small to Fail is their program and they partner with CF), and the NHF, whose original intent was to create resources and support for parents with disabled kids, in order for them to keep the kids, rather than place them in orphanages, an idea that Vodianova is personally invested in due to her own sister:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Naked Heart came into being after a siege at a primary school in Beslan, North Ossetia, by Chechen separatists in 2004 pushed Vodianova to do something for her country. Her idea was to build playgrounds in rough areas in Russia, adapted for kids with special needs like her sister.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vodianova explains that there is a grave lack of institutional and social support in Russia, which leads many families to place children with autism, Down syndrome, or cerebral palsy in state-run orphanages. “My mom kept Oksana in the family, which was an exception, and I saw how tough it was for her to raise her,” she says. To date, Naked Heart has built 177 playgrounds in Russia, the U.K., and Peru, with at least 17 more approved for 2017.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Not saying the Global Buzzards don't use NHF events/connections for their own purposes, just saying the organizations build playgrounds for completely different reasons.  (Maybe the Clintons took the build a playground idea from NHF)

            The Fabulous Fund Fair is another annual event held by NHF.
Here is some recent info about Naked Heart Foundation fundraising activity:

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Vodianova’s Naked Heart Foundation will throw its fourth annual Fabulous Fund Fair this October, and for the first time the charitable bash will be held in New York. AmfAR is a first-time partner with the Naked Heart Foundation for the Halloween-themed event, which will take place on Oct. 28. Aside from the Halloween timing,
             <strong>
              the event promises to be “inspired by” artist Jeff Koons
             </strong>

            </p>
            <p>
             The first Fabulous Fund Fair was held in London in 2015, usually during London Fashion Week. A typically celebrity- and model-heavy event, guests have included Stella McCartney, Kristin Scott Thomas, Doutzen Kroes, Liv Tyler, Lara Stone, Baptiste Giabiconi, Toby Huntington-Whiteley, Yasmin and Amber Le Bon, Justine Skye and Corinne Bailey Rae.

             I certainly hope the NHF is well intentioned.  I just saw that donor list and her history with the Clinton's and got very concerned.  There are too many scumbags donating for me to not at least look into it.

              Well intentioned doesn't mean that as the organization goes global, the same old crew doesn't use locations around to world to further their agenda.  Definitely going to keep looking into the associations.

            As a simple place to start checking out stuff I dug a bit into the Casa De Campo link and definitely the mention at the very bottom caught my eye since I've been checking out info regarding orphanages.  However, while putting this together what seemed a simple thing became long and complex and a sidetrack from Naked Heart Foundation, but on target in regards to Clintons et. al.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Rolando Gonzalez-Bunster is the chairman and chief executive officer of InterEnergy Holdings. Prior to founding InterEnergy, he founded and managed InterEnergy's predecessor, Basic Energy Ltd. (Bahamas), a holding company that owned and operates electrical generation and distribution assets in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Jamaica.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rolando is a pioneer of the electric sector of the Dominican Republic, being credited with the signing of the country's first state utility PPA, as well as being one of the key participants in the privatization of the state controlled electricity businesses. His track record in the country dates back to the late 1980's, when he developed the country's first barge mounted power plant in partnership with Seaboard Corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since then, Rolando has successfully developed, acquired and managed over 1,500MW of generating capacity in the Dominican Republic, Argentina, Jamaica and Panama. In addition to overseeing the management of all group operating companies, he led all significant aspects of project development, financing and the relationship with governments and multilateral organizations such as the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
            </p>
            <p>
             Prior to founding Basic Energy, Rolando was the international vice president of New York-based multi-billion dollar conglomerate Gulf &amp; Western Industries Inc., reporting directly to Chairman and CEO Charles Bludhorn.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rolando is the chair of the International Initiatives Committee of Georgetown University, a member of the Latin American Board of Georgetown University, and serves on the Board of Advisors of the Georgetown College of Arts and Sciences, his alma matter. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Clinton Foundation, and the Energy &amp; Climate Committee of the Clinton Global Initiative, focusing on clean and renewable energies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further to this, Rolando is a member of the Institute of the Americas as well as serving on the board of The Walkabout Foundation – a non-profit organization focused on funding research to find a cure for paralysis and donating wheelchairs to people in need around the world.

             This is all very interesting.  Thank you for the research!  The Bren Simon part is sending off all sorts of red flags for me.  I have seen way too much stuff where dentists work with doctors and human traffickers to graft the bones from victims.  Hopefully that is just my confirmation bias though.

            I'll help as much as I can, checking out ties between people, groups etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clearly there's an over all pattern we see which one could characterize as a 'sustainable' business model for the Globalist Elites and wealthy pedophiles: Global sex trafficking, Pedo sex tourism, Slave labor, as well as human guinea pigs for Vaccine Research, Organ Harvesting and even making money on organizations to "Combat" all of the above, (with exception to the human guinea pig area as that cannot be publicized in the same way.)
           </p>
           <p>
            One way to conceptualize the structure of such a business model involves these categories...
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Civil Society groups, NGO charity partnerships, seminars, global awareness programs/campaigns and Voluntourism are one area supporting (knowingly or not) transnational crime networks.  They are the pretty frosting to help cover up the appearance and stench of corruption of crimes against humanity, giving cover to powerful people to meet and conduct business and pleasure.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            These organizations and high profile events provide avenues of funding, ways to launder money, and of course, excuses for wealthy pedos to be in a particular country that provides sex tourism for the rich.  At this level, the network runs it's NGO 'playground' for the elites, involving the arts shows, concerts, resort hotels, and readily available opportunities to have sex with children.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Government officials, UN officials, etc., large corporate interests (those that use child labor/slave labor or those involved in medical research), Celebrities, and certain very wealthy  persons all profit from the business model, whether political favors, furthering agendas, being paid for their government influence, having connections to keep the cheap labor available, promoting a career, avoiding paying taxes, and so on.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            There's more but but I'm sure we're on the same page enough to agree that the tentacles of PG have reached into everyone's lives to one degree or another, spreading the global cancer, leaving no lucrative avenue of exploitation unexamined.

             I was thinking along those lines as well, but by building playgrounds they could choose the site by demographics and make it easier to target the children and young mothers. Playground equipment that drops kids into underground nets when they know they are alone at the park?  Cameras in nearby buildings run by the creeps? I read something about how they found a bench in S.F. or Portland that when sat upon by whoever, could be turned backwards by lever and peephole, and deposit them upside down into a tunnel, or Shanghied, as it were known.

            want to say right off please note this sentence: Announced a charity app Elbi at the Clinton Global Initiative. You can use it to give money to groups such as Save The Children, among many others.

            There are some Children's Charities that are complicit and may be involved in pizzagate, and Save The Children has been mentioned as one of them.  I was attacked once by someone that was upset because I mentioned this.  We must be careful who we now donate to.  I have also been upset by who I can no longer donate to.  Also yes, the Laundering of Money in the Art World is a Big Business.  Freud and Koons are Red Flags.

             Yeah, I deliberately signaled out Save The Children as the representative charity because they are probably trafficking in migrants to Italy and funded by George Soros.  I'm not familiar with the other names I have heard yet so I can't say anything about them.

               As of 9-30-04, Forbes reports that the Shriners had assets of $8.62 billion.  Of the $948 mil. raised,  the Shriners retained $412 mil with only a slight more than half, $505 mil. going to charitable services! Top Shriner, Ralph Semb, was paid $406,659 in salaries.* As of 12-31-06, Forbes magazine reports the Shriners have amassed a $9.54 billion empire retaining $636 million of the money raised that same year. Top Shriner, James Full, collected a healthy $1,207,369 in salaries this same year.  THIS looks pretty bad.    I imagine that looks pretty skimpy for the Shriner's Children's Hospital.

              Remember on the news, at least I do, when they were showing the pope at the fence of a migrant holding area, and Blessing them.  I was thinking maybe he was taking his pick of the litter. It made me so sick. I have been wondering about The Shriners Org. They have connections to the Free Masons , but have looked no further.  They do constant commercials on TV with children begging for donations.  It is heartbreaking but almost sick in a way.  I hate when they use children to hawk for money.
