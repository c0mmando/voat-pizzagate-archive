            THIS WOMAN IS A FRAUD. The story is 100% FALSE fiction. I spent a lot of time reading the entire story and looking her up afterwards. "Dr." Sue Arrigo is her name so I googled both that and her email address which is located on the story. I found her online real life pics and some messages from her sister to conspiracy theorists' websites advising Sue Arrigo has delusional schizophrenia and was NEVER in the CIA, MK Ultra, abused, kidnapped or anything remotely similar. She should be banned from the internet. There were a number of red flags in that long story which I will not expose so she can potentially correct them. I believe she is here posting as "Against Pedos" and "logjam" as well as others looking for credit on this story. I believe Ms. Arrigo watched a number of YouTube videos of Brice Taylor and others, as well as reading first hand accounts of children in MK Ultra stories and put them all together in her fabricated story. Brice Taylor is real, Sue Arrigo is not. In another conspiracy forum she posted about Obama abusing her and sitting in on CIA meetings as of last year!!! As far as being a "Presidential Model" she is an overweight late 50s early 60s woman who, again, has severe schizophrenia. **I wish people like this would STAY OFF THE INTERNET and not post delusional fabricated stories that are not true in such a serious investigation. ** please do not promote this fictional story on here anymore as it makes us look more fake news than ever. Also, Gail Allen has nothing to do with the story, it is SUE ARRIGO. Even the website is warped.

            Well... idk if I'll ever be the same after reading that. And what's worse, is that I have no idea how to fix the problem. The only comfort I get is the possibility that we can be wrong and the problem is not as bad as it seems. But I think it is unlikely. I totally understand why people don't believe in pizzagate despite the evidence. It is too hard to accept for most people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I skimmed this too. It's disturbing...

             Things will change. Dots are connecting for the bigger picture and as atrocious as it is, there's still more out there waiting to be uncovered and acknowledged.
            </p>
            <p>
             Change will either be brought about by public demand or, if the rumours are true, the good guys already at war behind the scenes will be successful in removing these people from power (it could even be a combination of the two).

              I hope you are right. My biggest fear is that the reason things are not changing is because they have us by the balls. If they control the nukes, they can use that as leverage. As in, prosecute and NYC goes bye bye. Or they can cause a global financial collapse like we have never seen before. Or they can shut down the electric grid resulting in millions of deaths. If they are willing to end the world to avoid prosecution, then how do you stop that?

               The fiat money system, as they designed it, was destined to implode from the moment it was implemented. It's been said by some that a global financial collapse would be the most likely catalyst to wake up those who are clinging to sleep. If it does implode, it would be a great opportunity to restructure how we do things. As it is now, with PG having gone global, it's not only waking people up, it's also the reason more and more people are getting involved to put an end to it.
              </p>
              <p>
               People waking up is their biggest fear. There are a lot more of us than there are of them. The battle behind the scenes continues. They won't be allowed to do the things you mentioned; they've already been shut down several times according to articles where the word "mysteriously" is used to describe how a reactor gets shut down or something doesn't launch or go off as intended.
              </p>
              <p>
               Stay in the now. Do what you can to make the world a better place, even if it's only in your bubble, and know things will work out.

            Many of the poor little kids are already traumatized. That's heart breaking. I sure look at things different now. The people we count on to run our country are many times corrupt. Many charities is just a way to get perks on the sly while looking like a good person. It seems so much more common than I ever thought possible. I will just never look at things the same again.

             THIS WOMAN IS A FRAUD. The story is 100% FALSE fiction. I spent a lot of time reading the entire story and looking her up afterwards. "Dr." Sue Arrigo is her name so I googled both that and her email address which is located on the story. I found her online real life pics and some messages from her sister to conspiracy theorists' websites advising Sue Arrigo has delusional schizophrenia and was NEVER in the CIA, MK Ultra, abused, kidnapped or anything remotely similar. She should be banned from the internet. There were a number of red flags in that long story which I will not expose so she can potentially correct them. I believe she is here posting as "Against Pedos" and "logjam" below looking for credit on this story. I believe Ms. Arrigo watched a number of YouTube videos of Brice Taylor and others, as well as reading first hand accounts of children in MK Ultra stories and put them all together in her fabricated story. Brice Taylor is real, Sue Arrigo is not. In another conspiracy forum she posted about Obama abusing her and sitting in on CIA meetings as of last year!!! As far as being a "Presidential Model" she is an overweight late 50s early 60s woman who, again, has severe schizophrenia. **I wish people like this would STAY OFF THE INTERNET and not post delusional fabricated stories that are not true in such a serious investigation. **

            I can't believe these people are human, they must have some kind of genetic difference that makes them a slightly different species, How there are so many of them, and how they managed to worm their way into taking over all the power structures of human society globally, I just have no idea. It's all unfathomable.

            I cant fucking imagine the little boys and girls cramped up in those containers while getting shipped overseas in bulk. This is horrific to think about. These people have 0 shame and respect for humanity. Makes you wonder wtf species they really are.

             My guess is they want the high spoilage rates to fuck the children mentally. MK ultra programming is all based around a roller-coaster of horrible trauma &gt; then motherly comfort &gt; horrible trauma &gt; motherly comfort &gt; horrible trauma rinse and repeat. They do this until the programming is complete and the subject will do anything you say.

             Imagine Theon Greyjoy from GOT but more trauma and from a younger age. Eventually your mind will just start to block that shit out. You will sub consciously do actions to avoid the trauma you want to and have forgot. This way people are completly controlled without realizing that they are necessarily being controlled. Doesn't always work though. This is why we get people like Kanye, Brittney Spears, Micheal Jackson and others who speak out.

             That it's so firmly established at so many levels means the only way it's going to stop is if the public demands it. Those at the top only care about how much money they make. People, including their own children, are nothing more than a means to an end.

             I will say one thing it does go back to CF, and Hillary's biggest client was Saudi Arabia. A fresh white child is worth $50k in Saudi, its a boy 6 years old virgin, clean.
I'm skeptical of travel by boat/container, in real when humans are locked in a container 3 days they're dead. Remember Hillary was State Department that means she could FLY anything anywhere with diplomatic pouch, and you can use your imagination how big the pouch can be and how many pouches on the flight because it doesn't matter nobody is allowed to look.
