              Yeah I said on voat that unless evidence shown I will still defend Pence, obviously its not in hard writing/pics so not 100% but looking more damning by each new report - shocked :'(

            SoberSecondThought is so clueless, or maybe not, that he accused me of being part of the Q campaign. Anybody that knows my posting history knows that I never believed the Q phenom from the very beginning and I was vocal about it, to say the least.

            This isn't just about Tori Smith ! This isn't the only connection she's making to MP . She even says that her viewers should look up TS on their own and decide for themselves . FACT is all these things happened and are happening under MP watch . Things like CHILD TRAFFICKING and SRA being wide spread in Indiana . We need to keep an open mind . Just sayin

             Thanks Cc1914 you're right. I am only posting for people to say if they know any more, I certainly have not said its true, as I said I was defending MP months ago when people were saying he was involved.  I just want the truth to come out, as there have been a lot of 'wolves in sheeps clothing' regarding pizzagate.  Again...I hope it is not true.

              Also I seem to remember that in Indiana is a Really Big Masonic HQ type Org. Can;t remember where or what it is right now, but I remember reading that on here.  If he is such a Holy Roller like some say on here, the religion part just Gags Me.  I can't believe after what we have seen about religions on here that people still believe that just because someone runs to their House of Worship they Glorify him.  I got backlash about him being such a good husband and never looking at another woman.  Yeah well we also know that a lot of people can be Living a Life of Lies.

               I still don't want to pre-judge but now when I look at him he looks sleezy, where before he had a bit of a glow about him - how a few words can change my perspective!  Look at his face behind Trump here, its as though he knows the cats out of the bag. lol - Look at me, not wanting to pre-judge 👀 😲 just about ready to send him to the gallows! 😂

                I agree.  But I got ready to throw him under the bus when I heard that Flynn possibly had a list of pedos and or gays at his behest.  I started looking at him differently after that.  Now I am pretty convinced, but still want to see it in writing.  Need to have some proof that will convict him. Is it not rumored about him and Jeff Flake?

              That's exactly how I feel . Truth no matter where it leads ! I was defending TS in 2016 not because I want to believe a fruity galactic alien but because it always seems there was truth mixed with half truths .

             haha if you are referring to the word connection in my title, I did apologise in my top comment.  I first had (does this video prove a connection to him?) then took out the words 'prove a'....and meant to change it to (does this video connect him?)  I did not delete/change post, because you can't change a title once up, also if I delete the post and try to upload again it says you have posted a similar post and does not let it post.

            No, Mike Pence is not involved in Pedogate. This video is a rehash of the bogus "Tory Smith" story.

             A whistleblower approached Paul Ryan in June 2013, offering information about pedophile rings operating in Washington. Ryan got the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, to agree to have the whistleblower testify live before Congress.
            </strong>
            Ryan also got Mike Pence to agree to supply protection for the whistleblower during the 10 days or so that it would take to arrange this. Ryan then passed this information to Glenn Beck, who talked about it in

           <p>
            <strong>
             The plan fell apart, most likely because of Boehner selling them out or otherwise folding under pressure. The whistleblower was probably killed, and the other participants were silenced by threats.

            The cover-up focused on discrediting and smearing Paul Ryan and Mike Pence.
            <strong>
             "Tory Smith" was a character created specifically as a means to attack Pence.
            </strong>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2217878">
             As I explain here,
            </a>
            "Tory Smith" accused almost everyone in the U.S. government, and many foreigners, of raping and murdering children. However, he continually came back to Mike Pence, his wife, his Attorney General, and senior Indiana State Troopers (that is, the people who would have protected the whistleblower). He accused them of not only raping and murdering hundreds of children, but of raping him. "Tory Smith" could get away with this because he posed as someone having spiritual contact with a huge variety of "Blue Avians" and "Galactics". To fellow believers he was a kind of prophet, who somehow survived being infected with anthrax hundreds of times, and raped dozens of times. To everyone else he was a mentally ill man who maybe suffered from PTSD. But he was actually working for David Brock, and still is. He posts on Voat using a variety of sockpuppet accounts.

            The other smear campaign was directed at Paul Ryan by Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt, as I explain

             There's one guy who's responsible for the majority of the "insider" crap that has been spread around since Pizzagate began. He's responsible for Senate Anon, HighLevelInsider, Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt, Tory Smith, ShareBlue Anon, and Q Anon

             As I’ve said to you before, every time I see you post, I will paste my reply and expose your lies...
            </p>
            <h1>
            </h1>
            <p>
             I am going to repeat this one more time. What I am about to say PROVES this person is lying.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those of you who do not know Tory Smith, he was a YouTuber that started posting in 2015. I think some of his earliest videos got deleted. Supposedly he was abused as a child and it continued into adulthood.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you were to watch his videos, you would clearly see that he was mentally ill. Possibly from past mind control or something of that nature. I will explain why. He made videos regularly exposing child trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             He would name names, agencies, politicians, military officials, bases, Milabs, everything and everyone he knew to be involved in child trafficking. The White House, Congress, Pentagon, Military, Air Force, SOCOM, AFRICOM, NORTHCOM, FBI, CIA, NSA, DARPA, Obama's, Bush's, Clinton's, and the Pence's...
            </p>
            <p>
             He focused a lot on Mike Pence because Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana and Tory Smith lived in Indiana.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason I say I think he was mentally ill, is because he would also make other claims. SoberSecondThought posted this himself so knows this.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              He uses these gifts to make a mind-boggling number of accusations. His core claim is that there are 41 secret trafficking centers around the world, created by the Bush family and run jointly by the CIA, FBI, DARPA, NSA, and various alien reptilians, insectoids, 'tall whites,' non-physical spirits, dark entities, Nazi war criminals, and so on. In these centers, high-ranking people can pay to rape and murder children (he cites a price of $41,000 per child). These are abducted in the tens of thousands from all over the world, by the Chinese, Queen Elizabeth, the Air Force, NATO, the Rand Corporation, the Vatican, the Los Angeles city council, and countless others. Tory has named hundreds of people as guilty of child rape and murder, including the Bushes, the Clintons, Obama, Rahm Emanuel, James Comey, Dick Cheney, 70 U.S. Senators, and so on.
             </p>
             <p>
              John Brennan (former head of the CIA) is a shape-shifting alien who has personally assassinated Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Whitney Houston's daughter, Paul Walker, Antonin Scalia, and Robin Williams, using a stun gun. He had to shoot Michael Jackson 42 times with the stun gun to give him a fatal heart attack.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tory is also a martyr of the first order. First, there is the torment of him psychically viewing and relaying the details of countless thousands of child murders, often including the names, ages, and favorite foods of the kids. He is "injected with weapons-grade anthrax daily" by DARPA. He has been raped in 14 of the 41 centers, including three times by Rand Paul(!), but has somehow managed to survive. The government also continually interferes with his computer, supposedly making it hard to upload his videos on a regular schedule (although 202 videos in eight months seems pretty regular).
             </p>
             <p>
              This is pretty exhausting and loopy stuff to watch, and I have not by any means viewed all 202 of his videos.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I used to watch some of his videos because he tripped me out. I felt bad for him. I watched the poor man slowly deteriorating physically. He thought he was being poisoned for exposing everything. I think it was probably cancer or something.

             Wow. Whatever. These aren't even comparable. So I gathered some pictures to prove that Tory Smith was seriously dying and that it wasn't an act. His health declined very rapidly the last 3 months of his life. Here are 3 images.

But (a) the video isn't HD, and (b) if you're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay a guy to say crazy slanderous things year after year, you can probably splash out for a makeup artist to help him look hollow-cheeked when it's time to end his run. I know people who do more elaborate looks just for Hallowe'en.

             This person continues to tarnish the name of a man that died. The poster even says he has no proof that Tory Smith didn't die. So he is basing his claims (this ridiculous series that he investigated for a year) on something he can't prove. On something he ADMITS HE CANNOT PROVE! On something that anyone with a brain can look at and see that the man was clearly dying. It wasn't an act. It wasn't makeup. He clearly lost a lot of weight and was getting weaker and weaker every week.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have stated over and over that I don't have an opinion on rather or not HLI, WIC, and everyone else is the same person. I am not defending them. What I do know is that what this poster bases his claims on is a LIE. He's working very hard to discredit posters from here, reddit and 4 Chan I believe. This is DISINFO and a limited hangout. This person has lost all credibility. He continues to write me trying to prove he's right and tries to use his manipulation tactics taught to him like I'm stupid. Analyzing me and my thought process. It didn't work. It won't work.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm tired of wasting my time having to repeat myself because this PAID SHILL won't accept defeat. He fucked this project up. His gig is up. He isn't getting his October bonus check. He needs to put in some applications somewhere else because he SUCKS. He didn't expect someone to know all about Tory Smith. Well, he FAILED.
            </p>
            <p>
             I encourage anyone believing this "series" to not base your opinion off of anything to do with Tory Smith because he may have talked about some of the same topics as HLI and the others. Tory talked about MANY things like that.
            </p>
            <p>
             I find it sick that he continues to slander the name of someone who died and cannot defend himself. Tory Smith had loved ones. The shill poster is so disrespectful and heartless.
            </p>
            <p>
             If he doesn't have solid proof, like he admits, he should STFU and not post this crap here. Go back to the drawing board. I think this person needs to be banned from the Pizzagate sub. I can't believe that this has gone on now for what? 11 days?!
            </p>
            <p>
             So that I don't have to waste all my time continuing to repeat myself every time this shill pings me, I am just going to save this and paste it every time. I have better things to do. The only reason I'm commenting right now is that I don't want you guys fooled by a deceptive shill that disrespects the dead and cannot accept defeat.

               Well, that's a shame. I'll just mention one of the points that I made to srayzie, which she labels as "manipulation" but which really just qualifies as due diligence.
              </p>
              <p>
               She has gone absolutely "all in" on the idea that Tory Smith
               <em>
                can't
               </em>
               have been lying, that he

                must
               </em>
               have died. But then she ignores all of the research I did on the organizing of the cover-up, the financing, the other phony insiders (

               as his sockpuppet; both have stopped posting. I similarly hammered on

                @Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt

               , and he has stopped posting. I've accomplished a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
               There's a really simple intermediate position that srayzie could take here: She could decide that while I have done lots of solid research, I'm mistaken about Tory Smith. I took down three insiders, but was wrong about the fourth. I documented the money trail leading from Herb Sandler to David Brock to HLI, I did tons of good work, but I blew it on Tory Smith.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't admit to blowing it on Tory Smith, by the way. I'm still convinced I'm right about that. But that is a position that is open to srayzie, and she won't even consider it. Any attack on Tory Smith is proof to her that I'm a paid shill. Nothing else that I have said even interests her.

                See here for her response.

              </p>
              <p>
               I don't mind people being skeptical, or being held to account for mistakes. But what srayzie is doing here is unreasonable and a disservice to her fellow Voaters. It's also weirdly out of character for her.

             Thanks for all this information.  I will check it out a bit later when its quieter.  Thanks too for adding the links for me to look at.  If you are right this is the reason I posted it, hoping someone would show it to be true or false with evidence.....Thanks again, I will check it out.   :)

            The 'source' she cites is the late Tory Smith. Tory Smith was as fruity as they come, all rambling allegations, zero evidence. Write it off entirely until/unless we have something solid on Pence

            Mitchell was a radiologist and his wife Leslie was the Pediatrics doctor

            They worked for a place called Baycare

            Looked at a few things after the crash

           <p>
            Knew Steinberg was important because of Bridgewater
           </p>

            If you look Bridgewater Associates Inc, you will find the CEO just stepped down

            Work conditions there were not so good, can't remember specifics, look it up

           <p>
            There was another passenger on the plane that has yet been named

            2 planes took off from Punt and Islita

            One plane made it to San Jose, Costa Rica

            The other plane crashed....strange enough I looked up the people

            If this vid true, I have to assume Trump knew of this before he chose him

           <p>
            Has he been keeping the enemy close to keep an eye on them, or, well I hate to think of the or

            (Relevance: This video suggests that Mike Pence is directly connected to Pizzagate by way of being involved in the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children and child trafficking organized while he was in Indiana. It is suggested that he is involved in the cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities.)

            When Robert David Steele mentioned that a very close friend of Mike Pence was definitely a paeodophile, and that he was not sure whether or not Pence was aware of it, I said here on Voat that I would defend Mike Pence, unless evidence came out to the contrary.  After watching this video, it looks like I might have to admit that I was wrong in defending him.  Please take a look and decide for yourself what the truth is.  This is a very sad day if true, which I am leaning towards now after listening to this video
