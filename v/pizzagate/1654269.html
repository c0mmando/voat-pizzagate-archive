<p>This woman came out to the Australian media about her experiences as a child through to teenager in 2013. Since she\'s come out hundreds of other victims have been given the courage to speak up about their experiences and have done so. Across the planet, all of these stories, from complete strangers, are all similar if not exactly the same in content. Her story is absolutely insane and mind-blowing. If there is any account of global, widespread satanic child sex trafficking you hear, this has to be it. This woman has seen and experienced things so sick I couldn\'t even think them up if I wanted to. </p>
<p>She testifies she witnessed prime ministers, presidents, banking elites, celebrities - literally anyone in any position of power - participate in hundreds of Satanic rituals involving the rape, torture, murder and cannibalism of newborn babies and children. She claims this has infiltrated every level of society, every corporation, every company, every media outlet, especially in Australia. I am an extremely analytical and rational person. This woman is not lying about a single detail. All of her statements are backed up with times, locations dates and names. She is completely, 100% coherent and sane. </p>
<p>The most horrific things that stood out to me in her story which I\'ve linked included;</p>
<ul>
<li>Witnessing multiple Satanic rituals in Sydney churches in which pregnant teenage girls were sacrificed, cut open and their baby cannibalized by roomfuls of elites</li>
<li>Drugged children lined up in church and decapitated one by one, afterwards the elites would have orgies in the blood covering the floor of the church</li>
<li>Being taken to Bohemian Grove, dressed as a teddy bear and thrown into the redwoods with other children to be hunted, raped and killed by elites </li>
<li>Spending a week at Holsworthy military base, underground in a cage &quot;bonding&quot; with children who had never seen light and were bred specifically to be slaughtered. </li>
<li>Watching one of her closest friends and other young children be thrown into an oven one by one and being made to think she was next</li>
<li>Extreme MKUltra </li>

            This was posted on another site as well under "teddy bear picnics" which is a pedo involved organization. This is linked through Hollywood Ashton Kushtor/Mila who was on Senate floor yesterday about child sex trafficking. Joke, on behalf of McCain. The teddy bear picnic goes to the recent bust of pedophile hunting network in Australia that including satanic rape/murder of young children. Dr A. Kidman (Nicole's father was charged) as leader who is psychologist and CIA connections. He fled to Singapore died suddenly in hotel roon.

            Let's remain open minded that not all claimed victims are real.  If I had to bet money on this woman I actually do believe her BUT.  she makes a TON of claims throughout all her videos and interviews.  I'm heard her claim to be raped by just about everyone.  Not that it's a lie but damn.  She claims rape by "Billy Grahm, Ronald Regan, Nicole kidmans dad, and several Australian celebs.  She claims to have whitnessed decapitations and ritual killings in many large Catholic Churches.  She claims Nicole Kidman herself was front row whitness to some of this.   Yadda yadda.   I'm NOT saying she is lying but it's just a lot of high profile people for one girl to have prostituted to.  And correct me if I'm wrong but how the hell she got out alive having seen what she saw hasn't been adequately explained.

               Fair point.  Although some fine research has been uncovered by many latching into what initially appeared to be the tiniest insignificant detail, so it works both ways.  That it's coming more and more out into the open by whatever means is cause for some small celebration.  Long may it continue.

            That's as apt a question as 'why do any of it'.  The whole thing is a power-trip, and it probably gives them a rush to see someone screaming the truth and being considered a nut, and reassurance that even when someone tells they can continue getting away with it.

             I've seen someone on Voat post fairly extensive research and links in Antony Kidman....but can't find them now.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was affiliated with a known MK Ultra doctor in NY (?). Not a huge surprise, considering his line of work...biochemistry and children.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is (was) 100% elite pedophile. Zero doubt.

               NORMAL???  in some of the interviews Fiona talks about Nicole standing with arms crossed watching this abuse.  I would assume that when Tom Cruise found out he get the hell out.

                 Fiona is the name of the person who the original post is regarding "Fiona Barnett's Horrific Satanic Ritual Abuse Testimony (Extremely Disturbing)"   and "she seems normal on the surface"  It appears you are a bit out of the loop and may need to do some research of cut back on the weed.

                   OMFG,  YOU said "I don't know who Fiona is" and I said that Fiona is the victim and the person the POST YOU are replying to is about.  YOU said" Nicole seems normal"  YES, Nicole KIDMAN was also who was being mentioned and I said "That Fiona, in one of her interviews was being abused by Old Man Kidman and Nicole was standing there watching the abuse with her arms crossed. Nicole has been implicated.  Now you can go back to facebook.

            That was way more intense than I imagined it to be honestly. And I was expecting the worst of the worst and that was still shittier than I could even imagine. Her website was blocked on Opera, even though I clicked unblock, it blocked it again. Thats super suspect. edit: words

            Once I got over the shock of what had happened to her I really started to enjoy Fiona's interviews.  She is smart and very down to earth, a treasure.  She has also begun compiling information about paedophiles more recently in power in Australia through her podcasts Pedos Down Under Radio, interviewing other victims and witnesses.  Listening to Fiona's evidence really changes your understanding of how Australia operates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, another survivor whose interviews I recommend is the American man, Jay Parker, who has a similar illuminati/ sra/ mkultra background as Fiona.  (It's incredible how those children in different countries around the world suffered almost exactly the same tortures.)

            Fiona has posted on this forum a few times.  I think she grows weary of the topic at times as well as dealing with attacks from disinfo agents which is understandable.  If it weren't for PizzaGate, I wouldn't even be able to comprehend her story.....and if it weren't for her story, I wouldn't be able to grasp the extent of PizzaGate or PedoGate.

             I think this entire investigation speaks to something bigger than anything we could imagine.  The belief of Good/Evil, God/Devil has been eroded for so long and blurred into relativism. If this has spread to every corner of the earth, and into major organizations and government's, you then have to look at the end-game here. What's their ultimate goal?  Total power and subversion.  It's been proven that pedophilia and the occult have no racial, class, or religious boundaries.  In fact, the least likely suspects are the most likely to be implicated if history is any indication.
            </p>
            <p>
             What we're facing here is nothing short of, what I believe, a true struggle between good and evil.  That evil is accelerating.  If you look at statistics from the past 15 years, abuse and pedophilia cases have skyrocketed.  Take that for what it is. There's a number of reasons why this may be so.  The internet and availability is one, for sure.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I think there's something more sinister.  When you take into account the vast number of people involved, and how there is no common theme between them other than the fact they are human beings (and mostly male, but not exclusively)...what we're facing is what people may call "possession" but I don't think it's the mystical attribute we've come to associate with that word.  The Bible warns against sin, of course, but specifically mentions sins that do and do not "lead to death".  That death is both physical and of the person which is what we're dealing with here.
            </p>
            <p>
             A recent bust netted a musician from some band and what he told investigators was telling.  He said he started looking/being interested in child porn a year prior and "became an addiction".  This is an older guy, so why the recent interest?  I think a lot of people allow themselves to slide into this evil.  It starts small, and without guidance or constraint, their "tastes" get more perverted.  Once down that hole they have to do even worse things to hide and cover up their acts.  Which, I believe, leads people into an utterly black pit of sin where their soul has completely perished.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why prayer is advocated so much. It works. It's never too late for people to stop, turn back, renounce themselves and their actions.  But so many believe this is the beginning and end of their lives, and the flesh is all that matters so they will go to their deathbeds hiding secrets, turning a blind eye, and protecting themselves at ALL costs.

             Yeah she sent me a little direct note.  She is a smart lady and I believe her totally.  At first you cant quite believe it all.  But after months and months of similar stories.....I have given up on disbelief.  Its all true.....and if Trump cant stop this or if they kill him.....it falls to us Normals to gather arms and rise up in rebellion and begin a cleansing old fashioned style.  By that I mean our constitutional right to create militia and join with whatever element of the military is awake and on our side.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the reason behind the endless false flag mass killings in America to take away our right to bear arms.   But they failed in that task.  There are more guns in America than people.   And I think finally we understand why our Founding Fathers wanted it that way.  Our right to bear arms is not for hunting or target practice or home defense even......it is the final fall back position of a harassed population.......hunting down the Tyrants and shooting them down.

              Since she had previously contacted you, perhaps you can reach out to her and invite her over to the thread.

             Wow, that's awesome I didn't know that. Would be great to have her in this thread at any point she feels comfortable. I'm sure she gets it every day but would be great to let her know we're all with her and on her side. How she isn't completely insane is beyond me.

              I think she has a blog.  It was posted on here a week or two ago. She is beyond courageous.

             Yes it's very very dark stuff, but Fiona is possibly the most suitable person to lead a movement for victims and survivors. She's extremely down to earth, rational, seemingly normal and honest, and above all mind blowingly brave. She has the potential to wake people up.

             Don't let this shit get you down. We are learning. We're discovering that we have been lied to for our whole lives. That in itself is liberating because from the moment we started this public investigation we were freed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now we just need everyone else to wake up
