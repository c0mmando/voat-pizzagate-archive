<p>Since March, at least four women and girls have gone missing: Sadaria Davis, 15; Shantieya Smith, 26; Victoria Garrett, 15; and Anna Stanislawczyk, 18. Davis was found dead in an abandoned building May 11. The other three are still missing.</p>
<p>&quot;We started noticing that young women were disappearing and nobody was finding them,&quot; the Rev. Robin Hood said in an interview Thursday. &quot;Increasingly, the neighborhood began to talk about people that were missing. We know sometimes that people who are runaways or missing — they sometimes show up. But the fear that we have ... is that these last four young ladies didn\'t show up, and one of them is dead.&quot;</p>
<p>He continued: &quot;It\'s terrifying. It really doesn\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out something is going on.&quot;</p>
<p>Moore said Smith was last seen in late May with a man she knows from the neighborhood. He has since changed his phone number, Moore said, and even threatened the family. WGN News attempted to speak with the man but were unable to find him.</p>
<p>“Our biggest fear is there is some type of predator loose, whether they’re kidnapping or murdering, we need answers,” Hood said.</p>
<p>Shantieya Smith, 26, was last seen May 25 in the 1600 block of South Central Avenue.
Victoria Garrett, 15, was last seen June 5 in the 4000 block of West Grenshaw Street.
Anna Stanislawczyk, 18, was last seen March 16 in the 3600 block of West Filmore Street.
Sadaria Davis, 15, was last seen April 27 in the 4200 block of West Adams Street. She was found dead May 11.</p>

<p>Sadaria Davis Found Dead</p>
<p>There have been reports that Sadaria was found with MISSING ORGANS and her Fingers Cut Off</p>

<p>Sadaria Davis was allegedly a friend of Kenneka Jenkins, the teen who was found dead in a hotel freezer in Chicago.</p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Sadaria Davis was recently found dead in an abandoned building after being reported missing back in April. The teenage girl was discovered on the floor of a vacant apartment less than a mile from her home, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. There was no indication how Davis died, or why she was in the abandoned building, a Chicago Police Department spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>After finding her, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office conducted an autopsy on Davis but couldn’t determine the cause and manner of her death.</p>
<p>A number of people have taken to social media to express their condolences to Davis and her family. Others have also alleged that the teen was found mutilated, with her organs and fingers removed, and was also a friend of Kenneka Jenkins, the teen who was found dead in a hotel freezer in Chicago in September of last year.</p>
<p>In a separate report from CBS Chicago, Davis’ disappearance is believed to be associated with several other girls who have gone missing on the West Side of Chicago. Anna Stanislawczyk, Shantieya Smith, and Victoria Garrett have been missing since March. Both Stanislawczyk and Garrett are teens while Smith is an adult.</p>

<p>Parents\' horror when they found exhumed son\'s organs had been replaced by NEWSPAPER after he died on school wrestling mat</p>
<p>The parents of a teen athlete found dead in a wrestling mat have described their horror at finding his body was stuffed with newspaper and his vital organs missing when they exhumed him.</p>
<p>Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, believe their son Kendrick, 17, was murdered despite authorities claiming his January death was an accident. They won a court order to have his body dug up in June and a second, independent, autopsy performed.</p>
<p>However, they were sickened when the postmortem revealed the teen\'s brain, heart, lungs, liver and other viscera were missing from his body and old newspapers, complete with ads for J.C. Penney, were in its place.</p>

              That is definitely organ harvesting.  They might have had people waiting somewhere in the city for their organ that they paid big dollars for in advance.  Somebody cherry picked those kids just like the friend that went missing earlier. That video was pure fuckery going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know this is a huge industry and huge money.  Let me tell you what I saw yesterday.  A Mexican guy posted on Twitter (
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/yealJesus">
               @yealJesus
              </a>
              )  a 40sec or so video of harvesting a young teen boy’s organs while he is still alive. It is called a medical harvesting. There were several men participating and the young boy was lying half way on what appeared to be a dead adult man in the dirt.  The boy was gagged so he couldn’t scream.  I could not see the adult man’s head, so the head might have been missing.  This evil man has the boy cut completely open of his torso cutting through ribs, etc. and the boy obviously appears to be in shock as he twists and turns under the knife.  You know there are no pain med drips going in this child’s arm.  The man slaps the boy hard on the side of his face to keep him responsive. Another poster said these are performed out in the remote areas and these guys are trained to keep the person alive until they remove all their organs.The poster said he had seen a young girl with all her organs removed in the desert.  This video is not for the faint of heart. You will never be unable to see it.  Lots of blood. Carmencita, you could NEVER unsee this.  This boy’s stomach sack was blowing out like a balloon as he tried to breathe and they were pointing and laughing at it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Honestly, I wish this video could be shown to everyone trying to flee to the US.  These dumbass parents would not be so quick to toss their six-year-old over a fence with no food, water in 100 degree heat with only a slip of paper in his pocket with his supposed mother’s phone number. These teenage boys might think different of going out in the desert trying to find their way.  I would love for this to air on MSM and all these bleeding heart Libs could see the real danger of trekking across a desert. This is real organ harvesting is big time  in and out of the US and billions of $$$ industry.

              This is very real folks and I believe law enforcement in Chicago dealing with these kids know a lot more than they will say.  I know the area well and the corruption is rampant.  Look who is the mayor, need not say more.  There are clean cops as well as dirty ones and they are definitely running a organ harvesting business.  ChicagoO’Hare Airport is huge and it would be real easy to fly in and out with a wad of cash to pave the runway with.

              Pray for all this people.

               Its shocking.  Chicago must be asleep.  The Black Community has been desensitized.  Imo, someone is killing them.  My theory is the police.  They are dressed like Black Site Ops.  They are shooting them in the back now.  I have not posted about one I found and he was allowed to lay in the street covered by a sheet.  People told the EMTs that he was moving but the ignored it and let him lay there for an hour.  I believe the Ambulance Cos. are involved and they are stocked with people that will carry out their orders.  Something is seriously wrong there. Also I believe Emanuel has the same type of Police Chief as they have in DC.  Just like Newsham.

                Just what I posted. We think a like. That is what I was saying. I also think a lot of that black on black crime is blk Ops taking them out and running body parts.

                 I have hated Emanuel since he was with Bill C.  He is a cocky puny little rat.  I would not want to meet him in a dark alley.  His father was with Irgun an Israeli terrorist group and Rahm left here to join and fight the in the Israeli army since he had dual citizenship.  What a deal he has going there.   If those people ever find out, I can't even imagine. Yeah, I have always thought we thought alike, that's why I pinged you.

                  I need ask you this.  Sarah Sanders was kicked out of the Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington Va last night. I was reading their website and they were talking about farm to table fresh meats and veggies and named the places they would buy from. This whole write up reminded me of research that someone did on here and we were shocked somebody’s daughter owned it. I want to say Chuck Schumer’s kid but my mind is pickled with almost two years of this stuff.  Do you recall somebody owning a restaurant or farm that tied into all this perverted crap?  Not the one where Podesta butchered pigs either.  I was just wondering if Sarah was trying to get us to see something.

                   There were two guys that owned a farm on the east coast and they were connected to Alfantis somehow.  A chicken farm but that is not somebody's daughter.  Other than that I can think of no one else. As you say, pickled is how my mind feels too.  Now you have me wondering.   If I remember anything I will send along.  Btw, I just read the article again about the kid lying in the street.  Here it is

            What I remember about him is that he was DIRTY and so was his dad who also was DIRTY and is deceased now.

           <p>
            Must have been tough for them to uh, spend so long on a waiting list like regular folk. Especially as they may have needed to procure organs in a hurry, given filming times or getting back to political careers etc...

            Just posting this here instead of starting a new thread. Maybe could start another organ trafficking post up top soon, because you guys, this to me IS pizzagate.
            <strong>
             Chicago
            </strong>
            is the connection. Carm, youre so right to focus on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, a mystery. Whats UP with this weird connection between
            <strong>
             Selena Gomez
            </strong>
            and her kidney transplant IN
            <strong>
             CHICAGO
            </strong>
            (I know!! WHAT!! Straight off the rack right from the Rosemont Hotel? Her
            <em>
             "best friend donated it"
            </em>
            MY ASS....) back around May/June of last year and the WEIRD references to Kenneka Jenkins walking into a freezing in Selena's video for "Fetish" released in July of last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BW8POwrAcys/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=selenagomez">
             https://www.instagram.com/p/BW8POwrAcys/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=selenagomez
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Internet sleuths have been onto this for a while. Reddit, LipstickAlley. And it will kinda blow your mind. Comments sections are full of "
            <em>
             Kenneka was killed for her kidney that was sold to Selena
            </em>
            " but the timeline doesnt quite add up as Kenneka went missing on Sept 09/10  and Selena's operation was a few months earlier. But even that's weird because there's never been exact clarification on when the operation exactly occurred. Just massive exposure when Selena released her hospital pictures on Sept 14th.
           </p>
           <p>

             https://www.instagram.com/p/BZBHr4Pg5Wd/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=selenagomez
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW, Selena does not have lupus or whatever crap she's making up. She has a massive coke n alcohol problem, and kidney ended up failing. There are also those that say there isn't even a kidney thing going on at all and she just spent that whole summer in rehab, but I think she did have the operation.
           </p>

            And did I mention

             Wow.  I am just in total shock.  The replies to the pic in the bed!  Lupus can call for replacing your liver at some point?  Is she totally lying then.  Oh, yes I have read things about her on CDAN and what a user she is. Including the freezer is beyond creepy.  So they already had planned on Kaneeka's demise earlier and they faked the operation time.  But in reality it took place around Sept. 9/10. Why would she send out the pics right after Kaneeka's death?  Of all the time she had, she picked that time right after the "accident".  And then she ads the Freezer!  Bleeping Baloney.

              Balony! I don't think Gomez had the operation had the operation around the time that Kenneka was supposed to have died, because the time she posted that pic of her and bestie faking their hospital stays (Sept 14th) she was already back at work on that Woody Allen film. (lots of tabloid pics everywhere)
             </p>
             <p>
              So she must have had the operation earlier and if it was Kenneka, then she was murdered earlier and the girl wandering around drunk in the hotel surveillance video is a fake (which many people think was the case anyways.)

                subverse commentators need to see this thread. This is so huge cant even. And to think was getting distracted by stupid Pa Sparkles and his dummy duchess daughter-ho. SMDH. Is there a direct connect from this hotel to Skippy? Doubt they've stayed there as too ghetto for them. But some politicos must have spent time there? I don't know chicago or rosemont at all.

               You are so right  It just came together for me.  new4now just sent me a link on the Autopsy results and it says that she was 5 ft 6in and weighed 159 lbs.  Well how in the heck is that possible.  If they used all her organs she would be a heck of a lot lighter BUT you just got it.  She was pretty thin in the video and on the morgue table she is 159.  Not possible.

                 Well, if you remember I posted that the ME had to fire one of the pathologists and go over all of his past reports.  I wonder about them, and we know that they are faking so many things for RE the mayor.  Whatever he wants he gets or you are gone.

             Will look at it.  Here is the thread with Jane Doe and she was a Black Child about 10-12 yrs. old.

             You may pick up a couple things in the comments.  But his post is what is really important.  He knows so much about the body regarding organ harvesting.  There is another thread on a hospital that they used for organ harvesting.  I will go through them later and send what may be important and will start looking through Cook County Morgue and who may be into the harvesting.  Look up melanin and pineal glands too.  Possibly the difference between the black and white ones make a difference.  I can't tell you how many times I thought I was going to Barf.  And I am one that can't stand the sight of blood or throw up.  Yikes.

                 I know.  I was mortified or days and even weeks.  I could not get her out of my mind and thought of her every night I went to bed. I think the police were covering for the guys that found her.  The long article that is now scrubbed, it said they thought she came from NC.  I saw a pic one time of the building and the basement where they found her.  The details drove me mad.

             Yes, I thought they were only after Black children but one of the girls is white.  Scary and Frightening times.  My friend tells me Amazon is trying to move there.  Another worry.

               Hey can you two check the Search and see if you can find an old thread on Kaneeka Jenkins?  I have searched under her name and Freezer and Crown Plaza and Rosemont   I know there was a thread on her in pgate and it had a lot of comments.  Everything I found is in other subs.  I am not that good at the Search.

                   You can ask Vindicator how to get into them.  There is a way and I can't remember.  I heard him telling someone how to do it.  So there is a way.

                   It's all a lie.  Did they just take out the kidney?  No.  I believe they would use all her organs.  They never waste anything.  It says 5 ft 6 in.  159 lbs.  How can she way that much?  I think they lied.  She would be a lot lighter.  They would not waste those organs they can make hundreds of thousands.

                 Then just keep reading ! OhMG!!   Listen, it lists the Chinese Organ Trade, I read an article by Jimmy Breslin (now deceased) about Rahm and it said that Rahm deals with the Red Chinese.  This could be the answer.  Red Cross Chinese and Rahm maybe.

                   Are those shootings set ups?  The ones that survive long enough are there organs used and then they die?  Or the ones that are near death?  When Trump brought up Chicago and called them out on it.  I took notice.  Something is just not right.  Too many organs in those shootings.

                    DAMN. Carm, can you do PART 2 of this thread tomorrow and reference this one? Im telling you: all the new celebrity suicides are to distract from this very topic. I know it. Celebrity suicides are the new school shootings SMDH Noone cares about shootings anymore/getting desensitized. That said, Bourdain for sure taken out by Weinsteins "people"

                     I won't be able to tomorrow.  Going out for most of the day.  Maybe Mon.  One of you would be better.  There is so much info.  It will be a Mile Long.  We should discuss it.  I pinged you to look at fogdryer's post.  It is on Rahm Emanuel.

                   Organ Trafficking is a real thing! White People have always killed Black People for their organs (Kidneys, Hearts, Lungs, etc.,) and there is a Long "List" of "WHITE' People waiting on organs. Forty Years ago The Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals of Cleveland was notorious for dealing in Organ Trafficking, " If" A Black Person went in for something Minor, they would have a "bad" reaction and die (Strange). It has now become a BILLION dollar$$$$ industry, so a lot of People (Especially Blacks) will have to die in order for "WHITES" (Organ Recipients) People to Live

                    We have come right back to the heart of pgate. The sale of illegal body parts and organs. OMG getting woke by the second. Do you think every time a celebrity needs a fresh organ, their 'handlers' send out an sos to different cities and a search conducted to find the right match (fast scanning through hospital records etc, schools etc) and a victim abducted and killed and made to look like suicide/kidnapping/accident etc Who else A List has had kidney/lung/heart/whatever transplants in recent years? DID THEY HAVE THEIR OPERATIONS IN CHICAGO?! Sh*tballs!

                      Mind racing. So how many shady ass docs have deliberately misdiagnosed patients into removing a diseased liver or kidney only for them to remove a healthy one to sell. Am guessing X-rays (like hotel surveliiance videos) can be faked. And Im not talking in China or Pakistan....I mean RIGHT HERE.

               I don't know how people can stay.  But my friend told me that they have left in the 10s of thousands.  Maybe that is their goal.  They want property like in Detroit.  Plus they want bodies.  May the burn forever or have a life filled with horrors.

                They're creating and will receive their just rewards. And moving isn't an option. Like in California. The good people want to leave, but then you're just going to leave it for someone else to clean up. So now they're fighting back through elections. That's key. Get these crazed lunatics out of office!

                 The small towns will be the catalyst to get things moving.  Schools are a great place to start.  Throw those bums out. The ones hiring sex offenders and screwing around with the money.  Run for office.  Even dog catcher is a start.  Dog catchers get around to all the hoods and can see what is going on everywhere.

             This woman who's daughter is missing and is demanding action, she needs someone that will get people riled up.  Riled up so much that they can get a thousand people into the streets, but it must be peaceful and strong.  They will be joined by some white people I am sure.  It will take a very strong movement to beat this.  They need to get rid of that mayor and the main problem in all of these big cities with Black people is the Church Ministers.  They are bought.  They still get them to vote for Obama's Friend.  Also there is Election Fraud.  I just did another post that was on The Chicago School System and their not reporting rapes and also hiring teachers with sexual abuse records.  With all this going on,

               My link to Chicago has Black friends and this is what they tell her.  They don't go to the church in their hood because that Minister takes people aside around elections.  The women are the bosses, that I read myself and they go home and tell who to vote for.  It's really a tradition of sorts.  I think it is wearing thin now, but still strong enough.  Also they pass around money which is sorely needed in poor neighborhoods.  That surely goes on in all poor places.  It's so frustrating.  This is why the Deep State has been so successful for decades now.  If these people really saw the real truth there would be BEDLAM.

                 I think at some point you and I and mv should set aside a few days to dig into Chicago.  Dig deep.  Yes, there are hospitals that are using these organs of the kids.  I also think there is sharing of them when places are close nearby like Mil. and Chicago.

                   Yes, they are using the same operations all over.  Horrible.  If people really knew what was going on behind the scenes.  I remember when I researched St. Louis it led me to research the morgue in Cook County and WOW.  That place was and still is a Sick Site.  Dead Bodies Piled Up.  There was a woman who's daughter was missing for quite a while and no one would look for her.  The family called and called police and morgue and no answers.  I can't remember how she found out, but she found her at the morgue and she had been piled up for weeks with the others.  There was a whole Big Overhaul and I believe (don't quote me) that she was replaced.  Wow things coming back.   My friend calls it Crook County.   I will try to get what I can from her, but she gets really worked up and depressed talking about it.

            I remember the story of the girl being found in the freezer, and the video was so creepy. She seemed drugged or hypnotized or something. Nice find and I'm glad that people are starting to pay attention. We'll have to see what develops, as usual.

             Yeah, well I tried to find the one thread I worked on with a couple others about her but could not.  Others are avail. but not much info.  Took me quite a while to decide  what to use.  The story about Kendrick Johnson is also stomach churning.  Imagine your child's body stuffed with Paper Towels.  I can't even.

               Wow.  Amazing.  I believe you are correct that they have a price on their heads.  Especially in certain areas where it is heavier than others.  But yes, they are wanted.  This hopefully will bring more awareness.  The mothers are genuinely worried, and I hope they get a protest or march going or something.  I don't know why people are not in the streets by the thousands in that town.  The mayor should hang his head in shame.  He has not uttered one word, at least that I have been able to find.  He is in Lockstep with the Deep State.

                saying (quite correctly) that young black kids have a bounty on their head made me burst into tears. I saw the sweetest young Af-Am kid in the supermarket at lunch and he was so smiley with his pops and peeked at me through his fingers while giggling. Heart melted totally. I cant image what it is like to grow up with your life already so much in the negative. My heart hurts for Kenneka.

                 Oh I know of some of those great kids too having worked at a school.  I cant even imagine.  Those poor kids don't know and their parents either how much danger they are in each day.  So heartbreaking.  I had so much trouble going to sleep last night.  Yes.

              Yeah, I don't even want to imagine. I remember watching a YouTube video of the girl entering the kitchen and the closest thing the presenter came to finding any evidence that someone entered the kitchen after her or was already in there was a slight shadow, but even this was very obscure and you couldn't tell for sure if it was a shadow or camera glitch.

               Did you guys see the crime scene photos? WARNING: VERY VERY GRAPHIC. Only look if you think you can handle it. They gave me nightmares.  But important to see because it will be very very obvious that she did not just 'walk into a fridge'

               I read a ton about it and the one thought that sent chills down my spine was that that whole 'kitchen' area was actually an operating room where organs were removed. Not Kennekas necessarily, but certainly others. Also her mom's demeanor - like Kate McCann's - is very very 'off'....story goes she sold her kid plus 2 of her other kids who also died in mysterious circumstances to traffickers.
              </p>
              <p>
               RIP Kenneka.

                How Horrid.  I researched St. Lewis for a few months and now I seem to be finding the same and maybe worse in Chicago.  This stuff is awful.  A mother selling her children.  I can't even understand that.  And all of them?  I don't know if I can watch the vid, maybe tomorrow.  Before bed always reeks havoc with my Sleeping.  Yes.

                  I hate to say it, but I think not.  CPS, DCFS, whatever you want to call them are all in on the crimes against them.  I always prided many decades ago how we treated children and the elderly.  That pride is now gone.  Shame has replaced it.

                    Notice this person was not Black.  At least not with a name like that.  They take whoever they can get but they are after young and also the Black kids are very poor and parents are sometimes not keeping track because of various reasons.  They are upping the donations and blasting ads all the time to get people to donate their organs.  They are doing this in SCHOOLS!!!

                    As he suffered from spindle cell sarcoma, Jacob Sandersfeld told his mother that he'd like to donate his body to medical research.    SANDERSFELD is not a typical Black Name.

                Whaaat? Thanks for the info and I'll definitely check it out. What you're saying about the kitchen actually being an operating room is incredible. I appreciate the warning about the nightmare fuel. Going to bed now, but will see what you linked to in the morning.

                 you will have nightmares. There WAS someone waiting for her in the kitchen. It was a guy with the blue jacket from the room party. His image was one of many images that were scrubbed and manipulated before the hotel gave the final 'edited' footage to the police (not that the police weren't in on it...) I have a buddy from chicago who I asked to ask around to see what was up with that hotel and my buddy said it was well known drug deals and all kinds of shenanigans went on. No explanation on the 'shenanigans' part, but the luring of innocent victims for organ removal would not be far fetched (I got the impression.) Yes please dont anyone watch video until daylight.  Watching this poor girl stumble around the hotel was creepy enough.

                 Justice for Kenneka. It is one of the things on my very long list of things to keep researching when I have time.

                  I can't believe it, but then again I can.  Where did you find these things.  Yes I knew that the mother had lost other children but did not know about the other guy in the room.  I just knew as well from someone on here that the area and hotel were suspect too.  Also near Chicago, yeah, well that says it all.  All creepy for sure.  Did you see the video with the Black Guy from Chicago?  He also mentions a kid from Georgia who was stuffed with Papers.  I can't even.  This stuff is Gut Wrenching.  What thread did you discuss this case in?  I am not done with this story either.  I want to find the guy that was on a thread last year with me researching the case.  There is a longer thread but could not find.

                    Can you check for old post on her.  I think it was my post and MF deleted.  It had info on the Sheriff of Rosemont and the police investigators.  I don't know how to search for deleted.  Yes, Another Post needs to be done.  This will soon be off front page and that is the Kiss of Death.  Will be busy today.  Be back on this in the evening.   Need to look up people in Rosemont.

                      I am trying to find an old thread from last year where we researched Jenkins case and someone was on the thread that lives around there. I can't remember his name.  Tried to find thread I should have looked under other things besides her name.  Crown Plaza and Rosemont.  Will check for his name.

               The police put off checking on her until much later.  I remember that one of our members lives near there and said that the area is mafia and completely controlled.  I remember there were casinos and a huge outlet mall there to draw teens.  They sure know how to lure them. Very odd they are connected too.  Possibly a warning to shut those girls up.

                 Black kids were always a commodity even to their own people that wanted to make money.  It's disgusting.  But really it's not just about being black.  White people do it too to their own.  Nobody really cares anymore.  They just want more money and are sick beyond belief.  I agree they must be put away.  Before they multiply.

                   Yes you are so  right.  But they do want the melanin. The poor ones are just easier to get and those are usually the black and brown ones.  My friend told me about another one missing.  But she has not been talked about she said.  Maybe I can ask her to look into it.  Will ask her what part of town.

                     This is why they are trying to get everyone's DNA and why they have the kids now getting free tablets in school.  You can bet they all use facial recognition.  I also am leery of the Coding Classes they are now pushing on kids.  Have not looked into that yet.  Also in the large cities they are pushing TECH Really Big.  Opening all kinds of Tech Farms (my name)  They are up to something sinister with that.  The beheading of children and young bodies is also telling.  The pineal gland is involved with that.

                     and I did some research on it.  There is a case in St. Louis of a young girl Jane Doe who was beheaded.  He though it had to do with her pineal gland.  Also some really sinister shenanigans going on with the police investigating the case.  The article on their report is scrubbed now.  We came to the point where we thought we knew who did it.  But we could not get hard evidence.  These cases are extremely sick and sad.  I wish I had kept my notes.
