             I think the only think that makes me stop and wonder is my distrust of the police... I think MJ was probably guilty, but I have a deep distrust of TPTB and wonder why some big names get caught/prosecuted and other's don't.  Like Jimmy Saville, they waited til he died to release all the info on his extensive child sexual abuse, but with MJ there was tons of attention on him and his alleged crimes while he was alive

            Joe Jackson should be charged also! Joe psychologically abused his kids, possibly physically, maybe even sexually. 
I totally believe Joe &amp; to an extent Katherine knew that Clive Davis was a bisexual with an usual liking for children! 
Joe Jackson sold his kid's souls for fame!
Evil bastard!
           </p>
           <p>
            I also go back &amp; forth on MJ guilty or innocent?
I really think he was a  MK Ultra victim.
Sadly, after learning about the Evil Pedos and celebrities, I am 85% sure MJ was a Pedo.
A talent wasted.

             Yeah I believe he was MKULTRA himself.   I think there is a chance he was not a pedo himself.  Not a big chance but a chance.  I think that maybe the Jews decided to use Pedophilia to destroy him.  Micheal makes some comments later in his life about the Jews doing all this on purpose...they build you up to the top of the world and then take it all away.  He said they do it for fun......so I dont know what to believe.  Regardless even if he did become a Pedophile himself....his guilt is somewhat diminished in my eyes since I dont think he had true free will.  He was made into a Pedophile.

              I agree! I think MJ suffered tremendously! I blame his father!
Although, once grown and if for sure MJ did harm children, then that for sure was on MJ. I know he may not have had complete control of his thoughts but he knew right from wrong.

              Not sure if anyone came forward. Just through the yrs there was hints.
Whitney Houston was another one that Davis had control of.

            This is related to PG because it deals with alleged child sexual abuse by an elite entertainer, and it also involves a case where the alleged perpetrator's guilt is not completely clear.  Was Jackson framed by TPTB, or is he guilty?  It looks like new alleged victims have come forward, and their lawyers are looking for even more victims to corroborate the stories.  And perhaps
            <strong>
             for the first time ever
            </strong>
            , alleged victims are claiming Michael Jackson was involved in an
            <strong>
             organized elite pedophile ring
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            On that note, I thought Jackson's first accuser Jordy Chandler had committed suicide.  Perhaps I am wrong and it was his father who killed himself?
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, this case gets into a lot of PG-related intricacies, especially related to the elite.  See the following quote from the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Robson — who says he was abused dozens of times by the pop star during trips — is one of three plaintiffs making similar claims in related lawsuits against Jackson’s companies. The choreographer, 34, filed an amended complaint in September claiming Jackson and key staffers at MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures ran a 'sophisticated child sexual abuse procurement and facilitation operation.'"
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Although I have often wavered on whether Jackson is guilty, I find it impossible to dismiss all of these allegations and sometimes lean toward him being guilty.  Thoughts?

             I think he is probably guilty.  It seems clear he was molested himself so I have a degree of sympathy for him but I won't whitewash his terrible crimes.  He is widely beloved though so if most people are able to swallow the bitter truth about him it could really open up the public consciousness to accepting the existence of elite pedophile rings.  People don't give two shits about John Podesta in comparison to Michael Jackson.
