<blockquote>
<p>In March 2013, the company mounted a marketing campaign for sexy underwear titled &quot;Bright Young Things&quot; <strong>directed at teen and pre-teen girls that drew considerable negative attention</strong>. The underwear contained wording including &quot;call me&quot;, &quot;feeling lucky&quot;, and &quot;wild&quot;.[13] The company was accused of &quot;sexualising&quot; teenage girls. When the ad campaign was launched, Victoria\'s Secret chief financial officer Stuart Burgdoerfer said that the line of underwear allowed &quot;15 or 16 years old... to be older, and they want to be cool like the girl in college&quot;. After the criticism increased, Victoria\'s Secret removed the items from the company\'s website and said that the ad campaign was meant for college-age women. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It appears as though Ms. Chandler, a possible Mk Child herself, was placed in Hollywood as a handler and liaison between Hollywood elite, celebrity and working Hollywood as a supplier of fresh young teen meat for &quot;modelling&quot; and &quot;industry&quot; practices such as sex trafficking, drug muling and ritual victimization among other things. This corroborates much long held research here that MODELLING AGENCIES have been and are being used as conduits for this activity, in this case The Midland Agency. Others include John Casablancas Elite Model Management, <strong>Paolo Zampolli and Jeffrey Epstein\'s ID</strong>, Lynda Erkiletian\'s THE Artist Agency, FORD, <strong>IMG, and even claims NXIVM used modelling agencies.</strong> </p>

<p>“I have a rougher version of beauty,” said Pearce, who had recently returned from casting the Hood By Air performance at <strong>Art Basel</strong> Miami Beach. Though certain models might be a “Walter kid or a Rachel kid,” as Chandler put it, it’s at the intersection of their aesthetic, each subversive in their own way, that Midland exists.</p>

            I did a post on Wexner a while back.  Just to inform people about him and his wife.  I never could stand him. They sponsor a huge benefit at their home each year.  More people attend the benefit than live in the town.

                 Can you describe the money making scam? Are they selling t-shirts and hats or something? I would never buy anything like that and I don't know anyone who would. Tacky.

                Donations, shirts, huge youtube channels that have been monetized, selling apps.....maybe some more things I don't even know about. The whole thing is collapsing right now though. Every day lately somebody that was once involved comes forward and admits what was happening behind the scenes. I hate it for the people that really believed in it but it had to happen because it was never real.

            There is another model agency (a British one) that we should include in the list: Storm models (Storm Model Management).

            recently did a post about it. It was the model agency that created the 'heroin chic' back in the day. One of its models has been Kate Moss, who was allegedly raped from the age of 14, while modelling.

             Jesus trys to tell us so in this passage "the faith of the gentile women.
            </p>
            <p>
             Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 22 A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession." 23 Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us." 24 He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel." 25 The woman came and knelt before him. "Lord, help me!" she said. 26 He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs." 27 "Yes, Lord," she said, "but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table." 28 Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
            </p>
            <p>
             Important details are added from the parallel passage in Mark 7.24-29:
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. 25 In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet. 26 The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. 27 "First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs." 28 "Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." 29 Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."

              "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."
             </p>
             <p>
              Jesus refers to Himself as the bread of the passover. He shares this during the Last Supper (Passover meal). The Jews who continued to follow Him after this became the foundation of the new Church. They were now Christians and were no longer under Jewish law. Jesus is the children's bread. As we know, only a remnant of Jesus' Hebrew/Jewish people believed Him and followed. This is why later, the Apostle Paul was called to take the Good News of salvation in Christ to the non-Hebrew/Jews called Gentiles. Many believed and were converted to Christianity. They left their pagan child-sacrificing practices for Christ. These were the "dogs" who ate the "bread crumbs."
             </p>
             <p>
              2 Corinthians 5:17 King James Version (KJV)
17 "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone today, Jew or Gentile who rejects Christ is not born again and is not saved.
             </p>
             <p>
              Romans 10:9 King James Version (KJV)
9 "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."

               A pure mind equals a pure heart. Put on the armour of our Father and set your self free. I say this because I care about you.

            Given prominent seating at the wedding to the bemusement of many. If one is being groomed for political life it's not so surprising.  Pity then that  Amal is really just a junior barrister in her chambers with only a Masters law conversion degree to justify her presence there (apart from the arms dealer uncle) and George ..well.. you know..
