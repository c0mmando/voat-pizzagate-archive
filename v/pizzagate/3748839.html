Founder of NIMH is Robert Hanna Felix, a 33rd degree mason. Dr. Harris Isbell served directly under him. Isbell targeted black drug addicts. The infamous NIMH rat experiments were performed by NIMH officials that were the “parole officers” to Charles Manson. Roger Smith was also an advocate for legalizing narcotics (such as LSD). Manson himself is connected to Laurel Canyon, a hot spot of hollywood/clown fuckery. Through Vito Paulekas, Manson has connections to the Rockefellers. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_explosion">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_explosion</a> Gasoline explodes at 1.4-7.6% fuel to air ratio. That is a very low number.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_there_a_chemist_available_that_can_get_me_data_on_the_evaporation_rate_of_gasoline">https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_there_a_chemist_available_that_can_get_me_data_on_the_evaporation_rate_of_gasoline</a> Gasoline’s lighter components evaporate VERY quickly while the heavier components evaporate at a slower rate.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detonation_velocity">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detonation_velocity</a> Gas explosions average at 1.6k-1.8k m/s. Meaning that given the poor ventilation in a garage and everything else mentioned above, if Josephz Barsi were to have actually lit off a match, he would have been hit by the explosion. This makes the “set off the fire in the garage, then shoot himself in the head” narrative completely impossible, as he would have blown himself up in the process.</p>

<p>Lastly, a new meme tearing apart the gasoline -&gt; gunshot narrative.</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith\'s mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.</p>
<p>-The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).</p>
<p>Accomplices: LAPD, the media, Ruth Hansen?, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, setting them on fire as part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Basically, it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source being programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course the fire destroys the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death?</p>',

           Look at page 195. Founder of NIMH is Robert Hanna Felix, a 33rd degree mason. Dr. Harris Isbell served directly under him. Isbell targeted black drug addicts. The infamous NIMH rat experiments were performed by NIMH officials that were the “parole officers” to Charles Manson. Roger Smith was also an advocate for legalizing narcotics (such as LSD). Manson himself is connected to Laurel Canyon, a hot spot of hollywood/clown fuckery. Through Vito Paulekas, Manson has connections to the Rockefellers.

           Gasoline is VERY volatile and an explosive like gunpowder. 1 gallon of gasoline = 14 sticks of dynamite in explosive force.

           Gasoline explodes at 1.4-7.6% fuel to air ratio. That is a very low number.

           Gas explosions average at 1.6k-1.8k m/s. Meaning that given the poor ventilation in a garage and everything else mentioned above, if Josephz Barsi were to have actually lit off a match, he would have been hit by the explosion. This makes the “set off the fire in the garage, then shoot himself in the head” narrative completely impossible, as he would have blown himself up in the process.

           Lastly, a new meme tearing apart the gasoline -&gt; gunshot narrative.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith's mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LAPD, the media, Ruth Hansen?, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, setting them on fire as part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Basically, it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source being programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course the fire destroys the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
          </p>

           Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.
