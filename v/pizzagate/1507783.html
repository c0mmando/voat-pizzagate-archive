<p>In the post I said my brother bookmarked an article talking about Canaanites and this work explains how the Canaanites vacated their land and migrated to Europe where they met and got along with the Celts and their druids. Here is the article he sent me and I\'ve read. It shows various traditions adopted from the Canaanites in present day Europe and even Christianity in general. Christianity has adopted some things from both Canaanites and the Celts, like the plant, Holly. Here is the article explaining the relationship of the Phoenicians, Celts and Canaanites. It\'s a bit long but a very good read to connect the dots. I\'m currently trying to trace this movement to present day. We need to understand this background. It has opened my mind to current evidence in the ongoing investigation.</p>

            Another example is the Christmas tree and the date of christmas - see my detailed post on your previous thread regarding Isis/Osiris/Horus and Nimrod/Semiramis/Tamuuz for an explanation on this. That ties directly to the 14+fish symbolism found in the Podesta Pic. Also Easter Eggs.

             yes, I recall the story behind the 14 + fish, I'll look into your post and see how this connects as well

            Mod labeled it as such because he/she disputes the etymology of the word cannibal. I tried to argue on your behalf w/ said mod and provided some sources/links while you were away, but alas...

            maybe the mods label your post "accuracy in question"  simply cose its hard to see the link between ur stuff and pizzagate itself...
iam not saying they are right, but i actually believe  should have better place to discuss this subject, for moment prooving this related to pizzagate seems quite impossible ,at least for commun people (i didnt check your other sub yet)..
           </p>
           <p>
            i have quite good knowledge on some of this related subjects....the celts links with christiannity etc...i am currently trying to write a book about a Graal legend where i live in France and some part of it will probably speak about this old beliefs, celtics, related to christians beliefs, etc...like some sort of old sacrifice rituals maybe etc...iam not sure for moment, and cant speak too much of it now, i am still researching on all of this too, and i cant investigating PizzaGate, the current world news, conspiracies etc,  and this all together lol...
maybe i should take a break with the internet but this thing have now my attention i can't help for it.....
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want, send me a private message, i could maybe have some good infos related to celts/christianity etc u maybe could like...
peace
