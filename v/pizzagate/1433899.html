            I agree, I think we need to ask Tony and John Podesta where they were when madeleine mccann disappeared.  If not this question, we need to force the top level people to answer a direct question about this.

             Yes. We need proof either way. They need also to be asked what their pizza code means. i want to see how they respond.They aren't fooling anyone. it's code for something. If it's so innocuous, why can't they tell us and clear their name? UGH.
