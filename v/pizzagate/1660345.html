<p>Donald Trump knows this because he himself is a 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Freemason.

             A claim without proof, that contradicts all lower levels.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're thinking of the Illuminati, which have taken great joy in pretending to be masons.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was the Taxil Hoax.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another reason why people think that is because it conflicts with their devout faith. In the freemason article I talk about this a bit, it's a charge thrown against the masons to delegitimize the movement. The globalist Church (Vatican, Russian Orthodox) has been doing this since forever.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can even put this to a simple litmus test. Which organization has decades-long evidence of fucking children? The masons? No, it's always a claim with no evidence to back it up. The Church, however, hell yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the charge ever is, is classical projection techniques. It's why they have those thoughts in their minds in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember, many masons were Christian - they just hated the Church.

            Spread my links as far as you can, more people need to be made aware of the notion that when pizzagate is over, there will aways be another scandal to take its place.

            That he's a mason? No. And he has no need to. Sure, his family knows, because they're family.
           </p>
           <p>
            The masons (long-time business partners) whom confirmed him are now dead. I actually named them - with sources - in the article, but the truest understanding will come from reading it completely in one sitting.
           </p>

            He tells them the "truth", which aligns with masonry. That people can be ruled, but only if the rule isn't tyrannical. We're in the midst of a revolution right now, you can feel it, it seems all so familiar because it is historically familiar.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Because he is not a member of the Elite. They hate him.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And he isn't lying about that. Masons always have been against the globalist elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's nothing scary about masonry, it's the most patriotic thing ever.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Trump is not discreet at all.

            So there's three levels of Trump-Tales:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Trumpification - if he does something, he's all in. The entirety of the Freemason post shows the great lengths he went through to convert his Tower into a masonic shrine.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Truthful hyperbole - which he pioneered in the real estate market. He was the first to lie about the floor heights. Trump understands psychology like Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is explicitly removed from him as a person and only applies to him as a showman.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) His family makes a ton of inside jokes. The press (not being the smartest crayons in the box) either don't understand, or don't care (sensationalism sells).They make him out to seem like a buffoon. He uses this to his advantage.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is very discreet when he needs to be.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to the Bonwit Teller episode (his first outing as John Barron), he's pulled this stunt numerous times.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are ten random times he mind-fucked people.

            He trolled Obama so hard on this one:
