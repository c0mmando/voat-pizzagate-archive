<p>&quot;Though it is the offspring of the dynamic duo in charge of Buck\'s Fishing &amp; Camping, the pizza parlor apparently owes its name to last year\'s sad passing of liquor store owner and neighborhood legend Sid Drazin, who, with his wife Bernice, ran Adams-Morgan\'s Comet Liquors for 25 years. Carole Greenwood and James Alefantis have acquired the sign and, barring objection from the usual neighborhood cranks, will get it up, no doubt, where they\'re good and ready. &quot;</p>

<p>The whole thing fits of course very well:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPP only opens at 17:00 and got a permission to remain open until 02:00 in the night</li>
<li>The whole outside looks more like a night club than a pizza joint (not just the sign but also the colored light bulbs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people have argued that the symbolism of the sign (stars and crescents) are related to paganism/satanism. I could not verify anything of that, but found a few links about Comet Liquors / Sid Drazin:</p>

            This has been long since established, but for accuracy, the site of Comet wasn't a liquor store before Comet came along, it was the Thai Room. The liquor store that the sign came from was a different address. I do, however, believe that he chose that particular sign for a reason.
