   It's become clear to me that for us to make progress in this battle, we must come to understand what the Dark-Web is, and how it works.

            lets not forget these folks also have access too SAP's. the more secure sites require a program running locally in order to authenticate visitors. you don't even want to ping the ip's of these sites, as was proven months ago when the FBI infiltrated a Tor/onion network porn ring, even operating it

            the arrests to snare more pervs.  i'm savvy enough to know even Tor and a vpn can't always keep you anon. it's only reasonable that if you randomly knock on someone's door (pings or visits site) they'll want to know who's there,,, even more so, with an emphasis on self protection, if they're engaged in

            after going 'click-click-WTF?! o. m. g.' 
remember: this shit is real as real can get, and the players have proven repeatedly  they are more ruthless and cold blooded about secrecy. the Clinton's philosophy honed in arkansas is

            more than anything we need to make the masses aware that there is a DARK WEB to begin with.  Most people are just too oblivious.   So, the more people know about the dark web the more reliable it is to believe all of the underground corruption that has been right under our fingertips this whole time.

            Unless you have hacking skills, it seems pointless to focus too much effort on the dark web. I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding child porn if you go looking for it, but what good would that do your investigation? You would have no way to match usernames with real-life identities. The most you could hope for is that someone is stupid enough to use the same username on the dark web as on the surface web, and even that would be difficult to prove. If you're on the East Coast and want to investigate something, maybe you could check out the site of that Rehoboth Beach house that was leveled.

            careful, mods may send you back to the stone age on this one... I posted something similar a few days ago and it was removed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps they feel... compromised?... if we shoudl go mucking aobut on the dark web and discover that maybe they have identical usernames there? who knows, but they used a pretty specious argument against a post that was well marked for "caution!"

            We should create a legal statement for anyone who want's to dive into the 'illegal' site of research, that will make clear that the visiting of illegal webpages is ONLY done out of investigative purpose. Not sure if something like this could work, but I think you will need a disclaimer and keep a logbook of your research to show that you are not in there for your own personal kicks...

             It's not going to work. If it did, anyone who is wanting to look at that garbage because they are creepy scum could just do the same thing. "Oh, I was researching."
            </p>
            <p>
             The reality is, this kind of actual research is best left to the folks who are actually in a position to be able to do something about it.

              I was thinking about the same thing, that it will be misused by actual pedo's. But what if researchers would keep open logs, and refer to this in the disclaimer, showing that there are actually investigating. If pedo's would start adopting this, they should also provide research..

               It's not going to work man, how are people going to actually do anything about it? If what you say is true, and people in a position to do something aren't willing, then what good is this research you're talking about going to do anyway? Who are they going to tell? Or is the idea to just start shooting people who are suspected pedo's?

               It's not realistic or reasonable or wise for average citizens to start trying to infiltrate child trafficking networks. It's fucking stupid, actually.

                well they could prove or debunk the pizzacode or lurk in on how the ring is transforming now that parts are being uncovered. If you can't see the value of public investigation then I wonder why you are here. I certainly don't promote the idea that everyone should start looking into the DW, more I am thinking about a strategy where skillfull people would be able to do this without falling into a trap that they become suspect, there must be a way. And if you don't wan't to contribute to this dialog and rather just say it's impossible without thinking of possible solutions: ok I get your opinion, move on

             The YouTube link discussed other sites where foreign woman were being trafficked. Its not just pedophilia. I wouldn't click on to that either. However, there are probably some young women and men that can be liberated from captivity and compelled prostitution.

             I see everyone's point. I hope LE will continue to work hard on this issue. I cringe when I think about who control the Feds, and what their history has involved.

             We should all increase our presence on the dark Web to protect the people who need to blend in. The 4chan hacker who doxxed the entire Clinton Foundation needs a helping hand. The best we can do for people like that, is just use tor and VPN.

               We can't expect them to do anything except attack Americans. Our government is simply not ours anymore. That changed when JFK's head was blown off.

               Our government is a foreign entity.

            I agree that trafficking without a doubt occurs on the dark net - but be careful not to identify it as a tool only used by criminals. I use tor for as much as I can, not because I am some supervillain but because there is a global movement to eradicate privacy online - many companies even selling or buying your info. I do not pay my internet service provider so that they can market my browing habits.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tor is not even secure, several sites I know of have been raided. The problem is on top of the tor network they logically use encryption like PGP to communicate. Seizing a bunch of encrypted info doesn't do you much good

            2716: Clinton’s Snuff-Film Server Tor – Serco’s Ammo Zulu Actors – Dallas 8(a) Money Shot Cops
           </h1>
           <p>
            by 
United States Marine Field McConnell 
Plum City Online – (AbelDanger.net) 
July 9, 2016
1. Abel Danger (AD) claims that for nearly twenty years, Hillary Clinton has carelessly allowed her agents in DOJ Pride and the State Department to use their private servers to transmit real-time snuff films over the Navy’s patented onion router (Tor) network and to blackmail into silence their mutual and terrified enemies – both domestic and foreign.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              AD claims that Serco 8(a) companies set up the Clinton servers to track the distribution of ammunition and Zulu timing signals needed by saboteurs, assassins, crisis actors and camera crews for the “first live-broadcast mass snuff film in human history” on 9/11.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              AD claims that Serco 8(a) companies associated with the U.S. Defense Ammunition Center trained the late Micah Johnson in the tactical skills needed to obtain time-stamped money shots of the snuff-film murders of five white cops on July 7, 2016 in Dallas.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              United States Marine Field McConnell asks James Comey – a former director of Serco’s banker HSBC and the current FBI director – to hand over evidence of Clinton’s extreme carelessness in the use of private Tor servers to the families of police killed in Dallas so they can develop class-action suits for the wrongful death of their relatives.

             Know Serco, its goes back to 1920's, then called RCA-UK, owned by Bush family
            </p>
            <p>
             RCA-UK supplied HITLER tech, just like bush bankers supplied money.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today SERCO-GROUP owns all the satellites in the sky, they also own the world air traffic control system, they also developed BUAT for the CIA which allows remote-control of all aircraft producted after 2007
            </p>
            <p>
             SERCO also under OBAMA was sole supplier for ONE BILLION USD to develop obama-care website.
