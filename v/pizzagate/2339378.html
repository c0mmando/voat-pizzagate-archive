<p>Never heard this story before and thought it ridiculously important to post. It\'s about a Native American actress Misty Upam who was raped at the 2013 Golden Globes to the cheers of men in tuxes egging the rapist on. A year later, she ended up dead at the bottom of a cliff in a ravine. The death was thought to be a suicide, but the report is open for interpretation. </p>
<p>Man, these are sick clowns! Let me get right into this story: </p>

<p>Charles Upham, the father of Misty Upham, the Hollywood actress known for her roles in August: Osage County and Django Unchained, spoke out recently about the alleged rape of his daughter and the horrifying problem that is Hollywood sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Charles noted that although Hollywood found a “poster boy” in Weinstein to “ease the conscience of high society for a while,” that the problem is persistent and “not an isolated incident.” ...</p>
<p>pham went on to explain how his own daughter fell victim to this abuse and it happened as Hollywood’s elite cheered it on as if it “were a beer drinking contest.”</p>
<p>My daughter, Misty Upham, was a victim of rape by a Weinstein Executive in 2013 at the Golden Globe Awards. The rapist forced her into the men’s room and had his way while other men in formal wear cheered him on as if he were chugging a beer in a contest. As Misty made the walk of shame back to the event, the Exec was given high fives, bragging rights and another notch in his Weinstein Co. belt. What should have been an auspicious occasion for Misty turned into a nightmare of pain, humiliation, fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>After her rape, Upham explained how he and Misty’s mom pleaded with her to press charges. However, Misty was petrified of doing so.</p>
<p>In a shocking revelation, Charles noted that they have DNA evidence of the crime.</p>
<pre><code>Her mom and I pleaded with her to press charges since she still has the torn green dress she wore with the DNA all over it. Misty was afraid to pursue charges because she knew Harvey Weinstein could protect his constituency and ruin her existence.
</code></pre>

<p>Misty was not only worried about her career but she was worried about actual physical harm that may come to her for speaking out against Weinstein.</p>

<p>What strikes me are the detailed instances given as to how her life was threatened and how she was demeaned by the police. The police behavior is a very important element because it demonstrates why nothing is ever done. It also displays a cultlike atmosphere in PedoWood in that none of the people around the periphery of these crimes ever breaks their silence. It\'s almost devotional.</p>
<p>What can I say? They worship at a different altar than you and I. Hope they realize that they\'ll reap what they sow. </p>

            A bathroom full of conspirators, cohorts and accessories to a series of crimes, including likely a murder. If it is proved to be a suicide, it could still be argued wrongful death. We are seeing the fruits of an elite rape cult. They don’t care if we know. They are on tv, still selling their sick culture to millions of unwitting enablers. This is too big for me. Time to pray.

            Google George Clooney...think his father is a Jesuit..I always expect actors who continue to get the best roles, money and publicity to have some kind of connection like that. They are not given out on talent.

            A Golden Globes party was hosted by Weinstein's Miramax. Here are some photos from that party.  Any of the 'executives' (eg non-stars) could have been the rapist and/or onlookers:

             So Weinstein hosted the damned thing? Makes what happened even worse. No wonder she felt she couldn't do anything about the assault.

            The Auburn WA Police Department actually taunted her by saying 'Are you a movie star? Then why don't you complain to George Clooney!'
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, she was found dead after she gave her green dress from the night she was raped (with DNA stains all over it) to the police.  The police obviously gave that information to Weinstein's Miramax people, and they organised for someone to murder her.  You don't kill yourself with a 'blunt force trauma to the head and body'.   The police continue to assert that there is no reason to believe that it was anything other than a suicide.  How much are the police being paid by Miramax?   This is dirty, dirty.
           </p>
           <p>
            The actress Juliette Lewis is a good friend of Misty's.  I hope she starts to fight for her friend to get to the bottom of this.  Perhaps she is frightened that she too will be 'suicided'.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be interesting to get a list of all Miramax executives who attended the Golden Globes of 2013.

            Personally I think this is next smoking gun after Seth Rich for busting this open. I know this tale has been passed around a bit but very nice synopsis OP. If that dress is in their possession that’s crucial but once it is unveiled they are in possession of such crime-linking magnitude the family needs to secure samples for various different labs to test as this evidence will soon be “lost” if only one source is used. Just how these ppl operate. Hopefully the family takes/has taken the appropriate steps in this respect but will be difficult to know that they have without a direct statement from them or something of that nature.

              Banded Groups of Narcissists and Shared Victimisation
             </p>
             <p>
              Psychologist Richard Grannon uses the 1989 movie SOCIETY as a visual metaphor to explain why Banded groups of Narcissists engage in shared victimisation and what they gain from doing so. The movie depicts a melding and merger that takes place between perpetrators and the victim and how that generates the narcissists much needed drug (first named by Sam Vaknin) as NARCISSISTIC SUPPLY.

             Yeah, it's quite some story. When I read it, I was stunned at the level of visceral predation. But then again, these are the folks that rape children. Anything's fair game for them. The more innocent and helpless the better.

             I hear you and Weinstein is only a link to the higher chain. He's not the one running things, but he did have power. And we know what he did to get that power so no tears shed for that POS. As for this:

             I love the Indigenous.  They are one the most maligned groups in the world. The are not wanted by the elite for they know the earth and the stars and those are the things they want to banish from the earth  They would rather they be banished from the earth.  We should listen to the Indigenous and their way of life.

             Unfortunately, that may be a favor. The statistics for police following up on Native American women is ridiculously low. Even in Canada it sucks. I remember a Native American woman was pushed off a balcony. I mean, there were like two people there, and the police couldn't figure out who did it? Come on!

             I'm so sorry she went through what she did. Her father is very courageous speaking out. Hopefully, in this climate, she'll start getting the attention she deserves.

            Misty Upham   I remember that someone commented that George Clooney may be involved in this.  That one of the cops involved in this told them to ask George Clooney and that he was possibly involved through Lionsgate   My memory is kind of fuzzy on this, maybe someone can help.  It might have been Data Lounge instead.

             Yes, the story does cite the cop saying that. I thought it was a bad joke, but you think he might have been involved? He's even more a POS than I could have possibly imagined.

              He is involved in these stories somehow.  I have seen people tossing his name in during the Blinds.  They know he is caught up in something.  But I think I saw his name a few times in that Blind.  Why would the cop throw out his name of all names?  Also I think they said that Lionsgate was somehow involved with Clooney.  I have read the story about a young girl in his Villa and also about people saying he likes young boys.  One way or the other, It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about all the trips he made to Darfur and the Sudan.  What was he doing there?  His uncle Nick Clooney accompanied him on a couple of trips.  Did he have something to do with how George turned out?  Heard he was somewhat of a spoiled brat too.  His Aunt Rosemary demanded he help out and all he did was get into trouble.

               Well, the marriage is fake as were the pregnancies. It already came out they used a surrogate, but there she goes, prancing around in another fake stomach. I don't know if the PedoWood crowd passes around the same one, or they actually each have one. Is it handed out in the initiation into soul-less wraithe? Don't know, but Clooney is a lush alcoholic who used to stumble around his mansion in a raging depression. Do they think good mental health i an outcome of particpating in SRA? Evidently, they didn't get the mental health memo that warned against rape and murder.

               They're deluded. They think that because there's been no obvious retribution for their crimes, that there won't be. When they were neophytes, they expected the police to come arrest them, or the press to print a story publicizing their obscene crimes, but the witches and warlocks were right when they said that they would obtain earthly power. What they left out was that it was a temporary state for the meek shall inherit the earth. So the depressions, the black moods, the rages, the reliance on drugs are only precursors of how they'll suffer when God' law comes to pass.

                I want to hear their rating cries here on earth.  The cries when they are carted away or some fed up parent puts and end to one of them.  I can't believe that some outraged parent has not run into a cafe or bar brandishing a gun and Bang! Bang!  That would be too good for them.  There are many fathers that have taken to killing a BF of his daughter.  Oh, Please let it happen.  They don't deserve to live a full life.  Hopefully he will die of any overdose or alcohol poisoning.  Btw, I hope there are many surrogates, or she will be worn out.

            A perfect symbolic meme of what awaits humanity it they are not eradicated.  Torture and humiliation and murder are a joyous celebration inside their collective psyche.  The old quote from FDR, "we have nothing to fear but fear itself," has never found a more fitting application than the situation we face now.  They are few; we are many.  And the only real tool they have is to manipulate through fear.  But if we fear them now the future is a fate far worse than death for us, our families, friends, and children. Sorry, but than brings another quote to mind from the Apostle Paul: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" 1Cor.15 [55]

             Reasonable people you can reason with, but there is no reason here. There's greed, gluttony, avarice, obsession, control, sexual perversity, sadism, etc., etc. ... The insides of these creatures are composed of the Seven Deadly Sins on steroids.

             We can't run or can't cower. If it worked, I'd say try it, but look at Misty. She was a lovely compassionate girl and they eviscerated her. Stomped on all areas of her humanity including the comfort of feeling safe and secure. Really, they are reptilians ... subhuman and they should live underground in their tunnels. Maybe that's where they'll be sentenced to be imprisoned, but they'll go without their art collections, pizza parties, and people to push around. Even without the accoutrements it'll be more humane than the atmosphere they created in their lairs of power.

             I agree. With the reptilian non-humanoids, I'm sure their mistreatment of certain races goes back a ways. In fact, I'm positive. There's an ancient grievance buried in time. The Native Americans must have done something wonderful like slaughter a group of these demons upon landing on their shores. Then in disguise, these shapeshifiers snuck back under the mask of being human. But you know what? It's not over. It's what the Native Americans know and keep tucked away. They know that whatever this ungodly power this is will destroy itself, and it seems to be doing just that. With Feinstein using the excuse of having a cold, and Pelosi blithering like a person possessed, I think that time has come and we'll get to witness it.

            Why isn’t Charles Upham (the father) meticulously killing every person possibly involved with his daughter’s death?
           </p>
           <p>
            In all honesty, if something like this happened to my daughter, I would make it my life’s mission to kill anyone and everyone involved in any capacity until they were all dead. Either that or I would capture them and horribly torture all of them for as long as I could keep them alive. I would dedicate every cent of my assets to this end until it was done.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I’m a little surprised here. Or am I missing something?

             I guess the question would be is why the whore Gloria Allred didn't take the case for no money. She could have brought the dress in for testing posthumously. Imagine convicting that bastard who thought he got away with it.

             Yeah, for that shithole to rape her so blatantly -- in a place where he knew there would be witnesses -- tells you a lot of about the culture of these degenerates. Oh, I wondering if someone would stop him, or call the cops -- nope! It was just cheering him on.

             Feel so sorry for Misty, but she did nothing wrong. And for her to make it that far and be an outsider with no connections, she must have been an extraordinary person. It's why they hated her so much.

                 I haven't either. It didn't start with pizzagate, though. There is nothing they're making that I'm even interested in seeing. The creativity is at zero and the stars are lackluster talentless shitholes. I even had free offers frm my cable service to try the movie channels and I'm like, "Nope." The only thing I watch are the ones produced by online TV. At least they try something different and I give them props for that. The scripts are original and they use actors that are new ... or at least that I haven't seen before.

             I never did either and it just shows that these types of stories are being suppressed. The fact the alleged rapist was allegedly (can't say allegedly too many times) a Weinstein executive I'm suuuuurreee doesn't play a role in why this didn't get press coverage.
