            I'm leaning towards this theory as well, michael86.

            Didn't dr piezinick say they chose and groomed Trump several years ago?

           <p>
            When everyone was in a tizzy about trump not going to the intelligence briefings when he was pres elect, I was saying "duh!  Whatever the CIA has to say to him is likely not truth and is info they want him to believe to purposefully trip him up.  Smart man for not being "briefed"!"

            This invalidates Steele, Trump is not going to go all through this shit and trouble to end up picking someone involved in the cabal. NOT.

            Yeah tweet him....he answers! He promised me he would prosecute Hillary, I said I'd hold him to it. He said he would...so he reads/answers. But Trump has a media team that monitors websites like TD, Voat, GLP, FB, and Twitter.  I have zero doubt they are aware of this guy. If they want to talk to him I'm sure they know how to reach him...also possible they know about him, vetted him via intel and found out he's a cuck.

            He has a lot of very good ideas IMO (open-source gov't) and real fixes to our elections and financial problems that are right on. Hwv, I've heard him interviewed and he was horribly dismissive and arrogant to the interviewer (who was professional and polite). ITT he has a real edge which his native intelligence allows him to get away with. He may also be totally unaware of his poor social behavior. I recommend (if you're interested) looking at older youtube videos and his predictions are pretty on-point.

            Yes I heard the interview on the Rense podcast. There were a total of 3 officials that should NOT be in Trumps camp as they are for the Globalists not we the people. I hope the message gets to Trump.

            Yes.  It could be that he is is mistaken or that he's not fully aware of what's really going on.  I don't think his intention is to harm Trump though.  Either way, he wants the pedos be fully exposed, so it's worth reading and hearing what he has to say on that front
           </p>

            Here's Some interesting info from his website on the 650,000 emails NYPD discovered right before the election:
           </p>
           <p>
            Wall Street elite pedophiles may be terrified of what will emerge from these emails as well as what is likely to become a nation-wide hacking campaign to “out” all elite pedophiles who also murder orphaned children in satanic rituals — an elite “privilege” to which law enforcement has previously turned a blind eye.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, people must understand, the Clinton Foundation investigation and the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server are two separate case files but they overlap, frequently.
           </p>
           <p>
            To address her use of a private server, the investigation only pertained to whether classified information was transmitted, stored or archived. The FBI determined, internally, that all three of these criteria were met.
           </p>
           <p>
            Due to the political sensitivity of the suspect and her aides, the Department of Justice demanded Director Comey abandon the probe and make a public statement, absolving Secretary Clinton of any wrongdoing as you have seen play out in the headlines over the past few months.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clinton Foundation probe has been taking place since the summer of 2015. It involves an incredibly complex array of individuals, countries, banks &amp; politicians. The general specifics of the case can be publicly found in Peter Schweizer’s book, “Clinton Cash”, which is in fact, accurate.
           </p>
           <p>
            In September of 2016, a raid was conducted by the NYPD in cooperation with the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, headed by Stephen E. Richardson. The raid turned up several devices belonging to Mr. Weiner &amp; Mrs. Abedin. This included two cell phones, one laptop and router which was turned over to the FBI’s cyber-crime division.
A short but revealing investigation was conducted which revealed new emails relating to the original probe into Secretary Clinton’s use of a private server. These emails were originally deleted through unsophisticated means, meaning there was no program used to continuously overwrite the data until it is virtually irretrievable.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the forensics team at the NYPD was successful in recovering 650,000+ emails in addition to an extensive archive of folders containing images and videos over 1.6 terabytes of data in total. Approximately 25% of the emails recovered tied directly into Hillary Clinton’s private email server and had classified markings.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, very disturbing emails were also uncovered detailing trips taken by Mrs. Abedin, William Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and several others to the Bahamas. The amount of time varies between them. Hillary took 28 separate trips in total with and without Bill. This can be verified in public record with the FFA and flight logs. It is also important to note the Secret Service was not present on these flights.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are dealing with serial pedophiles. However, some of the motives appear to be to create bribes or “life insurance”
           </p>
           <p>
            This archive of emails and files Huma had appears to have been kept with the intention of soliciting bribes. This is common practice in other countries as a means of political cronyism. However, there is more. The router seized and logs which were obtained from the ISP show that this bribe material along with classified information was purposely with clear intent being transmitted to IP ranges in the middle east, namely Qatar and Saudi Arabia

             When this was discovered, the FBI immediately took both Mr. Weiner and Mrs. Abedin in for questioning, as now we are dealing with a national security and potential espionage situation. Mr. Weiner quickly confessed to knowing about the bribe material and is in full cooperation with the NYPD, FBI &amp; the CIA’s counter espionage team.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huma is only cooperating to a point. She does not deny the material that was found. However, she refuses to provide details on who she was communicating with and is currently under observation while the FBI &amp; CIA conduct a separate investigation into Huma’s ties with foreign actors.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are a lot of moving parts and the more shocking evidence (the pedophilia) was used to gain leverage on the Department of Justice who have continuously stonewalled these investigations for political reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
             Following Friday’s announcements, the President of the United States was briefed and warned that his interference into these investigations can and will lead to his arrest. Namely on the charges of treason (for stopping the investigation into a suspect accused of espionage) &amp; obstruction of justice. He was placed under a gag order and was told if he speaks about the investigation, he will immediately be arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI is looking to charge: Hillary, Bill, Chelsea &amp; Donna Shalala under RICO law in addition to the other offenses uncovered from the Weiner investigation. Loretta Lynch is slightly more difficult because she controls the DOJ. There is an internal battle between the DOJ and the Washington FBI office. The FBI has basically been forced to bribe the DOJ by going public if Lynch interferes with the new investigation. This is one reason you have yet to see a press conference from the FBI. However, things are starting to get dicy and cooler heads are not prevailing fast enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is also a third angle to this internal feud taking place within the Federal Government. Several members of the Intelligence Community have reached their boiling point with the President, Loretta Lynch, John Brennan, Valerie Jarret, Susan Rice &amp; the head of the DEA [DNI], James Clapper.
            </p>
            <p>
             This has initiated a “soft coup” of sorts which started with the resignation of General Michael Flynn who refused to take parts in acts of treason by the Obama Administration as it relates to the transfer of weapons &amp; supplies to Islamic State of Iraq &amp; Lavant.
            </p>
            <p>
             This soft coup is not just a few individuals, it includes members of the NYPD, FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, DHS &amp; Department [Office] of Naval Intelligence. In addition to a coordinated effort of retired &amp; non-retired intelligence officers, analysts &amp; commandos.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also worth mentioning M16, Mossad, Interpol &amp; independent civilians like Mr. Julian Assange have also put their lives and careers on the line to help expose this hostile takeover of the U.S. Government by a criminal crime syndicate by means of political subversion. There have been casualties already of leakers both of government and non-government. It is also worth noting, several U.S. Military Generals and Admirals have also agreed not to follow certain orders. This includes actions in Syria as it pertains to Russia, Turkey &amp; Iran. Cooperation in Intelligence meetings have literally come to a halt. Right now, the United States ability to conduct clandestine operations is virtually impossible because of this gridlock between the Political, Military and Intelligence Community.
            </p>
            <p>
             M16 and Mossad are very heavily into pedophilia as a political control tool. There are some very ethical officers in both organizations, it may be that the secret world in finally fragmented between those with ethics and those without.
            </p>

             I outlined the resistance to the political coup which has taken place. I can tell you the political forces at work lack the intellectual ability to combat the Intelligence Community. The leaks that have yet to come out are devastating to the government and in the next few weeks we will either have a peaceful transition of power or turmoil. The Clinton Foundation probe can go one of two ways. It ends with those responsible for the heinous crimes going to jail or the bravest patriots I have ever had the privilege of knowing “resetting” our Republic &amp; the world to a status quo.

            Something basic we all know: Keep your friends close and your enemies even closer. The minute I heard about this guy that was my first thought. Trump knows what he is doing. I am convinced.

             Funny what he did with Romney. Roger Stone said Trump was simply torturing the guy (for what he said about Trump during the campaign). I remember when the first article came out on Zhedge blog about Romney being considered for State Dept., one of the comments, "Not gonna happen."

            When he named him, I thought it was throwing a bone to the establishment republicans, now with this, I wonder if he picked him just so he could get up front cooperation and then hang him out as an example of a Pedo and show he's not afraid to take any one down, even his own cabinet.

            Too bad they don't use their "elite" donations to feed and clothe and house (in their own nations) the refugees that they so obviously TRULY care about.  (Sarcasm)

            What a bunch of hypocritical BS spewing scumbags they are. Media matters and friends are despicable- acting like they care about anyone but themselves and their pockets and their sick perversions.  If only the poor and downtrodden, the minorities, the LGBTQ and the feminists would just wake up and realize they are just pawns in the dirty dirty evil game of the "elite".

            It's a pretty elaborate well laid out plan on how to truly get rid of the establishment.  He claims he had it sent to the White House but that it never made it to Trump.  He claims Priebus withheld it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a link to what I think is his message/plan that he wants Trump to have  (I'm sure trump has read by now) note: I've only scanned over it so I haven't formed an opinion on it.....

            It's curious isn't that the whitehouse petition is getting censored:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/JhpJHvd4Q5Q">
             https://youtu.be/JhpJHvd4Q5Q
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean if POTUS is not surrounded by Pedo Snakes, then who is responsible for this censorship. I mean this petition is on the official white house petition page and there seriously seems to be something very dubious going on with this petition.

            i just discovered him as well. But I do have to say, it couldn't hurt invesgating into the RNC members. If they are clean, then they are clean. No need to worry but If what Steele is saying is correct then members of the RNC are not only merely covering up the pedophillia but may potentially be enablers and involved in actively engaging in the sexual abuse and the trafficking of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do have to say, what makes me consider his remarks regarding pedophillia seriously is due to Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. and their connections to the franklin scandal and also they seem to be on rather friendly terms with the clintons. I don't know. I am just as suspcious of the RNC as I am the DNC.

             I think Trump made it clear the Swamp was on both sides. McCain, Graham showing their asses...Ryan is playing nice..but we KNOW...there's a lot of shit in the RNC...they didn't want him...and he knows it.

             Trump is smarter than Priebus and Steele combined, and I think Trump strategically chose Priebus. After Trump chose him, I heard a Roger Stone analysis of the situation on YouTube that seemed to make sense, indicating Priebus would have no power and would be watched.

            I too, give Trump credit for being smarter than the mediaparasite/hostsheep will give him.  A lot smarter.  That being said, I think they have a very real plan which is being enacted.  I'm also reasonably confident that all information posted here is read by both sides of the equation.

            And, as crazy as it sounds, I too get the "Spidey Sense" thing when I see Reince Preibus (sp).  (And on a funny note, I saw a post written once which read: "I have a 10" Reinse Preibus.")

           <p>
            My point in the post is that it's worth looking into Reince and keeping an eye on him
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not accusing him of being a Pedo but he may very well be protecting those that are

             That is how I feel. I mean at the very least we should investigate this guy's claims and not simply brush them off. If there's nothing to them, then there's nothing to them and that's that, but if there is something to it, then we have serious implications as to what his role is, agenda and who his affiliates are and how exactly are they involved in pizzagate. If we are to have any hope of bringing justice to this matter, we must be open to consider all possibilities and investigate at the very least.

             When I watched Trump's CIA speech it was apparent to me that he knew all about Reince.
            </p>
            <p>
             CIA speech:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMBqDN7-QLg">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMBqDN7-QLg
             </a>
             4:46 he discloses that    Reince Priebus and his  whole group has put candidates in front of him.
            </p>
            <p>
             at 5:15   he says, he met Mike and said  cancel everybody else.
            </p>
            <p>
             at 5:28 he says,  "he (Mike) was approved essentially (by who?)  but they're (who's they)  are doing little political games with me...  you know he was one of the three. Now last night, as you know,  General Mattis and Gen Kelly got approved."
            </p>
            <p>
             This all  has to pass  the congress decision makers and he knows it.
            </p>
            <p>
             So,   who's having the real say and approval?   It's not TRUMP!   He's just the figure head puppet who gets to make a choice between a few people who have already been selected (by what group exactly?)   and still have to be approved even after  Trump chooses one of the pre-approved selection.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is all part of the power and control drama, feeding off the fear and desire of those who are up for positions, and for the president to tell them they aren’t in control.            THEY ARE TELLING TRUMP VERY QUICKLY, AND ALL THE ONES WHO ARE PUT IN THOSE POSITIONS WHOSE REALLY IN CONTROL.  They want the power, money and prestige so they go along with it.   Hillary gets to walk the long mile, steps down and everything, pausing to watch the guy who beat her drive past in his special limo.
             <br/>
             Of course the  people leveraging  for the positions are interested in ego greed, prestige etc so they'll play along with the game  to get the money, prestige and  some controlled power - or the illusion of restricted power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Corporate Governance,  which is what North America and UK, etc are, is only 2 party by name.  They have to protect their  system because the government corportation and power structure runs on  child trafficking dollars,  drug dollars, oil chaos, and war dollars.    This is where the control of   ''pay-for-play''  came in.
            </p>
            <p>
             They've convinced everybody that patriotism to the 2 party system puts your trust in them to make decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it's clear to see that this is not healthy patriotism, it's misplaced patriotism -  it's an act of societal genocide (it's obvious how destroying the world by using false propaganda to uphold   power and money from  child and drug trafficking is harming society on so many levels).
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree that people need to recognize that this is not a one party problem.   These people are either enabling or engaging, and either way it is complicit under lying media and speech propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Governor Jesse Ventura's books and interviews describes this clearly (although I don't agree with everything Ventura stands for I agree with this.)    If Trump is sincere about trying to clean it all up he's walking a tight rope because he has to show allegiance to a party.... and all parties lead back to the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why pzgt  is essential to join the information and awareness to the public of   both parties.  The real patriotism is to stand up for the people and not for these in control who claim they're doing what's right by the people, but they are not.  They're doing what's right for corporate money-making governance.   The similarities are there, but just coming from different ideas about change or no change.   That in itself is propaganda obfuscation from the real fact that both sides are being had and distracted while the world is entrenched in more drug addiction and  unaware of the child slave trade corporate government money makers.  (not to mention the war ISIS money maker.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Once more  people realize that the government has fed them false propaganda  the public from both sides can join together to address the real issues, because right now their goal appears to be focusing on the differences so the  public can't recognize the real foundation and how their both sides being duped by lies for an agenda that most people won't agree with.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since Trump is trying to bring back health to the public, he is going against the corporate governance which has been put in place for awhile.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the government is using a ping system to see just where the public are at and how much they will tolerate, in order to know what they're next stage and steps should be.    WikiLeaks was an obvious agreed upon leak, because the government had the option to stop it.  They get to ping the public and see how much they'll take.
             <br/>
             The public showed that they focused on child slavery and didn't let up.  This forced their hand to put Trump in, with the purpose of   abaiting  the public and swinging the pendulum more the other way.   If the ping hadn't responded in a global uproar Clinton would have went in and the system would have moved further the other way.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now add to the problem that many of the workers, not just American but global,  are either silently   enabling or  outright engaging  re the  child  trade pedo situation and we have a real mess.

               He has building real estate  construction knowledge and his dad was in construction, so my thought was that he didn't like the shoddy construction and unnecessary columns.  But I could be wrong  which in this case would be a good thing.

               I guess they have essentially stopped the leaks  because  now it's hard to know what their planting as false intel.  They're masters of causing confusion and distrust that's for sure.
This is a really important discussion for me to figure this mess out.  If Snowden's right and  NSA has access to all information, then NSA new about dufus Podesta, and Clinton's email hacks.    Maybe  the leaks wasn't a psyop ping-back, and the CIA political structure  had no control over the leaks.  That would make sense why  Obama (CIA groomed and owned) blamed Russia rather than exposing the NSA inside job.   That exposure would disclose too much information to the public and they like their sheep gullible to propaganda  yet useful slaves for service.      I thought Trump was part of the  damage control maneuver, but now I'm not sure he's CIA installed.  I think he's NSA installed.
              </p>
              <p>
               But you're right, they essentially stopped WikiLeaks because I can't trust the new leaks since it's exploded, and most of us can't completely trust them although the broadcasting media would like us to believe that they killed all the other other wikileak operators (or some died of natural causes)  except for Assange?  Their sparing his life?  It makes no sense.    I guess it would make more sense that if NSA is the omniscient intel that Snowden claims, possibly the civil war  is between CIA and  NSA, as the deadman's switch wikileak indicated.   In that scenario maybe NSA put Trump in - in which case  NSA wins game point with all information to expose at any given  moment.
              </p>
              <p>
               I  definitely feel a ping going on.  I know when I'm being pinged and I'm being pinged. If the CIA's corporate governance is  the one doing damage control to make the public believe their false propaganda, that would mean that the public has way more leverage,  and  maybe it was  NSA put Trump in.    They   ping the public with intention to determine their next move.  The CIA Politicians  do their usual propaganda shitstorm, as they've always done which is predictable, to see where they can go from here.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is the wildest thing I've ever experienced - and I thought  the tower 7 collapse and Silverstein thing was insane,  this  makes all that look like kindergarten.
              </p>
              <p>
               It seems that the best way to unite the divided public is to focus on the fact that a person needs to take their patriotism back, rather than giving it to  the propaganda politicians who are corporate aligned with the CIA and using broadcasting media to run their lies.
              </p>
              <p>
               It also seems that if the public vocalize the need to expose  child and drug trafficking $$  demanding NSA's  data to clean this up,  the world might have an actual chance again.
But,  Monarchy has got to go.  It serves no useful purpose globally, other than to program people into patriotic allegiance of accepting all levels of lies and corruption.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was on the fence about the deadman's switch wikileak, thinking that CIA used it as propaganda  to confuse, but   now I'm thinking that  leak was  true.
              </p>
              <p>
               The way we can really get the truth on pgate and all the new WikiLeaks is to globally stand up and demand NSA  disclose and expose.
               <br/>
               This is ridiculous already.  Enough is enough.
I feel like a mad dad.
               <br/>
               Whether or not people want cp and pedopfilia legalized is somewhat of a different debate ---  I think my attention needs to be on demanding the NSA  put up their information re pgate and corporate politico drug trafficking, crimes and involvement, otherwise they are NOT protecting the public, they are protecting the criminals and if they don't it means everything is compromised.  Then what the hell are they playing the global public at, and why?   Other countries have equal security abilities as NSA,  do they have a pact to not disclose, but to use info as blackmail?   The problem is that the public adults and children are still pawns in that scenario.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is why  the public now needs  to focus on their similarities  with the hope of recognizing that  regardless of  personal rights to do what you want or don't want,  the attention should be on exposing the CIA involvement  as  corporate government $$$ through  child and drug trafficking research -  and demanding the NSA step forward with their proof!
              </p>
              <p>
               Because this is global, technically the world public can demand the NSA to disclose all their files that they allegedly have on everyone involved in the  child and drug trafficking issue.
              </p>
              <p>
               This would shut the CIA down completely, or provide them with the option of letting Trump put his positions forward.  I think the distraction is to focus on  issues that will cause a fight, like abortion,  which takes the attention off the main issues of  $$ child and drug trafficking of CIA Government and it's corporate and political pawns.  While NSA is pinging us to see what they can do, or how it would be accepted.
              </p>
              <p>
               So political self-centered  alt-left    Soros groups who work to support CIA   rallies people to distract from pgate so that the public don't step up to make obvious demands of exposure and clean-up.     The alt-left are so self-absorbed that they only care about their own interests and  have been morally compromised to care about children, or to recognize that there's something wrong here -- add a blind and unquestioning  patriotism to politicians  and we have the global mess we're in with pgate.    ((note;   I'm not slamming patriotism, only blind unquestioning patriotism  to these corporate politicians who are destroying the world.)

                I enjoyed reading it. It's definitely something I ponder a lot. But then I realize, I'm probably not ever going to have the answers I want.

                I do think this is a time of great turmoil and that the only help for all of us now is from God.
               </p>
               <p>
                I hope that doesn't sound fatalistic, but it's really sort of the opposite. Because when God gets involved, that's a great thing.

                 I admit I was raised a believer, but having been gaslighted many times I ended up atheist.  Then agnostic.  Last year I confronted the religious lies that tangled me up and decided to internally quest the truth - if I could trust anything at that point.  I've viewed how I've participated in this on a broad scale and that's led me to a lot of discoveries.   When I was a strong atheist I couldn't understand why God would create and produce  a bds&amp;m  duality world.      I've needed to be pushed to a choice cause I'm normally very tolerant and passive and  after pg I'm thinking there is an obvious choice that needs to be made.    Now I realize,   I'M the one here choosing this so I need to stop blaming. 
Interesting you say that cause this morning I thought I should rely in  Creator. (I don't like the word God).

No matter what I believe or understand, or don't believe and understand,  one thing I know is that I'll  muddle my way through this craziness  going down fighting against this crazy crap rather than concede to an environment it produces.   Plus, I'm pro child rights, so there's that.

             Not too sure on this Steele guy. I mean, is anyone ever really "ex" CIA?
            </p>
            <p>
             He's admitted that he lied and produced faked intelligence, etc. So what reason do we have to believe that what he is saying is not fake? Sure, he sings a tune that peaks the interest of many, but if you were going to spin a line, that would be a good way to go about it. Come across as a disaffected insider spilling the beans, which ends up just being another ruse, probably on top of other ruses.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is most certainly foulness afoot in the world today, and many of the people on this forum are trying as hard as they can to uncover it, which is a great deed for sure. Just be wary of strangers bearing gifts.
            </p>
            <p>
             For now, it's hard to know what to believe. I suppose that means they have me right where they want me... or do they? Time will tell

             I saw his intelligence presentation years ago and it's basically his vision for the intelligence work of the future.  He outlined exactly what the Pizzagate citizens investigation looks like years before it happened.

            I have heard of trump going to the island once but there is no flight log of him - at least I have not yet seen it.

            He didn't make sexual comments about his daughters.

            You are likely pare of David Brock's Shareblue orginzation.  Media Matters' plan for smearing and trying to impeach Trump has been revealed:

           </p>
           <p>
            We aren't idiots.  If there was ANY proof of Trump being a paedophile, it would be plastered across the globe.  David Brock and his little zombies like you would be sure of it ;)

             It's his specific plan that he wants to reach Trump.  I think what he saying is that he can't directly reach him.  You really can't.  Maybe he can get the plan to Kelly Anne

            Here is more info on Robert Steele, an ex CIA  spy, that shows his legitimacy:
           </p>
           <p>
            Below are quotes From an article titled "The open source revolution is coming and it will conquer the 1% - ex CIA spy"
           </p>
           <p>
            Nafeez Ahmed Published the article by the ex CIA spy on Thursday 19 June 2014 07.30 EDT 
NOTICE THE YEAR THE ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED (Steele mentions paedophelia in 2014 as well as peaceful quiet revolutions in Britain and the US being on the horizon). Link to the full article here

            Quotes from the article:
quote:
The Ex-CIA who trained more than 66 countries in open source methods calls for re-invention of intelligence to re-engineer Earth
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
Robert David Steele, former Marine, CIA case officer, and US co-founder of the US Marine Corps intelligence activity, is a man on a mission. But it’s a mission that frightens the US intelligence establishment to its core. 
With 18 years experience working across the US intelligence community, followed by 20 more years in commercial intelligence and training, Steele’s exemplary career has spanned almost all areas of both the clandestine world.
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
In 1992, despite opposition from the CIA, he obtained Marine Corps permission to organise a landmark international conference on open source intelligence – the paradigm of deriving information to support policy decisions not through secret activities, but from open public sources available to all. The conference was such a success it brought in over 620 attendees from the intelligence world.
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
But the CIA wasn’t happy, and ensured that Steele was prohibited from running a second conference. The clash prompted him to resign from his position as second-ranking civilian in Marine Corps intelligence, and pursue the open source paradigm elsewhere. He went on to found and head up the Open Source Solutions Network Inc. and later the non-profit Earth Intelligence Network which runs the Public Intelligence Blog.
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
I first came across Steele when I discovered his Amazon review of my third book, The War on Truth: 9/11, Disinformation and the Anatomy of Terrorism. A voracious reader, Steele is the number 1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction across 98 categories.
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
he writes in The Open Source Everything Manifesto. “Power was centralised in the hands of increasingly specialised ‘elites’ and ‘experts’ who not only failed to achieve all they promised but used secrecy and the control of information to deceive the public into allowing them to retain power over community resources that they ultimately looted.”
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
What about the claim that the US is on the brink of revolution? “Revolution is overthrow – the complete reversal of the status quo ante. We are at the end of centuries of what Lionel Tiger calls ‘The Manufacture of Evil,’ in which merchant banks led by the City of London have conspired with captive governments to concentrate wealth and commoditise everything including humans.
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
The public will endure great repression, especially when most media outlets and schools are actively aiding the repressive meme of ‘you are helpless, this is the order of things.’ When we have a scandal so powerful that it cannot be ignored by the average Briton or American, we will have a revolution that overturns the corrupt political systems in both countries, and perhaps puts many banks out of business. Vaclav Havel calls this ‘The Power of the Powerless.’ One spark, one massive fire.”
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
I’m a former spy and I believe we still need spies and secrecy, but we need to redirect the vast majority of the funds now spent on secrecy toward savings and narrowly focused endeavors at home. For instance, utterly ruthless counterintelligence against corruption, or horrendous evils like paedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember these statements were from 2014...
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
The national security state works for the City of London and Wall Street – both are about to be toppled
           </p>
           <p>
            quote:
We are at the beginning of an era in which truth in public service can restore us all to a state of grace

            Yep I heard about this. It has me very concerned. I don't think anyone is spending the time to dig into this. If indeed this is true, then it is very serious and must be taken very seriously.

            I'm inclined to believe this is true. The source seems pretty credible and I can't imagine someone like that nonchalantly hurling around accusations of such gravity.

            If we want to have any measure of success in countering those who would exploit innocent children and engage in predation of their innocence then we must be absolutely neutral in the matter and investigate the RNC members just as much as we have the DNC members.

            I mean lets not forget, Dennis Hastert was Republican. The Franklin scandal also entirely involved republicans for the most part.
