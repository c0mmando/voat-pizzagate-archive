<p>Independent Inquiry into CHILD Sexual Abuse put vulnerable people at risk in data breach</p>
<p>The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse ordered by the government in 2014 has been fined £200,000 after sending a bulk email that identified possible victims of child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Vulnerable people were placed at risk owing to the error after the email was sent to 90 inquiry participants on 27 February last year, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said. Around 52 of the email addresses contained people’s full names, leaving at least one complainant “very distressed”, the ICO said.</p>
<p>Director of investigations Steve Eckersley said: “People’s email addresses can be searched via social networks and search engines, so the risk that they could be identified was significant.</p>
<p>“IICSA should and could have done more to ensure this did not happen.”</p>
<p>The inquiry is looking at the extent to which institutions failed to protect children from sexual abuse. </p>
<p>The mistaken disclosure of the sensitive personal information is a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998, the ICO said, since the breach preceded the 2018 act.</p>
<p>The IICSA failed to use an email account that could send a separate email to each participant and failed to train staff on the importance of checking that email addresses were entered into the “bcc” section, according to the ICO.</p>
<p>It also hired an IT company to manage the mailing list, and breached its own privacy notice by sharing participants’ email addresses with the company without their consent, the ICO investigation found. </p>
<p>Theresa May’s official spokesman said the prime minister continued to have confidence in the inquiry. </p>
<p>“The inquiry has apologised for this incident and referred itself to the ICO immediately, and has introduced a number of measures to improve its data management,” said the spokesman. The Home Office has received assurances that the IICSA is taking steps to continually strengthen its management of data.”</p>

            Lets just forget entirely about the men that were falsely accused for various reasons, instantly told they were sex offenders, getting published in the newspapers as if they were convicted offenders, investigated as such, then gone years of agony waiting to find out if and when someones going to drag them for court for something they didnt do, only to find they had been cleared of all charges 18 months ago but no one told them, and the police
            <em>
             do not
            </em>
            publically withdraw or make statements in regards to people they publically shamed as being investigated in the first place!
           </p>
           <p>
            Cliff Richard has just had his day in court after having countless stories run about him as he was hit in the middle of that as well, and is i think suing the police.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remembering of course, that in amongst all of that 'Operation Yewtree' in the UK, the absolute biggest effect its had, is suicides of men who have done no wrong being caught up in the meetoism and taking victimhood away from people that have actually been abused, publically accused of sexual crimes against minors, investigated and cleared, but no one is putting them on the front page of newspapers and saying 'We were wrong about this person theyve done nothing wrong' - its generally a half paragraph somewhere down theback of the paper. Those men get no justice.

             Operation Yewtree
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yewtree">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yewtree
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Operation Yewtree is a police investigation into sexual abuse allegations, predominantly the abuse of children, against the British media personality Jimmy Savile and others. The investigation, led by the Metropolitan Police Service, started in October 2012. After a period of assessment it became a full criminal investigation, involving inquiries into living people, notably other celebrities,[1] as well as Savile.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report of the investigations into the activities of Savile himself was published, as Giving Victims a Voice, in January 2013. Operation Yewtree continued as an investigation into others, some but not all linked with Savile. By October 2015, 19 people had been arrested by Operation Yewtree;[2] seven of these arrests led to convictions. The "Yewtree effect" has been credited for an increase in the number of reported sex crimes,[3] while the operation also sparked a debate on police procedure and rights of those accused of sex crimes.

              Yewtree i know all about. I was living in england when it broke. Hell my ex who may or may not have been a Rotherham victim (long story) used to go on about 'Jim'll Fix It' when i first got there. Changed her tune quick.

              Ill straight up say Cliff Richard sure as shit seems like he would have been around that stuff, but seems to have been fairly clean publically, and there was a fair bit of surprise when he was arrested. But the lawsuit wasnt about the arrest it was about the privacy issues stemming from the accusations and in his case a public figure having to explain a massive raid on his home, and whether the papers should be reporting it. If he is in on that shit, well hopefully someone will fucking hang him one day, but as far as i know he got cleared, and if hes been cleared what choice do we have but to mumble under our breath? Same shit with Michael Jackson, but that dude was an out and out fruitloop monkeyfucker who had enough money to make anything disappear.

               Well, the movie moguls and Sony have money too to have protected Jacko.  I feel bad for what happened to him as a kid, but later on he was a protected pedo for sure.  Cliff R has friends in high places too, just like Jimmy S.  who was protected until after his death.  The Crown controls all that is released and when.  It will all come out after his demise.  Any Victim that wants to spill his guts is in for a surprise.  It will be shut down and he/she will turn up as committing suicide with psyco problems.  I found it comical that of all places he was in Portugal while raided.

              But then almost all males in my profession have lost jobs from false harassment complaints that dont get investigated, and ill tell you straight up you can pretend the majority of people are perfectly reasonable when drunk but its fucking bullshit. Many stories of male guards including myself having shit done to them by people that know we will lose our jobs if we say shit or physically defend ourselves.

            I think this was deliberate. That's how they do it. Remember DWS and the Awan bros. who got in the country on a TEMPORARY refugee visa back when they had some natural disaster in Pakistan. Their visas were EXTENDED. I also know someone who has a child who works for a 501c3 in California. Their job is to help immigrant/minority high school students (didn't ask their status) get job seeking/interview skills and then they are enrolled in an IT TRAINING PROGRAM. IT work doesn't require a college degree, but talented ones can make good money and by nature of the job, have wide access to vast data, depending on their company or GOVERNMENT JOB.  HMMMMMMM......

             You know what?  I was thinking about something similar yesterday.  The Cliff Richard payout.  Possibly they raided his place and nothing was really found and a great way to shovel him a bunch of money for possible payment for boys or girls.  This could be a new way to pay off their friends.  Oh God why we have to think of such things.

               Me thinks thou protest too much Sir Richard.  Best to keep your mouth shut while you are ahead.  Everybody knows you are a kiddy diddler  and I am sure a nasty one.  He surely learned much from Jimmy S.
