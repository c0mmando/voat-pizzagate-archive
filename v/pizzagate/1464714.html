            apologize? No fucking way. You didnt figure out nothing. What if the metal coffin was insulated and used to transport kids inside his fancy kidnapping van that he brags about lining with concrete boards? Thats all about soundproofing. The kid could be inside a soundproof coffin for extra measure and so no one hears the kid when removing it from the van. It could also be used for incinerating victims at a ceremony. Research Moloch / Baal burning victims alive. Plus the name! workin on my night cheese? Apologize Are you for real?

             People don't listen unless there is evidence. He probably made that table for someone or sold it a long time ago. It was about 50 weeks ago according to instagram. His friend that took the other picture, he may have forgotten about that picture, but after I found it, I came across it again where he or that person tried to make it public and I'm sure he told everyone it was a coffee table like the comment in the viral screenshot showed of one of the two trending screenshots, but stupid people don't listen, especially when they are angry and in large groups.

            I'm running a massive metadata search on all suspects, so if that information is anywhere to be found, I'll have it. I'm curious to know about that as well, but I can't just say what I think, I need evidence and evidence of the evidence. If it exists, I'll find it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm actually getting ready to break some really big news on the PizzaGate investigation, but I need more time to collect more evidence. If I tell everyone what I know now, it will risk losing more evidence that I need to confirm what I already learned.

             Why do toy manufactures make and promote toy guns for kids?
Why do candy companies make chewing gum chewing tobacco, and chocolate cigarettes for kids?
            </p>
            <p>
             Have you been to a Walmart or a Target store? They even make couches and recliners for small children.

            <p>
             What you are overlooking is that we need real evidence to connect dots. Just because you believe something, doesn't make it true, and just because you hate someone for a belief, gives you no right to attack them. Sounds like you already decided to live in denial.

             I never said he was innocent or guilty of anything. I just stated there is disinformation and confusion about the Child Coffin information.

               I only researched the coffins so far, and because they did damage control, there could be more I'm not seeing.
