            Overview
The Mount Weather Special Facility is a Continuity of Government (COG) facility operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The 200,000 square foot facility also houses FEMA’s National Emergency Coordinating Center. The site is located on a 434 acre mountain site on the borders of Loudon and Clarke counties, approximately 48 miles west of Washington, DC in Bluemont, Virginia.  The above ground support facilities include about a dozen buildings providing communications links to the White House Situation Room.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Center for Land Use Interpretation states that the facility has nearly 600,000 to 700,000 square feet of underground space.  The center also states that, along with Raven Rock (Site R), these facilities serve as:
           </p>
           <p>
            “. . . the main relocation sites for the highest level civilian and military officials, and what is called, seemingly interchangeably, the “Continuity of Government” and the “Continuity of Operations Plan” (COOP). The present day version of this plan, when it is activated, as recent articles in national newspapers have claimed, calls for 75 to 100 government workers to be kept in one of two underground locations, briefed daily and prepared to take over if the active, elected government is wiped out. COOP was activated hours after the attacks on September 11, and since that time these unknown individuals have been serving in rotations lasting up to three months, in Raven Rock and Mount Weather.”1
           </p>
           <p>
            History of the Site
The site was originally acquired by the National Weather Bureau to launch weather balloons and kites. In 1936 it passed to the Bureau of Mines, which bored a short experimental tunnel less than 300 feet beneath the mountain’s crest to test new mining techniques. Based on a favorable evaluation of the hardness and integrity of the mountains rock, the Bureau began construction of the facility’s tunnels in 1954, which were completed by the Army Corps of Engineers under the code name “Operation High Point.”2   Total constuction costs, adjusted for inflation, are estimated to have exceeded $1 billion. Tunnel roofs are shored up with some 21,000 iron bolts driven 8 to 10 feet into the overhead rock. The entrance is protected by a guillotine gate, and a 10 foot tall by 20 foot wide 34-ton blast door that is 5 feet thick and reportedly takes 10 to 15 minutes to open or close.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Army Corps of Engineers completed the “Area B” underground complex in 1958-1959. Total construction costs, adjusted for inflation, are estimated to have exceeded $1 billion. Tunnel roofs are shored up with some 21,000 iron bolts driven 8 to 10 feet into the overhead rock. The entrance is protected by a guillotine gate, and a 10 foot tall by 20 foot wide 34-ton blast door that is 5 feet thick and reportedly takes 10 to 15 minutes to open or close.  The underground bunker includes a hospital, crematorium, dining and recreation areas, sleeping quarters, reservoirs of drinking and cooling water, an emergency power plant, and a radio and television studio which is part of the Emergency Braodcasting System. A series of side-tunnels accomodate a total of 20 office buildings, some of which are three stories tall. The East Tunnel includes a computer complex for directing emergency simulations and operations through the Contingency Impact Analysis System (CIAS) and the Resource Interruption Monitoring System (RIMS).
           </p>
           <p>
            An on-site 90,000 gallon/day sewage treatment plant and two 250,000 gallon above-ground storage tanks are intended to support a population of 200 for up to 30 days. Although the facility is designed to accomodate several thousand people (with sleeping cots for 2,000), only the President, the Cabinet, and Supreme Court are provided private sleeping quarters. For Continuity of Government purposes, senior officials are divided into Alpha, Bravo and Charlie teams — one remains in Washington, another relocates to Mount Weather, and the third disperses to other relocation sites. The only full-scale activation of the facility came on 9 November 1965, at the time of the great Northeastern power blackout.

            Hi darkknight. Could you add links for the declassified information confirming Mengle was brought to the US via Operation Paperclip?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, please add the relevant passage about China Lake from chapter 2, specifically:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             THE INITIAL SPLITS &amp; INITIAL PROGRAMMING DONE AT CHINA LAKE, CA.
            </p>
            <p>
             The primary or initial torture for many children in western U.S. was done at China Lake, California which officially has gone under the designations of: Naval Ordinance Test Station ( NOTS), Naval Weapons Center (NWC), Ridgecrest (the town nearby), and Inyo-kern (the area). the address of Nimitz Hospital is the code “232 Naval Air Weapons Station”. The base was set up to test “new weapons”. Evidently, the Navy decided that mind controlled people were an important weapon to test. Most of the “new weapons” created at China Lake were for the most part human robots turned out in large numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Monarch Mind Control was carried out in large airplane hangers on the base which have been able to house thousands of tiny cages just large enough for human babies. Lots of 1,000 babies was a small batch. According to people who worked in the hangers helping program, many batches were 2,000 or 3,000 babies. Many survivors remember the thousands of cages housing little children from ceiling to floor. The cages were hot wired (electrified on the ceiling, bottom and sides) so that the children who are locked inside can receive horrific electric shocks to their bodies to groom their minds to split into multiple personalities. These cages are called Woodpecker Grids. The victim sees a flash of light when high D.C. voltage is applied. Later, this flash of light is used with hypnotic induction to make the person think they are going into another dimension when they are blasted with high voltage. In the Peter Pan programming, the Programmers tell the slaves that this is “riding the light.” One of the popular traumas after the small child has endured the Woodpecker Grid cages for days is to rape it. The rape is intentionally brutal so that it will be as traumatic as possible. Many of the technical people on the base are civilians. This is in part because part of the research involves mind-control, and Illuminati civilian mind-control experts have come and gone from the base. The California Institute of Technology at Pasadena is intimately connected to China Lake’s research (and by the way to the Illuminati). Also much of the work at the facility is for the intelligence agencies and not the military. Intelligence assets are often civilians. One of the things developed in the California Universities and then implemented at China Lake was color programming, which will be covered later in this book. Red and green were discovered to be the most visible colors for programming. Various colored flashing lights were used in programming at NOTS. Survivors of the programming all remember flashing lights. The use of flashing lights has been introduced into American culture by the CIA. If a person goes into bars and places where bands play, you will notice multi-colored lights flashing. The flashing lights create disassociation, especially in people who are programmed.

            It seems like a pretty big stretch that "batches of 2,000 - 3,000 babies" were being held in electroshock cages there. Babies do not grow or develop normally when

            Everyone knows Mengele lived and died in South America cuz a Jew Elie Wiesel was infamously begging for shekels to find him based on supposed sightings over 10 years after his death.
           </p>
           <p>
            And dumbfuck goys like you bought it sink, line, and hooker.  Just like the retarded stories about Mengele, a trained opthalmologist, injecting blue ink into people's eyes to make a Master Race, LMAO

            I got china lake mixed up with china beach. I am not surprised that they would use ordinance testing facilities for clandestine research. You  place the evidence on the range, then order bombing drills and destroy it.
