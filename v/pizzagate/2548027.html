I don\'t know who else has posted about this but it needs to not go away. Hold Canada\'s feet to the fire! Nothing happens to Canadian government employees that are charged with abusing children. Nope, swept under the rug. The most apathetic country in the world, bar none.

            THIS WAS INDEED A BIG STORY!
           </p>
           <p>
            The following is unvetted but PLAUSIBLE according to VOAT research: 
"1. April 18 2018: CIA Director Pompeo oversaw capture of UN adviser and pedophile Peter John Dalglish, who leaked video of Hillary Clinton torturing and killing a child.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              A Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today revealed that during the past fortnight, CIA Director Mike Pompeo was personally dispatched by President Donald Trump to the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal to hold a secret meeting with the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong-un—but with Pompeo’s duel-mission to this Asian nation, also, seeing him personally oversee the capture of top United Nations adviser Peter John Dalglish.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              In desperation just prior to his being apprehended, Dalglish released to the “dark web” what is described as a “snuff film” showing Hillary Clinton and her top aid Huma Abedin torturing and murdering a child.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Pompeo told Naryshkin that President Trump had ordered an immediate halt to any further sanctions of Russia in exchange for allowing the Americans to handle this “extremely delicate issue” on their own—that Moscow agreed to—and was then followed by the US admitting that Pompeo had, indeed, met with Kim Jung-un."

              </a>
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            DiFi's hubby Richard C. Blum has longstanding connections with Nepal and "preventing" child-trafficking through his AMERICAN HIMALAYAN FOUNDATION. Nepal is a known trafficking site. Surely he would have known of Dalglish's presence there. His wife is on the Foreign Intelligence Committee.

            Apr 17 2018  -Senate Democrats Call on Trump Administration to Extend Temporary Protected Status for Nepalese Nationals   THIS WAS FEATURED ON FEINSTEIN'S WEBSITE right during CIA Director Pompeo's aledged oversght of DALGLISH'S ARREST IN NEPAL!
           </p>
           <p>
            April 25, 2018  -Trump Being Blamed For Obama’s Plan For Nepal Refugees   "The TPS was set up for Nepal on June 24, 2015 after the severe earthquake they suffered. It was originally set to expire December 25, 2016. But in October of that year, owing to the extensive damage from the earthquake, DHS issued an extension of the TPS to run through June 24, 2018 (posted in the Federal Register at that link). Remind me again who was president then? That’s right. The Obama administration originally only thought a TPS was needed for a period of 18 months. They already gave them one extension of an additional 18 months, and the TPS was always set to expire this June."

            Canada seems to be a haven for anything backwards. I know people up there too. What ever happened with the NVXIVM chapter in Vancouver Canada? They didn’t even raid it or anything from what little we can read about it. And isn’t Frank Guistra from Vancouver too? I wonder if he had any hand in it? Dalgish should have his Order of Canada thing revoked what a joke.

             Frank Giustra is a vile excuse for a man, if he is even human. Vancouver, what with the Piggy Farm (Pickton Farm, snuff films, murders)and other atrocities, is just a cesspool.

              Absolutely agree. Isn’t the entire province run by Freemasons. And how is it that Frank G is a billionaire in the first place? That is virtually impossible. He said he was from a small town near the city grew up dirt poor and made billions in the now defunct Vancouver Stock Exchange or whatever they call it up there. So many oddities. The thing that is the most damning is all his children’s charities and boylover logo that he changed immediately after being called out for it. This guy is up to no good.

            Dalglish has Trudeau ties.  You won't find much on the internet.  Will have to search.

            Also seems there are many connections here in Canada to Upper Canada College, where Dalglish had attended school. Much to dig on this. I seem to remember a recent probe that was outing a teacher there. I personally know some that attended that school and I can vouch that they are some of the most messed up people I have ever met. Of course, it is primarily a school for the offspring of the Deletes

             Dalglish had connections to Trudeau's father, Pierre Trudeau. He got appointed by him for an honorary job if I recall correctly, in his early twenties. And Pierre Trudeau (as well as his son) has been one of our usual suspects....
            </p>
            <p>
             TL;DR: He got introduced to Canadian power-pedo circles already as a very young man. Amazing that he finally got arrested. But I don't hold my breath that he will go to prison for more than a couple of years.

            <p>
             Apparently, he took these Nepalese children on trips to foreign countries, too.
