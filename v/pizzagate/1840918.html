<p>This video relates to pizzagate as it depicts a location on the East coast that seems related to voodooism, satanism, sex trafficking and a restaurant/hotel + strip club and prostitution. Abandonned in a hurry.</p>

<p>Very specific child death reference:</p>
<p><strong>ABIKU: Abiku refers to the spirits of children who die before reaching puberty; a child who dies before twelve years of age being called an Abiku, and the spirit, or spirits, who caused the death being also called Abiku.</strong></p>

            I would have no way to go forward with this information anyway so it's best to keep it off the internets for now. I learn more about myself from pizzagate than about satanic baby cannibals LOL Now I know I am squarely planted on the victim side of this whole scheme. And I have no way of doing anything to help those who are being victimized by this system other than observing things and documenting them for the future. This is not really the kind of system that I would want to infiltrate either. With the entire world it seems doing the three monkeys on this topic, it's still good to hang around other people who wont ignore it.

            Thank you. Do you ever feel a bit stupid and think that you (we) are the last people to find out about this and that everyone knows... and keeps quiet? Because the info is horrific and traumatizing.

            Wow. This is quite stunning. I am glad you are picking up that companies associated with the CIA (the psyop/mk-ultra/monarch/false flag/control part of it) use spirals as a means of conveying their affiliation. However, I always try to go 3 for 3 in terms of signs before exclaiming MK-Ultra! What was the service your father's company provided to the CIA? Did they provide a discreet off-site meeting place, a cover for construction work, a means of laundering payments to assets? It's an interesting puzzle.

            Thanks for taking the time to respond. I was hoping for a link to to Alefantis' stomping grounds, where do his tomatoes come from? Note my request for address on other creepy facility. Linking at least 2 facilities comes suggests evidence of a ring.

            Can't somebody contact the maker of the video and obtain the address. The maker is taking subscribers. He may even become excited about working with the pizzagate team. A property  title search could be done to ascertain the previous owners or business tax records for the county/city could show owners/tenants. From there search the Internet to obtain more evidence.

             I agree with you, the association with human trafficking was made by the first hand observers. The posters of bands that feature child abuse and death as themes is what raises suspicion.

              i listened to music with themes of death when i was a kid, (still do) it meant a whole lot of nothing! i just think this one was reaching, but who knows, i could be wrong.

               None of the symbology we are investigating is bad on its own. Death is one of the more popular themes in art. People should be allowed to be edgy. And I give the benefit of bullshit to each and everyone I come across while reading what they write or looking at the photos they post. There is a certain amount of dramatization and characterization associated with being an artist, especially in a metal band. It's the repetition and the way these symbols are arranged that form a pattern of communication and a culture. And the primary topic of the investigation, James Alefantis, has generously confirmed that we, supposed normies, are in a different culture than he is.

                i'm not sure what you're trying to say here. i was just saying that the place just looked like a flop house for punk rock kids (or young metal heads,) not a child trafficking location. i'm an artist so yeah, i like edgy music &amp; art. i do find that people on this board sometimes jump at shadows. i do understand it to a degree, because this pedo shit has me jumping at shadows too, but not every g-damn thing is child trafficking. btw i'm a metal head from way back, so my tolerance for edgy is probably considerably higher than most people on this board.

                 I like the "jumping at shadows" expression. I jumped at the Abiku shadow and waited a whole week to post that lead here because I grew up with heavy metal and always saw these groups as posing, not expressing their own deeply held beliefs and culture. However, this leads to artists who pile on the symbolism so high it gives a headache, and gives me the sads... because I feel like they are expressing the connected culture of children raised with SRA.

              ok, but i didn't see any concrete evidence that this was for sure a strip club! to me it looked like a flop house for homeless punk rockers. i didn't see any kid pics.

              These bands are just pure garbage with screaming and yelling...its like their only reason for existence is to have large gatherings of bands/people to hide suspicious activity and have sacrifices of humans and the loud music masks the screaming of victims...
             </p>
             <p>
              What better way to have out in the open "occultic/satanic" gatherings then to have underground music shows...same goes for Comet Ping Pong and its music venue.

               I vote sincere over bullshit because nobody winds up with such a huge number of super specific satanic/luciferian/thelema references in their "art" by mistake, even if they are trying to be edgy. I believe that the answer to this lies in studying social circles as they move from hotspot to hotspot. We can do that using millennial's inability to be discreet! I just can't believe I landed on this while trying to watch something NOT about pizzagate. It's the second time I make an effort to avoid pizzagate only to be presented with pizzagate via a random source.

             Of course Ominous Black has music and lyrics directly linked to Thelmaic cult of Aleister Crowley. You know the one John Podesta and Hilary Clinton and their friends in email liked to talk about when they mentioned "Thelma"
            </p>
            <p>
             The same one practiced by Marina Abramovich where she got the "spirit cooking" recipe from A. Crowley' book of sex majick and the religion of Thelma. The religion based on Egyptian mythology of Osiris &amp; Isis where Osiris is the God of the dead and is cut into 14 pieces during a ritual. Remember John Podesta with his hands opened and the number 14 and the fish displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
             During the ritual all Osiris pieces are brought back together with the last part being his penis which the participants cannibalize and he is resurrected. Osiris is also the story of mother son incest and the birth of Horos. That is where "The eye of Horos" comes from or as some of us have discovered "the snake in the eye" genetic marking

             These are our leaders everyone. You might not believe it they surely do. Aleister Crowley was not just some occultist of the past. He was a British intelligence officer. He called himself "The beast &amp; 666" He was the highest ranking member of a top secret society. Names of our top political leaders have been members.
            </p>
            <p>
             You would be surprised. The man everyone screams is so evil who led NAZI Germany was a member.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mussolini kicked Crowley out of his country back in the day because he was so evil and as we know Mussolini was no hero.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barack Obama was wearing an Aleister Crowley T-shirt last year. Now whether he is uninformed or not someone should have probably mentioned to him wearing a t-shirt of the guy famous for black sex majick involving bestality, pedophelia, spirit cooking, etc. was not a good idea... even if your Whitehouse counselor John Podesta &amp; former SOS HRC practice Thelma and attend "spirit cooking" of some type. Not a good look

              Where is your proof of Obama with A.C. shirt. That would be good to add here. Edit: I found it, appears to have been photoshopped on Obama's plain gray T-shirt matching a young boys T-shirt with NASA??? insignia who was standing next to him.

               Will have to search the old threads maybe you can help me if they have not been deleted or anyone reading this. The picture was posted over a month ago. He is seated in a chair in some type of gymnasium or hall of some type. He is looking up at the camera and I believe the t-shirt is grey with face of Aleister Cowley face in blank or dark colors on the front of the shirt. I think it was a short sleeve shirt I am almost certain. I will search today for it. We were shocked when it was posted back then but most people did not understand who Ccrowley really was. Thanks for the questio!n!
