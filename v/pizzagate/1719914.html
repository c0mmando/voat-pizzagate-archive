            Well I can't get the linked page to open.  Too many ads?

            How funny you should mention Rockwell, who popped into my head last night after leaving a steak restaurant with a buddy.  (We were discussing Pedogate.)
           </p>
           <p>
            TIdbits from Rockwell's bio on Wikipedia (bolding mine)::
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              He also is noted for his 64-year relationship with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA),
             </strong>
            </strong>
            during which he produced covers for their publication Boys' Life, calendars, and other illustrations.
           </p>
           <p>
            His early works were produced for St. Nicholas Magazine, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)
            <strong>
             <strong>
              publication Boys' Life and other youth publications
             </strong>
            </strong>
            . As a student, Rockwell was given small jobs of minor importance. His first major breakthrough came at age eighteen with his first book illustration for Carl H. Claudy's Tell Me Why: Stories about Mother Nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is said to have been his first paying job as an artist.[12]
            <strong>
             <strong>
              At 19, he became the art editor for Boys' Life, published by the Boy Scouts of America.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            He held the job for three years,[13] during which he painted several covers, beginning with his first published magazine cover, Scout at Ship's Wheel, which appeared on the Boys' Life September edition.

            •  The 1994 film Forrest Gump includes a shot in a school that re-creates
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Rockwell's "Girl with Black Eye"
             </strong>
            </strong>
            with young Forrest in place of the girl. Much of the film drew heavy visual inspiration from Rockwell's art.[42]

            •  Film director
            <strong>
             <strong>
              George Lucas owns Rockwell's original of "The Peach Crop", and his colleague Steven Spielberg owns a sketch of Rockwell's Triple Self-Portrait.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            Each of the artworks hangs in the respective filmmaker's work space.[31] Rockwell is a major character in an episode of Lucas’ Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, “Passion for Life.”

            MY COMMENTS:

             <strong>
              George Lucas is a known pedo. Reportedly, anyone in a Lucas film must have sex with him.  Lucas even wanted to make the Indiana Jones character a pedo:

            According to his son, Rockwell was supposedly a "devout Christian:"

            Did Joseph Goebbels popularize certain ideals to the mass culture? Does Steven Spielberg attempt to do the same thing? Is celebrity more special than actual truth in art?
