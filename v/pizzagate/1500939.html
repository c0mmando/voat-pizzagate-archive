            Wow. I am kinda surprised to see this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, we have been at this a long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The way it works, for the most part, is looking at each case as a singular event. There are a couple of cases that screamed human trafficking to me, Haliegh Cummings being the one that eats away at me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have wondered at times if LISK could somehow be involved. I know that the victims are all adult prostitutes but something about it says to me this is not his first rodeo. The area is very wealthy and everyone knows everyone. Killers have a type and this guy likes young looking women, women in their 20s who look like teens. Disregard some of the victim's pics, they are not flattering and better ones can be found not on the police hand outs. The fact that the FBI was blocked from investigating and there was a small female child found in the same dump site makes me think the killer started with children and moved up. Killers rarely share territory so the child is connected to the same killer in my view.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rich area, FBI blocked from the case and the child found in the same site make me think something may be up. This is one of the biggest unknown serial killer case in recent memory in one of the richest areas in the country, I would be shocked if this guy didnt Have political ties. Maybe someone who got cut off from the ring and had to seek out his own victims. If that is the case, he is a rare lastly killer. Most get a thrill out of seeking out the perfect victim, this guy goes on Craigslist and does not have a set type.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't go on there bringing up pizzagate. It is a tight group and it won't be taken to kindly. Looking at each case seperatly gives you blinders to the bigger pictures and I think sometimes we miss the obvious links. Sadly, most of the missing children cases show a parent did something and there is not enough  evidence to do anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me, Haliegh Cummings is a good place to start looking into him an trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Maddy McCann board has hinted at human trafficking for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say don't go there bringing up this but bring the cases her for further discussion.
           </p>
           <p>
            I actually investigate missing person cases on my own. That is why I am in this sub. I keep thinking that one of the cases I have researched could apply.
           </p>
           <p>
            Feel free to ask me about different cases you come across that you think my be connected. I know a lot of the ones dealing with small children like the back of my hand. I will do a quick Google to refresh my memory now and see if I can find the names in more cases. After researching for so many years, all the names and details get thrown together.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that PG deals.mostly with children but I have been thinking there must be people recruiting teens online for those politicians who like them a little older.

             Totally disagree LISK was into kids. The baby found was DNA matched to a woman found in and around the same location (presumed to be a prostitute but unconfirmed as no one knows her actual identity). No other kids were ever found there and that is factual.

              I can say that PG will not be welcome on there. It does not fit with the format of each case having a thread. You need an actual named victim or a Jane Doe who needs to be identified to to get on there.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said, I have a few friends have made there. I know of four who post here. Here is the thing. This sub is great for getting information out to the masses but it is garbage for researching.
             </p>
             <p>
              When researching a case, you need white noise. You need to start at one point and see where it leads you. Hit a dead end, back up and start again. Document the connections, stay neutral, and build the case starting from the beginning. Ideally, you would have a group of five or so to work with but you do the work seperatly. This is how I work when we have a victim and story to follow. Connect the dots from the beginning and find out how events unfolded.
             </p>
             <p>
              This case is different. We have no victim and really no evidence of a crime. No timeline or place where the crime occurred. We have incriminating evidence without an actual victim. We have lots of yelling to disrupt us. No one is working on the same timeline and we are all going in different directions. We are all just throwing out information here and not organizing it. I think many forget that we need to build the case. No one else will right now. This case is just too large with too many people all throwing ideas and evidence in that we cannot stay focused. There is not a listing of facts and evidence by grouping.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your thinking gets cloudy when bombarded with so many posts. WS works because it is one thread with listings not a page with a millions different posts and then comments.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are people from there on here. Use WS for info and I will see what other cases may have connections.

               I agree. However, I think WS could be a great resource for PG researchers who are tying together various human trafficking cases, and for checking connections between missing persons and high profile suspects. I believe that some of these cases are connected, and collusion could be beneficial. I  feel that PG researchers could benefit from the WS research model; because there is an definitely an element of "casting about".

                I agree. I will look into a couple cases tomorrow where I think there could links and see what I can find.
               </p>
               <p>
                One thing that would help would be to break off into groups. Agree on a certain set of facts as evidence and see where it leads each group. Figure it what fits and what does not.

                I keep going over this in my head. How is it that this has been going on for so long but we have no bodies. You don't get lucky for that long when hiding bodies.
               </p>
               <p>
                I Wil get back to you on this in the morning.
