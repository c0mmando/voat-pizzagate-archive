The show appears to be indoctrinating children to the world of occult ritual sacrifice.  In a grotesque scene, a naked mother appears to be in labour when she is smashed in the head with a giant brick.  A baby climbs out of her vagina and begins crying as the mother eerily continues to moan in agony.  The breast detaches and the infant begins smoking and feeding as a milky white substance begins shooting out of her nipple.  Anal sex is depicted as performers dressed as feces and male genitalia began dancing around the spectators, all the while encouraging children and adults to participate.

<p>The company also has a rather \'interesting\' manifesto on its website stating in pertinent part:</p>
<p><em>&quot;... We are always a nuisance – poking fun, rebelling, kicking over the traces, infiltrating the mainstream and wielding its information against it, being irreverent, naughty, a goad; reflecting power/society disrespectfully, being a bull in the china shop on purpose, breaking taboos wherever we shall find them, being rude, vulgar, violent, sexy...&quot;</em></p>
<p>Of course this is all just ancillary to the routine, ritualistic, child abuse that occurs in Satanic covens every day but I thought it worth mentioning that this is what is being taught to children in the name of so called art and education.  To call it anything other than child abuse is beyond macabre and spiritually insane.  &quot;<em>Breaking taboos wherever found</em>&quot; includes acts of murder, demonic ritual, pedophelia and similarly depicted scenes and is not a justification for &quot;art&quot;.  Rather, it\'s a covert/overt method of child abuse that attempts to hide behind the cover of art. </p>
