            Look at the thread below. The OP is a sensible guy, and while I disagree with his plan, he doesn't seem like a Deep State provocateur. However, other people in the thread are calling for mob violence and public hangings.

            Remember this is a two way street. Any time you meet someone who tries to use you as described in the OP, that person has become your resource for disseminating false information for the porpoise of manipulation of our enemies. They are a valuable resource use and abuse them wisely.

            I think there are a lot of operatives out there trying to get people to either do violent things, or even just stupid things in public in the name of PG. Anyone pointing this out is immediately attacked, called a pedo/shill/pussy. This weekend is the next protest, should be interesting and embarrassing at the same time.

            I sent out warnings against this before, this FBIanon tried to do just that:
           </p>
           <p>
            I told about what is the "only" solution to the problem. It was a reply to this FBIanon's call to arms. I said:
           </p>
           <h2>
            "The only way is a
            <strong>
             Global Unified Truth
            </strong>
            , where everything must be thrown out in the open so the whole world can see for what they are." This would put the right-of-action into the hands of The People and Righteous Law Enforcement.
           </h2>
           <p>
            Nobody currently in justice departments could then get away with 'protecting' the evilists. Trying to do so would make them commit 1st degree evil and indeed, put the right-of-action into the hands of good people, which can then be lawfully dealt with, rather than throwing ourselves at corrupt officials, which would then look like "taking law into our own hands" and give them a reason to engage Martial  Law, State of Emergency.

            Once we own our country again, then we will have to think about violence. It will be an organized war to keep hold of our country from the parasites that once owned it, who will be manipulating other countries against us. AKA Nazi Germany 2.0
           </p>
           <p>
            Until then, violence is just a waste of our time. We need to wake our own peoples up. All of em :)

            Thanks for this. It's important. Even if most of us are aware of this, we have newcomers who may not be. Let's stay frosty, and call out calls to violence and vigilantism when we see them.

           <p>
            Let it not be said that VOAT PG is inciting violence in any way.

            The more i think about this scenario the more i think if one side doesn't blow, the other side will anyway. Obviously i don't want this to blow on our side because kids and innocents can get caught in the middle and that would be the worst outcome, but i think they should be prepared and have a plan, and if push comes to shove- carry it out with cool headed reason, they likely are knowing how smart these peeps are. But i think the other side will start something anyway and it will be ugly. Imagine the scenario that their ww3 plan fails and they know they don't have much time, they will likely start riots on homegrown soil as well as stage a "terrorist" attack.

             But they are apparently cowards. They want "us" to fight among ourselves and their Military contracted Soldiers of Fortune , and they can sit back and watch.

             Thinking that under Trump they won't have the means to stage the big farces [at least in the U.S., anymore]; we'll see.

             They may be too busy fighting off the Trump-cops. Today Webb said something could be breaking. And the Fox News reach some millions of people and are reporting about the Awan "Bros"  -

             They may have to deal with their own problems? Webb also said when these rat lines start to come down they come down fast. We'll see.
