            im wondering if we can do a simple FAQ for those who may be more easily swayed. max 10 common questions we find sceptics are putting forward and lets debunk them all. hopefully the mods can sticky it for a while and that might bring in a few hundred more friends to our cause.  also our current Q&amp;A thread relies on these sceptics to look through the comments which we already know wont happen 80 percent of the time. i love the graphics and memes coming out of the community lately but i feel like this FAQ is a must for us.
