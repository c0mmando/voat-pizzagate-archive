<p><strong>EXAMPLE OF JOHN DOE FOUND IN TEXAS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On October 30, 2007, the body of an unidentified Hispanic male, age 18-30, was located in a field behind an office building located at 1800 Wittington Place in Farmer’s Branch, Texas (Dallas County). It is believed the John Doe had been deceased for 1 or 2 days prior to discovery. He had black hair, styled in a Mohawk. <strong>He had multiple circular scars on the anterior and posterior surfaces of his forearms and legs and three parallel linear scars on his anterior left wrist</strong>. He had a <strong>tattoo of a barcode with “080387” on his right shoulder</strong>. He was found wearing a black and blue zippered sweatshirt (&quot;Iron Fist&quot; brand), a red “Reebok” brand shirt with &quot;New Jersey&quot; and &quot;Jason Kidd&quot; printed on it (described as a basketball jersey), black jogging pants (&quot;Athletic Works&quot; brand) and white athletic style shoes. He was wearing a yellow metal bead necklace and had a yellow metal square earring with a clear stone in his right ear. <strong>He also had a white cloth band around his left ankle.</strong>  The reconstruction featured above is an artist’s rendering of what the John Doe may have looked like. Anyone with information should contact the Farmers Branch Police Department, reference case number 151838 or the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office, reference case number 3729-07-2722Z. <a href="http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184585/1/screen">http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184585/1/screen</a></p>

I am a new poster, but not a new user. I was given some interesting information on NCMEC and in particular the state of Virginia. It appears that Virginia has a larger than normal amount of missing children that have no picture attached. I had this infographic appear in my timeline and tagged for me specifically <a href="http://i67.tinypic.com/11tstn4.jpgJPG">http://i67.tinypic.com/11tstn4.jpgJPG</a> which led me asking the original poster where his info came from. That led here <a href="https://8ch.net/pol/res/10588784.html">https://8ch.net/pol/res/10588784.html</a> which led to here <a href="http://www.vsp.state.va.us/CJIS_VMEC.shtm">http://www.vsp.state.va.us/CJIS_VMEC.shtm</a> which led to here <a href="http://www.missingkids.org/missingkids/servlet/PubCaseSearchServlet?act=usMapSearch&amp;missState=VA&amp;searchLang=en_US&amp;casedata=latest">http://www.missingkids.org/missingkids/servlet/PubCaseSearchServlet?act=usMapSearch&amp;missState=VA&amp;searchLang=en_US&amp;casedata=latest</a>. This seems very odd to me as less than half of these children have pictures. If you click the link to see the poster of the child, still no picture. OP of /pol/ thread called NCMEC and asked why no photos and they stated that <a href="https://8ch.net/pol/res/10588784.html#10588962">https://8ch.net/pol/res/10588784.html#10588962</a> they can\'t post pictures without parents/guardians permission. This seems as if it is PG related as Brian Podesta is NCMEC Senior Analyst <a href="https://archive.is/wnmLe">https://archive.is/wnmLe</a> , with a security clearance of of TOP SECRET-SENSITIVE COMPARMENTED INFORMATION. This is the highest security clearance there is. Why would this guy need security clearance that high? and at the NCMEC? WTF is this guy into? And why?</p>

            I will say this: NCMEC is the FINAL authority on all sex crimes against children. They are the first and last agency that law enforcement calls when there is a sex crime against a child. Ultimately, NCMEC has the final authority on who gets prosecuted and what cases get prosecuted. They claim to be a non-profit organization, but they get 85% of their money from the tax payer (federal grants)

            Okay. So I looked into this problem with Virginia's kids lacking photos when it was brought up last year, and it bothered me a lot back then. Now I can make some fresh observations.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you noted, Iowa has photos for all its missing kids. But notice something else: Because one went missing in the 1970s, four in the 1980s, one in the 1990s, and two in the 2000s, Iowa really only has two cases open: one from 2013, and one from May of this year. Two cases, that is it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same is true in Kansas. More than half of the cases are old, so Kansas actually has just 11 recent cases. Of these, three are from one family where the father took them overseas. Not really an active case. And in Missouri, two-thirds are old, so there are just 22 recent ones.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile in Virginia, if we just look at the cases WITH photos, there are 157 current decade ones (since Jan 1, 2011) out of 190 total. This is obviously a wildly different ratio.
           </p>
           <p>
            Combined population of Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas is about 12 million. Population of Virginia is 8 million. Virginia has about seven times as many current cases, with photos, on a per capita basis. But it actually has slightly FEWER old cases per capita than the other states -- they have 64 for 12 million, Virginia has 33 for a little over 8 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, one more refinement in our analysis. How many recent cases are still open if we eliminate those from 2017? There are tons of teenage runaways, hundreds of thousands across America, but most are accounted for within less than a year. The answer: Missouri has six, Kansas has seven, including three from that one family, and Iowa has one. Virginia has 36. That's a per capita rate of unsolved but NOT RECENT cases of 4.5 per million in Virginia, and 1 per million in the other states (counting three related kids as one case). And that's ignoring all the 2011-2016 cases without photos, which also number 36.
            <strong>
             So Virginia has nearly NINE TIMES the per capita rate of unsolved, not recent cases.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I see in a comment below that NCMEC claimed this was because Virginia sends in every case the moment they get it, even without sufficient documentation. That is false. These are cases that are from 1 to 6 years old. They have been documented properly (as we saw by isolating the kids who had photos from those who did not). The explanation might be that NCMEC doesn't efficiently close old cases from Virginia, and that 90 percent of these kids have been accounted for. But I doubt it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I need to build a spreadsheet and repeat this analysis for all fifty states. But I already know what I'm going to find.

             Recall that it's voluntary reporting by state. So Wyoming - with no cases - isn't accurate. Can't run accurate data analysis when you are not comparing apples to apples.

              Certainly, and thanks for pointing that out. But my main expectation is that no state that does report, will come anywhere close to Virginia. And I expect that should remain true whether we just look at raw numbers, or break it down by time periods.

            "Follow the cards?"  This started as keeping cards of information on children on file, in case they went missing.  Maybe it was a nice way to build an inventory.  I'm going to look at this a bit more.  I'm sure it has allllll the information needed to assess "availability" and vulnerability.

            You have to have a clearance that high to get green/blue badged to Mahogany Row, NHB/Langley, or not have to follow color coded paths.  How else does one interface the world of missing children with our civilian intelligence community?

            Excellent wok OP. I think many have suspected this for a while - NCMEC is the clearinghouse for the DS pedo network.

            I'm thinking a lot of these kids were in foster homes.  The ones that have no pics. I was looking, too and trying to do searches to see if their families creating pages about them. I could not find anything on most of the young girls that went missing recently.  Most parent are worried sick and create webpages wit their pics and info.  No one seems to be looking for these girls.  This is very worrisome.

            That one in particular sounds a lot like a gang related incident. Along with the pattern scarring which I have some of as well.

             EXACTLY. It is obviously his birth date. 18-30 is a bit rough. But there is a +/- 5 years on most Doe deaths because science. I am sure they checked births from taht date and local hospitals, but if no one called him missing, it's just a sad thing. Very sad.

            This is the holy grail of pgate. As well as its international body ICMEC.  They are controlling who gets searched for and know exactly where those missing are. You would never privatize an agency that controls investigative information on missing children. It is a joke. They know it. Brian Podesta knows it and that is why they suspended everyone's Twitter or blocked them when asking.

             It sounds like they are literally using their website to shop for kids instead of "searching" for them.  There is absolutely no reason Brian Podesta would need the highest security clearance for the NCMEC and this is 100% the reason Twitter silenced us for mentioning his name. We need to stay on this story as I think this is the iceberg. 
Great post thank you!

             Thank you  for posting it. I don't normally do back to look at old post, but for whatever reason, I found your comment and found it very interesting.  I knew Virginia had an unusual amount of missing children, but I had not seen it associated with the absence of a pic.

             I DID A CURSORY LOOK AT NCMEC POSTINGS FOR A FEW STATES AND FOUND SOME ODD THINGS which made me wonder if the pedophiles don't shop NCMEC for their kids. ARE THE NAMES OF THE KIDS MISSING IN VIRGINIA REALLY THE KID'S NAME? ARE THEY THE CONTACT PERSON'S NAME? IS THE POST JUST SO THE 'BUYERS' CAN SEE A DESCRIPTION OF THE KIDS AVAILABLE FOR SALE?

           <p>
            And then go on to talk about the absurd amount of missing info on kids missing from Virginia, which was covered months ago. Where's the rest of the info to back up your theory? Honestly this seems like a shill post, with a bunch of capital/bold letters, a big claim, and nothing to back it up except recycled info. Maybe I'm missing something?

              I have been collecting information on NCMEC for well over 6 months. They are concealing the identity of Missing Virginia children. Go to their database link below; THERE ARE NO FUCKING PICTURES.  All of the other 49 states have 100% of the pictures a few have 99%

              It just seemed like a wild question to pose and then just not follow up on it. I thought that he was going to provide more evidence to show what brought him to that possibility, but instead he went on to talk about the high rate of missing photos for kids in Virginia, which has already been covered, and never worked his original question back into the statement. It just seemed like a whole bunch of capital letters and no real information.

             I don't think I MADE any claims.  I asked some questions about ODD things with Virginia's missing children.
If you read the last bit regarding the comment made by Rachel,only yesterday, and follow the links,  it says that when NCMEC was asked why there were no pics with the kids, they said that it was because some parents did not want their kids's pictures out there.
  Isn't it strange that all of Texas's parents are okay with it, but half of Virginia's parents are not?
I found it strange that most all of the kids had names that would not be found on the TOP 100 names in the United States. I am making no claim, but IMO, that implies foreigners.  And, apparently, Virginia has its own way of tracking kids.  That makes me wonder about the purpose of a NATIONAL ORGANIZATION, NCMEC, if every state is going to run their own database for missing kids in their own way.
And, my apologies to you and all, if this is all a rehash.

              No apologies necessary, I apologize if I was harsh or anything. I definitely agree that the NCMEC is up to no good &amp; that Virginia has something going on. They certainly could be using the listing on their website for nefarious things. At the minimum, their lack of diligence in keeping up the listings is potentially keeping children from being found.

            Even sicker part is they request/collect money to 'Bring Them Home' so people are actually paying for this exploitation if it turns out they are doing the abduction and sales!  Sounds like The Clinton Foundation and Haiti :'(  I don't think I can take this much longer it is getting too much now and I am usually positive thinking about breakthroughs coming soon.

            Reality Calls did an interview last year ( if I recall correctly ) with a statistician regarding the irregularities with Virginia missing children reports, interestingly this has been removed from the channel, this is also doubly strange as the episodes are numbered and there's no missing number. I can attest to existence as I watched it and still have the link which is now 404'd. ( edit 2: There are posts on Voat discussing the video in detail )
           </p>
           <p>
            During this interview the guest speaker explained that Virginia uses the system differently, most states only list for confirmed missing children and often do not use the system in all cases. Virginia will use the system if a youth is missing for even a few hours (edit: I presume this is the explanation for not all kids having pics ) and uses this system in EVERY instance Virginia being the home of NCMEC. So the explanation for the irregularities was 'everyone else is just using it wrong'... which I struggle with myself personally.

             I struggled with that explanation as well. Using a system comes down to perceived benefits. One theory may be that some states simply see the value of using the system more than others, or have the resources available. Another theory is that Virginia and Texas are states close enough to the money behind high volume trafficking. We can only know if serious information emerges.

             Thank you.  It gave me a really sick feeling, looking at this.  And NCMEC kept stalling, making it a real pain to get through the listings. And, in the middle of counting Virginia's initial 42 pages,  it was reduced to 41 pages.  I don't know what, why, or how that happened.
