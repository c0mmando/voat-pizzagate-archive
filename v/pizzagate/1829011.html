            They don't believe it?  That's pretty revealing.

           <p>
            So they are revealed to be liars willing to casually smear people with this accusation, an accusation they have no basis to believe is true.   And Upvoated on top of it.

             you don't believe anything people have discovered here has basis in reality.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            My objections to the speculation and the conclusions based on what has been discovered. People are simply fantasizing. I would say the conclusions have no basis in reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example:
           </p>
           <p>
            Discovery - Alefantis talked about a pig farm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conclusion - Alefantis is disposing of the bodies of his victims by feeding them to the pigs on the pig farm.
           </p>
           <p>
            That should sound crazy to you because it is.   A more logical conclusion would be there is nothing unusual in the fact that James Alefantis has connections to farmers as he owns two Farm-to-Table restaurants and he needs farms as his suppliers, not just for pork but for tomatoes, cheese, vegetables, beef, chicken, steak, lamb, eggs, etc. He also would need a seafood supplier.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have heard of Farm-to-Table restaurants right?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             i don't think i'm going crazy, but your comments are intended to make us feel and sound crazy by twisting people's words and coming to illogical non-conclusions...calling you a gaslighter doesn't imply that you've succeeded at gaslighting. see? you make logical leaps all the time.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I don't twist people's words and I don't make logical leaps.  Again, we are in a thread based on the idea that James Alefantis works with a pig farmer to dispose the bodies of all the many people he has killed, but first he takes their teeth out.    I ask you again how do logical people get to this point?  Where is a single bit of evidence for such a conclusion?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm here because the thinking on display is fascinating, but also because moral panics and conspiracy theories are bad for democracy.  And if folks actually wanted to contribute and help their energy could be better focused, but they would rather believe in massive overarching conspiracy theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            (BTW, I think we are all far less rational than we realize and can easily tell ourselves a story that will fool ourselves because it feels right.   I put myself in that category.)

            If Epstein is tied to Mossad, they could be using MKUltra techniques for programming and relaying messages. Considering the range of guests Epstein entertained, I can't rule out the possibility. The use of dentist tools for torture is documented via Brice Taylor/Susan Ford.

            Man, this is one sickening subject. You did go there, and it's a valid discussion, just hard to read about.

            The teeth though, I remember a child that was abducted and killed. It was Danielle Van Dam and four of her teeth were missing, one found lodged in her throat. The man that abused and killed her was a pig. They need to give pigs a new name because actual pigs aren't that reprehensible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, here's a link:

            I don't think this was from extractions. I'm posting to show that even without the stem cell theory, that these scumbags are so depraved as to think children's teeth get in the way of what they want to do.

            I believe the MSM media version of the Pickton pig farm murders in Canada is also dodgy.  There seems to be an established connection with pig farms and satanic cults/cannibalism etc.   Puts you off your eggs and bacon, eh.

            Just playing devils advocate bc I worked at a tattoo shop a long time ago and it was normal for tattoo shops to use dentist chairs bc they raise/lower/adjust/hold heavy people, etc...
Also could be used if your getting your hair done, more relaxing than a regular barber chair, same functions tho (up down tilt, etc)

            I read that they have people who own mortuaries.  It is very easy for them to dispose of bodies off the books through cremation.

            Of course, I would not discount anything.  I am just letting people know.

            Could be systems is not putting two and two together.  It is making shit up.  This inane theory is made up of unrelated pieces of evidence and then people are drawing conclusions on top of it.  Nobody here is actually interested in finding out what may be true.  They are just building​ towers of their own bullshit.   This thread itself it already build atop of a bullshit edifice.  You've convinced yourselves Alefantis is a serial murderer​ and the complete lack of evidence for that bullshit theory just makes search deeper to pull out more bullshit.   You've also convinced yourselves Alefantis is connected to Epstein.

             So the idea of entrapment schemes committed by Epstein or Alefantis is ridiculous.  But the idea of entrapment schemes committed by Russia on Trump is highly plausible.  Thank you for your valued opinions. /s

               Considering you said connecting, then yes there is probable cause.  There isn't direct evidence.  Any rape that is reported years later doesn't have physical evidence and yet there can still be convictions.

You can't be serious can you?   Putting aside the simple fact that using those symbols in no ways means you are a pedophile as they are fairly common designs just like saying pizza doesn't mean you are a pedophile.   Let's put that aside, it certainly isn't illegal and was not even done by Alefantis.     You know you're reaching terribly on this one, right?

Instagram?  So again no crime.  Like if I commented on my friend's instagram to "put down the crack pipe" that is not a crime.  Also pedophile yellow beads?  That's a thing?

What association?  This guy doesn't show up in the summary or the wiki.  Doesn't matter.  It's doesn't connect Alefantis to a crime.  Simply knowing a guy who committed a crime doesn't mean you are connected to it except it a silly little semantic way.

            Great post! This probably has 99.9% chance of having nothing to do with this but, it caught my attention when I was told this and thought I'd throw it out there. A friend of mine is an Endodontist and he mentioned like a month ago a shortage of Nitrous Oxide. He said he has a decent supply but worried when it's gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just talked to him again yesterday and it came up again...still a shortage and now he's getting very concerned. Very odd it's still in shortage. FDA posted in January about it. I know it's used for other things but dentistry is probably the #1 I would think.

             Nitrous oxide (poppers, whip-its, and just inhaling via mask) is used in the homo community to relax the anal sphincter.

             Some videos of some crappy songs by crappy bands using it were posted on here; I'll see if I can find them.

            I was thinking about this pig farm yesterday. I think they could also be slaughtering the bodies and selling it as pork. Or selling it as human (long pork) to those cannibal restaurants. Grind up the bones at the farm and sell the the powder to flour mills or that soap company in Pennsylvania or just mix it in with the top soil or compost.

            OMFG! Some of this depravity has to be related to centuries of inbreeding.It must be. We see these individuals 'functioning' on the outside in socially acceptable ways. And yet, story after story after story demonstrates, imo, that none of these unbelievable actions taken by this population even phases them as abnormal on any level. There needs to be a whole new personality disorder diagnosis in the DSM....

             To add to Jem777, the younger the tooth the more potent the stem cells. A fruitful line of research may be one of analyzing the need for or shortages of human teeth for stem cell research and dental treatment. I have found dentisits in my community to be overly eager to pull teeth and replace with a tooth implant which frequently requires bone grafts from cadavers. I say, there are not enough willing donors to supply the needs of the medical industry which in turn fuels illicit trade in body parts.

              . I wish we could all work together even when we don't agree or find evidence that oppose an earlier stated view. That is reasonable and in fact scientific. I am working on doing that more. It is hard when slurs and names are called and most people are trying to do the right thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe from the scientific study that I posted there is discussion about the stem cells that are available in different types of children's teeth, I.e. Molars, cuspids, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              They clearly have identified the most valuable teeth and process to obtain these stem cells. All indications this is from live children or at least recently alive children.
This seems like a great area of further research.

               You are quite right. I have not been submitting posts, just comments. The submissions are time consuming requiring hours of research and effort to compose. My goal in joining was to act as a self-appointed cheerleader - or cat herder - to offer suggestions and encouragement and to stimulate a more focused effort. I'm hoping for the day when we can dump packages of research and position papers into the laps of those in power like Trey Gowdy or our own Congressmen. I want to see us achieve some credibility.Become lobbyists if you will since I think we are acquiring a rather sophisticated level of understanding.

               On the issue of organ donors we need legislation at the national and international level, say WHO, World Heath Organization to toughen up laws that will discourage trafficking. All tissue and organs need to be certified  that they come from an unadulterated source, we do this for organic foods, don't we?

            Extraction is one possibility.  However, a full or even partial mouth extraction would put the person out of "service" for at least 24 hours while they recover from pain, bleeding.  One could argue they don't care, but I think "performance" would be hampered.  If impromptu sex is your goal, that would put a damper on your "fun."

            There are a few dental connections that have come up --
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a "special" dental RESTRAINT invented just for kids. It's called the PEDO Burrito.

            Dental restraints. Hmm…
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s the original application

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The trademark was simply typed words in all caps. It was sent in on a label, according to the paperwork. Not real impressive for a company logo. (And there also exists the possibility that this company is a front.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Meet Vacharee Peterson. She's listed as the trademark owner as an individual. There was also a former owner (same last name, and may have been a dentist), according to the paperwork. Husband or ex husband maybe?

            Vacharee is the CEO of the Community Dental Care. It’s a dental clinic, which includes pediatric patient treatment. She trademarked the Pedo Burrito name for her safety restraint device for young dental patients in 1999. CDC is a big practice, with four dental office locations.

            PICOH has a very interesting logo too.

            It looks like a butterfly, and is made up of two big people and one little person between them. We’ve seen these same type of logo arrangements before.

            I searched “Combination pediatric patient safety restraint and cushion for dental patients” and this was one result. Just an interesting book called “Pediatric Dentistry for Special Child” Google result
           </p>
           <p>
            Some interesting images came up in the search for pedo burrito

            As I was looking though the dental images of kids strapped helplessly to boards, with their mouths pried open with metal hooks, sedated at the hands of a sadist, I just get sick to my stomach.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I will just leave this here, if anyone is interested in pursuing it further.

            Dentistry plays a large role in trafficking somehow. Plenty of opportunities. There is stem cell harvesting. Trackers can be inserted. You can be injected with medications. You can be molested while you are unconscious. (My child went to a pediatric clinic once, and I was not pleased with the “no parents allowed in treatment room” policy. We swapped to a family dentist instead.) Are low-income kids being funneled into the dental system with all this low-cost/free care?

             and it states that she's originally from Thailand and went to dental school.

            <p>
             "Dr. Vacharee Peterson came to Minnesota from Thailand as a high school exchange student and stayed for Bethel College and dental school, but she had trouble finding a job because the dentists told her she did not look like a proper dentist."

             The Thailand thing might be something? We all know a bunch of shit goes on there.
