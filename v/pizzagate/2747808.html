<p>AntiPope  Francis is very concerned about the youth of today. He founded a school corporation in Argentina in 2001 and took the headquarters with him to Rome in 2013  <a href="http://web.scholasoccurrentes.org/en/">http://web.scholasoccurrentes.org/en/</a></p>
<p>The school Scholas Occurentes is a nondenominational organization of 400,000 schools in 80 countries with the motto &quot;We\'re not going to change the world unless we change education&quot; Children from Dubai to Dominican Republic are featured on the FB page <a href="https://www.face">https://www.face</a> book.com/scholasoccurrentes</p>
<p>Avoiding religious proselytism, with an emphasis on sports and arts, The AntiPope draws the kids in. “Today we can not think education without sport”says Francis. <a href="http://web.scholasoccurrentes.org/2016/10/12/pope-francisco-with-players-in-the-pre-game-united-for-peace/">http://web.scholasoccurrentes.org/2016/10/12/pope-francisco-with-players-in-the-pre-game-united-for-peace/</a> 
 Vatican Radio issued the news that the pope was promoting on the following May 7 “a boxing match between a Catholic and a Muslim in Las Vegas.”
 Major soccer stars like Maradonna, and Ronaldinho, boxing stars Oscar de la Hoya and rock stars like Bono lend their names to the school.http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1351308bdc4.html</p>
<p>After meeting with Francis and agreeing to participate in Scholas, &quot;We have not discovered what we\'re going to do together,” Bono, a big friend of Cardinal pedophile McCarrick, said, “but we\'re kind of in love with each other.” <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/before-abuse-scandal-bono-dedicated-song-to-his-old-friend-cardinal-mccarri">https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/before-abuse-scandal-bono-dedicated-song-to-his-old-friend-cardinal-mccarri</a> </p>
<p>Bono also discussed the current pedophile crisis with the AntiPope: <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/bono-says-pope-francis-aghast-church-sex-abuse-300081">https://www.buzz.ie/news/bono-says-pope-francis-aghast-church-sex-abuse-300081</a> &quot; And you can see the pain in his face and I felt he was sincere.&quot;

 Bono has been quoted as saying in the past: Christ was either who he said he was, or he is &quot;a complete and utter nutcase&quot; He owns 1.5% of FB, owns a chunk of Forbes, speaks out against poverty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono</a></p>
<p>The vice president of this school is Archbishop Sanchez Sorondo: <a href="http://angelqueen.org/2017/08/11/sanchez-sorondo-archbishop-friend-of-the-powerful-antinatalists-who-never-celebrates-mass-or-prays-the-breviary/">http://angelqueen.org/2017/08/11/sanchez-sorondo-archbishop-friend-of-the-powerful-antinatalists-who-never-celebrates-mass-or-prays-the-breviary/</a></p>
<p>Sorondo is the AntiPope\'s right hand man, responsible among other things for  inviting controversial Stanford University professor, Paul R. Ehrlich , a well-known Neo-Malthusian, and famous for his defense of abortion as a measure for population control to a conference on biological extinction , promoted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and Social Sciences, which took place last March.
&quot; He is responsible for a new ambiguity and accomodation in matters of life, culture of death and sterilization as a solution to environmental problems and climate change.&quot; eponymousflower.blogspot.com/search/label/Archbishop Marcelo..</p>
<p>The directors of Scholas Occurrentes are also called upon at times to speak at conferences organized by other Vatican organisms. For example, that of November 13-16, 2015, sponsored by the pontifical academy of sciences, on the theme: “Children and sustainable development, a challenge for education.”
Noteworthy among the speakers, in addition to the famous neo-Malthusian economist Jeffrey Sachs, who has become inevitable at such appointments, were Enrique Palmeyro and another top director of the Scholas, the Argentine María Paz Jurado, this latter on the issue of “global citizenship” as “a paradigm shift in education.”

<p>Funding for Scholas is linked to IRSA a company owned by a Eduardo Sergio Elsztain considered the wealthiest Jew in South America. Elsztain got his start with 10 million dollars seed money from Soros.
In addition to Soros, Elsztain has also worked closely with U.S. real estate magnate Sam Zell, U.S. investment fund honcho Michael Steinhardt, and Hollywood mogul Edgar Bronfman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Elsztain">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Elsztain</a>

<p>The curriculum is not exactly your Catholic parochial school: </p>
<p>The school passes out booklets on Family; Diversity; Self Esteem; and Creativity. In the booklet on Diversity, for example, different forms of family — ambiguously including homosexual couples with children — are pictured.
Under Self Esteem: there is a cat that wants to be a dog. At the end of the story, a donkey supports the cat in this desire, and the cat is shown sitting in a doghouse with a bone in front of it. The message here is that one may choose what one wishes to be,“ One critic says There is nothing remotely Catholic in these texts. There is little reference to God, a couple of fleeting but ambiguous references to (Our Lord) Jesus, no mention of Mary or the saints nor prayer, mortification and self-denial. <a href="https://onepeterfive.com/scholas-occurrentes-another-vatican-soros-connection/">https://onepeterfive.com/scholas-occurrentes-another-vatican-soros-connection/</a></p>

             Link? Using children as a front for illegal activities, sounds about right for an AntiPope that turned his eyes away from babies being taken from their mothers to give to the military during Operation Condor.

              This is Jorge Sonnante's twitter. He is a Deacon and is bringing evidence to the Argentinian Court. Cristina Kirchner is going to jail, the problem is finding where all the money has gone (almost a billion), Jorge Sonnante is stating that it has been laundried through several welfare societies from the Church and being thus sent to the Vatican Banks as donations.

           <p>
            PICO National Network was founded in 1972 by John Baumann, as the Pacific Institute for Community Organization (PICO), headquartered in Oakland, California. In the late 1960s Baumann had worked with community organizing projects in Chicago, where he became familiar with Saul Alinsky's ideas. During the 1970s, PICO worked with five neighborhood-based organizations, recruiting individuals and families. As neighborhoods experienced the economic and social upheavals of that decade, the neighborhood-based model of organizing became less viable as communities fractured.[8]
           </p>
           <p>
            Following a staff retreat in 1984, PICO shifted to a congregation-based model based in part on the experience of COPS, a federation in San Antonio, Texas developed by Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation. As it expanded beyond the West Coast, in 2004 PICO characterized its acronym as standing for People Improving Communities through Organizing. In 2005, it renamed itself PICO National Network, emphasizing the autonomy of its affiliated organizations, and its role developing national strategy, training, and consultation.[9]

            Oops! I left out this source of the quote. It's the Pope Bono was referring to:
"He was at the Vatican this week to sign an agreement between his charity, One, which seeks to support education and eradicate poverty, and the Catholic Church’s Scholas Occurrentes, which is also focused on educational initiatives. 
Bono said he was “intrigued” by the work Scholas is doing. 
“We haven’t figured out what we’re going to do together, but we sort of have a crush on each other,” he told the Catholic news site Crux.

            After meeting with Francis and agreeing to participate in Scholas, "We have not discovered what we're going to do together,” Bono, a big friend of Cardinal pedophile McCarrick, said, “but we're kind of in love with each other.”
           </p>
           <p>
            OOH.  WOW.  Was Bono in that bed with the 5 seminarians and McCarrick.  We are in love with each other?  What kind of statement is that for a Rock Star to make about a Cardinal?   Tell you the truth this is not surprising at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if that is not enough, Bono and the Cardinal, Women are up in arms over their Church and their pope.
