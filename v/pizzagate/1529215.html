            I have had friends who adopted children from Russia. They had very serious issues which were caused by attachment disorder. These children weren't physically abused as infants, per se, instead they were never held or loved on, and remained in cribs with bottles propped up when it was time to eat. The bonding time is imperative to emotional stability and these children would be adopted after having lived in that kind of environment for 0-3 hrs most of the time and have enormous problems bonding with their adoptive parents. They also had sociopathic types of tendencies. That sounds harsh, but it's the best way to describe their behavior where they would purposefully try to harm the parents or adopted siblings, either emotionally/physically and have no remorse over it. It's really sad bc these adoptive parents desperately wanted to rescue these kids and give them a better life and it turned into a nightmare. There are shows on it I'm sure you could find done by 20/20, Dateline ect.

             That describes the article I read. I was considering  adopting and decided not to after reading that article. I think there was alot of undiagnosed fetal alcohol syndrome, and rather than building disability programs and agencies instead  they shipped them out.  FAS often have  little to no empathy and a  self absorbed nature.... which would make good politicians with thw right education. Sadly.

             I wonder if  the Russian version of CPS has changed their level of care.
             <br/>
             Not that I think CPS  isn't flawed; it's a nightmare.

             During  that era north american institutions were equally horrific.  They'd line everybody up and spray them down with a hose, and that was the nicer side of institutions. The west has made a combined effort to reduce institutions... but that's  a big mess too.

              Ya..some of the stories I saw really were heartbreaking. I think it may have been a Diane Sawyer show that I saw that showed the babies all in their cribs with bottles propped up and never being held. The only human touch they would have was being changed. So you're right, upon reflection I believe there was a combination of children w FAS and the attachment disorder. Terrible combo. My friends struggled to find ways to reach their children emotionally. It became a nightmare.

            the problem with Russian adoptions was most of the children's parents were either alcoholics or druggies, so the children were damaged..  more than one adoptive parent send or tried to send the child back to Russia.

             Yeah,  I remember reading that  some people sent children back, because the children weren't  responding to the adoption.
However,  the article I read was dated from  the early to mid '90's.
