            I think that it's a little like the trump campaign. There was a silent majority that was totally underestimated. A lot of people are concerned about the lack of privacy and don't come out publicly on social media, a lot of people are not even on social media. It does not mean they don't know. i think google, Reddit YouTube Facebook, manipulated the counts so it would appear that this movement had less traction. In fact pizzagate is such a threat that the news outlets globally are parroting the same message about fake news even the pope!. A group of  conspiracy theorists amounting to 7000 on voat would not trigger that reaction. The people all the way at the top are reacting to this. This is bigger already than any of us knows. Just my opinion. :)

             That is a pretty good way of thinking about it actually, it just feels like it hasnt quite penetrated that particular percentage of people we require for tipping point, but maybe were very close.

             It wasn't underestimated, they were rigging the polls in favor of democrat voters. The trump camp was doing it's own internal polling in battleground states and the results were not surprising to them.

            I only 'woke up' a couple months ago after reading wikileaks and seeing the media's dishonest coverage of it. I was red-pilled on the dishonesty and corruption of our establishment shortly before pizzagate broke, so it was easier for me believe, otherwise I probably wouldn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we'll have a lot of trouble convincing people who trust the media by default that pizzagate is real. Most mainstream sources do a very good job of presenting themselves as educated and giving themselves a lot of self-referential authority, and when the alternative news source is a passionate mob yelling "Clinton is involved in a satanic pedophile ring!", we don't look credible.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think our best bet with the masses is to split our efforts and take out/ discredit the news sources directly. Those who are skeptical of the news already are likely to end up here on their own, it's the indoctrinated we want to create doubt in. Destroy the machine they're plugged into through weaponed memes that show news sources contradicting themselves or being wrong.

            It's only blatant to those who know what to look for.

            Most of us, assumedly, have been 'balls deep' in this kinda crap for years going on decades for some. Others are still very much asleep, it's in the title even - you're talking about the "sheeple", this term has always implied a great difficulty in getting through to the people in question; it is on us to take their utterly slap-dash spin and turn the kinetic into potential that bolsters our public image as opposed to damaging it.

            Get talking, use meme-magic, soundbytes, provoke conversation and let it take on it's own form - use the same tactics without the malicious intent, in saying that though, I must stress that NLP and cognitive dissonance are not ethical in the slightest and should not be used to spread awareness.

            Hillary jumping into the ring might be a huge godsend for this.  Look at the comments in this article:

            When fake news first broke, it was hard to find many critical of it but when a person with many documented lies tells you that all of the opposition is false it's beautiful irony.  This hero who dodged sniper fire might just save the day.  The number of subscribers is still growing.

             Thats definitely one thing i was thinking today! 
Surely if the worlds biggest pathological liar is telling you 'Dont believe the lies' that beautiful irony will force some people to go 'wait a fucking second...'

            Unfortunately they have been mass blinding society so long, people just believe it's possible.  Others would rather pretend the world is a safe place and be ignorant than face the horrific truth.  They are the ones who won't move forward when everything changes.
