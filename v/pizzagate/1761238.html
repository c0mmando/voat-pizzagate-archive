            Fake or not, his audience is wide and maybe it got people looking into it? I bet if anyone did a search on this with key words, Epstein had to show up on their search, no? Is that a bad thing? I'm not saying I believe she was genuine, but loved the exposure of the subject which we know is true.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or are u guys saying possibly a set up where this girl later is found to be a liar. If so, that would suck, especially for "Dr Phil" since he always claims to do his research on people. LOL

            Horsefucker, you're stealing my ideas from comments I made 9 days ago about this, and then you are adding your own twist of gaslighting and linking to an external video to justify your "ideas" and submission credentials.

            This episode is still good redpill material for normies, many of whom like and trust Not-really-a-Dr. Phil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever you may think of Phil, or even if you think "Kendall" was just a LARP, this episode is still helpful in waking people.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if it turns out Phil pulled some kind of scam with this episode? Well, by then, I would hope you've opened the normies' eyes to all the other evidence so that they realize Phil doesn't matter, the kids do.

            Even some "limited hangout" content can potentially pry the sleepy eye a crack, if you're smart about it.

            must admit this info makes a point.  i watched the episode half attentively and didn't think it that suspicious, but hard to ignore the questions raised by this post and the A call for an uprising yt vid such as a) why wasn't an investigation announced into the parents or the handlers if Phil in fact thought it credible?; b) how did the girl get free of such a 'powerful' owner/handler to do the show?   definite grounds for skepticism imo
