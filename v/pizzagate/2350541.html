<p>The church is a non profit and their biggest donor is a shell company which is part of another shell company which is owned by the same A+ list mogul we have seen time and time again in all of these stories. This is where things get a little interesting. Because of the racial makeup in the community, and wanting to make sure everyone blends in, they had to get the tweens and teens from Europe. Specifically they found some orphanages in Eastern Europe. How did they get them all into the country? Well, every church needs religious workers. The church hired twenty &quot;pastors&quot; and got them in as special immigrant religious workers. Each of these &quot;pastors&quot; had between four and six children they brought in with them, and of course their wives, many of whom had their own children too. Of course, none of these pastors or wives really have any kids they brought, but almost overnight, what these people have created is a fully functioning, safe from prying eyes place where these kids are being abused. Apparently, much like their protectors, they want to ensure a never ending supply, by having the teens get pregnant as often as possible.</p>

<p>Apparently The Church is finding it more difficult to bring in children the way they have in the past. That elusive head of the Church has donated tens of millions of dollars to research against diseases, many of which adversely affect third world countries. It was during this process of trying to eradicate a disease that one of the scientists created a pathogen which can kill swiftly and effectively. When the head of The Church heard about it, he agreed to test it on a village in a country that was friendly to bribes. It worked really well. It killed an astonishing number of people which were mainly adults. The children of the adults were 30-40 miles distant at a boarding school. Now, with no parents, they needed to be adopted. The Church, along with more bribes to the government had a great way to get large numbers of children quickly.</p>

<p>Why would a church way out in the middle of nowhere America be spending so much time in Africa? Where is the church getting all of this money? Apparently that is another reason they are in Africa. Several years ago they learned about the presence of a &quot;map.&quot; I call it a map but it was just a sheet of laminated paper. On that paper were the names of apartment buildings and apartment numbers. These apartments were scattered across almost every country in Africa.</p>
<p>Where was this sheet of paper located? <strong>Libya. It was the treasure that Gaddafi had stolen from his own country and also all of the ill gotten gains he collected for being the pimp to every bad desire everyone had ever wanted fulfilled</strong>. If you go back a few years, I wrote about one of those horrible fantasies and the members of Hollywood involved.</p>
<p>Well, to top that al off we have SGT Report with over 118,000 views racked up for Pizzagate, and I\'m about to drop THIS THREAD on his youtube comments. I\'d say that\'s a pretty good day for the good side, wouldn\'t you?</p>

            LOCK THEM UP!
As someone who has followed the corrupt Clintons since the '90's, this comment sums it up:
"Pollyanna Pangloss
20 hours ago
I think I'm getting accusation fatigue. I am 47. I have been hearing accusations against the Clintons since the 90s. The imminent arrest of the Clinton crime circle has been perpetually imminent for almost three decades. I don't think the date of the Rapture has been predicted as many times--and that happens at least a few times every decade.
           </p>

            In a way, just making accusations has become its own industry. Arrests are unnecessary. The accusers make a living accusing, and the accused make their living doing accusable things. It seems to work pretty well for both sides. Everybody is getting paid. This arrangement seems highly profitable for both sides. Look how large and profitable InfoWars has become since 2004 (when I first heard of it).  Look how rich the Clintons have become. Both sides continue to grow in wealth and influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both sides not only get to make lots of money but they become "rock stars" in their own right. Alex Jones is famous now on a global scale. So are the Clintons. The people they bring into the fold also become wealthier and more well known. Both sides profit so much its hard to see how either one would want any of this to end.
           </p>
           <p>
            This relationship between the "deep-state/globalists/illuminati/term-of-your-choice" and the community of "truth seeking patriots" is about as symbiotic as it gets. They really need each other at this point, given what a profitable arrangement it has become. Both sides appear to be getting exactly what they want, without getting "exactly what they want" in a way that dries up the relationship.

            For those of us watching, it is starting to look like something out of ancient mythology. The eagle visits its prey, disembowels, and eats the guts. They grow back the next day, and the whole thing repeats itself--ad infinitum.﻿"

Citizens would gather and throw rocks at the corrupt politician until they were run out of town.

             I take your proposal and raise you one "Monokuma style very special punishment". Take the bastards and punish them in an extremely ironic fashion related to either who they are, or their crime. Fully public too.

              Denuding of wealth, of course.
Extreme physical punishment is inhuman, we should not do that to ourselves.
Public humiliation is OK.  I advocate bringing back stocks and taking people like Podesta town square to town square, all day in stocks, for the rest of their lives.

              No throwing things, it could be unsanitary. No spitting, unsanitary.

              Urine, however, is sterile. Direct application is most sterile. Towns need more urinals anyway.

             That could describe the whole criminal justice system  where they all feed of each other - criminals, police, defenders, prosecutors, judges... Thats why in these capital cases I'd be for Military Tribunals and fast sentences. The less attention we give these people and the faster we move on the better... else it just becomes another form of media entertainment.

               As Sam Vaknin explains there is such a huge difference between health Narcissism and Pathological/ Malignant Narcissism that they could do well to be called different names.

                Our Island Girl that gave us the tip does not know if this is it or not.  Says she was held there a long time ago.  Very bad memories.  I told her we would check it out and let her know if anything pops up. The owners are important. And should be researched.  Do you want to help?

                    They are wasting our money on all sorts of things.  It is our money.  They act as if they should not give it back to us. Medicare and Soc. Sec. are Insurance Policies.  They act as if they are charities.  As if they are giving us a Hand Out.  Here we see Loads of Cash.  It is all going to them.  Sick.

              There is a very iconic hotdog stand on Alii Drive near Kailua-Kona Big Island. I don’t dare ask anyone to go and get pictures. Run by gays. Right on the beach. Been there for many years. I can’t do google earth on my phone. Should be easy to locate for your experts.

                I have posted the info of the place I found in this thread.  I sent info to 2 others and have not recd. response.  I need help looking into the owner of the place since I am not on facebook.  I know there is a tie in to Chicago and the hot dogs come from there too.  I also got the name of the street from our Abuse Victim who I now call Island Girl.  She knew the name of the street and this is the one that came up.  Please help if you can.  Here are my two comment posts.
               </p>
               <p>
                Have not had any time to look into this but here it is

                Our Island Girl that gave us the tip does not know if this is it or not. Says she was held there a long time ago. Very bad memories. I told her we would check it out and let her know if anything pops up. The owners are important. And should be researched. Do you want to help?  AND
               </p>
               <p>
                This is the owner of island olonoa grill Chris Colby His pic on facebook is super creepy Here is link for his facebook I can't get in, do you have an acct?

                he serves dogs from Chicago and his favorite baseball team is the Chicago Cubs. Could he have an Obama/Chicago connection?  It is possible, but I need help.

                 Interesting lead. How does one go from chicargo to arizona to just owning and operating a small eatery in hawaii, you'd think that would be a locals business pursuit. Must be the special hot dogs.  It seems as though you have a legitimate source for some kind of claim, I would hope as your witness calms down and is willing to open up more you might learn more we can work with.

                  She knows of this hot dog place because of her background but she was not held there during some horrid things they did to her.  She had problems even discussing it.  I have talked to quite a few Victims and know that they can become physically sick which can trigger some very bad psychological reactions.  So, I don't know if she will have any info on this.  I just hope this does not just float away.  I can't check this guy and his friends out, cause I don't have a FB acct.  Hopefully someone will see it.

                Just overcoming an entire lifetime of abuse, targeting and unusual life experiences... there are no coincidences. Wish I could tell all.
People need to tear Warner Brothers studios apart... name by name from it’s inception.
Especially the animation department.
