<h2 id="md-preface">Preface</h2>
<p><strong>Bill Clinton appointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Berman">Judge Richard M. Berman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Garaufis">Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis</a> to district courts in NY, where they are now presiding over the Epstein and NXIVM trials</strong>, respectively.  This information is out in the open and in and of itself, would <em>appear to constitute major conflicts of interest</em> regarding two eerily similar and politically stunning sex trafficking cases.</p>
<p>During the course of my research, I began to realize that <strong>Lynn Forester de Rothschild\'s</strong> relationship with Clintons, along with several different people tied to <strong>both judges</strong>, creates <em>the appearance of additional conflicts of interest</em>.  Because of this, <strong>I have arranged the post according to Lady Rothschild\'s relationships with each party</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="md-lynn-forester-de-rothschild">Lynn Forester de Rothschild</h2>
<h3 id="md-connection-to-ghislaine-maxwell">1. Connection to Ghislaine Maxwell</h3>
<p>She owns a Manhattan property close to Epstein\'s and back in 2015, the UK\'s <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/madam-maxwell-linked-to-film-stars-and-top-politicians-j2s00hdqp3c">Sunday Times reported that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms Maxwell, 53, was photographed [this] weekend outside her home in New York where she moved after the death of her father, the disgraced newspaper mogul Robert Maxwell, in 1991.</p>
<p>The Manhattan property, which is close to Epsteinâ€™s mansion, is owned by Lynn Forester de Rothschild, wife of the British financier Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ghislaine is also a former member of the Clinton Global Initiative according to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/35046616/081-Clinton-s-Global-Initiative-2007-Members-include-ARK-Paul-Bernstein">a 2007 members list</a>.</p>
<h3 id="md-connection-to-jeffrey-epstein">2. Connection to Jeffrey Epstein</h3>
<p>Her husband, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1508273-jeffrey-epsteins-little-black-book-redacted.html">appears in Epstein\'s little black book</a> on page 48.</p>
<p><strong>Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport</strong>.  According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Forester_de_Rothschild#Early_life_and_education">Wikipedia</a>, Rothschild\'s father was <strong>&quot;president and owner of the General Aviation Aircraft Services, now Meridian, in Teterboro, New Jersey.&quot;</strong>  It is likely that he would have spent a lot of time working out of Teterboro Airport, although the page source on that has already been 404\'d.</p>
<p>In addition to Madame Maxwell, <strong>Epstein\'s brother, Mark, was also a member of <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/35046616/081-Clinton-s-Global-Initiative-2007-Members-include-ARK-Paul-Bernstein">the Clinton Global Initiative in 2007</a></strong>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a2295/lynn-forester-de-rothschild-interview-0514/">Harper\'s Bazaar</a>, Lynn\'s first job after law school was with the firm <strong>Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett</strong>.  According to Wikipedia\'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_Thacher_%26_Bartlett#Notable_alumni">list of notable alumni</a>, <strong>Cy Vance worked there</strong> as well, albeit long before Ghislaine.  I only mention this because the name Cy Vance ended up ringing a bell, but I couldn\'t remember why.  I did a quick search and realized that <strong>Vance\'s son, Cy Vance, Jr.</strong>, was not only <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/02/manhattan-da-subpoenas-trump-organization-over-stormy-daniels-hush-money-payments/">in the NY Post this week</a> for subpoenaing a Trump organization over the whole Stormy Daniels hush-money fiasco, but he also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/nyregion/cyrus-vance-epstein.html">made the New York Times 3 weeks ago</a> because it was <strong>his office who attempted to get Epstein\'s sex offender status lowered in New York</strong>!</p>
<h3 id="md-connection-to-alan-dershowitz">3. Connection to Alan Dershowitz</h3>
<p>I <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3363760">posted about this</a> a few days ago and included a link to a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3Th7aBx5s&amp;feature=youtu.be">clip of Dershowitz</a> stating he was introduced to Epstein by Lady Rothschild</strong>.  I have been speculating that he dropped her name as a way of silently indicating his protected status among the elite.</p>
<h3 id="md-connection-to-judge-richard-m.-berman-judge-for-the-epstein-trial">4. Connection to Judge Richard M. Berman (Judge for the Epstein Trial)</h3>
<p>Long before she married into the Rothschild family, she volunteered on the U.S. Senate campaign of <strong>Daniel Patrick Moynihan</strong>.  <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/economist-magazine-shareholders-british-commerce-rothschild/">According to Politico</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In between studies at Pomona College, a private liberal arts school in Claremont, Calif., and Columbia Law School, she began a long association with Democratic politics, volunteering for the U.S. Senate campaign of Daniel Patrick Moynihan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Lynn was born in 1954, then she would be 18 years old (entering college) in 1972.  If she spent 4 years at Pomona College, that would bring us to 1976.  Moynihan was elected in 1976, so it would reasonable to believe that Lynn volunteered on Moynihan\'s very first campaign for Senate.  In 1977, Moynihan was a co-chair, along with <strong>Jacob K. Javits</strong>, of the New York State Alliance to Save Energy.  <strong>Javits\'s executive assistant at the time, Richard M. Berman</strong>, was appointed as the executive director of this alliance.</p>
<p>While it seems likely that this appointment was more influenced by Javits, <strong>it is quite a coincidence that out of all the judges that could have presided over the Epstein trial, it was Judge Richard M. Berman who was selected.  And on top of that, out of all the courthouses this trial could have taken place in, it is currently taking place in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/judge/Berman">Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse</a>!</strong></p>
<p>At this point, I am sure many of you will want to <strong>dig deeper into Judge Richard M. Berman</strong>.  If you would like a head start, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xyftwTdUaE">this video</a> I made a few days ago to accompany <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3363677">this Voat post</a>.  With the help of a fellow Voat user, I came very <strong>close to being able to connect Judge Berman to notorious California pedophile, Harry Baker</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="md-connection-to-judge-nicholas-g.-garaufis-judge-for-the-nxivm-trial">5. Connection to Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis (Judge for the NXIVM Trial)</h3>
<p>According to her Wikipedia, Rothschild sits on the Board of <strong>Bronfman E.L. Rothschild LP</strong>.  There is no citation for this, but a former CEO confirms <strong>both her and Matthew Bronfman as members of the board of directors</strong> in <a href="https://riabiz.com/a/2017/5/11/how-neal-simon-parlayed-a-hoity-toity-family-office-ria-into-a-5-billion-serial-buyer-in-two-years-by-letting-the-whale-swallow-him-first">an interview with RIABiz.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RIABiz: Is this a new position for the company? If yes, why is the position being created now?</p>
<p>Simon: Marilyn\'s position is a new one for the company. We have been anxious to grow our presence in New York. Not only does Bronfman Rothschild have a current office in New York, but several of our board members are based there as well, including Matthew Bronfman, Eli Goldstein and Lynn Forester de Rothschild.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bronfmans, particularly <strong>Sara, Clare, and their father, Edgar</strong>, were the principal funders of the NXIVM sex cult that is currently being prosecuted in New York.  <strong>The three of them also appear on <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/35046616/081-Clinton-s-Global-Initiative-2007-Members-include-ARK-Paul-Bernstein">the Clinton Global Initiative members list for 2007</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Presiding over the NXIVM trial is <strong>Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis, who, like Judge Berman, <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-nicholas-g-garaufis">was appointed to that judgeship by Bill Clinton</a></strong>.  Unlike Judge Berman, <strong>Garaufis actually <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-nicholas-g-garaufis">served in the Clinton Administration</a> as Chief Counsel to the Federal Aviation Administration</strong>!  
</p>
<p>Before he was a part of the Clinton Administration, <strong><a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-nicholas-g-garaufis">Garaufis was the assistant Attorney General under Louis J. Lefkowitz</a></strong>.  I have been working to see if Louis J. Lefkowitz is related to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Lefkowitz">Jay Lefkowitz</a>, one of the lawyers who negotiated the now infamous plea deal with the office of Alexander Acosta</strong>.  Apparently, Louis J. Lefkowitz has a brother named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/12/archives/leo-lefkowitz.html">Leo Lefkowitz</a> and Jay Lefkowitz has an uncle named Leonard Lefkowitz according to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/obituaries/jerome-lefkowitz-a-force-in-new-york-labor-law-dies-at-86.html">father\'s (Jerome Lefkowitz) obituary</a>.  I\'m Just not 100% sure that they are one-in-the-same.  <strong>Any information establishing the two as the same person would be greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
<p>Judge Garaufis was <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/sex-cult-brooklyn-judge-1.31431929">in the news recently</a> for having <strong>ordered a prosecuting lawyer to cease questioning Lauren Salzman after she broke down during the NXIVM trial</strong>.  How nice of him.  Oh, and I almost forgot.  Lauren Salzman\'s mom, <strong>Nancy Salzman, was also a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/35046616/081-Clinton-s-Global-Initiative-2007-Members-include-ARK-Paul-Bernstein">2007 Clinton Global Initiative member</a> as well</strong>. </p>
<h2 id="md-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am sure there are other connections I have either missed or not found yet.  <strong>Please comment anything else you end up finding along these lines</strong>.  Thanks for reading and watching!</p>',

           a few days ago and included a link to a

            stating he was introduced to Epstein by Lady Rothschild

           .  I have been speculating that he dropped her name as a way of silently indicating his protected status among the elite.

          </h3>
          <p>
           Long before she married into the Rothschild family, she volunteered on the U.S. Senate campaign of
           <strong>
            Daniel Patrick Moynihan
           </strong>
           .
           <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/economist-magazine-shareholders-british-commerce-rothschild/">
            According to Politico
           </a>
           :
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            In between studies at Pomona College, a private liberal arts school in Claremont, Calif., and Columbia Law School, she began a long association with Democratic politics, volunteering for the U.S. Senate campaign of Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           If Lynn was born in 1954, then she would be 18 years old (entering college) in 1972.  If she spent 4 years at Pomona College, that would bring us to 1976.  Moynihan was elected in 1976, so it would reasonable to believe that Lynn volunteered on Moynihan's very first campaign for Senate.  In 1977, Moynihan was a co-chair, along with
           <strong>
            Jacob K. Javits
           </strong>
           , of the New York State Alliance to Save Energy.
           <strong>
            Javits's executive assistant at the time, Richard M. Berman
           </strong>
           , was appointed as the executive director of this alliance.
          </p>
          <p>
           While it seems likely that this appointment was more influenced by Javits,
           <strong>
            it is quite a coincidence that out of all the judges that could have presided over the Epstein trial, it was Judge Richard M. Berman who was selected.  And on top of that, out of all the courthouses this trial could have taken place in, it is currently taking place in the
            <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/judge/Berman">

           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           At this point, I am sure many of you will want to
           <strong>
            dig deeper into Judge Richard M. Berman
           </strong>
           .  If you would like a head start, see

            close to being able to connect Judge Berman to notorious California pedophile, Harry Baker

           <p>
            Simon: Marilyn's position is a new one for the company. We have been anxious to grow our presence in New York. Not only does Bronfman Rothschild have a current office in New York, but several of our board members are based there as well, including Matthew Bronfman, Eli Goldstein and Lynn Forester de Rothschild.

            Are you a Qtard perchance?  Javits was THE biggest spokesman for the 1965 immigration law which was America's death sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I cant believe you people will make posts about chemtrails brainwashing us to accept NWO, but totally ignore REPLACING WHITES WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD THE SAME RULING PARTY FOR OVER 100 YEARS (Mexicans).
           </p>
           <p>
            Javits, like almost every single name you mentioned in this lengthy and quality post, is of course a kike.  Here's him outright lying about the laws effects:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The limits were high enough, Senator Javits conceded, that immigration from the Western Hemisphere under the new law "would be approximately the same as the level reached last year"â€”a modest 140,000 or thereabouts. Yet the total number of persons of Mexican origin in the U.S. went from 5 million in 1970, the first census after the act, to almost 34 million today.
            </p>

            Lmfao what the fuck is Trump or JewAnon gonna do to change how stupid and lazy and un-civic Mexicans are?   At least they dont disproportionately engage in pedophilia and child marriage, right?  LOL
