I'm thinking after reading this interview that if anything is going on at the Salamander resort, she is most likely NOT involved!

            I think there's something to be said for Mommy Gut. Perhaps I'm too eager for this to be a good lead, but I went to the link to their website, immediately clicked "Tailgating and Activities," and saw they're having a Hat Contest. The categories to win are:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Best Racing Theme
            </li>
            <li>
             Funniest/Most Outrageous
            </li>
            <li>
             Most Glamorous/Elegant
             <strong>
              4. Best Child (under 18)
             </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
             Best Men’s Showing
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            The "Child" one could so easily be completely innocent, but knowing what I know now -- that moneyed sporting events are always havens for these traffickers and "owners" of trafficked kids -- seeing that category made me really uncomfortable.

            p.s. We also have a "secret" military base nearby that has been the topic of much local suspicion for years! It' is rumored to have levels deep into the mountain and be the "designated survivor" location. Countless conspiracies surround this location and I have personally witnessed odd vehicles and even my own son had a machine gun held up to him by a "government security" agent while he was hiking nearby!
           </p>
           <p>
            From the road you can even see what looks to be apartment buildings that even have a playground, but are surrounded in barbed wire fencing within the main barbwire fencing. Weird!
