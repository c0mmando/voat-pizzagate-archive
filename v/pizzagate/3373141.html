By definition, just standing there with a gun, such that the other person feels threatened, would qualify. Welch was never charged with discharging a firearm inside a building.

<p>REPOSTING:</p>
<p>&quot;North Carolina arrest records for an Edgar Maddison Welch date back to 2007, and include charges of possession of up to a half ounce of marijuana, possession of controlled substances, driving after consuming alcohol and driving with an open container of alcohol. He plead guilty on the alcohol and drug charges.</p>
<p>In October, Welch is alleged to have struck a 13-year-old with a car on Harrison Road in Salisbury, according to a WBTV story. He stayed at the scene, it was reported. Officials said the victim suffered head, torso and leg injuries.</p>
<p>Reports emerged late Sunday that Welch might be a struggling actor, with a resume that includes a half dozen minor jobs on film productions, including being an extra and production assistant.&quot; <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article118902963.html#storylink=cpy">http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article118902963.html#storylink=cpy</a></p>

            Why would an armed man, looking to rescue children shoot into a locked door?

               I already did the "fire" in real time as they were releasing reports and video on it. Interestingly,the story quickly went away.

              <p>
               Search VOAT archives for it. I tried to do a timeline for the Welch visit, but it was impossible due to conflicting reports.

            </p>
            <p>
             Even weirder, he first tried to open it with a "butter knife" according to the FBI criminal complaint. Evidently, the closet wall didn't go to the ceiling because it says that after unsuccessfully USING A BUTTER KNIFE and trying to shoot the lock open, he got on a chair to look over the wall and see inside. WHAAAAT?
            </p>
            <p>
             Fox news says Welch also had a knife. A KNIFE WAS NOT LISTED IN EITHER THE FBI complaint OR POLICE REPORT. It is ONLY mentioned in the FBI complaint in reference to a BUTTER KNIFE being used to pry open the lock. One might assume Welch took the time to grab one from the kitchen..

            </p>
            <p>
             SEE :28   Appears to be big hole in top of server.  Do they want us to believe this is from the (3) shots fired at the lock? Is that why they say he stood on a chair (to get that angle)?

             Of course Megan didn't ask James about his IG photo of a walk-in (cooler) with a friend commenting "kill room."

             We clearly see the locked room in question right next to the presumed "SIDE" door that leads (down steps?) to the exit next to the white outside building BEHIND Little Fox. Gun shots would have been pretty loud (3 claimed) if you were just outside that door. The police report did list a "damaged" hard drive.

             At 1:45 we see the only "back" door to Comet (it exits the back "party" room. Notice it is level with the parking lot. The party room is actually a ground floor with the restaurant being at an upstairs level. Notice, THERE IS NO FREEZER OUTSIDE THIS DOOR.

            <p>
             As per comments below, there might be a SIDE door off the kitchen on the UPPER level of Comet that is next to some sort of attached small room off the back of Little Red Fox next door. This could be the location of the "freezer."

              LOL! The Google censors have just made it so you can't freeze the video at 1:45. If you move it by hand through the frames, you can clearly see the back door with no freezer.

             I doubt it. No way to verify unless you get James to show you where the employee got the frozen pizza dough. I don't see a freezer in Comet's alley from Google maps. Megan Kelly never asked him about that. It's still a MYSTERY!

            With regards to the alley and dough thing, that would be the cooler/storage room out the back of Comet. I remember reading a while ago somewhere that they share the usage of that with
            <em>
             Little Red Fox
            </em>
            next door, so not much in that one really.

             I never read that. Could you get a link? They kept their jars of pizza sauce at James' other restaurant, Buck's, two doors down. I think the only back door to the parking lot is in the curtained "party room" in the back. Is that where the closeted hard drive was? Certainly seems very inconvenient to the cooking area in the front of the restaurant. Again, I was surprised that Chef James would use FROZEN pizza dough.

              Yuke, How do you know about a side exit to a "shared cooler?" Do you have inside knowledge?  Also, the FBI criminal complaint (written much later) specifically said a  FREEZER behind the restaurant. The real question is the timing of the alleged shooting of the locked closet and its location. In the original police report, no mention is made of the employee hearing gunshots prior to entering the building and seeing Welch. Also, if he heard gun shots, which if you are correct, would have been near that exit, why would the employee enter and be surprised to see Welch? The criminal complaint brings this up and states that the employee heard loud noises, but didn't recognize it as being gunshots. If that closet was so close to the door, I find that hard to believe.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only customer witness who was publicly interviewed was a lawyer. He and his family were in the ping pong area of the restaurant when he claims he saw Welch walk by and enter the back "party" room through the black curtains. He admitted to Alex Jones in an interview that he heard no gunfire. Based on other interviews he gave and the original police report, I could not find a time line that worked, fitting in the alleged closet shooting. In Welch's plea deal, he was not charged with firing a firearm inside a building. YET, the FAKE NEWS continues to characterize Welch entering the building and shooting up Comet Pizza. A provable LIE.

              The rear exit in question is technically the rear from one point, but you're right in saying that the extreme rear exit is at the back of the party room which is riiiight at the back. That closeted hard drive place seems to be just before the first, nearest exit to the shared cooler. Thanks for that other link by the way, I've somehow not seen that posted before.

               It is a rear exit for Little Red Fox, but not for Comet. Look at Google maps- Comet extends another building length beyond Fox.

                There are pictures that show that it is for Comet as well. If you look on maps again, go into the car park, and you'll see the door in question.

                    Okay, I'll play. No, I'm not a Rothschild, which in some obvious ways, is a shame. No, I don't work at Comet, again, I'm British; that would be one hell of a commute. Now that we have that established, back to the doors. Answer what I asked instead of turning to attempted shill-calling, or have you done that because you don't have an answer?

                     I'm not playing. You never asked me a question. For some reason you don't want to admit that the door in question is on the left SIDE of the restaurant, halfway back. LRF is about half the length of Comet. The lower level "party" room takes up the back half. The true "rear" door is on the back wall of the party room part. The only CUSTOMER witness said he saw Welch walk through the black curtains into the party room area. Until the employee entered the SIDE kitchen door, there have been no witnessed accounts given of Welch's movement from the back party room all the way to the closet and side door, presumably near the kitchen. No TIMELINE of events has been reported.

                     BTW, Brits do get US work visas and James is known for hiring multiculturally. Are you in the "dossier" business?  LOL!

                 I left video links above. I am correct. Rear for Fox, SIDE for Comet. Documents true rear door HAS NO FREEZER near it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The referenced FREEZER must be in that white rectangular "room" off the back of LITTLE RED FOX. If not, WHERE?

                   It appears that one must exit a SIDE DOOR from the Comet kitchen area and come down steps to exit the door to the right of the white out building. But of course, Comet has no basement. LOL!

                    So there, we've established that LRF has its own rear door and that Comet has a "side" door that leads to this same cooler and a rear door at the back of the party room/long building. Yes?

                     Why do you say this white building is a "cooler"?  Have you seen inside? Also, the FBI complaint clearly states the pizza dough was retrieved from a FREEZER. Again, does this "out" building comply with restaurant code for raw food storage? There should bee inspection records to verify this.

                    You've lost me now. What exactly are you trying to say, that there is one door that is shared by both Comet and LRF? That side door? If so then what is the door on the other side of the cooler?

             HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AT COMET ACCORDING TO THE DOJ PRESS RELEASE:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Upon arriving at the restaurant, Welch parked his car and armed himself. At about 3 p.m., he marched inside the restaurant, which was occupied by employees and customers, including children. He was carrying the AR-15 assault rifle and the revolver. He was carrying the AR-15 openly, with one hand on the pistol grip, and the other hand on the hand guard around the barrel, such that anyone with an unobstructed view could see the gun.
            </p>
            <pre><code>        The customers and employees fled the building. At one point, Welch encountered a locked room and attempted to force open the door, first using a butter knife and then discharging his assault rifle multiple times into the door.

        A few minutes later, an unaware employee entered the restaurant, carrying pizza dough. Welch saw the employee and turned toward the worker with the assault rifle, causing the worker to immediately fear he would be shot. The worker fled. Welch was left alone in the restaurant. After spending more than 20 minutes inside, he left his firearms and exited the restaurant unarmed. He was then arrested. The assault rifle and revolver were recovered inside the restaurant. A shotgun also was recovered from the defendant’s car, along with a box of shotgun ammunition."

             "On Dec. 4, 2016, Edgar Maddison Welch entered the Comet Ping Pong restaurant and fired an AR-15 rifle into a door. The 28-year-old man told police that he had driven from his home in Salisbury, N.C., to "self-investigate" the "pizzagate" conspiracy theory that the restaurant was the site of a child sex-abuse ring involving powerful Democrats such as Hillary Clinton."

             Edgar Maddison Welch pleaded guilty in March to federal charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and transporting a firearm over state lines. The case is seen as a clear example of the potential real-world consequences of fake news stories."

             "A North Carolina man who fired an assault rifle inside a District of Columbia restaurant during his investigation of a conspiracy theory dubbed “pizzagate” has been sentenced to four years in prison.....Welch pleaded guilty in March and acknowledged that he entered the Comet Ping Pong restaurant Dec. 4 with an AR-15 assault weapon and a revolver. He said he drove to the restaurant from North Carolina to investigate an unfounded conspiracy theory about Democrats harboring child sex slaves at the pizza restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
             No one was physically injured, but the judge says Welch’s actions “literally left psychological wreckage.”"

            <p>
             "In a case that drew national headlines, Welch, who is from Salisbury, N.C., showed up at the popular restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, carrying a fully loaded AR-15 rifle and revolver in plain view. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of transporting firearms and ammunition across state lines and a District count of assault with a dangerous weapon."
            </p>
            <p>
             "“Did you in fact transport these firearms from North Carolina to the District of Columbia and . . . enter the Comet Ping Pong restaurant openly carrying [an AR-15 rifle] and point it in the direction of a person?” “Yes ma’am,”
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
             "After a panicky evacuation by workers and customers, including children, Welch fired the rifle multiple times at a locked closet door, striking computer equipment inside, court documents said. He also pointed the rifle toward an unwitting employee retrieving pizza dough from a nearby business who entered the back of the restaurant, then immediately turned and ran for his life, according to the government’s evidence signed off by Welch."

             This list could go on and on. So tell me WHAT IS TRUTH?
            </p>
            <p>
             OH, and I haven't even mentioned the only customer witness publicly interviewed"s statements. I don't know if he was interviewed by authorities or not. He did tell Alex Jones in a recorded interview that he did not hear gunshots. He showed up at Comet with his wife and children BECAUSE he heard about pizzagate. Go figure.  How many people were actually in the restaurant at the time? How many children? As far as I can tell, there were no witnesses who saw Welch shoot the gun or heard what they recognized to be gunshots. Welch VOLUNTARILY  waived his right to remain silent and have legal council. Where did he get the BUTTER KNIFE? How long did that take? Did he shoot the computer when he stood on the chair? Why would he shoot into a locked closet if he thought children were in there? If he believed they were in there, it would seem he would be careful to shoot at the lock parallel with the door so the discharge wouldn't go into the closet. And a butter knife and (3) shots didn't seem to work, so he stands on a chair and just looks over the low wall? SO MANY ODD, UNRESOLVED ISSUES.

              INTERESTING STATEMENTS:
             </p>
             <p>
              "The defendant WALKED (emph. mine) directly into the restaurant..."
             </p>
             <p>
              "The defendant was able to precede directly to the back of the restaurant without any interferance"
             </p>
             <p>
              "While the restaurant was empty, the defendant encountered a locked storage closet."
             </p>
             <p>
              "He thus attempted to force it open with a butter knife."
             </p>
             <p>
              "...the defendant aimed his AR-15 at the wooden door and fired multiple times."
             </p>
             <p>
              "The resulting gunfire struck the closet door and lock, passed through the door, and damaged a computer and some drywall inside the closet."
             </p>
             <p>
              "....the bullets only damaged the tangible property inside."
             </p>
             <p>
              "AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, .....an employee of the restaurant, was retrieving pizza dough FROM A NEIGHBORING BUSINESS." (emph. mine)
             </p>
             <p>
              "WHILE he was carrying dough back to the restaurant, (the employee) HEARD LOUD SOUNDS, consistent with gunshots." (emph. mine)
             </p>
             <p>
              "...at the time (the employee) did not know what was happening inside the restaurant..."  COMMENT: I guess this means no one exited this side door, off the kitchen.
             </p>
             <p>
              "(The employee) thus entered the restaurant through a SIDE DOOR that was just A FEW FEET from the defendant's position." (emph. mine)
             </p>
             <p>
              "(the employee)...then saw the defendant then turn towards him with the leveled  AR-15, such that the AR-15 WAS POINTED DIRECTLY AT (the employee)." (emph. mine) NOTE: other above accounts differ.
             </p>
             <p>
              CONTINUE READING PAGE 5 (too much to type) NOTE: The employee did not see Welch shoot his gun. The original Police Report did not mention that the employee heard any loud noises before entering the building.

              Early Disaster Response in Haiti: The Israeli Field Hospital Experience
             </p>
             <p>
              "The earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010 caused an estimated 230Â 000 deaths and injured approximately 250Â 000 people. The Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps Field Hospital was fully operational on site only 89 hours after the earthquake struck and was capable of providing sophisticated medical care. During the 10 days the hospital was operational, its staff treated 1111 patients, hospitalized 737 patients, and performed 244 operations on 203 patients. The field hospital also served as a referral center for medical teams from other countries that were deployed in the surrounding areas."

              "The key factor that enabled rapid response during the early phase of the disaster from a distance of 6000 miles was a well-prepared and trained medical unit maintained on continuous alert. The prompt deployment of advanced-capability field hospitals is essential in disaster relief, especially in countries with minimal medical infrastructure."

             <p>
              "His defense attorney Dani Jahn asked for a sentence of 18 months. She stated that Welch was acting out of concern for the children in the alleged “sex-ring.” Welch, a father of two girls, was an EMT and volunteered for three weeks in Haiti to help orphaned children after the 2010 earthquake."

             </p>
             <p>
              They didn't mention his acting background or his hitting a child walking on the side of the road, just a few months before his trip to D.C.
             </p>
             <p>
              I winder if Welch was there at the same time Silsby was???????

              Let's just make things easy. We need a list of every foreigner in Haiti right after the quake!
