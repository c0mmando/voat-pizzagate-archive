<p>What started online almost two decades ago as a means of swapping child pornography has transformed in recent years into a more complex and diversified community that uses the virtual world to advance its interests in the real one.</p>
<p>Today, pedophiles go online to seek tips for getting near children — at camps, through foster care, at community gatherings and at countless other events. They swap stories about day-to-day encounters with minors. And they make use of technology to help take their arguments to others, like sharing online a printable booklet to be distributed to children that extols the benefits of sex with adults.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the booklet by pedophiles they hope to recruit children with for sexual abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Called “Straight Talk for Boys,” it is an 18-page discussion of sex, particularly between children and adults, from the pedophiles’ viewpoint. Such encounters are depicted as harmless, even beneficial. The document criticizes parents and therapists. And it encourages boys to wear Speedo bathing suits and shower naked in public places.</p>
<p>But it repeatedly returns to one message: boys should never tell about sex with adults. “Older boys and men may be frightened about getting caught having sex play with you, because they can be put in jail,” it says. “So you have to think of ways to ‘signal’ your interest in another person without openly saying what you want,” adding that “nobody else can know about what you agree to do.”</p>
<p>The booklet comes with instructions, advising pedophiles on how to distribute it. “The best and safest way is to leave quantities of the booklet in places where boys in the 8 to 14 range can find them, and where adults will not discover them too quickly,” the instructions read. “Obviously, you don’t want to be observed placing the booklets in your chosen locations.”</p>

            We have all been asleep while these sick excuses for human beings have been having their way with our children.  We have been afraid to be labeled too politically correct or Fuddy Duddys.  Question, open your eyes and do not be afraid to speak out.  You can make a difference if you stand up and protect our children.  They are not experienced enough or strong enough to do it themselves.  Not at the tender ages of 8-14 or even younger.
