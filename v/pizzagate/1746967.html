            Those are all helpful observations. But I suppose then it was the sort of anarchistic free-for-all scatological event Pizzagate has been all along. Occult research - meaning 'hidden' as well as esoteric - can get weird quickly. TBH this whole supposition is pretty bizarre, though history demonstrates not unheard of by any stretch of the imagination.

            All things considered I think it was amazing that this happened at all, that it went smoothly without any agitators, and that so many people were able to use this as an opportunity to connect IRL. Many thanks to the organizers and attendees. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come, and can be used as a template and learning experience.

            I'll furnish an example of a terrific benefit that you completely overlooked.
           </p>
           <p>
            In recent history, people in western societies have been herded into digital ghettos like Facebook, Twitter, and yes, even VOAT, isolated from the kind of living breathing communities that existed just a few short decades ago. Michael Savage coined the phrase digital ghetto, and he's right. We've been relegated to arguing in forums like this instead of banding together with our neighbors, so the very act of having like minded people meet and mingle in
            <em>
             one space
            </em>
            for an all important cause has intrinsic value. There were undoubtedly friendships and connections made there that may lead to collaboration and sharing of vital information that can bear fruit down the road and thus further this unprecedented public investigation. It was also a display of sheer bravery for all those inclined to show up in the actual nest of the vipers, to pass on a message that nothing you can do will ever cause us to relinquish until you're behind bars for unspeakable crimes against children. This was old school boots on the ground organization, modest to be sure, but filled with good intention, and it was a success in the ways just described.

             this is now a deleted post but I say to you amen - exactly what I thought.   Just the opportunity for folks to meet face to face is a strength that cannot be equaled.

             Valid points, and yes I agree that face to face interaction is important. Will it outweigh the negative press that is gleaned from this ? I don't think so.

              To be candid, there's likely no right or wrong approach. It's all unprecedented. Sure, it's fine to speculate on what ifs, but trying to gauge the actual impact of any particular action is futile because some are going to say it had merit and others not.
             </p>
             <p>
              This much I am certain of, and I don't claim to be the originator of the saying, but it goes if something's not working, try anything else. There are no arrests at the highest hierarchy we demand, and until there are, I say throw anything and everything that moves at the problem, and this includes small scale protests of the kind just executed.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I were leading the charge, I'd have a hundred volunteers in every major city hand delivering door to door a well written one page PG synopsis including links to the best two or three video presentations. I would also have them hand delivered to every police station and even every fire department, because when the news finally starts breaking in the mainstream media that the deep state is deeply disturbed and feeding off children, we want those local officials to at least have been afforded the opportunity to view the evidence that has convince all of us beforehand, evidence that the vast majority of people have not seen. The storm is brewing, but it's not going to be some onslaught from a cancerous media empire hellbent on proving us wrong.

            I feel sorry for the people that showed up and spent a lot of money getting there.  Maybe a motel or hotel, breakfast, lunch and dinner, gas, and this is more than one day for many.  One guy flew there from Fla. with his mother.  These people had their hearts in the right place. Then a bunch of loonie tunes got up and ruined it for everyone, including us.  We may not be able to stop people from having these protests. But maybe we can at least implore them to not go to a park and just protest at the WH.  Go straight there and let him know you want him to speed things up.  Signs that say   #InvestiGate#PedoGate.  It seems the park is a place the crazies can set up their stage to act out all of their nutty Fantasies.  But hopefully they will give it up. Sad it had to come to this.

              I was not sorry about the protest and have said all along I have a hard time deciding whether we should do the March or not.  I am sorry for the people that took stage to make us look like crazies and the sane people that showed up.  All it takes is one or two to undo what we have done.  The articles that were written were not favorable either. All in all the ones that spoke about satanic ritual talk and racist statements made the rest look like tin foil hatters.  It only takes one or two to ruin it for the rest.  They will always focus on those, unfortunately.  We do not have enough people to turnout yet. That is what is so sad.

            And it gave us insight into what strategies they would use to try and discredit pizzagate and some other games they play to try and get us to start listening to other controlled opposition.  Like that hilarious FAKE DRAMA between David Seaman and "lift the veil";

            Its only a matter of time before they run out of "heros" and "saviors" to try and control the narrative.  They love "herding" everyone to some other controlled agent.

             So who are the shills the? There are several suspects in my book, but I don't have any evidence to fully confirm it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Was it the 4-5 youtube channels that attacked Seaman all on the same day, which also happened to be the same day the David Seaman Buzzfeed article came out? Or, is it David Seaman that is the shill?
            </p>
            <p>
             One of those Youtubers made a guest appearance today and made sure to let everyone know how many subs he has, and spent plenty of time self promoting, just like he accused Seaman of doing.

             I don't think that intel was worth the downside. If the elites were worried about a PG protest, they would be killing people by now. They know the media has it under control. Don't get me wrong, they were there getting their own intel as usual.

              They were willing to throw Alex Jones and all he's worked/shilled for under the bus by telling him to discredit pizzagate the day before the protest gives you an idea how shit scared they are of pizzagate.

              This doesnt make any sense since this whole protest was possibly a George Soros operation...hence the "our children matter" and David Seamans connections to George Soros.  This also lets you know how shit scared they are when they start their own protests to control the narrative from the start.

              The real uncontrolled protests will start when people start realizing their own friends and families children go missing and nothing is being done to find them and that is right around the corner.

               I see what you are saying, I misinterpreted your comment. When I first heard about the protests, I thought the same thing. I figured it was just an event being pushed together by CIA or the social engineers. I don't think it was. I think this was a self serving circle jerk, and that TPTB ended up using it for their own ends. Everyone loves to "feel" like they are "doing something."

               The organizer Neil was at the first event, and he must have said "I'm not scared" 500 times. He was red pilling people by screaming at them and shouting "HOETARD" over and over. It was next level.

             I live in the USA and therefore have freedom of speech, and I plan to continue exercising it. Please refer back to what I said in the OP if you would like to explain the feelings you are experiencing:

             <p>
              If your first impulse is to call me a "shill" or a "pedo" or a "pedo protector" just be forewarned, that type of response means that you cannot provide evidence and are upset that truth is smacking you in the face.

              they are not stopping your rights or calling you any name.  They are saying they are speechless with digust at your position, and they are well within their rights to do so, as are many others.

              I wouldn't say you're a shill or a pedo. Just a smug entitled asshole. Who the hell are you to demand that everyone prove any of what you have requested?

              Yes you have freedom of speech, and these protestors have that same right as well as the right to assemble.
