1/ Nathan was only abused on the set of the movie Clownhouse FALSE: Salva started to abuse Nathan at the age of 6 to 12
2/ Victor Salva did many years behind bars, FALSE Victor got a 3 year sentence and served approximately 15 months.
3/ Nathan received a substantial settlement FALSE
Nathan received barely enough to cover lawyers fees and the settlement was reached Without the family\'s input. There was speculation that Nathan\'s lawyer was actually working with the opposing attorney for the opposing sides benefit
4/Victor was shunned after the conviction FALSE
Nathan a child at the time was barred from the premier, told he would never work in the business again and Francis Ford Coppola\'s lawyers sued Nathan \' s family for 5 million because his mother wanted her child off the set where the abuse was filmed
5/ Victor Salva had a hard time finding work after his prison sentence FALSE Francis Ford Coppola gave Victor money to live offer and had a movie deal ready. A Disney inc. film named Powder
6/ Francis Ford Coppola denounced Victor Salva\'s rape of a child actor that happened on set which was Francis Ford Coppola\'s Nappy Valley home FALSE When Powder came out and Francis Ford Coppola was interviewed he stated although it was tragic there was only a slight difference in age ( Victor Salva was 29 the child was 12) Also zero mention that the child\' s abuse started at the age of six
7/ Victor only had pictures and video of this one boy FALSE During the raid many nude pictures of unknown children were found some of those pictures were of Nathan\'s co-star.
8/ Victor Salva never worked with underage children again FALSE Victor on several movies had actors under the age of 18
9/ Victory latest movie Jeepers Kreepers 3 never saw the light of day FALSE Although Netflix has yet to show An Open Secret it does show Jeepers Kreepers 3</p>
<p>Nathan has a new documentary coming out soon called The Babysitter, this man is the real deal. He came forward with the name of his abuser and unlike Corey Feldman is not looking for millions of dollars to tell his story. He has been vocal for many years. Here is the link to the interview</p>

            Jeepers Creepers has many disturbing pedo/sadistic overtones. Only a diseased mind could do that.
