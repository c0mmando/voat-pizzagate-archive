<p>Nothing to see here folks, move along...or is there?</p>
<p>According to previous reports Homan Square is notorious for disappearing people : <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/19/homan-square-chicago-police-disappeared-thousands">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/19/homan-square-chicago-police-disappeared-thousands</a></p>

<p>According to George Webb [yes I know what we think of him]  but there\'s often relevant information... this is a facility that is involved in the chain of human organ trafficking.  Webb\'s channel and all videos mentioning Homan Square have been lost.  If anyone has further information please post.. Here is why I think it is relevant....there are many pages still on the web with information about a YT video titled <strong>&quot;From Homan Square Chicago to Cleveland Clinic&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Webb\'s videos have mostly been scrubbed from Youtube unless uploadded by someone else.  This video mentions Homon Square in the description but I can\'t find where in the video he specifically mentions that location: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jDW9_OzRpA">Day 99 DynCorp, Haiti, and Me, Part 1 Who Killed Monica Petersen?</a></p>

<p>The video also has alludes to PROMIS and Palantir software as well as the Cleveland Clinic.  With hindsight, all of that information is seen within the context of information we have unearthed since.</p>
<p>He mentions the pregnating of young girls in Haiti for the use of later trafficking their organs.  We know that Ricky Dearman of the Hampstead case worked for the Supreme Master cult as a \'reporter\' there. That had some websites with streaming facilities which were supposedly fronts for porn which the police investigated.  I found that the location of one of the offices of the alleged London cult financier Will Draper later became the first location for the Cleveland Clinic, practically opposite to Buckingham Palace:

             and myself were onto this a few years ago. Unfortunately with the ongoing daily redpill tidal wave, it died and was buried.  Great story. KJ’s mom seemed like crisis actor or paid off. Many other complicit hotels. Would expect nothing less in mob-run Chicago. Thank you and

              As far as the organ trafficking industry angle, the suspicions that came up with KJ, and the 'other' child trafficking which seems to take place in the video of the lobby that night, there might be more to learn. When a story like this gets messy or "buried", and we have exhaustively analyzed the details, it is usually worthwhile to zoom way out, and see what other stories sound similar. The commonalities and patterns that exist in ALL of these stories begin to paint a picture of a possible M.O. for this 'industry' at large, or reveal those names who are complicit in their crimes.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think it is safe to assume whether its the doorman or the owner of a hotel chain who looks away, hotels have been allowed to be used as safe havens for prostitution, human trafficking and robbery. Is it so far a stretch to think some hotels have been intentionally designed with this profit and clientele involved? Why are so many hotel chains involved in Human Trafficking organizations? Can we identify entire brands or chains which make a habit of covering or not reporting - or perhaps even catering to predators? Some may think this is a stretch to say an entire company like Crowne Plaza or The Standard Hotel could be involved at its highest levels, but the profit potential, and examples of plain-sight institutionalized-evil (like the Epstein network, or Human Rights fronts used to kidnap refugees), beg for us to investigate.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have a long hotel motel company dig inspired by KJ and delving into this potential of their involvement, which I hope to develop further, if you goats have anything to add.

               Not a stretch at all re. Crowne Plaza, Standard etc. The Rosemont Crowne, Chi, was said to be center of operations. All discussed back in the day, corrupt Emmanuel Bros and so on. So many ties to so much. I’d love to see another discussion on KJ. Some say was a psy-op, who knows.The (edited) footage released by the hotel was chilling. Standard on Sunset had shady helicopter deaths of execs. Not just hotels. Not just Chitown. Cleveland biggie too.

               Some say

               better preserves organs. Some say America doesn’t care about Black people. Some say organ harvesting IS Pizzagate.

            </p>
            <p>
             Records show that Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party treasurer who gave millions to the party under William Hague’s leadership but stopped donating during David Cameron’s premiership, appears to be back in the fold and is a member of May’s Leader’s Group. He was joined by the former government adviser and investor in payday loans, Adrian Beecroft.

             The Leader’s Group, which has included wealthy individuals linked to Russia, the fossil fuel industry and climate denial, is open only to those prepared to give the Conservatives at least £50,000 a year. In return, they receive regular private dinners, lunches and drinks receptions with the prime minister and other senior Tory figures, including leading cabinet ministers.

            <p>
             ..Set up in 2003, the Leader’s Group is the top of a network of Tory donor clubs – a network that grew dramatically under David Cameron. According to the party’s website, the Leader’s Group is “is the premier supporter Group of the Conservative Party. Members are invited to join the Leader and other senior figures from the Conservative Party at dinners, post-PMQ lunches, drinks receptions, election result events and important campaign launches.”

             ..Anthony Bamford of the JCB construction empire has given more than £5 million to the Conservatives since 2010. The Ferrari-driving, private-jet-owning, yacht-sailing billionaire, who has personally donated £80,000 to Boris Johnson in the last year, is estimated to be worth over £4 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
             A number of senior Conservative donors have received honours including knighthoods and peerages. In September, Tory treasurer Ehud Sheleg received a knighthood, as did outgoing Tory treasurer Mick Davis. Sheleg, an art dealer, has given the party more than £3 million.

              Kimberly-Clark Corporation is an American multinational personal care corporation that produces mostly paper-based consumer products. The company manufactures sanitary paper products and surgical &amp; medical instruments. It operates non-woven fabric mills and paper (except newsprint) mills.[3] Kimberly-Clark brand name products include Kleenex facial tissue, Kotex feminine hygiene products, Cottonelle, Scott and Andrex toilet paper, Wypall utility wipes, KimWipes scientific cleaning wipes and Huggies disposable diapers and baby wipes...The British subsidiary holds Royal Warrants from both Queen Elizabeth II and Charles, Prince of Wales.
             </p>
             <p>
              .In 2002, Kimberly-Clark purchased paper-packaging rival Amcor's stake in an Australian joint venture.[28] In 2003, Kimberly-Clark added to its global consumer tissue business by acquiring the Polish tissue maker Klucze..In early 2004, chairman and chief executive officer Thomas Falk began implementation of a global business plan that the company has detailed in July 2003. The firm combined its North American and European groups for personal care and consumer tissue under North Atlantic groups. In 2019, CEO Thomas Falk resigned his position but continued on as the company's chairman of the board. COO Michael D. Hsu became CEO following Falk's retirement.

             <p>
              In April 2020, The Financial Times reported that panic-buying during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 13 per cent increase in sales of Kimberley-Clark's consumer tissues in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the previous year.

              Arson at Guatemala shelter kills 22 girls and a strange tip about a US Navy ship : 6 Degrees of Separation

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Domestic worker Alicia Lopez, 50, had been outside the home for hours trying to find out what happened to her autistic 12-year-old son who came to the center with a drug addiction. She said he had been raped there last week.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another strange coincidence. NYT says all the dead in this fire in a children's shelter (in Guatemala) were girls, but that may not be the whole story. USNS Spearhead was sitting off the coast of Guatemala again when it happened. The shelter is inland, but accessible by helicopter.
             </p>
             <p>
              USNS Spearhead works in the area of humanitarian assistance as well as special operations support and does quite a lot of training in the Caribbean.

               USNS Spearhead
              </strong>
              (T-EPF 1) to work with host nation counterparts and aid workers to provide medical and dental care, preventive medicine, and veterinary consulting.
