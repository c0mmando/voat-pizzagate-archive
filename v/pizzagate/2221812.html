            that article took the most useless unexpected twist ever—"woman can't get away with pedophilia like men do because there's gender inequality in hollywood"—wtf? i should've known better than to click.

            "Plenty of people are unaware that Besson is actually considered a sexual predator in the United States and has committed statutory rape. In the year 1991, Besson began a relationship with a 15-year-old actress named Maïwenn Besco. At the time, Besson was already a 32-year-old and was currently working on Léon: The Professional.  His young girlfriend was even given a small role in the film; Besco played a character titled “blond babe”, which is just another example of the sexualization of underage girls in the film.
Besson did not only date a minor, he also impregnated her. At the age of 16, Besco gave birth to Besson’s daughter, Shanna Besson. Besson has never actually been convicted for statutory rape because he is from France, and the age of consent there is 15."

            <p>
             When I lived in New York, in the 'nineties, this dude was EVERYWHERE. I have personally met at least FIFTEEN WOMEN, probably more, who say that he's accosted them in NYC. He essentially goes up to women and says, "Hey, I'm James Toback, and I'm a famous director, and I feel like there's a connection between us." Then he shows them some article on himself or some other artifact to prove he is who he is, and tries to get them to go somewhere else with him.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has done this to three girls I’ve dated, two of my very best friends, and a family member... twice. Yes, he came up to her twice with the same stupid line, not realizing she was the same person. This is in addition to many other women I've talked to at parties or dinners about their interactions with Toback.
            </p>
            <p>
             AND THAT'S JUST PEOPLE I KNOW. It’s not even mentioning the many other accounts going all the way back to an article that came out in SPY magazine in 1989 detailing this behavior, and I’m not including all the people I’ve talked to online who’ve had experiences. I mean, statistically, it would seem his numbers would have to be at least in the thousands.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of these women were in their early twenties. Most of them refused to go any further with him, but a few went to dinner, or to some sort of casting situation, or to someplace private.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, honestly, if the stories were just about some crazed sex addict who approaches thousands of women on the street trying to get laid, I wouldn't be posting this now. I don't want to be attacking every Hollywood douchebag who hits on countless women. That type of behavior isn’t cool, but I think it’s important to separate douchebaggery from any kind of sexual coercion. But the women I talked to who DID go someplace private with Toback, told stories that were worse than the women only accosted on the street.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s important to say, I don’t have any firsthand information about any of this. But the stories are so eerily similar, and I’ve heard them again and again from some of the people I trust most in the world, I know the chances of them being untrue… well, it would just be impossible. I knew it was their choice whether or not they wanted to come forward publicly, but I let them know I would have their backs if they did.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I did what I could do in my impotent state – for over twenty years now, I’ve been bringing up James Toback every chance I could in groups of people. I couldn’t stop him, but I could warn people about him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recently, I thought the guy had disappeared into obscurity and old age, but then I saw an article in the Huffington Post about him, entitled, "James Toback Gets Us, He Truly Gets Us." I almost vomited. Did the person who wrote the article even do a basic Google search on Toback? It seemed like he was more current than I had thought, with a movie at the Venice Film Festival starring Sienna Miller. I had hoped his exploits had become well known enough that producers wouldn’t finance his films and actors wouldn't work with him.
            </p>
            <p>
             So since then I’ve been hoping the Weinstein/O'Reilly stuff would bring this vampire into the light (him and a couple others, frankly). So I was happy today to wake up to this story in the LA Times.
            </p>
            <p>
             I told the women who would come forward I had their back. This is me doing my best to fulfill that promise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Love to you all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Addendum to the first post:
            </p>
            <p>
             A few people on here, Twitter, and other sites are saying, "James, why didn't you say anything if you knew this was happening?"
            </p>
            <p>
             A) Like I said above, I did say something, many times, to many people, all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             B) More importantly, I have publicly written Facebook posts about Toback and what he was doing, as well as mentioning him on my web site and on MySpace. I don't know why suddenly people are just assuming I didn't just because I don't mention it here.
            </p>
            <p>
             C) That said, I put myself in legal jeopardy doing so, and I'm not sure I would do the same today. If I actually SAW something, it would be a different story. But simply sharing secondhand stories is legally complicated, and could open me to being sued. It is necessary that firsthand accounts come out to get these stories noticed, whether it's from the victim or someone else who witnesses what's occurring.

             He also did not use birth control (or at least not effectively) and she gave birth at 16.  Hope he is safer with his cast and crew, films can, like other acts of giving birth, be life threatening.
