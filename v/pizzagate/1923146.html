<p>Found out something interesting from the conversation. It seems head shill has been trying for a while to recruit other people from worldcorpo discord to shill and torment us. So far he has not been successful. Posting this in order to warn you of a potential shill invasion down the road just in case he ends up being successful. Robert has sown a tapestry of deceit, so be careful.</p>
<p>Relevance to Pizzagate: Our tormentor is at best an active accomplice (conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice) to pizzagate (at worst a full blown suspect) given his deliberate attempts to undermine the investigation. Defeating him will be a huge boost to our team\'s collective morale and a blow to the morale of the shills. </p>
<p>Let\'s start digging. How strong are this guy\'s ties to pizzagate. Is he an active player or just a goon? Personally I suspect he\'s a &quot;higher level pawn&quot; or an &quot;ally&quot;. The fact that he knows about worldcorpo is very suspicious. If by chance we end up with more breadcrumbs and clues as a result (even if the initial hunt didn\'t meet its original objective), then its still looking into. Due to the sheer complexity of the conspiracy, any potential new angle could end up getting us closer to the truth.</p>',

            Frankly, though, as the trolls go around here, he's pretty tame. It's easy to downvoat him and ignore, and not that difficult for mods to clean up his messes.
            <strong>
             Compared to the asshats we've got in here spreading disinformation to demoralize people and shitting up comment sections of research posts with off-topic crap about Jews
            </strong>
            , mods, Voat being compromised, other users being shills and the rest of the BS they use to "taint" posts, PG_Retard is no big deal. An impotent nuisance.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, singling out Jews is a priori evidence of disinfo peddlers in the lead mods opinion.  Because jews controlling everything and curtailing free speech is a myth XDDDDD

             Shitposters are the only ones curtailing free speech around here, Donkey. I have yet to see one fair and square piece of evidence anyone's ethnic background has anything to do with Pizzagate. This sick shit seems to appeal to certain cowardly shitstains from many backgrounds.

              The perps are 100% Jewish and crypto Jewish.
             </p>
             <p>
              If mass shootings occur in a city, and every perp is of a certain ethnicity, you don't think it's germaine and worthy of being reported?  Don't the citizens have a right to know WHO is committing these crimes?  Shouldn't that factoid be referenced within the larger framework to help make sense of it -- why and how it is happening?
             </p>
             <p>
              Ignoring a glaring pattern like that is NOT the hallmark of a good researcher.  Because it is IMPOSSIBLE to put it into context sans the information.
             </p>
             <p>
              How many real cases -- in real life -- have you worked, Vin?  Worked any murder cases?  I have.  And I understand the relevance of the info.  IF this is really a research forum, unencumbered research to get to the TRUTH should trump any subjective "political correctness" ideals.

            The level of insanity that this pizzagate thing signifies is mind blogging. You pizzagaters truly are the bottom of the barrel of irrational conspiretards.

             More like disinfo flunky who can't get a better gig, has to do damage control for the pedos. Bet you wanted to push flat earth instead. Aw well, put in your time and one day you might get to defend the banks and say thay are not manipulating precious metals. All kinds of more high brow assignments out there.
