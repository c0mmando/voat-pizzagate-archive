            Ok, Savage is a shill I'll tell you why. I've listened for at least 10 years. He does this mis characterization thing a lot.
He'll bring up a subject then deflect it into a conclusion that is false.  He uses a lot of NLP also, almost everyone in the media and politics use NLP aka conversational hypnosis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Savages favorite thing to do is get really hype about a topic then change the subject or start playing some music.  This is a technique called broken record or scratched record.  The NLP practitioner will bring up a topic that's very emotional then BAM do something shocking to break up the emotional conditioning to that subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            I used to love savage but then I realized he was just a steam valve to neutralize a certain independent minded individual.
           </p>
           <p>
            NLP
Bandler, Grinder, Virginia Satire, Milton Erickson
           </p>
           <p>
            Understands NLP and the movie They Live will never look the same. You will ever watch TV or read another news paper or magazine. It's all brainwashing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: he did the same thing with 9/1 truth. He would bring it up then deflect away from Mossad Saudi etc.
We really need to learn that every major element of the MSM is deep state propaganda for a targeted audience. Social engineering.

              Good ideas. Notice he sounds like he tells absolute truth for weeks or months then steers back into the left right plantation.

            I was listening that day and i dont think he was trying to bring awareness. Especially for how badly he mischaracterized it and then just powered right on. I was very disappointed to hear him say that. Been trying to tweet at him since but of course he wont hear it. I havent been listening regularly since. Glad i wasnt the only one. Hes called out Mcmasters months ago but recently he seems like hes been more anti trump instead of intellectually critical

            I have only a thought to offer.    I think he just mentioned it for his own purposes of positioning himself.  Pizzagate is still so hot button, so fringe, the brainwashing job so thorough, that a media spigot like himself can use it to immediately signal "see I'm reasonable, I'm not crazy" and then go on to espouse his pet radical ideas.

            Most big time Media people have to be controlled opposition to be allowed to have their roles.  They are there to give the illusion of honesty but spin you away from the big issues....anything that might rock the right/left fake fight we have seen for generations.  The "dead" have no clue that the right and the left really are working for the same team.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you can rest assured his silence means we are over the target....and his masters are nervous.  This story revealed Megan Kelly for what she was....it exposed Fox News as controlled opposition.  It must be important for them to throw these big fake chips on the fire in the attempt to stop the story.  They even exposed the fact we dont have a second amendment anymore with the youtube and twitter demonetizing and shadow banning Pizzagate researchers.
           </p>
           <p>
            You would be best served to trust no one you used to listen to.....everyone is suspect in this situation.

            Savage's remarks about Podesta's proclivities bring to mind the well-known cliche of a person who seeks to forestall questions about his own secrets by calling out the same in others.  Example:  The closeted homosexual man who over-vehemently expresses hate for gay men.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no idea whether Savage is a pedo or even a pedo sympathizer.  His long silence on pizzagate is strange, though, when he has never been prone to hold back on an issue just because it's been labeled a conspiracy theory.  Then the micharacterization of it when he does say something...it does make you wonder.

            I generally like MS's attitude toward most topics, but he does have glaring flaws. I stopped listening to him for a long time after he came out against Edward Snowden with extreme vitriol. He seems willfully ignorant to common privacy concerns and unwilling to address some of the biggest conspiracies in US history (JFK, 9/11, Gulf of Tonken, etc) so its no surprise that he comes out against PG without any cursory discussion with his listeners.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was listening to the same program the other day when he did this. He brought up PG out of no where and without any context. He also blasted anyone giving credence to the Seth Rich/DNC murder conspiracy. It's really a paradox that is quite frustrating to see. With such a big audience he has the potential to draw so much attention to these events. Perhaps he is a shill or perhaps it is just a generational thing, idk.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do find that older americans are harder to accept the redpill. I generally think that people have so much of their lives invested in s paradigm of how the world operates and resist any redpills because the acceptance of which calls into question the context of most of their lives. To accept the redpill is to admit that large foundations of their life were false and they were naive to believe it. By the time you are 60+ years old thats a large foundation and most egos will not subject to it to questioning and possible erosion.
           </p>
           <p>
            I still listen to MS because he is entertaining and is correct on many things (Islam, culture, borders, etc.); but I listen to him knowing that he will never cross into discussion that threatens the entire system. Virtually no one is permitted to discuss such topics to such a large audience; maybe he knows this, idk.

             Yes....this is it.  I had a hard time when I finally realized America wasnt noble and trying to save the Planet....we were just the big dumb mule of the Luciferian Sabbetean Masonic Kazars.....
            </p>
            <p>
             That we were killing millions of muslims for no real reason except to make their countries a horror show and drive young men and kids into Europe.  To cause chaos so no one can know what is happening to the people.   To dominate the native Europeans with foreigners.
            </p>
            <p>
             That Vietnam was a fake as war....that we tricked Saddam Hussein into invading Kuwait....Saddam always said the American Ambassador gave him the go ahead to invade.  I could not believe we would kill 3000 of our own citizens.....
            </p>
            <p>
             But I could not deny it any longer.  It was painful.  Our whole history is a fucking lie.  Hundreds of thousands of American men have died for elite jackasses to make money and play a real version of the game risk.  They are making the wars so bad the world cries out for peace at any cost.  They are basically psycopaths and need to be isolate or eliminated from society for all our safety.

            Savage doesn't express strong opinion (generally) unless he has multiple sources or personal bias to back it up. PG is (currently, as maybe historically) such a web of small pieces here and there that I can't really see Savage digging in without countless
            <em>
             weeks
            </em>
            of research. And even at that point, there's just not enough for him to fight against because it's difficult to understand the mountain of evidence (as a casual listener) without also enduring weeks of research &amp; fact finding.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you had an approx time or two of his later refs, I'd be interested to hear it.

            Because of his intellect and wit - and willingness to criticize RINOs -- I used to be a diehard listener and was willing to overlook his "mistakes."  E.g., whenever a listener called pointing out that 09/11 was an inside job, MS would scream, "We all saw the planes hit the buildings!" and hang up on them.  Classic straw man tactic.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were other red flags:  trotting out Hagee -- a fellow rabid zionist but of the phony Christian variety -- on a regular basis, constantly beating the war drums against Islam, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I no longer waste my time on him.  His wit and intellect are overshadowed by the negatives. After all, any nationally-syndicated radio host is MSM.

             You make a good point about nationally syndicated being msm. At the same time...he's been banned from entering Britain, on our govt's shit list as it were, stalked by the NSA, constantly calls out soros, UN, etc. like trump, he's despised by tptb. Which is the conundrum for me. Btw, he's not banging the Israel drum as much as he used to.

             Exactly. It's like he's reading his reports from yahoo news. Which we know he doesn't. Only a cursory glance at a semi-reputable site tells you it's not just a "prostitution ring." As I'm known to say...if it doesn't make sense it isn't true. Which is why I think he's up to something, perhaps even at the behest of trump.

              Yeah I am certain Trump called Alex Jones and made him blow Alefantis with his apology...

             <p>
              I have gone back in forth with faith and lack of faith in Trump over the pedophilia.  I am starting to believe we will not see any big targets go down over this.  His minor arrest is all he is willing to go.  Either they have something major on him or Trump had no idea how many people in the government had to screw a kid and perhaps slit its throat and prance around naked fighting each other over the pituitary gland.....
             </p>
             <p>
              It seems it is sooooo many they will stop at nothing to destroy him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump seems to be actively picking people to work for him that are kicking out any patriots or believers in Pizzagate.
