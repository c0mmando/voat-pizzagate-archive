<p>MeToo was started by Ronan Farrow with this <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories">article</a>. It has always been an open secret that Harvey Weinstein was a pig. I remember reading gossip blogs back in the 90\'s and people would joke about his newest &quot;It&quot; girls and how they had visited Harvey\'s casting couch.</p>
<p>That\'s why I was surprised when that story came out and rolled my eyes with all of the stars being so surprised and saying they had no idea. I just thought to myself that Harvey must have pissed someone off in the business and they were taking him down. I always wondered who that was and decided I would dig into it further.</p>
<p>So who gained to benefit from the Weinstein\'s downfall? <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/weinstein-sale-may-not-be-dead-1087159">these people</a>.  Maria Contreras-Sweet and Ron Burkle. Who are they? Maria served under President Obama as the head on the Small Business Administration. But she was just the front person, the really important name here is Ron Burkle. The billionaire Ron Burkle has been besties with the Clinton\'s since at least 1992. It is a long tangled web, between them but here is one <a href="http://observer.com/2006/04/the-complete-ron-burkle/">article</a> that might help.</p>
<p>Now read this <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/02/11/maria-contreras-sweet-withdraws-500m-offer-to-buy-weinstein-co/">article</a> they had a deal all set up to buy the Weinstein\'s company, a deal where both brothers wouldn\'t receive a dime. But do you know who would get 10 million for their troubles? Gloria Allred and those poor victim starlets that Harvey groped and that were so brave to come forward.</p>
<p>Guess who screwed up that sweet deal? New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Guess who was the next person that Ronan Farrow exposed and who had to resign? Surprise, surprise it\'s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/four-women-accuse-new-yorks-attorney-general-of-physical-abuse">Eric Schneiderman!</a></p>
<p>It has been announced that CEO of CBS, Les Moonves is the next one on Roman\'s <a href="https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/leslie-moonves-sexual-misconduct-new-yorker-ronan-farrow-1202888614/">hit list</a> You may wonder are the Clinton\'s behind this one? Not that I can tell, but a very powerful Hollywood family the Redstones are in a legal <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/2018/07/205760/les-moonves-shari-redstone-cbs-viacom-national-amusements-dramatic-history">battle</a> right now for control of CBS and would be all to happy if Les was gone.</p>
<p>I do believe though there is one more Hillary Clinton <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/matt-lauers-firing-and-nbcs-theatre-of-accountability">takedown</a> who was a victim of MeToo, one that co-worker Ronan couldn\'t be used for. What did Matt Lauer <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/matt-lauers-firing-and-nbcs-theatre-of-accountability">do?</a> Hillary was apparently enraged at Lauer and had a <a href="http://www.investmentwatchblog.com/hillary-clinton-if-that-f-ing-bastard-trump-wins-we-all-hang-from-nooses/">meltdown</a>  afterwards.</p>
<p>I think the MeToo movement spiraled out of control and quite a few others, were collateral damage. I doubt the originators wanted Kevin Spacey out of the picture, or Bryan Singer etc. and I am sure they were freaking out when it started uncovering some of their tastes for the underage.</p>
<p>That\'s why I am surprised Ronan is going to drum it all up again, it may very well backfire in their faces once more. They must really want Moonves out of the picture to take that risk. Haha it looks like some groups in Hollywood and Washington DC are at war with each other and they are doing all the work for us by taking each other out.</p>
<p>I may do another part in the future looking more into some of the actresses involved and there is also some interesting things I came across about the Redstone family. Here is <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/sumner-redstones-granddaughter-compares-shari-892199">one</a></p>',

            Interesting that you should bring up Burkle. There is a picture of Bill Clinton with 15yo ??? Rachel Chandler on Epsteins plane. But astute eyes were able to determine that it was Burkle's plane, not Epstein's. Burkle and Bill were very close friends and Burkle was known for his skirtchasing teenage girls on both sides of the Atlantic. Then Ron Burkle and Bill had a falling out and Bill started hitching rides with Epstein. That's all I know about Burkle.

             Ron Burkle is the Clinton's business partner and they go way back. Ron and Bill pal around so much that's Ron's plane has two nicknames Air Force 2 and Air F*ck One. Lately they have tried to publicly distanced themselves but I think that was because to many were questioning their business dealings.  So much is brought up about Bill's relationship with Epstein.But I am not sure if anyone has ever to a real close look at Burkle?

            Im somewhat hesitant to share my full opinion, but here goes.... I fully support the metoo movement and feel it is very in line with our goals here.  Metoo took down pedos kevin spacey, and dan schneider(!!!) Evan rachel wood and others came forward with stories about being raped in Hollywood whem they were kids. Weinstein had underage victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, we want to see a hell of a lot more come out and more sickos taken down. Yes, metoo has not been centered on pedos in hollywood, but it has not covered up or distracted from it. Its opened the doors. More people are talking about pedowood, more survivors are coming forward, and people are now more open to believing these true horror stories.  If it came out all at once, people would dismiss it as crazy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think a huge problem here on our forum is the left vs right, lib vs conservative paradigm, and what is very sad about that is that overall  the right side is against feminism, and i believe thatt is poisoning our mission. Please hear me out with an open mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have learned that feminism means equality for women. The media demonized feminism from day one, just like they have demonized pg. Women survivors were ridiculed, as we see sra victims ridiculed, and how many child sexual abuse victims are ridiculed.  Rape and abuse and sexual harassment are real and they are rampant. Women, children and men. Furthermore, there is no clear line between girl and woman... Females of all ages are sexually abused, they are traumatized, they are not believed, and all of this needs to stop. Its like if the victims are kids, voaters care, but if they are women, many voaters disbelieve or dont care. What about teens? Preteens? Its happening to all ages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like we say, believe the kids, it is rare for them to lie about these things, they have nothing to gain amd everything to lose... That is true for kids teens and adults. People don't want fame from coming out woth rape allegations again hollywood bigwigs. They get some support, but they get tons pd ridicule amd blame and disbelief, not to mention risking their careers and maybe even their lives.  Tptb dont use metoo to cover pedowood, they hate it, cuz we are getting closer and they are being exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same systemic powers that dont want is tp believe adult survivors are the ones covering up pedowood.  Asia argento was one of weinsteins bravest and loudest survivors. Days after her huge speech, anthony bourdain seems to have been Suicided.  I believe tptb were very scared of all he knew. He had also spoken about the corruption of hrc.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, and importantly, feminism is the movement that brought rituala use to light!! Insisting it was real, that child sexual abuse is real, and that the victims must be believed.  Feminists were the group fighting the false memory syndrome foundation, and all the sick forces pushing their agenda that dissociative identity disorder is not real. In this light, i feel feminists arw being betrayed by this movement.  Yet, i know there are manu feminists here on our team, doing amazing work, and whom we respect. Some label themselves such, some dont.some dont due to the anti feminist bias here. But rrally truly, a lot of the people here who say they hare feminists actuslly arw feminists. They want equality and safety for women. Belueveinga feminists are man haters is totally equivalent to believing pg'ers are loonies who think comet holds a child sex ring and caused a "madman" to shoot up the place.  Dont believe their rhetoric.
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore, sexual harassment of women girls and teens is rampant and horriifying its scope and extent, and it connects to a very real fear of the reality of sexual violence, which is an epidemic in our society, just like pedophilia. Hand in hand with pedophilia. Its about domination and control, and its perpetrated by monsters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Overall, being anti feminist and anti metoo is being anti our agenda to take down this beast we are here fighting.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also want to point out the reality of men and boys being abused, that tthese survivors are real and just as traumatized, and that feminism also brought their plight out in the open. Everything metoo is fighting for will only help child and teen victims and save potential victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thid divisiveness and hatred needs to stop. Some of our best pg'ers are women, feminists, and or survivors whether its abuse from childhood or adulthood or
            <strong>
             both
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, i must add that some of those fighting the good fight with us here are jewish, african American, libertarian, green party, and even liberals.  We need to focus on what we are here fighting for.  The shills try to divide and separate us in order to weaken us, and too often their method is working.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are here to take down the child abusers. We have had success and we will continue to.  The dam hsas broken open and i cant wait to keep watching their donwfalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            Love and peace to you, my fellow warriors of the light.

             Since I was the one who wrote the piece MeToo Movement Exposed. Let me explain my position.
I felt I needed to expose Ronan Farrow and how the MeToo movement started. He is not to be trusted and I would hate for someone to reach out to him with an abuse story that involved anyone from their cabal, as they will be exposing that they want to come forward and their life could be in danger.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am just going to stay away from the feminist part, we have very different view points on that, although did my posts in any way attack feminists?
            </p>
            <p>
             The left vs. right? There is corruption on both sides. Nowhere in my posts have I made this about left vs. right, I am willing to expose people from both sides if I find it. Exploring the relationship between Ronan and Hillary was essential as Pizzagate started with her campaign manager John Podesta's e-mails, plus we a found many connections to child trafficking through the people that surround her and her foundation. Hillary is a HUGE part of pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you think I am a shill? All I am doing is trying to do is inform about the ties and shady agenda behind why MeToo started. We need to know who to trust and who is on our side. Believe it or not the only battle I want with you, is a battle with us fighting together for child victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             All I can say for the Evan Rachel Wood story is...give us NAMES!
            </p>
            <p>
             MeToo ended up being a good a thing because it did inspire many others to come forward, which took down Kevin Spacey, Bryan Singer etc. but Ronan had nothing to do with that. Do you think Ronan is going to start outing pedos? I don't think so. In fact I know that he has been sitting on a name of someone who molested a 15 year old and hasn't released it. Stay tuned for part four...

            From day one my belief has been that the Me Too movement was for one purpose only. To try and distract from the pedophilia in Hollywood. Make it about the women and who will care about the kids kind of attitude.

            They ALL knew. They ALL know how the game is played. They think we're all stupid and we didn't know too. There's some reason why Weinstein, Spacey, etc were thrown under the bus when they were. We will problable never know why, but what's important is to remember there's always a reason or plan for why they let us in on things when they do. We are constantly manipulated for their ends.

            Yes, they opened a can of worms when #MeToo was started. They couldn't pick out which worms they wanted though. It caught Bill C. and Al Franken as well.

              I believe the unintended are what we call collateral damage. They are aiming for the main target, and I believe we know who that is. If some fall in the process, so be it. Or it could be the 2018 version of birth control or depopulation. I still have this visual of Hillary saying women are our future. Perhaps it was part of the plan all along. Who knows. ..... I saw this....

            Fantastic post ! As usual 🙂 I never jumped on that metoo wagon , I saw it as a totally organized effort to make us all think that this was going to stop once and for all ! It worked on their fans but not on those awake , IMO.

            Very interesting!  I have long regarded this #MeToo business as merely another way for feminists to demonise men and, more importantly, as a limited hangout; "expose" the already well known casting couch culture in Paedowood to cover for the much darker sin of pervasive child sexual abuse.

             I agree there is a lot of muddying the water right now. And we are talking about a lot of stuff that covers up real issues..... But sexual assault is a power and control crime rather it’s committed against a child or an adult and people were complicit in the coverup. I personally think “me too” could help lead us to “them too” if we can align these types of crimes against humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think we need to focus on FACTS. The franklin scandal happened. People were tortured, raped, abused, and it the cover up more people were  sent to jai AND killed. These are facts.
            </p>
            <p>
             So is James Gunn a pedophile? Probably but I don’t have the proof. And before you see the big picture of the evil people are actually capable of it’s hard to believe the claims. People aren’t awake. They want to believe they’re just jokes. I know I wanted to believe that at one point, but I never will again.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are too many facts that prove to me that this country has a serious elite pedophile epidemic. I’ve studied Jeff Epstein and franklin and the Lawrence E King players from Franklin at length and I know too much.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think we have to demand punishment and accountability to the people hat we KNOW COMMITTED THE CRIMES. JEFF EPSTEIN. LAWRENCE E KING. These people are AT LARGE IN AMERICA  and we have proof of what they’ve done. We need to demand action and once people start to see glimpses of the truth they’ll start to wake up. It is happening more and more and we just need to stay so fucking  loud that they can’t ignore it and they have a moral obligation to act.

             I don't think so. Imo, it was an important debate, and for the first time, men who experienced sexual harrassment came forward as well. It also gave strength to survivors of sexual abuse, who felt it was suddenly easier to talk about sexual violence.

             Yes, it certainly was meant to be a limited hangout, someone decided Weinstein had to go. But then it grew into a much larger movement in many countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact, I often use #MeToo discussion to redpill people about pedophilia in Hollywood. People will take it more seriously now.

              Yeah, It has given some real victims courage to come forward and that is a wonderful thing. I just hate how Ronan is praised as some kind of hero when there was a very shady agenda behind MeToo.

            The soap opera isn't a very interesting distraction for me. Everybody know the "elites" are sick people. Known it since the 90's and surprised it took this long for them to eat their own. Power corrupts and unregulated power rots from inside. But in a weird way this whole situation has helped white people to pursue marriage again because not many corporations are going to hire women now. They've become ticking time bombs with #metoo written across their faces.
