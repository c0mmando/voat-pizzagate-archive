            Wellstone was killed by targeted plane crash they used an EMP device to crash his plane he was taken out because he confronted Dick Cheney with the knowledge that 9/11 was a false flag inside job. Cheney ordered Wellstone killed to send a message to every other Senator and Congressman if you question 9/11 you will also be killed. It worked. They all kept their mouths shut. Wellstone was a courageous hero his death was instantly covered up by the FBI they were waiting at the plane crash site they got there in 5 minutes to clean it all up and make it look like just a normal plane crash but it was in perfect weather clear skies no mechanical reason for the plane to go down like it did. The EMP pulse fried the plane's controls.

            No doubt it's a lead. The infuriating thing is that the article brings up massage ads and how California is frustrated in trying to stop these shops that often use trafficked women as prostitutes. But California was the one that passed legislation that took sex shops out of police hands and put it under the control of the health department. Seriously? You're trying to eradicate an epidemic of sexual slavery and you're letting the health department handle it?

            I remember Wellstone's death and his funeral and the Democrats glommed onto that funeral and made an embarrassing spectacle of themselves. You can bet that there was something fishy about his death, by the way they behaved. it was just disgusting.

            The one thing I haven't seen get much attention is Joe Bidens son Boe who died while also investigating human trafficking. If anyone has any leads on that, or just pertinent information, they should share it! We all know joe is a huge creep
