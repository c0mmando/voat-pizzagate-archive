<blockquote>
<p>A man accused of raping an 8-year-old boy while wearing an animal costume at &quot;furry&quot; parties will go to trial, a district judge ruled Monday.</p>
<p>Kenneth Fenske, 57, of Quakertown, appeared at a hearing in Perkasie, where the boy, now 15, testified about the parties his parents took him to, where people dressed up and identified as different animals, sometimes to fulfill a sexual fetish. He said the man took him upstairs during the parties and raped him three or four times during the summer of 2009.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say the parties included a ring of men who allegedly abused the boy over a number of years. Four other men in Pennsylvania and Virginia, one of whom is related to the boy, also have been charged with various sexual offenses against him. None has yet entered a plea.</p>
<p>District Judge Charles W. Baum ordered all charges against Fenske to proceed to trial.</p>
<p>Fenske\'s attorney, Steven Fairlie, said his client maintains his innocence and alleged the charges against him were an effort to profit off his wealth.</p>
<p>The accusation has &quot;all the hallmarks of a money grab,&quot; Fairlie said after the hearing. Fenske was an inventor and ran a technology company, he said.</p>
<p>The teenager said that his parents were present at the parties in Fenske\'s home, but that he had never told anyone about the assaults until a few months ago. The boy was the only child at the parties, he said. He was allowed to play on an Xbox, but he alleges that Fenske, who went by the name &quot;Lupine&quot; and wore a full-body fox suit with &quot;a head, feet, tail,&quot; asked him to go upstairs and then assaulted him in the bedroom on multiple occasions. </p>
<p>&quot;I kept it to myself,&quot; the boy testified. &quot;I didn\'t tell anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>Fenske was arrested in January. The teen was placed into foster care and therapy, the Attorney General\'s Office said at the time. His mother and grandmother appeared in court Monday, and kissed him on the cheek before leaving the room.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very proud of how brave&quot; the boy was in testifying, said Chief Deputy Attorney General Michele Walsh.</p>
<p>The case is being prosecuted by the Attorney General\'s Office. Also charged are David Parker, 38, of Stroudsburg, Monroe County, and Jeffrey Harvey, 40, of West Wyoming, Luzerne County, as well as two roommates from Henrico, Va., Craig Knox, 35, and Stephen Taylor, 30.</p>
<p>Fenske, who appeared wearing a navy suit with a red patterned tie, did not speak during the proceeding. He will be arraigned on June 9 in Doylestown.</p>

             So what is this?  Pretend Beasteality?  They put on suits and pretend they are an animal having sex with a child.  This is beyond comprehension.  So, sick it is beyond words.

              WTH?  What is up with his parents?  The teenager said that his parents were present at the parties in Fenske's home, but that he had never told anyone about the assaults until a few months ago. The boy was the only child at the parties, he said. He was allowed to play on an Xbox, but he alleges that Fenske, who went by the name "Lupine" and wore a full-body fox suit with "a head, feet, tail," asked him to go upstairs and then assaulted him in the bedroom on multiple occasions.   I would not be surprised if they were paid for bringing that boy to the party.  They should be charged for past child endangerment.  Shameful, at best.

               Yeah, I agree.  They were either in on it, or using drugs and not paying attention to what was happening to their kid.

               Either way, they bare responsibility.

             yes, that's the image I was remembering. Who in the world just happens to have that many masks "just laying around" just in case someone wants to take a pic....for reals...sickening.

              Am I the only one who thinks of that photo as rather ghoulish in nature? Or is it a MK Ultra Halloween theme? Remember guys, one of the men in the photo is Charles Desantis - UN chief in charge of adoptions by foreigners! !! Megyn Kelly - are you red pilled yet?
