<p>Something caught my attention in the article, &quot;PIZZAGATE | NEW TUNNEL DISCOVERY. Connects At Least 4 Of Alefantis\'s Properties.&quot;</p>
<p>What I want to draw attention to is a possible Smithsonian connection (remember the <strong>museums</strong> clue?), and also to the Cosmos Club. Max Maccoby (lawyer for David Brock and James Alefantis) is a member of the Cosmos Club, which was founded by John Wesley Powell, who was a head of the Smithsonian in the 1800\'s during a major restructuring of that organization.</p>
<p>The article above mentions Harrison G. Dyar, the &quot;Mole Man&quot;: &quot;Smithsonian Bug Expert By Day; Eccentric Tunnel Digger By Night&quot;
<a href="https://archive.is/yKjJL">https://archive.is/yKjJL</a></p>
<p>The Cosmos Club which Smithsonian head James Wesley Powell founded has had many powerful members over the years, including at least four US presidents (Hoover, Taft, warmonger Teddy Roosevelt and early globalist Woodrow Wilson) and numerous other politicians, Henry Kissinger, Nelson Rockefeller, Robert McNamara, etc. etc.</p>

<p>There are some old books on Amazon about it but otherwise there\'s not much info and it seems to be a very secretive private club in Washington DC. I\'m not necessarily saying that they\'re all involved in pedogate but there is definitely some kind of weird connection going on between the Smithsonian, the Cosmos Club and people like Max Maccoby.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian itself, ever since James Wesley Powell\'s leadership, has become a total establishment disinfo operation. I know about it through separate research into Native American history and archaeology which is otherwise unrelated to pedogate. Suffice it to say that the Smithsonian has been involved in the cover-up of the nature of pre-Columbian Native American civilization for political and ideological reasons for over 100 years. This all began in the larger context of Darwinism, evolutionary theory, and maybe more importantly <strong>Social Darwinism, which is basically the idea that some people don\'t deserve to exist and it\'s okay to mistreat and even kill them because they\'re degraded human beings and you\'re only strengthening the gene pool by killing them.</strong></p>
<p>So that is some very brief social/historical context for the change in leadership at the Smithsonian under James Wesley Powell, founder of the Cosmos Club.</p>
<p>I\'m not as good at some of you other people at digging up deep info, but I just want to throw these breadcrumbs out because I really believe there is something going on here and you guys can figure it out. So again, to summarize, what I\'m drawing attention to here is...</p>

            It makes me think that members of elitist private clubs and organizations like the Cosmos Club are creating and running these tunnels all over DC. Just a gut feeling but it seems like something worth exploring.

            Great post! Cosmos Club seems extremely shady. I wonder if Cosmos Club is a pedophilia-centric club or anything.

            I don't know if this has any relevance but Alefantis was involved in a project to revitalise the tunnels within the Dupont Circle area - an arts commission. He worked with JAMES HUCKENPAHLER the artist. Huckenpahler created an open source document called Meta Monument.

             There is no exhaustive study into this, only bits and pieces mostly done by amateur researchers/historians. InfoWars hosts an article by David Hatcher Childress which lays out some info here:
             <a href="http://planet.infowars.com/science/the-smithsonian-institute-archaeological-cover-ups">
              http://planet.infowars.com/science/the-smithsonian-institute-archaeological-cover-ups
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been compiling a lot of information on all of this from historical and archaeological sources, and plan on releasing it as a free PDF and also a print book eventually. I can tell you that archaeological evidence from before around 1880 is the most reliable. I don't want to get too much off of pizzagate into "woo-woo" territory but there have been 100s of skeletons of unusual height (7 to 8 feet tall) discovered in mounds, suggesting a distinct race of mound builders or at least a racially-distinct leadership class of abnormally tall people in the Ohio River Valley and elsewhere, possibly related to pre-historic Scandinavians and/or the "Beaker culture" of Britain. The mounds they built are virtually indistinguishable from the barrows in Britain attributed to the Beaker culture, or even the kurgans of Eastern Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since 1880 the skeletons began going to the Smithsonian Institution and disappearing, along with lots of other important artifacts like evidence of rune-like alphabetic writing on stone and other indications of a higher order of civilization than is typically attributed to Native Americans.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also if you can get your hands on a copy of the written accounts from the expeditions of De Soto, the first French explorers to the Great Lakes region and other early European explorers, you'll find very interesting information that is overlooked or discounted by the academic establishment today.

              Thanks for the tips. That's damn interesting. The mound builders -- Viking link makes complete sense. I always thought it was odd those intrepid sailors succeeded in establishing colonies everywhere they landed but N. America.

              Another interesting cover-up in Native American archaeology you may be interested in if you haven't already heard of it is evidence of a horrific

              of the Four Corners area by basically a Pre-Columbian version of ISIS out of Central America -- driving the "Anasazi" into building the cliff dwellings. Quite interesting. Evidence was ignored or suppressed for decades because it ran counter to the "Noble Savage" narrative.

               I hadn't heard of that in reference to the four corners area specifically but there are lots of Native American oral traditions of cannibal giants. The typical story is that there were red-haired and black-haired "giants" (note that the Smithsonian recognizes them only as "tall" skeletons) that fought each other, and some of them were cannibals and the historical Native Americans as we know them warred with them until they were extinct. A lot of very large skeletons were taken out of Lovelock Cave in Nevada, which was apparently not inhabited ever since the former lake in that area became the desert that it is today (they found duck decoys for hunting in the cave as well).
              </p>
              <p>
               The southwestern natives also said that they were helped in their wars by a sky god who caused fire to engulf an entire valley. It's some crazy stuff and I'm still trying to figure out what to make of it. There are a lot of connections to biblical stories and traditions from the Middle East as well. The Book of Enoch also talks about semi-"divine" cannibal giants, and a lot of raping of normal women as well. Thus the abominable hybrid children that God supposed condemned with the global flood, trying to destroy all of them, etc. etc.

                Given what I've seen modding this board -- all I have to say is, it's a good thing I'm not God. There would be a lot of smoking black marks where people used to be. I get the whole Great Flood meme, I really do.

                Humans who acquire too much power just seem to devolve to the same nasty shit, no matter what era, race or geography. As a free citizen of the most powerful nation in human history, that is a sobering thought. And why I am here on this fine Friday evening, helping give my government as thorough of a colonoscopy as can possibly be arranged.
