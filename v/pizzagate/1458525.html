<p>Keep in mind if you look deeper into them they have broken links leading to their commercial properties which I thought was odd since they had listed a Burger King, a Mall, and an executive office plaza as their registered assets under Residential.

<p>this innocuous looking building is actually this company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunTrust_Banks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunTrust_Banks</a>. These guys have an unbelievable amount of assets, and the whole neighborhood is surrounded by million dollar houses. What I find even stranger about this place is despite being around all these million dollar estates the real estate company sells apartments at around $1400 while the surrounding going rate for places is around $2,100.</p>
<p>Questions:
Who owns the shell company with a poorly set up website for the apartment.
Is the apartment basically a brothel.
What is going around with all the schools that are around this place.
What\'s going on with Sun Trust Banking location, and could it be tied into this. </p>
<p>If you are going to set up an operation of this scale you would need to have more space than what Comet Ping Pong has. Bank would also be really handy, close proximity to airports would be exceptionally nice (It\'s within 4 miles of 3). You would want the neighborhood to be affluent and low crime. Why has the apartment been around since 1962 and have relatively no digital trail to follow. This is not a hipster crowd, this is a loaded with money crowd living here. 
**
It is disturbing how many schools surround this place, and how easy their access to children is.**</p>
<p>TL:DR There are tons of schools in the area, there is an apartment complex with the social media of a 12 year old, litterally 0 advertising, priced exceptionally below the standard of surrounding apartment that features pictures of Comet Ping Pong, Politics and Prose, and I am assuming had a picture of Betsa Pizza but that slide has been removed (Wonder why). Also a very large bank, with an extremely tattered look to it, and the one rating it has is very poor.** All in All, I would like help tracking down info on the apartment at the very least.**</p>',
