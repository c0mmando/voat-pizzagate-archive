<p>Robert Herring of OANN posted two intriguing tweets. The first dated September 18th had to do with Seth Rich: </p>

<p>No longer offering $200K for info. into #SethRich murder. Instead, we will be hiring private investigators.</p>

<p>Then yesterday came this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RobHerring/status/911009456472825857">https://twitter.com/RobHerring/status/911009456472825857</a></p>
<p>On Oct. 10th <a href="https://voat.co/user/OANN">@OANN</a> will make <a href="https://voat.co/user/POTUS">@POTUS</a> a very happy man. On Oct. 10th, watch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So many ways to go with this. My first guess was the evidence that Pedosta\'s Russian narrative is a fairy tale devised while eating thinly sliced pizza for about an hour, but there\'s that reference to Seth Rich. Have they been working on that story, and do they have something tangible? </p>
<p>But to complicate matters, there\'s a tweet by Katherine S Hefner (it\'s at the top of the comments): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We\'ll be waiting. This plus <a href="https://voat.co/user/wikileaks">@wikileaks</a> Oct surprise for <a href="https://voat.co/user/HillaryClinton">@HillaryClinton</a> will be a fun news month</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confused by this as are others. Note one tweeter saying he had to check the timestamps. It\'s what I was going to do. The only October Surprise for Killary that I was aware of was last year\'s. There was supposed to be a November Surprise that promised to land people in jail, but it never came because Killary didn\'t win the election.  
</p>
<p>So is there a Wikileaks October Surprise planned for Killary? Have no idea. I might have missed it, but there\'s an October 10th one planned by OANN. The thing is that OANN promised something big before and it wasn\'t. It may be all hype. But Project Veritas has promised its own October Surprise on the news media so there will be something to lift our flagging spirits: </p>

             Yes, he did. So that tweet could have been right. Especially with the ole gal going back and forth about challenging the election.

             I so would like my Christmas present to be Killary, Pedosta, and DWS in jail where they belong. I'd like anyone involved in Seth Rich's death to be there, too. They could reminisce about pizza parties while locked away in a cell.

             This is the most frustrating part of it, but imagine being Trump for a second. If he is actually making moves on "draining the swamp," wouldn't you want to wait to do it at the moment of maximum impact? I am referring to ruining the anti-Trump Dems' shot at gaining more seats in Congress in 2018. To keep majority of Congress republican he needs to ruin reputations as close to the 2018 midterms as possible. That's one argument I've heard for the wait, not to mention if he actually wants to take down the swamp (Fed reserve, R*th5ch1lds, etc) I'm sure it's not a quick process to do properly.
