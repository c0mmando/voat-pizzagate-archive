<p>You don’t have to be Elton John or Billy Joel to appreciate a work of art that allows one to create musical artistry. A number of top designers and artists have banded together with the non-profit organization, Sing For Hope, to create 88 one-of-a-kind “Pop Up Pianos.”</p>
<p>These gems have been scattered throughout the city for the past two weeks, giving New Yorkers a chance to put a little groove in their step. Now that the installation\'s coming to an end, the organization teamed up with Charitybuzz to auction off 10 of these unique items. With designs by names including Issac Mizrahi, Diane von Furstenberg, and Kate Spade…that sounds like beautiful music to our ears! Not only will placing a bid make you look as good as, or even better than you sound, but 100 percent of the proceeds will go towards funding for the Sing for Hope’s Art U! program. Pianos that do not go to Sing For Hope will be donated to schools and hospitals around the city, so use your computer keyboard to place a bid and get keyboard that helps charity and gives “Piano Man” a new meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn\'t Furstenberg connected to the Clinton Foundation and the  Italian families who are connected to the Vatican?  Didn\'t kate Spade recently commit suicide?</p>
<p>It\'s all connected.</p>',
