             ?   I don't understand the distinction you are making.     Are you talking about the art scene in Europe (which she was heavily involved in) and the art scene in the US?  Was there something different about the art scene in the US that you won't find in the pure non-commercial art scenes of Paris or Berlin where she used to live?
            </p>
            <p>
             Or are you talking about before she starting making real money?

               Her first windfall was in Amersterdam real estate.  She used that to buy some New York real estate.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think your take on her is a bit off.   It took a bit of Googling, but I found she moved to New York in 2001, since then the highlights include, her most famous work which was seen in person by 750,000 people, the documentary about that work and her career, co-created and starred in an opera about her life and started a performance art institute.  Seems like she's been busy.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also just found about about her religion.  Her spiritual guide is a Tibetan Lama, so it seems she practices Tibetan Buddhism.
              </p>
              <p>
               oh, she also wrote her memoir.

                Tibetans don't do Satanism. This is again an act of evil filth people adopting a (semi) established spiritual / religion to hide / cover under and in fact degrade and tarnish its reputations.

                 She is not a Satanist.  You've been misled on that point.  If you are a follower of the Dalai Lama, I think you would be interested in seeking the truth.   You should read about her life from non-pizzagate sources to see if you've been told the truth.  She has a long history with Tibetan Buddhism and is well known at high levels within Tibetan Buddhism.

              It's very weird if you know Kara Walker's art to think that she is celebrating her subject matter.  This has been a common mistake people make who are coming to know artists only through a distorted pizzagate view.
             </p>
             <p>
              He also linked to Kara Walker through sugar plantations in the Domincan Republic.  The connection (which is nonexistent) is that Kara Walker did a giant installation at a defunct sugar factory in Brooklyn that the current land owners are trying to win permission to use that waterfront land for condominiums.  So they do things like sponsor an art installation to get people to visit the site and generate neighborhood good will.
             </p>
             <p>
              She has no connection to the sugar barons in the Domincan Republic.  The installation she did was a sugar sculpture.  It's kind of like if I put on a play in the old Tammany Hall building in NYC which is now a theater that I'm somehow connected to Boss Tweed.

            $400K for a stencil cutout that a 3rd grader can make in 30 minutes? Where I live $400K will buy a new 2000 sq ft house with a swimming pool, 2 new Cadillacs and enough left over to take a world cruise. What some people think is valuable I will never understand.
