            Just yesterday John Conyers denied his accusations.  This guy says it was never his intent to make people feel uncomfortable.  WHAT?  Unwanted Advances?  Does he think he is such
            <strong>
             Hot Stuff
            </strong>
            that they will just be
            <strong>
             Tickled Pink?
            </strong>
            Evidently they both do.
