            Just so we're clear, the Lebanon war that the yearbook refers to was in 2006. Seth Rich would have been 12, and that is apparently what the yearbook says (text is kind of smudged in the video).

            He went with 300 other kids, and stayed for six weeks. It wasn't really "training with the army". It's a very common thing in upper-class Jewish families, the kids often go around the time of their Bar Mitzvah. I don't think you can infer much from this item except the obvious, that he came from an upper-class Jewish family.

             Thanks for pointing that out. I usually don't go with the ((Jew!!!)) circle jerk on voat, but being from an upperclass Jewish family does make you part of a small, well-connected, club. I don't know what to read into that, but, according to statistics, it's true, and those people do end up coming up in stories like this all the time.

              The list of "dual citizens" is also fake. If you check the source, he arrived at the list based solely on the Israeli "law of return," which grants Israeli citizenship to any Jew who asks. Bernie Sanders was specifically asked about his being on this list, and he said it's crap, he has only American citizenship.
             </p>

              It is certainly true that a high proportion of Senators and Congressmen are Jewish, and many of these are also on the known bad guys list (Chuck Schumer, Anthony Weiner, etc). But the statistics aren't really all that out of line. For example, 23 out of 435 Congressmen is 5.3 percent. But then about 2.2 percent of the U.S. population is Jewish. Since politicians tend to be well-connected and wealthy, there's really not much here besides the fact that wealthy people are over-represented in the House of Representatives. Knock me over with a feather!

            What does Seth's parents do for a living?
I find it odd how these families let their young adult children go to foreign countries, especially ones where the country is known for violence. 
If this is true about Seth training with the army there, how does an American citizen get to train with Israeli army? This story gets more bizarre every minute.

              So Seth's parents in all likelihood had plenty of $$ to afford to send Seth to Israel. Interesting, I wonder how many times Seth was over there?

             Most Jews consider themselves Jews first and Americans second. To them Israel is more important than the USA. If Seth Rich was such a patriot, how come he didn't enroll in the US military or the US Reserves?

              Yeah, I am not buying the whole "he loved Bernie so much" story anymore.

              Like I said b4 an "inexperienced kid" from NE does not get involved with the Clinton Cabal on his own. 
Now, I am realising Seth may not be that inexperienced after all!

             I don't know because Id never let my high school age children insert themselves into a foreign war.  Heck I have an issue with senior trips out of the country anyway even if it's England, Germany or France.   However, around here at least, many of the high schools are doing it yearly.
            </p>
            <p>
             BTW....One of the big dangers I've seen surfacing lately among people in elected government is that a multitude of them have DUEL CITIZENSHIPS.  .I know for instance Michelle Bachmann had a duel citizenship with Switzerland....and there was a Sandy Hook mother who also had a Switzerland dual  citizenship.  Then there's Rahm Emanuel (mayor of Chicago) who has an Israeli duel citizenship and I know he served in the Israeli army.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think if you are an Israeli citizen then you have to serve in the army??  Can anyone confirm this?

               yeah I mean and if you look at who's been running for president lately and all the dual citizenships or at least dual loyalties among them, it gets really crazy
              </p>
              <p>
               Obama = British, Indonesia,, Kenyan, and American Citizenship (American from his mother, Indonesian when he moved there and went to school there as a kid with his step father, and British/Kenyan from his biological father.
              </p>
              <p>
               Marco Rubio - His parents were both cuban when he was born so Cuba can claim him as a citizen and he was born in America
              </p>
              <p>
               Michelle Bachmann - Switzerland and America
              </p>
              <p>
               Bernie Sanders - Isreal and America
              </p>
              <p>
               Ted Cruz - Cuban, Canadian, American  (he was born in canida and father was cuban citizen until 2008 or so)
              </p>
              <p>
               Bobby Jindal (Both parents were Indian citizens at the time of his birth and he was born on American soil)
              </p>
              <p>
               So with all these people running that have murky loyalties, you start to wonder if it is on purpose.  As if this is the only people available to run.
               <br/>
               Super weird and disconcerting

Two years + of obligatory service, except for Arab Israelis, because this is the Apartheid State of Israel, after all.

            It is a Right of Birth"  to have to go to Israel?  I have Jewish friends Actually 3 couples and not one of their kids went to Israel.  Even the parents have not gone.  So he went there after HS.  So what.  People change so much during college and afterwards, that what he learned and the people he met up with may have changed his outlooks on war.  If he was a Bernie Voter, he would have changed his views.  Being in HS and going there, being away from the family, yeah that was probably what made him think it was cool too.

             My American Jewish friends I've known throughout the years would go to Israel for their right of birth. They are normal, nice, hard working people. I believe that Seth Rich's parents might be involved, but I can confirm while Jewish millennials are liberal Bernie people, they are unaware of a greater conspiracy.

              I believe that they are the same as the rest of the masses.  Uninformed and unaware of what is going on behind closed doors.  I believe that those of us that were involved in this election, and I mean working the phones, doors canvassing and had our hearts and souls in it, we knew at the very end what happened.  They stole an election.  So others that were not so involved do not believe or know what they are capable of.  They live on the outskirts, the outer edges of life.  That is why I am so very committed to bring out the truth to the masses.    Once it unfolds, it will be like falling dominoes.  They won't know what hit them.

               Unfortunately, no, the Jews are NOT the "same as the rest of the masses"
              </p>
              <p>
               Since birth most Jews are made to be aware of who they are, beginning with circumcision.
and they quickly get indoctrinated in their synagogues where they learn that they are Jews, the chosen ones, and they are made to believe they are different from everyone else who are not jews.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jewishness is a closed sect, you can't really join and become one of them, like in the rest of all religions, and those who do through marriage, will never be treated like real jews, because to be a real jew, you have to be born from a Jewish mother.
              </p>
              <p>
               Proof of this, is the AIPAC, the most powerful Politican Action Commitee in the USA,
The AIPAC literally makes donations to ALL Senators and congressman and women of ALL parties. The Jews are the most powerful political force in the US, despite being only 2% of the population.

                WE send  our money to Israel.  So you are saying the Jews (my friends included) are members of AIPAC or believe in sending money to Israel.  Our senators and women of all parties, whether Jewish or not are responsible for accepting that money.  I will not throw all Jews under the bus nor will I make any blanket statements about any one race or religion.

                 Yes, your friends could be members or AIPAC, it is a legit PAC, and it raises millions of dollars from Jewish citizens. 
That is completely legal. It is not illegal for senators and congress people to accept money from PACs, it is part of our political system.
This is the reality, whether we like it or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Refusal of AIPAC's donations is political suicide.

                 You could say that Jews are smarter, because they are more politically aware, and they are united behind their cause.
They also put their money where their mouth is, unlike most of the other citizen groups.

                  You know what, I don't like your attitude.  All groups, Catholics that have propped up the Vatican (while protecting abusing priests)  Christians that send money to their Holy Roller Heads,   Black People that support the NAACP, etc.  People are allowed to do whatever they wish with their money.  The people that accept it are at fault as well.  I am sick and tired of having to defend Jewish people on here.  We are here to save the children from pedophiles, not constantly the religion and cultures of any  particular race.

                    The facts as you see them. I am old enough to have experienced some pretty brutal times so do not try to patronize me saying I can't handle reality or call me sunshine.  I have been having to fight on here the last few days seeing the constant pummeling of Jews and I am sick of it.  Those that wish to do that should start a sub of their own.  This sub is for research on the pedophiles that are raping and trafficking our children, not the constant every tear down of a group of people.
