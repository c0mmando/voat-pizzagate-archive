<p>Well, it never stops with them.  Today, a PP branch in Pennsylvania called for the Walt Disney Company to create an animated princess &quot;who\'s had an abortion,&quot; in a since-deleted tweet.</p>
<p>PP Keystone, a branch of the health service provider based in Trexlertown, PA., tweeted that, &quot;We need a disney princess who\'s had an abortion/We need a disney princess who\'s pro choice/We need a disney princess who\'s an undocumented immigrant/We need a disney princess who\'s actually a union worker/We need a disney princess who\'s trans.&quot;  The non-profit Internet Archive\'s Wayback Machine - which archives snapshots of sites across the web - shows it stored six captures of the tweet.  PP\'s national office confirmed the tweet amd its deletion in an email to &quot;USA Today.&quot;  Disney has yet to comment.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, we joined an ongoing Twitter conversation about the kind of princesses people want to see in an attempt to make a point about the importance of telling stories that challenge stigma and championing stories that too often don\'t get told,&quot; said Melissa Reed, PP\'s president and CEO.  &quot;Upon reflection, we decided that the seriousness of the point we were trying to make was not appropriate for the subject matter or context, and we removed the tweet.&quot;  The tweet triggered a slew of feedback online from users replying to a vanished post.  Some took screenshots of the tweet before its deletion.<br />

<p>When these taxpayer-funded low-lifes aren\'t killing babies and children and haggling over prices of body parts, they are enabling and teaching children to be desensitized to the death of the innocent.  Indoctrinating young children is nothing new from PP.   Disney princesses promote values that most parents can applaud: kindness, compassion, courage, hope, and justice.  They are overwhelmingly heroic women who protect the vulnerable and are kind to those in need.  A princess getting an abortion is what this corporation stands for.</p>
<p>And the federal government refuses to defund the nation\'s biggest abortion provider.  LifeNews reported that PP Keystone received $3.5 million in tax dollars in 2016.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the  &quot;Disney Princess&quot; subject has been raised by PP.  We all know that PP takes drastic measures to reach their customers at younger ages than ever before.  Elementary schools are being infiltrated with sex-ed teachers and information PP people and pamphlets.  A few years ago, sponsored and suggested posts by PP started popping up in &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine showing what it looks like when Cinderella gets tested for STD\'s (sexually transmitted diseases).  Images were also being placed on Facebook.

<p>Since the beginning of the Walt Disney Company, princesses have been criticized for how they portray females.  Modern Disney princess films have expanded on and provide audiences with themes of feminism and sisterhood.  Two linguist researchers in 2016, Carmen Fought and Karen Eisenhauer, analyzed all the dialogue from Disney princesses and their movies.  The goal of their research was to establish the differences between the way male and female characters in the franchise speak.  They reported that films of the &quot;Disney Renaissance&quot; era (1989-1999) were more male-dominated.  In the &quot;Little Mermaid,&quot; men speak 68% of the time dialogue and in &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot; 71%.  These women reported, &quot;There are no women doing things.  There are no women leading the townspeople to go against the Beast, no women bonding in the tavern together singing songs and drinking.  Everybody who\'s doing anything else, other than finding a husband, pretty much is male.&quot;  They attributed this imbalance of dialogue to &quot;carelessness&quot; and claimed we are so trained to think of males as the norm.<br />

<p>So, this is nothing new under the sun, and none of us will be surprised when the movie comes out about a transgender Disney Princess who is successfully artificially inseminated but decides to abort the baby in the second or third trimester, or is this movie already a rerun?</p>',

             A Pennsylvania branch of Planned Parenthood says a tweet declaring the need for a Disney princess who's had an abortion was not appropriate and the organization has taken it down.
            </p>
            <p>
             An executive for Planned Parenthood Keystone says the group believes pop culture plays a "critical role" in educating the public and sparking "meaningful conversations about sexual and reproductive health issues and policies, including abortion."
            </p>
            <p>
             Melissa Reed, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Keystone, says the seriousness of the point they were trying to make was not appropriate for the subject matter.

           <p>
            Last week, The Hill reported that the FBI is seeking thousands of pages of unredacted documents from the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation and criminal referrals of Planned Parenthood and StemExpress. Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed in congressional testimony that the referrals’ findings could form the basis of criminal charges against Planned Parenthood and StemExpress, once verified by the Department of Justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to whistleblower Holly O’Donnell, who worked for StemExpress, StemExpress workers were “embedded” in PP clinics to save money. They used private patient medical files leaked to them by Planned Parenthood management to locate women who could meet their body parts order quotas for the day through their scheduled abortions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Inside PP abortion facilities, StemExpress workers would then dissect the aborted fetuses, package the desired organs, and ship them via FedEx to StemExpress, which sold them to medical researchers. Contrary to PP’s explanation, the organization received payment from StemExpress for each fetal organ “determined in the clinic to be usable.” StemExpress paid its technicians a bonus depending on the number and type of body parts harvested, O’Donnell says.
           </p>

            In the latest video, O’Donnell says she witnessed coworkers take fetal body parts without patient consent from abortions at Planned Parenthood: “If there was like a high-gestated fetus, I have witnessed there was no consent signed, and these women didn’t know that it was getting taken,” revealed O’Donnell. “It’s stealing, it’s stealing baby parts.”

            Childbearing age females require agency over their own fertility. Overwhelmingly, women prefer to prevent conception via ordinary and humane means.  However, nefarious individuals and groups collude to deny female reproductive agency, in myriad ways both  high birthrate and low.
