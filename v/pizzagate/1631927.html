            PizzaGate subs are under our control. They tried to move it to ClintonGate and PedoGate. Now they are trying to shatter it to DCPedoRing whatever gibberish you are proposing.

             Good luck convincing anyone to actually listen to you then. I'm not saying moving the subs to something else but suggesting take it beyond calling it pizzagate. Calling the investigation pizzagate makes you look stupid. Talking to someone about pedophilia in DC without saying pizzagate makes it a hell of a lot easier is what I'm saying. Stop being so fucking childish with this instance on calling it pizzagate.

              This is not about being childish. If you want to call it DC Washington Pedophile Gate go ahead.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm only telling people to not also do this because there has been two attempts already to change the name pizzagate because CREW/CTR/Pedoshills owned the ClintonGate and PedoGate hashtags and subs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also you are saying PizzaGate has been debunked, just as a pedoshill always does. Please provide some arguments for your claim. But I know you wont.

               In your haste to call someone out who has been here since day one, you've ignored that I said the public PERCEPTION is that 'pizzagate' has been debunked. I'm saying I've found it easier to broach the subject by calling it the DC Pedo Ring and giving the example of the Westminster Ring here in Britain. Your condescension is off putting. I hope you don't do the same to everyone who react negatively to the term pizzagate.

                Well here is a different tone:
               </p>
               <p>
                PizzaGate is burned into the minds of millions already, if the arrests start happening every memory that once was thought a ridiculous conspiracy theory will activate in the opposite direction.
               </p>
               <p>
                There has been so much exposure, it's perfectly fine to stay with PizzaGate. People will get interested again, and the search results count on the term are enormous. There is already so much out there.
               </p>
               <p>
                PizzaGate is the main term which should be used for this madhouse.
