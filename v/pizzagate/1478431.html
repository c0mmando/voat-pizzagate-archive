1) **Focus on Jeffrey Epstein.** He has the most locations, the most connections, the most travel activity, and is a convicted sex offender.

People like Virginia Roberts and Rachel Chandler offer the best leads.
2) **Focus on Hollywood.** As we know, celebrities like Elijah Wood and Corey Feldman have gone on the record and identified the problem. This establishes the legitimate grounds for further investigation/outcry if research is based off of their words.
3) **All information must be broken down into professional infographics**. I know one or more people here have been making some - this is absolutely critical in order to effectively get this information in people\'s heads. And whoever is doing it is doing a great job (although I would maybe make 52 infographics deck of cards style)  Most people shut down and ignore when something looks amateurish.
4) The pizzagate brand was killed by the pushback. My personal suggestion would be to reboot as #OpViPedo on reddit, twitter, etc. and going forward, only mention CPP as one of several potential sites/nodes of investigation. People need to see the larger picture - that human trafficking by our elites does exist - and tunnel vision on one site makes this easier to dismiss.
5) Other notables incidents that cannot be denied: Dennis Hastert, Terry Bean, Operation Flicker (Pentagon), House Page Program, Craig J. Spence call boy scandal. Even generating greater awareness of theses incidents would be meaningful.</p>

            I have a suggestion.
           </p>
           <p>
            A stop and start rebranding with a new and yet unfamiliar name probably isn't the answer but I think that anytime #pizzagate is used everyone should start adding the hashtag pedogate until it too catches on.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's more straight to the point, will be harder to make sound ridiculous etc etc and nothing is lost by doing it.

            Cut it out with this shit, We've mentioned rebranding 3 times already and it has been shot down each time. Anyone who suggests it from now on is a clear shill.

            I commend the sentiment and concerns you have but I disagree.
           </p>
           <p>
            1 - MSM isn't trusted any more. The old rules no longer apply. The new rules are - anything that is so strongly and viciously attacked by the MSM has probably got something to it. Witness Trump and the attacks on him, same with Brexit. The more the media doth protest too much, the higher Trump and Brexit support spiked, particularly when it got extreme and overbearing. PizzaGate is STILL BOOMING in large part BECAUSE of the MSM being forced to cover it and ham fistedly "debunk" it.  Let them keep talking, and more people start checking it out. Once they do they will discover a wealth of info that the "debunkers" never address and they too will realise the MSM is covering up. You can't put out a fire with more gasoline.
           </p>
           <p>
            2 - PizzaGate is now a thing. It IS the name, for better or worse. You'll never get the same head of steam with anything else because people will just say "that's PizzaGate". Also, a rebrand will for that very reason cause suspicion and feed into the debunkers agenda. People will assume that because it was proven rubbish the conspiracists just gave it a new name. And you LNOW that's what our opponents will push. They'll laugh and say "dude, this is PizzaGate, who are you trying to fool?" Remember that labelling and ridicule are their main weapons of defence: political correctness to cause shame and stigma so people avoid talking about it or investigating for fear of labels (crazy conspiracy theorist, fake news promoter, tinfoil hat loon, etc).
           </p>
           <p>
            3 - by rebranding we accept the name is wrong and we play into the enemies hands of "labelling" and ridicule. We concede there's something wrong. No. what's wrong is he enemy has attempted to say PizzaGate is Alt Right / Trumper / FakeNews / Conspiracy theorist / about one guys pizza parlour.  THEY'VE defined it and pigeonholed it to attack - essentially they have creat a Straw Man.  What we need to do is laugh them off and keep pushing that this is "a non partisan international citizen investigation into paedo rings and child trafficking by Ekites in government and business and how the media is covering up for them". Anything else is bullshit. Tell them they don't get to define what it is, if they are not part of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            4 - we don't need a figurehead we need to wake up a critical mass of people until something gives. Already since PizzaGate have you noticed TONS of paedo ring related stories have been in the news. So as long as we keep our definition as above, we can point to it all as wvid nice that such elite paedo rings do exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short PizzaGate wasn't the ideal name. I was there when people were discussing hashtags. I preferred EyesWideOpen. But it is what it is, rebranding is not a good idea. Resisting the media attempts to label and define us is.
