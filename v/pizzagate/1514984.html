<p><strong>J.B. Pritzker</strong> - Remember him from Podesta\'s emails? Probably the biggest example of pay-for-play to come out of the whole scandal. He\'s spent big for the last couple decades on WJC, HRC, and BHO. Plenty of ties with CGI.

<p><strong>Matthew Pritzker</strong> - Along with his sister, sued their dad for 500 mill. One of his biggest interest is investing in pizza chains(sounds juicy but has lead to anything yet).</p>
<p><strong>Liesel Pritzker-Simmons</strong> - Bother of Matthew. Oddly enough was an accomplished child actress. Likes to start investment companies. IDP foundation, Young Ambassadors for Opportunity, BlueHaven Initiative. Hangs out at the White house quite often apparently. So far in my digging, I have been most interested with this one. Also, Why the fuck does it seem like everyone associated with these people went to Georgetown?
<a href="https://archive.is/WIa6p">White house trip</a></p>
<p><strong>Penny Pritzker</strong> - Current Secretary of Commerce. Are you kidding me? This person is part of BO\'s cabinet. Check out some of the deals that she\'s pulled off including Superior Bank. Bought for 1 mill. and received 640 mill. in credits. And the Transunion stuff where she basically has everyone\'s info ever.
<a href="http://archive.is/EylVU">Bad Bus.</a></p>
<p><strong>Jean(GiGi) Pritzker</strong> - Movie producer with some big titles under her belt. Haven\'t gone down that road but...possible Hollywood link.</p>
<p>So that\'s what I did for a bit yesterday. Maybe it will help someone that\'s looking for a new start that feels stuck. There\'s plenty of room for searching. I also want to make it clear that I am not accusing any of these people of anything so right off the bat, I will be able to clearly spot the shills and CTR. If they\'re clean, they\'re clean. This is just something I thought was interesting.</p>',

            <p>
             J.B. Pritzker is an active philanthropist and civic leader. He is one of the nation’s leading supporters of expanding high-quality early learning (birth – 5) for disadvantaged children. As the Pritzker Family Foundation’s president, he created The Children’s Initiative, which funds innovative research and programs for children in underserved communities. The Erikson Institute recognized him for this initiative with its Spirit of Erikson Institute Award. Pritzker also supported the creation of the Pritzker Consortium on Early Childhood Development at the University of Chicago, which is led by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman.
            </p>
            <p>
             Along with the Gates, Buffett, Kaiser and Harris Foundations, the Pritzker Family Foundation is a founder of the First Five Years Fund, focusing nationwide attention and resources on comprehensive, quality early care and learning programs for children from birth to age five. The foundation is a leading supporter of Educare Centers, providing high-quality early childhood education for at-risk youth.

             We are active in Phaeton, a small village of approximately 1,800 located along the northeast coast of the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             We joined members of the community to establish Noah’s Ark, a small school now serving approximately ninety students age 3 to 12.

           <p>
            Phaeton, Nord-Est is very close to the Dominican Republic border. Remember that Silsby tried to smuggle children out of Haiti and across the Dominican Republic border, which is where she and her group were ultimately busted. There is very little information available about this town, though wikipedia claims its population is a mere 2,500. This is a small community.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at how tiny it is on google maps:

           </p>
           <p>
            Much like Larua Silsby's little Baptist group, New Life Children's Refuge, there are other Baptist groups still working there.

           <p>
            But since a small group like that has their own page, figures that "Noah’s Ark" should also have its own page, yeah?
           </p>
           <p>
            But I'm not finding one.. save for this

           <p>
            Most I can find for info on it is this:

             http://childrensinitiative.org/haiti-trip-report/
            </a>
            from October 2016, but no photos or anything. Drops some names: Alan Jerffery, Michael Ippoliti, Elmond Jean and Dr. Clonel Louis.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Alan Jerffery" doesn't seem to actually exist, although there is a Jeff Alan who lists "Volunteer translation technology expert for Haiti Disaster Relief" from 2010-2013:

           </p>
           <p>
            Found Michael Ippoliti, seems he is a real person who actually did go on the trip:

           <p>
            Found Elmond Jean:

            Possibly found Clonel Louis (name 582) though this is the only place I can find him:
