<p>Peter Bright, a former technology editor for the liberal online publication Ars Technica, was convicted in Manhattan federal court Monday of attempted child enticement. Bright was convicted after a one-week jury trial.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: “As the jury found, Peter Bright attempted the basest type of crime, arranging to engage in sex with young children. Thanks to the FBI, Bright is in custody and facing serious prison time.”</p>
<p>According to the allegations contained in the Complaint:</p>
<p>In April 2019, Bright reached out online to an undercover agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), who was posing as the mother of a 7-year-old girl and 9-year-old boy (the “Minors”). Over the course of hundreds of chat communications, Bright discussed with the undercover agent his plan to meet the Minors to engage in sexual activity. Bright also requested photographs of the Minors.</p>
<p>You can view the federal complaint <a href="https://archive.vn/5wl1z">HERE</a>. Warning: contents are extremely disturbing.</p>
<p>In May 2019, Bright met the undercover agent at a public park in New York, New York, for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with the Minors. As Bright and the undercover agent began walking to the Minors’ residence, Bright was arrested.</p>
<p>*&gt;</p>
<p>Bright, 39, of Brooklyn, New York, was convicted of one count of attempted enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>

            This guy was into pandas. Remember Cum Panda from Alefantis' instagram? Anyway this guy collected stuffed panda toys. There was even a picture of him giving a panda to a little kid. It made me wonder if that was his calling card and he gave them to children he had selected to build a bond between them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another symbol he used was pumpkins. I've seen other pedos use the pumpkin as well. I'm not sure what it means but if you break it into two words it's pump kin. Does this mean to abuse relatives? Is pumpkin used as a sign to tell other pedos that you abuse family members?
           </p>
           <p>
            He also referred to his computer as a 'pizza oven'. Ovens make pizzas, if pizza means children, is he saying he uses his computer to make child porn?
           </p>
           <p>
            There was so much revealed from his arrest and its a shame most people have forgotten all this.

             I know the meaning of the nursery rhyme "Peter, Peter pumpkin eater" is about getting someone pregnant:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater
             </p>
             <p>
              Had a wife and couldn't keep her
             </p>
             <p>
              Put her in a pumpkin shell
             </p>
             <p>
              And there he kept her pretty well.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I.e. Wife was stepping out on him until he knocked her up.
