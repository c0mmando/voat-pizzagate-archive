<p>If you read <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@mandireiserra/brad-sherman-the-man-who-represents-deep-state-s-move-against-trump-and-assorted-potenially-pizzagate-shaped-rabbit-hole-goodies">Mandi Rei Serra\'s</a> post here, you\'ll get one angle. People on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2002875">Voat</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6nsrob/the_invisible_bistro/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/133657808/">4Chan</a> have started parsing the various leads. There is some concern, that it\'s all a fluke in an aggregate system. Well, okay then. If Hours Center is pulling all the businesses with &quot;Joseph\'s&quot; and listing them under &quot;Joseph\'s Bistro,&quot; then whoopsie, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1996070">But I\'m not buying it.</a></p>
<p>I looked up my home town; a little hick metropolis that thrives on Americana (I say <em>hick</em> because it\'s surrounded by orchards, fields, feed lots and dairies. Closest town with over 20,000 people is an hour away) and there were a couple of things listed as Joseph\'s Bistro. Well, let\'s put it up against a control-- what happens if I look up McDonald? My home town has two unrelated McDonald\'s businesses-- the franchise burger place and an old electrical store that\'s been operating since, I dunno, the 40\'s or 50\'s. It\'s old and predates the McDonald\'s drive through. So, using the logic that it\'s aggregating <em>-everything-</em> that has the chosen phrase, both McDonald\'s should appear, right?</p>
<p>Well, no. Only the drive through does. </p>
<p>To me, it demonstrates it\'s not an aggregation issue. If it were, there\'d be people with the name McDonald listed, in addition to the aforementioned electrical store. </p>
<p>Now let\'s explore this with Joseph\'s Bistro.</p>
<p>I went to their site, and <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/search-results?cx=partner-pub-6371063963738592:3182582079&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=joseph%27s&amp;sa=Search">looked up the single phrase, &quot;Joseph\'s.&quot;</a></p>
<p>If it\'s aggregating all things with a Joseph in it, and then putting those with no logo with a fill in of Joseph\'s Bistro, we\'d see it, right?</p>
<p>Not so much.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/DQmPmRqysGruoSYvY7TuexSdDTYki5aUCWFyqTEBx6wKDGd/HCallthemjoes.png">HCallthemjoes.png</a></p>
<p>Businesses including the phrase &quot;Joseph\'s&quot; in their name and no logo are shown with no logo. The &quot;subfolder&quot; theory is wrong, sorry. If a placeholder image was used, then we\'d see it. Here we can plainly see a Joseph\'s business with no logo. If it\'s a bot filling in the blanks, wouldn\'t those blanks be somewhat uniformly filled? Let\'s use this as our control.</p>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/DQmVYkbJ39TrNf1ZVChJYMCyVtftCQh6AKcnpdh5591HyvL/HC%20weird%20place3.png">HC weird place3.png</a></p>
<p>Now, there\'s also these:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/DQmbVQUJRCgKAoosX8g9Won49HHH5HRw1jiAzQuxJscsc2P/HC%20weird%20hours.png">HC weird hours.png</a></p>

<p>If a bot filled in the info, why is it not consistent, like how all the websites listed go to www.fiorechiro.com?</p>
<p><strong>Another issue are all the trends people are noticing.</strong></p>
<p>Many of these Joseph\'s Bistro locations seem to be in close proximity to the following:
- Children (schools/parks)
- Lawyers
- Medical Establishments and practitioners
- Busy Roads
- Law Enforcement and Military</p>
<p>Here\'s an example.

<a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/josephs/mcclellan/6594153/">Source</a></p>
<p>It\'s not often one finds a business open for a single day a week; generally the cost of overhead makes one, <em>you know</em>, work... unless one is making a shitton of cash once a week or has some wealthy sponsor to keep it afloat-- that is, if it\'s a legitimate business.</p>
<p>And it\'s odd that so many of these locations are near medical establishments.

<p>But what gets my mental hamster running on it\'s wheel is that both Voat and Reddit experienced a ddos attackwhen interest in the Invisible Bistro grew.

Correlation isn\'t causation by any means, but it\'s interesting. Maybe it was some other topic being discussed at both sites, maybe it was a random occurrence from assholes with too much time on their hands. Whatever it was, it provides fuel to the fires of citizen investigators, if only to find out the whys from all the weird questions arising.</p>
<p>If anything, I think we want it cleared up, as to why these odd listings exist. Joseph is a common enough name. But so is Dave, Tom, Mohammad, Mary, and John, or any freaking name from a religious text. Those names don\'t compare with Joseph, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/franks-franks/">Frank\'s Franks</a> comes in second, with 17,000+ locations.
And their website redirects to a Real Estate appraiser from Pennsylvania.

<p>When I searched for the address terms, separated I got some interesting hits (although I can\'t say they are related), but I\'m not going to peruse it further or go  down <em>that</em> rabbit hole... so here is good.  Why not explore it? Because some rabbit holes end with foxes. </p>
<p>Know what the one franchise that outdid Joseph\'s happens to be? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/subway/">Subway.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/DQmPqu4MCEjRcN1b3xjRv7X2Fpc3fpDNnw7EJACg8zmvhYx/subway.png">subway.png</a></p>
<h1>And as we all know, Subway is FOREVER associated with this douche canoe on a stick.</h1>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/DQmZbyKdroGCseA7KtG3YP6MWW3yK3zi6ZKJkDS33mFGMr3/subway2.png">subway2.png</a></p>

<p>It\'s not a good look, no matter what.</p>
<p>To the citizen investigators, please do not call those people listed on Hours Center. We don\'t want to get them scared if they are innocent folk caught up in a bot error, or if it is nefarious, we don\'t want them spooked to the point that all hell breaks out to keep the world distracted.</p>
<p>If any law enforcement (on the side of the citizens of America and <em>not</em> those protecting or participating in human rights violations or other unlawful deeds) read this, it\'s on you. We can gather this readily available information and parse through it, but we, as civilians, can\'t do much-- we don\'t know who\'s protecting the system and we know the system is broken. We cannot take the law into our own hands, because that\'s how the investigation gets listed as a nutjob\'s wet dream. We have to be methodical, ethical, and peaceful. Loud, but peaceful. But under no circumstances should a lawful citizen investigator <em>ever</em> investigate a location with a firearm, or alone for that matter.  Don\'t interact, just observe. This is the Neighborhood Watch, cyber version.</p>
<p>Maybe we can find some patterns. Maybe we hand hold the spotlight while white hats do their thing.</p>
<p>That is my hope.</p>

            To the citizen investigators, please do not call those people listed on Hours Center. We don't want to get them scared if they are innocent folk caught up in a bot error, or if it is nefarious, we don't want them spooked to the point that all hell breaks out to keep the world distracted.
           </p>

            If any law enforcement (on the side of the citizens of America and
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            those protecting or participating in human rights violations or other unlawful deeds) read this, it's on you. We can gather this readily available information and parse through it, but we, as civilians, can't do much-- we don't know who's protecting the system and we know the system is broken. We cannot take the law into our own hands, because that's how the investigation gets listed as a nutjob's wet dream. We have to be methodical, ethical, and peaceful. Loud, but peaceful. But under no circumstances should a lawful citizen investigator
            <em>
             ever
            </em>
            investigate a location with a firearm, or alone for that matter.  Don't interact, just observe. This is the Neighborhood Watch, cyber version.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe we can find some patterns. Maybe we hand hold the spotlight while white hats do their thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is my hope.

             They already know our locations due to the NSA. They may have a huge ball of yarn to untangle before specific location is evident,  but that doesn't negate the fact that there be Franks everywhere but we have yet to see one at a location deemed to be Frank's irl.

              I've been looking. The fact that this thread exists is either proof of a leak that this is legit, or it's some kind of weird Asian engrish malfunction, or a trap but you're right - they do know our locations. Just who knows our locations however is up for debate. There are numerous potential different groups after some of us who might or might not be connected to the NSA. I'm not a troll. GO check out this thread for proof of my intentions.

              The website this location links to is here:

               https://www.fiorechiro.com/

           </ul>
           <p>
            The other location is linked to the same site and is on prime real estate in Old Town Alexandria. Same chiro affiliation.
           </p>

            Interestingly, this happened two blocks away from the 4200 location this morning.  Very strange for that area:

            Other locations around the area link to florechiro.com as well.

            This chiropractor was convicted of several sexual assaults with a child in McKinney TX, his lawyer was Todd Shapiro. Todd's father is Howard Shapiro, the husband of Florence Shapiro. Florence Shapiro worked on the Jeb Bush Presidential campaign. She also sits on the board for Collin County Children's Advocacy Center (CPS) and has donated over 70,000 to them. Also, once working for her state senatorial office was someone listed on IC Watch.

            Not pulling up on Hours Center because maybe it was removed after the guy got convicted. The article above says the DA made him public enemy number one.

            I'm willing to keep digging, but, this is serving to solidify my hypothesis that this is a database error. Sorry to disappoint!

             Something odd I found from your analysis is that about half of those hits were either some form of medical professional (doctor, dentist) or a lawyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of the other researchers are finding this commonality in their findings too.

             Either a really bizzare coincidence or something to look at?

              I don't think it's odd... a lot of Doctors, DDS, Lawyers, etc are "listed" due to either requirement from their office/firm, to make it easier to find reviews/listings, or simply by Medical/Legal index based listing sites (Similar to HoursCenter, but specifically for medical or legal fields).
             </p>
             <p>
              Ironically, what's odd is any non-business/non-legal/non-medical listings... the people that are being listed who simply live at private residences. But upon further inspection most* of these are rental properties and the listings that include everyday "Joe's" are simply current or prior renters of said properties.

            Swagger Restaurant and Bar: anyone ever heard of this place? It's coming up in several locations around the world, but they don't seem related. However their menu looks kinda gross.

            If you google the address, the same address is listed for Domino's, Swagger's Bar, and Fossil, but since I live here I can tell you that only Domino's and Dickey's BBQ are actually there.

            I don't know what to think yet but I thought I'd drop this tip. I looked up Texas and because I used to live in College Station TX and I've never heard of Joseph's, I looked at this result:
            <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/josephs/college-station/6510191/">
             https://www.hourscenter.com/josephs/college-station/6510191/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This pops up and if you go to the site, it's a hospital, St. Joseph's, which could be nothing but a sign of an error on that site. However, the website listed on the same page is www.fiorechiro.com which is a chiropractor in a different state which is kinda confusing also:
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Why would a restuaruant named Joseph's be located in a chiropractor's office. I am pretty confused about this whole thing, but again - just dropping some tips.
           </p>
           <p>
            The weird thing about College Station is that it's where George HW Bush has his library, and I met him there once on accident at the gym, so heavy Illuminati presence in the area.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to go with other people needing to investigate this but I am definitely interested in this as a potential lead, although we aren't sure if it is a lead or not.

            I really hate this thread..but I had to at least check out my town...and I am really stunned.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only location is the address for the local hospital. When I search the hospital address for bistro there IS a cafe that comes up that is located in the hospital [which is what I think, this is some kind of food catering/cafeteria thing, even makes sense for doctors offices or lawyers offices ] The only page for the cafe is yelp so I go to yelp where i am totally creeped out to find NOT pictures of the cafe, but pictures of my husband's workplace which is a totally different location, including logo and even a photo with him in it!?! I chalk this up to yelp glitch BUT THEN
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm telling him about this when he gets home. Laughing "hey you are on pizzagate" and I explain my autist rabbit hole that leads to the restaurant he works at-  he turns white and tells me that
            <strong>
             the hospital rents storage space from them that is located in their building
            </strong>
            . The hospital was already renting that part of it when the building was sold and they begged to let them keep  renting it. Now the building has been turned into  a restaurant... the hospital storage is still there.  they don't rent storage to anyone else.

            Thanks! This definitely adds some fuel to the fire... I'm the one that's been pushing the sub-folder/database error as the most likely cause. However, if we were to put our heads together and come up with the top 10 - 20 listings that are truly suspicious... ESPECIALLY if they can be cross-referenced with known offenders/areas of interest. I would happily dig in with some of the tools I have to see if there is a way to be 100% certain this is NOT a database error.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, my sub-folder theory looks like it checks out, at least in each case I dive into. Paired with the fact that a ton of the listings on HC are downright wrong (missing addresses, botched hours, incorrect spots on maps), I'm still thinking this is all a technical error. But, I am happy to help debunk my own hypothesis with a few key addresses/listings.

             I like the rule of threes. Who else can dig in to verify this isn't a database error? I don't have any technical ability but it seems like the kind of thing someone with know how should be able to do relatively easily.

             I'd like to believe its a deep internet glitch lol based on teh weird connections I'm finding that would be preferable.

               Look at the hits I found (in my comments on this thread searching Ventura County).
              </p>
              <p>
               Based on a Google Maps sweep, the most alarming ones are one in Oxnard and one in Ventura. Virtually every single one based on that sweep fits the "red flag" patterns".

             Looked up dentists in Missouri. For some reason, only a few pop up. One called Zona Rosa dental. Ummmm.... oddly enough near a park and a hotel. But the map location when clicked sends me to a nonexistent GNC near Dealy Plaza in Dallas, near the 6th Floor Museum.

             Very weird. I really hope this isn't just another wild goose chase created to keep us busy, but I'll still be looking until convinced otherwise...

            Thank you for the report and though we have to keep in mind the possibility that there is a logical explanation/error for this, right now "I'm not buying it either."  Don't think something this odd can be ignored.  :)

            Dunno. I looked thru the Joseph's in my town, and there's one right in my old apartment building! But it's on an upper floor of a strictly residential building. In an apartment that was (apparently) occupied by a (presumably) now-deceased attorney with a first name of Joseph. Whose only presence online was a partial obituary and a note about his representing indigent defendants in criminal court.

            I live in a very rural area and have over 30 near me. Like everyone else, they link to the same types of business. This is where it takes an odd turn for me. I don't want to go too far into my personal life but I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 years old. The person responsible hired a prominent defense attorney and was let off with a slap on the wrist. The prosecutors treated me terribly. To the point that if it happened to me again, I would not go to law enforcement. Anyways, one of the locations is the lawyer who defended the guy. He is also a big art collector and has his art collections on the law firms website.

             This is a church. St. Joseph's, to be exact. The Pear St. address is interesting, because the "face" of the church is actually on Tenant Ave. Of course, there is access on Pear St. (Its the parking lot), but Pear runs perpendicular to Tenant, and is actually the rear of the church. There was a scandal that was, locally anyway, kept relatively quiet in the early '00's.

             I remember reading about Stephen Kiesel around '03. This fucker married my parents in '74. We actually clipped the West County Times story. My parents no longer display their wedding photos, because this piece of fucking shit is prominent in a lot of them:

              It could be a coincidence, of course. The office I referred to above is the closest location to me. It gave me the chills when I started looking at this. Just so many coincidences. What happened to me is not associated with pizzagate at all. But it's just a gut feeling that there is more to this.

            check this out
           </p>
           <p>
            As pointed out by another user, I looked at a small town and there were a whole bunch of locations
           </p>
           <p>
            In the second place, a good sized city, there were only 2 locations
           </p>
           <p>
            Location #1
Street view google: A woods at an intersection where 3 streets converge.  The street going to this dead end is an area heavy with children-focused businesses --- an elementary school, a YWCA, a large daycare
           </p>
           <p>
            The telephone number (still Location#1) (anywho - reverse look up) is associated with the home address of a  9th Circuit Court Judge.      (Weirdly enough, his home address is  Hampstead Lane...  if you are not aware of what that word insinuates, see
            <a href="http://hampsteadcoverup.com/">
             http://hampsteadcoverup.com/
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            Location#2   a catholic hospital.  The reverse look up on the tel #  had no results
           </p>
           <p>
            We should look very closely at the 9th Circuit Court connection to Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I recently found another connection with a non-profit == which was started by a 9th Circuit Court Judge.  It supposedly focuses at teaching 9 to 11 yr old students about "violence" (the org. is affiliated with 12 local public schools)     but   the PEDO list shows 8 convicted offenders using that  Org.'s address as their "work" address.

             Wow!
Wondering what we might find in DC or other hot spots for kidnappings?
            </p>
            <p>
             Guess we should also figure a way to reverse-engineer this -- 
like what situation or need would cause them to use this method for contact?
Are these somehow directing pedophiles to specific areas for help or services?
Traffickers on the other hand would seem to have more specific instructions on where to go.

              If all of them participated, to one degree or another, it's a viable network to act as a support net for one of the world's most atrocious human rights violations.

              Those in the loop would know particular tells. Just think, if a whole network of programmers and logistic people existed, in an easily accessable format, one could plan trips around areas they know to be safe (for them)... one would be among their brethren.

              That's what I lean toward when I think of it in shady terms. I'm not completely sold on it, though. There'd have to be hard evidence to back it up. But if you've ever seen V for Vendetta, that part where Finch has his revelation about how things play out... it's like that. I can be wrong and I'm okay with being wrong. But when one stumbles across something that fits the idea of it being a front... well, as I said, I'm okay with being wrong. Poking mean critters with sticks is stupid. Observing from a distance however...

               I'd also look at the locations with regards to rail lines.  Don't forget that some of these businesses in industrial parks (like on PODESTA COVE in Memphis) may also have tracks where a car can be left, loaded, and sent on its way without issue.

             Many of these Joseph's Bistro locations seem to be in close proximity to the following: - Children (schools/parks) - Lawyers - Medical Establishments and practitioners - Busy Roads - Law Enforcement and Military

            The data points here are children and agents of the state. By association with children you get parents and nature. By association with the state you get protection and deity.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             If anything, I think we want it cleared up, as to why these odd listings exist. Joseph is a common enough name. But so is Dave, Tom, Mohammad, Mary, and John, or any freaking name from a religious text. Those names don't compare with Joseph, though.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Regarding religious associations you get Joseph the husband of Mary and Joseph the son of Jacob. With James the Just the name of James is the Anglicized form of the name of Jacob, so if you discard the doctrine of perpetual virginity and listen to writers like Origen and Epiphanus then you get James/Jacob the son of Joseph, the reverse paternal pair of the Joseph and Jacob of the patriarchs. A significant association with the name of Jacob is the great tribulation, or time of Jacob's trouble.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's the reverse doctrine of eating flesh of drinking blood, originally prohibited and part of a curse (eating the flesh of one's children), and yet later endorsed at least symbolically  as being a path to eternal life.

            Honestly, the subfolder theory was just
            <em>
             too heavily
            </em>
            pushed last night for me NOT to be suspicious of it. Oh, and you know, the fact that clearly there are a lot of these places that have absolutely nothing to do with a Joseph or anything like it. Also, after I started seeing that theory, I started looking at all the other business that I know exist and where they are located in my area, and they all checked out. On top of that, I didn't see any other fake businesses like the one at subject here. There are many reasons why the Joseph subfolder thing just
            <em>
             feels
            </em>
            like a distraction.

            Not sure if this is anything, but I found one at 5395 Polaris Ave, in Las Vegas. The street view of it shows Joseph's Properties. Looks a little shady.

            I was at a meeting today, and funny thing someone suggested eating at Subway.  NO WAY said I.  That place just makes me sick and that got me to thinking about Jared.  He just makes my stomach turn.  Somehow I don;t think it all came out about him.  I think there was way more to it than was discovered.  Maybe a connection with Sandusky or Hastert.  Slime Balls Stick Together.  Somehow they always seem to find each other.  Great Post  Upvoat4U

            Sent you some sbd. Did it work? Doesn't look like it, so I also sent minnowbooster to delegate SP. If that doesn't work, let me know. I think this is worthy of preservation.

             I got it and converted it, but my SP is so low that I can't do anything. Arg. Didn't get the delegated SP either.
