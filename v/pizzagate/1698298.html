            already posted, so I've been going through and trying to add some of the more pertinent details that are relevant to pedogate as a whole. I've archived sources when possible and linked directly to the sources when not. About half way through this list but it's by no means exhaustive, and I have to take a break for now. The layout's not the best and still thinking about what information is needed and where to direct attention to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Feel free to add it to to the top post. I'll try adding more names when I get a chance.

               Ingram originally immediately confessed and pleaded guilty, but has since maintained innocence, alleging his confessions were coerced, though this did not stand in court. The family were all members of a local Pentecostal church that promoted the idea that Satan could control the minds of Christians to commit crimes, then remove the memories after the fact. Psychologist Richard Ofshe, supporter of false memories, was involved in the case and came to the conclusion that Ingram's confessions were solely the result of extensive interrogation.

            Good idea. Least it does is convincing pepole, how widespread crimes like human trafficking or pedophilia are in society, including people in high positions. I think the article which was posted on voat about university professors being charged with these crimes was great and can serve as an eye-opener.

             Any government pedo is pizzagate.   Put Hastert on there, put Obama's secret service agent that plead guilty yesterday, put the CDC lady on there, put the Stockton Mayor on there.... THIS IS PIZZAGATE

            Where is it?  I mean a raw list,  each line a name, highest government position they held, age of victims, and that is it, no executive summary of evidence.... just a dumb simple list of convictions
