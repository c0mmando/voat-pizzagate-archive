People who did, he said, were “the friends, cousins and relatives of the devil”.</em></h2>
<p><strong>His remarks come as dozens of victims of clerical sexual abuse gathered in Rome ahead of an unprecedented Vatican summit on the issue.</strong> </p>
<p>In the lead-up to the four-day event, <strong>which begins on Thursday</strong> and which will be attended by about 180 bishops and cardinals, the victims have criticised the church’s failure to sufficiently address the issue so far.</p>
<p>The Vatican said it hoped that the meeting would mark a turning point. But people who had survived sexual abuse by priests said the church was nowhere close to confronting the deeply entrenched problem.</p>
<p>Peter Isley, spokesperson for <strong>Ending Clergy Abuse</strong>, an organisation that brings together activists from different countries, told reporters on Wednesday that the victims’ group would demand Pope Francis adopted zero tolerance measures for paedophiles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are two points,” Isley said. “Kicking out abusive priests and expelling the bishops and cardinals who covered them up. Resignations are not enough.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twelve victims met together with the organising committee of the summit on Wednesday afternoon. </p>
<p>One, Phil Saviano, whose revelations to Boston Globe journalists in 1992 led to a widespread investigation that exposed sex abuse by the clergy, gave a letter to the archbishop of Malta, Charles Scicluna, asking for the names of thousands of priests found guilty of child abuse. </p>
<p>“Peoples’ faith and trust in the Vatican is rapidly washing away,” he wrote in the letter.</p>
<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<p>Anne Barrett Doyle, from the US-based website <strong>BishopAccountability.org</strong>, told reporters in Rome that canon law had to be fundamentally changed so that it stopped “prioritising the priesthood of ordained men over the lives of children and vulnerable adults who are sexually assaulted by them”.</p>

             The two Popes before him weren't better either. And I'm afraid the next one will also be not better, only that he probably won't be a Globalist, but a conservative Pope.

            So here is a man from the Catholic Church, a place where almost every year news about pedo priests and their crimes come out and nothing changes. A Man from the Vatican, a place where its hall looks like the head of a giant serpent, from the
            <a href="https://files1.structurae.de/files/350high/1/826500/f1000009.jpg">

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            We know serpents symbolize deception. If you are about to construct a building that represents holiness and connection to the creator, there should be no room for interpretation. This is not a mistake. And it is not a mistake that the background with Jesus looks like a
            <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/06/2a/b1/062ab1859f139159ec981c921a9470d9.jpg">

            I wonder if the investigators of these pedo priest crimes ever find evidence connecting them to satanism. Because media never connects satanism with pedo priests.

             You know, I've seen these pictures dozens of times, and yet every time I look again and think how blatant it is. 
Don't rely on the media to connect much of anything to anything, they're complicit too, it's the best way to buy their silence.

              Fascists hate women and children. The vatican and church are  fascist whether all catholics know it or not. Look at the areas that are heavily catholic ..South America..etc. no birth control and no abortion...plenty of babies when you follow those guidelines. Our supreme court is catholic for the most part.

            Pope say critics of the Church are "Friends of the Devil" is so much hogwash. For me personally, I am NOT critical of the Church per se, but I do not believe the current pope is 1. A Catholic 2. A true Christian.
I am a critic of the fake pope and want to see him removed. That would be a huge step in getting my Catholic Religion back on track.

             The entire organisation is satanic. Completely apostate, doesn't teach the truth of the bible, has been involved in politics, wars , violence since its inception. Matthew 7v15-20 is so spot on.
