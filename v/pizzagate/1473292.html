            Getting redpilled means facing the reality of this world we find ourselves in today, especially those who rule us. Best thing that happened to me was being given the evidence for the activities on pizzagate. I am a scientically trained professional so I appreciate a trail of data wether pictures, tables, graphs and maps. Anything that i can analyse and look at so that I can form a conclusion. The worst thing is to have some shove things down your throat. Best thing is to say here is what evidence that may be relevant, what do you think? Then again, the average person has no critical thinking training as the are used to been spoon fed from birth. It is up to us with investigative skills and analytical mind to make info as digestible as possible to the masses.

             completely agree and eloquently echos my intention of the post - people need to be exposed and shocked by the main allegation/images and then once they see something strange and you stress the gravity of the issue, give them a list of the connected people to check for themselves if interested to see the other weird shit that all seemingly points in the same direction (maps , tables, graphs, videos , band/artists surrounded in this circle) and let people be smart and follow the trail themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's so much evidence and background to this story now that it's almost impossible to explain it correctly to someone while they are still taking you seriously (this is at least my experience with a good amount of ppl - although some have been receptive i do also get the response, "could definitely be possible politicians are dirty people, but who knows"

             i feel like making it extreme off the bat puts people off about it immediately. images have power, they just need to see. but i agree its pretty up there with the holocaust.

               is this a serious question? have you explained this theory to any co-workers or your boss? 
I understand the gravity of the situation, but do you think it would even be an issue if people were not already closed off to even the idea of this? They need the red pill, a casual or off the cuff discussion of this with someone unaware of the situation will go almost nowhere in most cases.

                I could, but it would ruin my day and everyone elses. Plus I'm waiting until the thing spreads overseas (the actual scandal that is) so that I at least look a little bit valid when I casually mention my worries of a childabuse epidemic.

               <p>
                Which is easy, it's on my mind a lot since finding out. That doesn;t mean I want to talk about it, and I dont', until it becomes relevant for me to do so, on this stretch of planet I reside.

                 you do realize that there is still the attempt/effort to discount this whole thing. we're on the internet it's already overseas. its on the tonight show. its on the front page of CNN. this development won't go much further unless people push the issue in order to help others see something is happening.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You basically answered my question - by not speaking about it you understand that the discussion will go nowhere and if anything people will be bummed out about it/discount it on some level.
