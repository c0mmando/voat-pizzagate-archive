<p>I read the comment below by a father, on the &quot;Pizzagate Exposed&quot; thread on Facebook.
It\'s in regard to this photo:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Oxr2O">http://archive.is/Oxr2O</a></p>
<p>When I looked up the name of the actress with &quot;Pizza&quot;  around her knit sweater\'s collar
 I found out the company which makes that Pizza collar sweater is called:</p>
<p>illumiknitiDesigns</p>
<p>They no longer offer that sweater; if you go to it, you hit a dead link.</p>
<p>But on their front page you see that all their products are for newborns and infants.</p>

<p>From a correspondent:
&quot; i had to share this picture&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Oxr2O">http://archive.is/Oxr2O</a> [I do not know how to embed images in my posts on Voat, but I would like to know how to]</p>
<p>Here is the note from the concerned Dad:</p>
<p>I was telling my daughter that i didn\'t approve of her watching Fuller House bc it was inappropriate. (I had just seen a video about the pedophile type behaviors in the original) i didn\'t tell her why...but i did mention that the Olsen twins weren\'t involved in the new show. A while later she showed me this promo picture..that is currently used bt Netflix. She said see, one of the twins is in it! ...as she pointed to the character of Kimmie Gibbler...I felt so sick inside...Look at the freakin collar on her dress!! And the way she\'s looking at the other girl...and the way the guy is looking at them both...Pizza right there in plain site!!
..sure seems obvious these sick stories are true. Time to drain the swamp called Hollywood..they are &quot;programming&quot; our children...sick bastards...I\'m so angry that they are so blatant!! I pray for those girls on the show.&quot;</p>
<p>Notice the Pizzas around the collar of the girl actress who has the TV Dad\'s hand on her shoulder in the new version of the &quot;Full House&quot; show &quot;Fuller House&quot; Illumiknit designs makes the sweater, but seemingly no other products advertised except for infants.  
</p>
<p>The original actresses for the early version of this show were the Olsen Twins. The Twins were featured in a gross nonsensical video on disgusting Pizza which is topped with chicken, and cream sauce. </p>

            Christmas shopping at the mall yesterday..Betsy Johnson has a pizza 🍕 slice purse out for Spring 2017--lovely...and then I saw children's footy pajamas with pics of pizza slices all over them. I felt sick. I'm so red pilled and so thankful for the work being done here.
