            "At the heart of collectivism is the idea that human beings are “blank slates;” that we are born empty and are completely dependent on our environment in order to learn what is right and wrong and how to be good people or good citizens.  The environment becomes the arbiter of decency, rather than conscience, and whoever controls the environment, by extension, becomes god." WE MUST remember that Immigrants and the Poor that are being forced to leave their countries because of violence and wars are being played just like we are.  They are doing what they need to do for themselves and their families to survive.  We must not fall prey to the lies of the elites to make us hate them.  For if we fall for their lies, they have won.

            When will John Podesta get his ass kicked by a group of pedo hating gangsters with baseball bats?  I'd love to see it filmed and uploaded.

            Molesta Podesta isn't just a pedo...he's a refugee importing globalist pedo. It really puts

            Between jobs some years ago I really needed a quick gig. Interviewed and was hired to register citizens to vote. 1st day on the job employer was a no-show. Two other new hires were also mad at being stood up. Complained to HQ Acorn in FL. Felt totally blown off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Employer called &amp; claimed he had been in a car accident. Obviously he was lying. He then claimed he'd make it up to me. I immediately asked for full reimbursement in cash for my transportation costs and time. He then stated I must be poor and offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I asked if he was trying "to sell me?" Then slammed down the phone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Complained again to FL Acorn with even more fury. Again blown off. Did get a call from a very nice woman who said he was indeed a pimp and that's the real reason he took the job. She said Acorn did not care at all either, although he used their $$$ to get from Vegas to FL, as well as housing &amp; food expenses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wished I had the ability to sue Acorn for FRAUD.
