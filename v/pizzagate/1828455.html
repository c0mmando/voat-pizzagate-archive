           Whether or not you believe in mediums, this is really interesting because it talks about police not being allowed to arrest rich men buying little girls, who are drugged, abused and kept in dungeons; and how there's a big market for little girls.

            I haven't read through all of this as yet, but just wanted to chime in to say that I've followed the Channeling Erik website for a few years now and have read both of her books. I know people are going to have mixed opinions based on the fact that this involves a belief in mediums, the afterlife, etc. I'll just say that I am a very rational minded individual and I previously didn't really buy into the concept of mediums. I do now.
           </p>
           <p>
            The medium who works with the Channeling Erik website also did an "afterlife interview" with Madeleine McCann:

             You have to either have your head in the sand, or be extremely partisan and look at these types of things as an attack your political party (even though both parties are involved).

            I do believe in Mediums because there is a Clairvoyant in my immediately family. It's very frustrating, despite the open minds here and Reddit it's hard to share information I've come across this way.... and I do have information about this case, as well as more about JP. Just can't source it.
           </p>

            And yes, according to my source. Maddie was taken by both Podesta brothers to be used by their 'clients' for sex.

            <p>
             That's possible especially since John Podesta's emails were deleted from around that time. But I think it's not an open and shut case implicating the Podestas. Please take a look at Richard Hall's 2 documentaries about the case. The Podesta's may be involved but only to act as "red-herrings" to distract. Where have we heard of that being done before?

             To move up the pyramid, members must take huge risks to prove loyalty and worth. I also firmly believe both Podesta's were tasked with Maddie's 'abduction'.  But it was staged.  I believe the parents sold Maddie and the Podestas acted as delivery men.
