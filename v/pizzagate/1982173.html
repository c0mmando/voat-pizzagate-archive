            I'm of a different opinion.  I would consider us in the "intelligence preparation for the battlefield" (IPB) phase of this war.  We have identified the threat, the enemy and put a name on it (Deep State, Pedo State, etc.).  Now, what is happening is people are building their "targeting packages" and develop their plans for the pending "war".  The rolling up of all of the low-level pedos the last 6 months is equivalent to rounding up all of the known commie or Nazi sympathizers in the last century preceding a world war or major conflict.
           </p>
           <p>
            Politics and public opinion is what is playing out right now.  The MSM is running their propaganda machines at full tile - in the red.  But they have a seriously flawed actor - CNN - who is giving millions their initial doses of red pill.  Confronting people at this stage will send them running back to the safety of their echo chambers.  They need to be spoonfed this information. It should feel like it was their own realization/awakening.  If you try to put it in their face, they will run.
           </p>
           <p>
            I cannot recall the exact "law", but it essentially says that the tipping point for belief in a conspiracy theory is somewhere around 10% of the populace.  We are not there yet.  But it is building.
           </p>
           <p>
            IMO, we are still in the phase which requires guerilla tactics - websites, slamming comments on MSM, flyers, business cards, PR stunts....anything to raise awareness.  Hell, if anyone is going to NYC with the family this year, write "PIZZAGATE IS REAL" on a piece of paper and slap it to the window behind the MSM live broadcasts in the morning.  Be creative.
           </p>
           <p>
            There will be plenty of time for F2F interaction in the not-too-distant future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Fact: Talmudist have been doing this for centuries, even with our level of awareness this might not be enough and we may have to take action " - Not a fact.  13 million Jews on this planet and you think they control the other 8.5 billion people on this planet from their evil lair about the size of the state of NJ?  God, you are gullible if you believe that.

            I think if more of us would organize locally...to just show up somewhere with pizzagate/pedogate signs and informative flyers...much like Pizzagate Howie does....it would help to spread the word. So many people still rely only on the MSM fakenews....so they are totally in the dark regarding pizzagate. Also, i really think it is wrong and self defeating to point the finger at "the JEWS". Let's face it, pedophiles exist among all people. They are Christians (think of the VATICAN fer cryin out loud!) , Muslims and Jews. They are of every race, creed and color. So knock it off....and let's work together to rid of EVIL behavior by ALL... instead of a select group. Even if the top layer is composed of "Jews"...those who go along with the pedo program are every bit as guilty.
           </p>
           <p>
            So..on Twitter and other social media we should start organizing Pizzagate Info Rallies on a local level. Example: Come to the #Pizzagate Info Rally infront of the CNN building, in downtown wherever at noon, on Saturdaay...or every Saturday...in hopes the rally will grow each week. 
I really think pizzagate will go no where fast if we wait for our pedo infested and compromised government officials to do the job. 
Get on twitter and facebook to get people to show up. Pizzagate Howie has shown us how to do it.

            Comments are appreciated and interesting...I do think this is a good idea, maybe just a bit early.  I think alot of what needs to happen is happening right between our ears as we make decisions based on our collective future.  That being said, it may come to action and trying to think of ways we can meet up.  Hell, it would be fun to grab a beer with a group of you, but also realize that that might not be safe right now.

            We're dealing with the side effects of propaganda and the resultant cognitive dissonance. The inability for people to rationally process new and life-view changing information. Again: this is the power of propaganda. A trusted source reinforcing a falsehood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why?
It keeps people pacified and controllable. They aren't steering their own ship anymore. Its been pirated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every one of you reading this has re-taken the ship however.   At some point, when the facts simply cannot be denied anymore, your brain decided it was in fact better to accept the change in ideology.  (What was your wake-up moment? Share it.)
           </p>
           <p>
            People are waking. We will hit critical mass. It's not done.
           </p>
           <p>
            How much did you wake up?
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people drop right down the rabbit hole. Others just see the entrance. At least they acknowledge it. Be patient and insist on facts. FACTS are the best antidote.
           </p>
           <p>
            Heres your red-pill warning: they have to conquer grief and anger to break out.. Guess who it gets directed at initially? The ugly fact is you're going to make people who can't swallow the pill not happy with you. Be prepared.

             You ain't kidding either.  They couldn't (and still can't) even digest the fact that Trump is POTUS.  It is good that the talk of Russia, dossiers, taxes, Flynn, etc. are all fading into the sunset.  They are running out of plays in their book.
