            , the support for your headline stating "3M has a patent for adrenochrome" is not actually linked in this submission per Rule 2. Also, after clicking through several submissions to find it, the patent documents -- if I'm reading them correctly -- don't actually support the headline. 3M let the patent expire in 1997:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             1997-05-06 FP Expired due to failure to pay maintenance fee  Effective date: 19970226
            </p>
            <p>
             2018-01-23 STCH Information on status: patent discontinuation
            </p>
            <p>
             Free format text: PATENT EXPIRED DUE TO NONPAYMENT OF MAINTENANCE FEES UNDER 37 CFR 1.362
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Expired patents are no longer "owned" by their originator. According to
            <a href="https://www.upcounsel.com/petition-to-revive-abandoned-patent-application">
             these legal advisors
            </a>
            , reviving an abandoned patent after more than two years is very very difficult.
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore, it's not clear what the pizzagate thesis for this whole submission is; i.e. Trump using the Defense Production Act to force 3M to make masks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since you can't edit this headline, and I've seen this misinformation being passed around on Twitter the past few days, I am going to give this the "Possible Disinformation" flair so people know the premise asserted in the headline is wrong and hopefully stop spreading it.

             Look at Vindicator’s Twitter account. Santa is Satan and he is making a list, no different than Infowars has been for years. The last moderators were caught blackmailing members. Voat is a honeypot. These clowns go round and round disclosing some things to appear on the good side. Q lied to everyone. Your families are not safe. Donald Trump is friends with the Clintons and Jeff Epstein. He married his daughter to Kushner. He allowed 5G to be installed all over America. The Trump Tower is a symbol for Satan worship. It goes on and on. Trust the plan means to sit back while they murder those who might have stood against them. They have until Easter Sunday. Soon everyone will know what is really happening.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trust Sessions. Trust the plan. It is working out so well.

             Michigan Sues 3M, DuPont over ‘Forever’ Chemical Contamination in Water

            <p>
             Michigan on Jan. 14 sued 3M, DuPont and other companies for financial damages from contamination caused by potentially harmful “forever” chemicals that are turning up in drinking water across the industrial state.

             The lawsuit filed in state court alleges that 17 defendants deliberately concealed the dangers of a class of substances known collectively as PFAS. The filing, announced by state Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Grethen Whitmer, came a year-and-a-half after former Gov. Rick Snyder first stated Michigan’s intent to sue Minnesota-based 3M and other unnamed parties.

            <p>
             Team Rubicon formed in January 2010 following the Haiti earthquake, when William McNulty and Jacob "Jake" Wood[2][4] led a medical team into Port-au-Prince three days after the earthquake. The first Team Rubicon was an initial team of eight. They gathered funds and medical supplies from friends and family and flew into the Dominican Republic. They rented a truck, loaded their gear, and headed west to Haiti. The team treated thousands of patients, traveling to camps deemed “too dangerous” by other aid organizations. They ventured outside the traditional scale of disaster response, focusing on those who would be overlooked, untreated.

             In 2013,
             <strong>

Honoré, USA (Ret.) as well as private sector business people Andy Bessette from Travelers Insurance, Jeff Dailey, CEO of Farmers Group, Gregg Lemkau from Goldman Sachs, John Pitts from Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Richard Serino, former Deputy Administrator of FEMA, and Jeff Smith from FedEx serve as advisors to Team Rubicon. Many are former military or have logistical expertise that helps guide Team Rubicon

            <p>
             Additional high-profile supporters are former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.[28][29] Former President Bush included Team Rubicon as one of the case studies of as part of its research on veteran serving nonprofits (VSNP).

After all, if it was as big a rabbit hole as touted, then the rest of Agnes Nixon's children must play a part, no? So when I dd the search for Agnes Nixon's children, the name of Mary Nixon came up..It turned out that Mary's married name was Hiltbrand and the first place I saw it was in an article on a fundraiser for DISADVANTAGED KIDS and the FOSTER CARE SYSTEM.

              I thought that this would be a fun picture to share since our guest speaker Brad Schallert from the World Wildlife Fund gave Sir Richard Branson and the NGO he founded in DC, the Carbon War Room, a shout out during our most recent class. I interned for the CWR last school year and had the opportunity to sit in on a meeting with Richard Branson in March 2012.

                Interesting. Many years ago now, I had a group very much like Black Cube harassing me following me, breakins, even late night calls and death threats. Sadly at the time,no one took my claims serious. Not until the tactics revealed by Weinstein's women and what Ronan Farrow dug up was anyone willing to listen. In the beginning it was all middle  eastern men (Mossad?)  but they were very well organized and yes, like a secret army. There is more than one company that does this besides Black Cube like K2 or Kroll and Kaspersky Lab. I was on the receiving end and believe me, it is no fun. You honestly think people are out to kill you.3 safety box breakins as well, from banks.I couldn't even tell anyone back then, they would think I was nuts.In my experience they work in tandem with security firms like Wakenhut. Serpiseserprise though, that it means Saturn.These scum are evil

             That facility has over 200 researchers in it and has a clinic and psychiatric hospital for children associated with it. Nominally it is a University Research center devoted to the study of childhood mental illness. However, the clients come for minor problems like learning disabilities, and attention deficit and leave as multiples without their parents knowing. The clinic only takes “high functioning” children -- not schizophrenics, or cerebral palsy kids. Unsurprisingly, the Rockefellers, and the Carnegies are major funders of it...

              Shipwrecked on Ten Islands with Clintons &amp; Branson

             Bill Clinton was recently in Saint Lucia celebrating the new solar farm that the Clintons were instrumental in erecting. Who knew that the Clintons and Richard Branson were spearheading a renewable energy project across the entire Caribbean known as the ‘Ten Island Challenge’, locking in every island, forming a perimeter around all their favorite places, such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Aruba, Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Kenya, and Tanzania? If one didn’t know better, isn’t that the route drug traffickers and child traffickers utilize? It could just be a coincidence, but it sure is an interesting pattern. ...
            </p>
            <p>
             ..This was a very strategically thought-out plan that involves governments, politicians, the billionaire clan, power companies, and one of the biggest shipping industry companies in the world. What the heck would they have to do with renewable energy? A lot. In this open-sourced investigation, you will see the timeline, the shipmates, and how it all connects. You will see how it all manifested and possibilities as to where it is headed.
            </p>
            <p>
             After reviewing multiple sources citing the islands they have contracted with, it is clear that there are more than just “Ten Islands”. One source involved with the project reflects 10, while another reflects 13, and the Norwegian government claims there are contracts with 21 islands. Yes, the Norwegian government has a vested interest in this project as well. Below are two maps reflecting the majority of the islands that have been cited by most of those involved. It may not include all of the islands, as the “ten islands” were a test pilot for them to acquire additional contracts with other islands.

              Also note, San Adrés and Providencia are Colombian islands

             ...One island that seldom sees hurricane damage is Aruba. Interestingly, Aruba has always been known to be a major cocaine hub for trans-shipment to the United States. Despite this, in 1999, when Bill Clinton was president, Aruba was removed from the U.S. State Department’s list of major drug producing and transit countries. According to the case study posted on the World Bank’s website, the reason for the decline is “unclear”. Curious.

             According to this Case Study:
             <em>
              Drug Trafficking and The Netherlands Antilles
             </em>
             , they clearly indicate that the Caribbean countries are geographically positioned in the world’s largest drug transit zone.

            <p>
             The Caribbean is not just a drug trafficking hub, it is also a child trafficking and sex trafficking hub.... Aside from the well-known Pentagon scandal from 2007 where numerous military officials and defense contractors were subscribing to child pornography on Pentagon computers, just this month a NASA contractor, Anthony Joseph Culotta Jr. was arrested on child pornography charges.  What makes this story so alarming is that he has worked at the Kennedy Space Center Launch Services Program since 2004, and in 2018 he was found using his NASA-issued laptop computer to search for, view, and possess sexually explicit images of children. What’s worse, is of the over 1,000 images found, there were images of known victims previously identified by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

             Stephens benefited from the firings at the DOJ by moving to Honeywell and then Raytheon while the Clinton Foundation benefitted by accepting money from these two companies beyond the normal scope of lobbying. That is exactly what the Clinton Foundation is designed to do and it is illegal. The Clinton Foundation is a clone of the American Security Council Foundation, run by miners, that traded political influence for money. The Bush family had a similar political trade machine, though they did a better job of obscuring it by using more than just one central foundation to coordinate.

             I have to say, of all the Voat channels doing research into this stuff, this one is the most in depth.  Less speculation and just using phrases and more actual uncovering the connections I confess I don’t do enough and more just lurk. But I find your stuff the most intriguing and enlightening. Sounds like 3M is a key player in all this, and now Trump calling them out and taking reigns. Serious sauce here.
