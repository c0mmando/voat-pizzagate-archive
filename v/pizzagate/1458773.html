            You can't tell from the very beginning what is and what isn't a real lead. Even police detectives have to check out something before they decide that it's a false lead. Any attempt to prejudge what is relevant could harm the investigation.

            Yes. Upvoted as people are going off on wild goose chases and witch hunts that devalue the true issues. People need to use logic. If you believe it to be a lead but can't confirm... make it VERY clear.

            The hacking is a joke and the "secret menu"
Saw a thread about a MeetUp group
I still believe the basement for Comet to be a dead end but we continue to hammer it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis
Podesta
Clinton
then all known associates and link them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Too many wild tangents that distract from the core.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at how many businesses in that square block have pedophilia symbolism. 4.... 5? That is where the focus should be. Tie all those owners and associates. Not random fucking meetup groups. So frustrating.
