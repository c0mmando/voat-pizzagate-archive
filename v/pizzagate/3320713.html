<p>June 25, 2019 (Everyday for Life Canada) — A child pornography ring operating in Toronto was busted this week by Toronto police. The computer servers were housed in a building in North York. It\'s frightening to think that families live in a neighbourhood while this evil and demonic activity was routinely taking place.</p>
<p>The worldwide Internet service made hardcore child pornography available to customers for a fee. The police referred to the activities as a &quot;big box store&quot; and described the computer files as &quot;really, really horrific.&quot;</p>
<p>In total there were servers with a capacity of 1,000 terabytes. That is huge. The number of global registered users was nearly 60,000, but only 12,000 have been identified. The operation reached 116 countries and the number of pornographic files uploaded was close to 400,000. The 19,000 child pornographic files were downloaded 19,000,000 times. Canada had 331 users, America 2,027 and Europe 3,806.</p>
<p>What a horrible and sickening story. It\'s demonic in nature and scope. In Canada alone, there were 331 people involved. How can any police force investigate that many individuals? They can\'t. </p>
<p>And remember that the figure comes from the 12,000 identified users. But in all there were 60,000. Most of them will never be investigated or charged. Just think of the number of victims that are out there. These are lives in Canada and the world that will only know pain, abuse and suffering.</p>
<p>The police investigation is one thing but there is another important question that needs to be asked: why is this sexual evil so widespread in our society? Why sexually attack and victimize children who are innocent and know nothing about sex? These questions have no simple answer. </p>
<p>However, we have managed to hyper-sexualize our society over the last two generations, starting with the sexual revolution. Many have pushed for every sexual orientation and pleasure to be normalized. The United Nations and our public schools are doing the same thing. It\'s all about &quot;inclusive and diversity&quot; education. </p>
<p>There is a fallout in promoting a sexualized society without limits. Children too get sexualized. They get hurt and abused. We need to protect children from being over-sexualized and exploited.</p>
<p>Five men have been arrested in Toronto and the police are looking for another suspect. Here\'s the Ontario Provincial Police talking about what they describe as a &quot;monstrous child porn bust.&quot; </p>
<p>And we should never forget what Matthew 18:6 teaches about this evil: &quot;If anyone causes one of these little ones — those who believe in me — to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.&quot;</p>',

            Isaiah 45:7 King James Version.
I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and
            <strong>
             <strong>
              create evil
             </strong>

            Numbers 31:17 King James Version.
17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, for all you brain-dead motherfuckers, of which there are many here, your bible plainly states that your god is responsible for evil and commanded his followers to kill every living thing in sight in Midian, except for the young, virgin pussy to be kept for themselves.

             The wording of the Old Testament is of Jewish origin with the New Testament more aligned to Christian beliefs:
            </p>
            <p>
             ." The Old Testament is essentially the Jewish Bible, or Tanakh, with some minor variations. It includes religious law, historical narratives, wisdom literature and prophetic writings."http://www.religionfacts.com/old-testament

            <p>
             " Judaism believes that the Jewish Scriptures, often referred to as the Old Testament,[1] are the inspired word of God.   Jews can never accept Jesus as the Messiah, and why Jews must reject claims that the New Testament is infallible and divinely inspired."https://www.jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/why-jews-cannot-accept-the-new-testament/

            "The police investigation is one thing but there is another important question that needs to be asked: why is this sexual evil so widespread in our society? Why sexually attack and victimize children who are innocent and know nothing about sex? These questions have no simple answer." Would guess satan worship is # 1 answer. ...despite decades of going to church too often, this subject did not come up. But I learned about it from reading about , not God, but politics.......(2) great blackmail for politicians....nobody but nobody likes to be thought of as a pedophile.
