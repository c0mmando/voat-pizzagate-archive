            Wheres the direct relation to pizzagate per rule #1? There's no cite directly correlating to pgate but it stays while other threads that state it directly and using a thread that existed from the main page to begin with. MF MAKES NO SENSE.
           </p>
           <p>
            See, I have no problem with this thread because I understand the breadth and scope of pizzagate and think threads like these should stay and be discussed, I just have a problem with millennial faggot deleting threads that are more than relevant to the discussion. Dude has abused his authority and a voat needs to be taken to have him demoted.

             I feel it easily meets rule 1 as it deals with people in power engaging in child sexual exploitation-- organized, with a group of offenders.  I hear your frustration though, I've had many many posts deleted by mods

             Former NYPD Police Officer Sentenced To 66 Months In Prison For Conspiring To Engage In Sex Trafficking Of A Minor
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Earlier today, at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, former New York City Police Department officer Eduardo Cornejo was sentenced to 66 months in prison, five years of supervised release, and sex offender registration, following his September 21, 2016 guilty plea to conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.  Cornejo was ordered to pay $5,000 in forfeiture.  The sentence was imposed by United States District Judge Brian M. Cogan.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sentence was announced by Bridget M. Rohde, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and James P. O’Neill, Commissioner, NYPD.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Cornejo conspired to engage in the sex trafficking of a 16-year-old girl during his off-duty time, a violation of his oath to protect the community and uphold the law,” stated Acting United States Attorney Rohde.  “Together with our law enforcement partners, this Office will continue to address and bring to justice those who occupy positions of trust at any level and who engage in criminal conduct.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “The subject in this case used information he knew from being a sworn member of law enforcement to elude officers who would know he was doing something illegal,” stated Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney.  “He was aware of the laws, and continued to break them even after being arrested.  We wear badges as law enforcement to serve and protect our communities, not to endanger and exploit children for financial gain.”
           </p>
           <p>
            According to court documents, then-NYPD police officer Cornejo engaged in an interstate prostitution scheme that involved at least 10 different women.  Cornejo transported the women to motels throughout the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Long Island, often immediately upon completing a tour of duty with the NYPD.  Judicially authorized interceptions of communications inside Cornejo’s vehicle confirmed the illegal purpose of his activities.  For example, Cornejo stated, “The girls is at the [a motel] so it nice and clean, it’s picking up now it was alright last night.”  Soon thereafter, he stated, “That might make it hot though, standing outside with a bunch of girls. . . . [Members of law enforcement] going to know what’s up real quick.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In January 2016, members of law enforcement observed that at least one of the women transported by Cornejo (“Jane Doe”) appeared to be particularly young.  Concerned about the possibility that Cornejo might be trafficking a minor, members of law enforcement interviewed Jane Doe shortly after members of law enforcement observed Cornejo transport her to a motel.  Jane Doe presented an identification document reflecting that she had turned 18 years old approximately two months earlier.  Further investigation revealed that Cornejo began transporting Jane Doe to participate in prostitution activity when she was just 16 years old and that she engaged in commercial sexual acts at Cornejo’s direction.  In his post-arrest statement, Cornejo confirmed that he had transported Jane Doe for numerous months with the intent that she engage in prostitution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cornejo has been in custody since August 10, 2016, when Judge Cogan revoked Cornejo’s bond.  After his arrest and release on bond, Cornejo had been continuing to promote prostitution by driving multiple women to motels throughout the New York metropolitan area.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s Public Integrity Section.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander A. Solomon is in charge of the prosecution. "
