<p>Relevance to Pizzagate:</p>
<p>Government contractors have been implicated in child rape and sex trafficking.  There might be better examples than those listed below, just trying to establish relevance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dyncorp was implicated in &quot;prostituting&quot; children:</p>

<p>Also:</p>
<p>….the Obama administration cannot locate thousands of the 90,000 (and counting) migrant children it welcomed into the United States beginning in summer 2012.  What’s worse, the Department of Health and Human Services found itself so unable to manage the influx of illegal immigrants that this policy effectively resulted in the U.S. government facilitating child slavery, including sex slavery.</p>

<p>(2015) At least 3,400 sponsors -- about 12% of 29,000 listed in a government database -- had criminal histories that included domestic violence, homicide, child molestation, sexual assault and human trafficking, the whistle-blower told Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next five largest contracts were given to MVM for UAC transportation, which range from $20 million to $9 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What I found on MVM:</strong></p>
<p>MVM provided security to the Washington DC Public School System:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/MVM">https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/MVM</a>,_Inc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MVM donated to HRC and former running mate Tim Kaine:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Allegations against MVM include misconduct, reckless behavior, and poor training, procedures and equipment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They couldn\'t keep track of their equipment, they didn\'t have an accounting system for it, they couldn\'t get their bills paid.&quot; The 15-year CIA protective-services veteran added, &quot;In my opinion, they were putting people in harm\'s way out there...”</p>
<p>But Mr. Marquez [MVM\'s owner] acknowledged that MVM, along with its rivals, has had personnel problems.
&quot;Every contractor has a harder time finding these qualified people,&quot; he says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Oys8U">http://archive.is/Oys8U</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>MVM lost the bulk of its CIA contract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MVM was regularly 10 to 15 guards short of the 100 or so it promised.  The lack of guards required the agency to postpone missions, one former manager said</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/0uiB5">http://archive.is/0uiB5</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>I wonder who MVM has watching the children as MVM has so many issues -- and they don’t even seem to care about protecting (certain?) CIA agents?</em></strong></p>

           Allegations against MVM include misconduct, reckless behavior, and poor training, procedures and equipment:

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "They couldn't keep track of their equipment, they didn't have an accounting system for it, they couldn't get their bills paid." The 15-year CIA protective-services veteran added, "In my opinion, they were putting people in harm's way out there...”
           </p>
           <p>
            But Mr. Marquez [MVM's owner] acknowledged that MVM, along with its rivals, has had personnel problems.
"Every contractor has a harder time finding these qualified people," he says.
