<p>Really Comey? No such thing as absolutely privacy?

            Comey held the line. For all the recent efforts the FBI has done like the Norway bust, they are still only going after low-level operators. They are not going after the ringleaders in government. The FBI has the Dennis Hastert tapes and they would rather hold the evidence than let the house of cards fall down. The government won't prosecute itself. While the NSA knows whats going on, a compromised FBI and Justice department will lead to no arrests. It should be very worrying that Trump kept him on.

            In what universe does this make any sense?  Comey would not recommend bringing charges against Hillary Clinton and handed immunity out like candy.  So why would he now bring charges against any elite for "pizzagate" related crimes?
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no explanation except delusion that one would expect Comey to recommend any charges against anyone for "pizzagate"...and THAT is why he is still director of the FBI.

             If we are to believe those who claim to be "insiders" - yeah, that seems to be the consensus. From FBIAnon/DHS Anon (Via Victurus), to Robert D. Steele to Steve Pieczenik, Roger Stone and Erik Prince... each of these individuals has come forward to claim that insiders have told them that all of this evidence exists.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either that it was all pre-existing and historically monitored/recorded, or that it was recently unveiled on the Weiner/Abedin laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
             So. Two possibilities. They are ALL lying or this is truly being withheld with an incredibly strong gag order in place applied to anyone that has seen it/knows where it is.
            </p>
            <p>
             Personally? As a father. If I had access to information like this (FBI, NYPD, DHS, etc.) I would not be so cowardly as to protect it. I would go straight to Wikileaks and make the world a better place. Even if that means I would be their final snuff film, at least I would know that my kids and their kids would live a safer life.

              You don't need wikileaks to do that, that actually might be counter-productive considering they have been compromised.

               So you think the 1% released of Vault7 thus far was intentionally done by the CIA?

                 Personally, I think the Vault7 stuff is way too damaging for the CIA to have released it intentionally.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There seems to be a relatively high likelihood that Wikileaks is intentionally slowing their releases to comply with a larger, coordinated effort. The evidence of this goes all the way back to Assange's press conference. Remember he said he had the goods on HRC? He was alluding to a massive leak specific to Clinton &amp; Co.
                </p>
                <p>
                 However, when this webcast went live, he was visibly nervous and basically shared nothing at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do think "they" got to him... but I think "they" are two prong. First, we have the Deep State enemies of the people, likely threatening/DDOS'ing/Cutting his internet... and Second, I think that true patriots from within the FBI/CIA may be working covertly with Assange to ensure that he doesn't leak too much, too soon, as it could* jeopardize their ability to cut the heads off of the hydra all at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Remember, if the cards are played too early and evidence is poured without having the proper groundwork laid - a lot of people implicated could flee, go into hiding, off themselves, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 At least this is what I am hoping for.

            The nerve he had trying to recruit more FBI agents. Until the 2-tiered justice system is removed, the FBI is only going to bring down the small fish, while the big fish gain more power. Why would anyone want to work for that?

            YOU won't have privacy so that WE can do what we want. That is the subtext here.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the issue of privacy will soon be subsumed by the issue of censorship. Because I don't care if they know I know. But they care that I do.
           </p>
           <p>
            The issue of privacy is just a stepping stone to the issue of free speech. Twas always thus.

             It wouldn't be this way if the righteous didn't have so much patience with these demons.
            </p>
            <p>
             They could all easily be
             <strong>
              crushed
             </strong>
             if the people's wrath was unleashed.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact,  I think their arrogance is
             <strong>
              itself
             </strong>
             a sign that the righteous are holding back.

              Careful now... haha, that's some dangerous verbiage. We really could never even come close to justifying any kind of "wrath" at the moment. Everything is still circumstantial. And unless you are willing to uproot your life, embed yourself in an organization involved, obtain information that can be used as concrete evidence - I'm afraid the only tool you have is information/internet access.
             </p>
             <p>
              Any form of wrath should be withheld, under all circumstances, unless:
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               <p>
                We all have access to concrete evidence that implicates elite/politicians are involved in this... AND
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                The legal system fails to pursue/prosecute these individuals based on verified evidence
               </p>
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              If circumstance turns to fact and these people are not held accountable... by all means, we shall drain the swamp ourselves.
