<p><strong>Court prevents father from preserving son\'s gender identity</strong></p>
<p>DALLAS (ChurchMilitant.com) - A Texas mother is pushing her young son to change his gender, and the boy\'s father is powerless to stop her.</p>
<p>Six-year-old James Younger is at the center of a custody battle pitting Anne Georgulas against the boy\'s father, Jeffrey Younger.</p>
<p>In the years since, Georgulas has been forcing James to undergo &quot;social transition&quot; therapy, steering him toward chemical castration and gender reassignment. She dresses him as a girl and calls him by the name &quot;Luna.&quot; She enrolled James in school as a girl; though school officials know &quot;Luna&quot; is actually a boy, his classmates do not.</p>
<p>When James is with his mother, he obediently adopts the &quot;Luna&quot; persona. But whenever he is with his father, James rejects the feminine identity his mother imposes on him, reverting to his masculine identity and choosing to live as a boy. </p>
<p>&quot;James violently refuses to wear girl\'s clothes at my home,&quot; Younger told Walt Heyer, a former transgender and founder of Sex Change Regret.</p>
<p>Heyer, an expert in transgender issues, believes James has been misdiagnosed as gender dysphoric. In a Nov. 26 article for The Federalist, Heyer explained the boy doesn\'t fit the criteria for the condition:</p>
<p>The criteria for a diagnosis of childhood gender dysphoria are that a child be persistent, consistent, and insistent about being the opposite sex. ... Under the skilled eyes of the therapist, the child was presented two pieces of paper, one with the word &quot;James&quot; and one with the word &quot;Luna,&quot; and asked to pick the name he preferred. When the appointment only included his mother, James selected Luna, the name and gender he uses at his mother\'s home and in his first-grade classroom. When the appointment was only with his father, however, James pointed to the boy name James, not the girl name.</p>
<p>The glaring disparity between a child\'s preferred identity when in the presence of one parent versus the other should cause a therapist to reassess, perhaps nullify the diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and terminate any steps toward transition. But in the case of James, this hasn\'t happened.</p>
<p>Younger is trying to protect his son from Georgulas\' gender reassignment efforts, but his fight has been hampered by court order.</p>
<p>Georgulas has charged Younger with &quot;child abuse&quot; for refusing to affirm James as transgender. She has sought restraining orders against him and has petitioned the court to terminate his parental rights.</p>
<p>The court is requiring Younger to pay for James\' transgender &quot;therapy&quot; and future sexual mutilation. It is preventing Younger from dressing his son as a boy at school, from teaching him that he is a boy and from teaching him Christian precepts on sexuality and gender. </p>
<p>James will be eligible under Texas law for hormonal sterilization — chemical castration — in two years.</p>
<p>Younger faces a lopsided fight to preserve his son\'s identity, as Georgulas enjoys financial backing in her effort to alter it. Younger\'s supporters have set up a website to cover the case: SaveJames.com as well as a GoFundMe page to help him with legal expenses.</p>

            "I founded Dallas Rainbow Counseling in 2011, with the hope of creating a bat-signal like beacon for the LGBT community, so that you would know there was a safe space where you can go to therapy without fear of judgement for just being you. My passion for this community, combined with my solution focused approach &amp; ability to connect with clients is what sets me apart from other therapists in this area."

             I think once people realize that this is becoming a real thing that they will hugely protest.  Before it spreads like wildfire.  The sad thing is, how many will be maimed for life.  They don't care.  They just want their sick normalization programs.  I can't believe that THEY really believe in this stuff unless they are totally demented.    We can spread the word with friends and relatives and by posting on here when we see articles.  I am going to send this to a couple of friends.

             At a lack for a better word, yes she is a mother.  And a Pediatrician.  Hard to believe but true.  This Child would have been better off to have been born into a dirt poor family than this Monstrous Moronic Mother.

            This is exactly what the wealthy funders of the trans cult like Pritzinger and Soros want--for as many kids as possible to be transitioned.  This little boy doesn't suffer gender dysphoria when he's with his dad. This could be a case of Munchausen by proxy. These drugs will have irreversible effects on this child.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people who know the truth are those who have de-transitioned. They find out that surgery doesn't make them a woman (or man) and doesn't cure them of gender  dysphoria. Suicide rates among those who have transitioned are the same as those pre-transition.

             Yes, I believe the transgenders are committing suicides because when they realize their mistake, how can they live with this.  The link and site for Sex Change Regret that I posted is a very good one and has much info in it about people that have had these horrid regrets.  So very heart breaking.  The medical community (Frankensteins comes to mind) are guilty of creating some horrid monsters for monetary profit.  It will be the crime of the century imo. Our poor Children.

              This is my first comment in a while. This story hits close to home. Thankfully my older kids don't wanna be like their sicko dad. The court systems here will most likely award custody to the mother. I recently experienced the full extent of what is possible and there's no hope for the normal parent when one is into tranny stuff. It's like the court gets off on it. A local attorney I consulted with told me trannies are not that bad to the court any more. She's a republican and friends with a long time congressman in the area. Between that and the other attorneys who seem to exist only to collect money and adopt children via CPS to steal them from poor parents, this dad's best hope is to oppose the transgender thing and keep access to his kid. He'll be lucky to get out of this without maximum damage.

               When they're middle-aged transitioners like Jenner it's because of a fetish. Normal sex doesn't cut it any more for them. They get turned on by the idea of themselves as woman. They could limit their fetish to private in-home wearing women's knickers once, but in middle age that's not enough.

               Thank you for your response.  I am hopeful but that's just me and praying.  I know that it could also go the other way especially with her connections with the medical field and politically.  This is a very sad case indeed but Thank God that father is a real fighter and he has people willing to fight with him.  Yes, some transgenders have mental issues, but some like this boy, have parents that are pushing the gender ideology for whatever reason.  That is the sad part.  The mental issue I believe can be easier to fix than a sick and perverted parent.

                 The sickest part is that the pope is spreading his garbage telling someone about how they were given their sexuality before they were born.  I just wanted to scream my head off.  The are teaching these lies in school during sex classes as well I am sure.  If not coming right out with it, they will strongly suggest it.  This stuff makes me so sick. I don't know where all this will end.  People need to fight back.

            First, I can't believe this has two down votes. Really? It is a tragic tale of this little boy who has been, and is being brainwashed by his mother. She is encouraging her son to feel this way. Notice when he is with the father he still relates to being a boy. Sadly, I feel there is no escape from this for him as long as his mother is a major influence in his life. I noticed she has two older children, and two younger  ones, including him. I wonder how the older children feel about this? I know if I lived in that area, and she was my Pediatrician, she wouldn't be once I knew about this. I hope parents pull their children from her practice.

             The sad thing is that the other Children will be messed up too.  This charade she is mastering will affect them horribly but she doesn't care.  This Gender Push seems to be more important than the Children she gave birth to.   I think spreading this on social media would be the way to go.  As you say, Mothers need to pull their Children from her care.  Can you even imagine such a thing, that your Child's Dr. is all over the internet because SHE wants her  son to be a girl.  I can't even.

              I feel sorry for the other children, esp the younger one. Something is really off about this whole thing. I want to know if the two younger ones are adopted. I hope word gets out about her doing this. Texas is not that progressive yet. I believe many parents would not agree with what she is doing.

               Vindicator said he found that the father is a former transgender.  I wouldn't doubt it now, because this whole story is beyond belief. I too believe that if the people of Texas find out about this, well, Katie Barr the Door.

                 Yes, I hope people figured that out.  It was late and I didn't realize what it really meant until later and hope others did too.  This whole thing is horrid.  I want to do a thing on Gender Ideology and how they are giving puberty blockers without approval.  They are really getting parents to do  Tavistock experiments on their Children.  That's my take.  They are cutting out the middle man.  CRIMINAL.  I don't think the FDA or the CDC or scientific comm. has signed off on this.  Except for their Sick Friends.

                 Oh, I know you didn't, I think I know who did it.  It's been happening for quite some time now.  Goes with the territory.  I think you are right that there is a man that is helping the father having gone through a horrid experience himself.  This whole thing has just left me in shock.  A Pediatrician Mother.  5 years ago who would believe this.   Something must be done to put a stop to This Insanity.

                  Sorry on replying late. Was sick yesterday, better today. Yes, the former transgender is helping the father. He knows what a mistake this is for it to be happening to this little boy. I don't understand it either. If someone wants to do do this after they become an adult, that's their choice, but for a child it should not be happening. They are not ready mentally, physically or emotionally. We have seen the high percentages of suicide attempts in teens and young adults with transitioning. It is insanity.

                   The whole thing about the reassignment is that it is a hoax.  It never works the way they say.  Too much money in lying.  The drugs are what make them M or F and even they don't work right. There are many that are speaking out on this.  Even adults are being duped.  Sick Sick Sick.  All of them need deep mental help.  There is always a cause at the root many times no bonding with the parent of the Child's sex.  But other reasons too.  All this needs to be exposed big time to the masses.  That's why they want to shut us down here, they want us to stop posting about this stuff.  We must continue posting about Gender Ideology and their lies.

             Pediatrician Mother is pushing Gender Ideology at the cost of messing with her son's sexual organs and ruining his life.  So what?  She is on a roll and a supporter of Freud through the Red Nose Found.  All so sick and evil.

                Correct.  This will spread rumors the father does not need.  He has enough problems on his hands.  Pray for him.

             The inconsistency of James’ identity hasn’t stopped his mother from fighting his father tooth and nail. Georgulas is accusing Younger of child abuse, for cutting James’ hair and “other non-affirming actions.” She has sought to forbid Younger from using male pronouns for James, demanded that Younger attend transgender awareness classes, ordered him to pay for James’ “rainbow counselling,” and filed for a restraining order.
             <strong>
              rainbow counseling?

             “I also request that you stop bullying Luna on FaceTime. When you ask if everyone at her school liked her haircut, you probably noticed she didn’t answer. She herself does not like her haircut. Please stop making her feel worse about herself than you already have,” Georgulas wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
             HELLO!!!  The reason HE didn't answer is because all the Children at school were told he is a girl.  This must Stop!
            </p>
            <p>
             “Based on the three occasions I’ve spent time with him, I’d say he acts and looks unmistakably like a healthy six-year-old boy,” a local Christian pastor wrote. “I am praying for James, an average six-year-old boy, a sweet-natured, intelligent, lovable and at this point particularly vulnerable young man, caught up in a titanic clash of worldviews.”

             Nevertheless, James may be facing chemical castration as soon as he turns eight, if his mother has her way. The willingness of doctors and therapists to provide this therapy to children has been called“institutionalized child abuse” by Dr. Michelle Cretella, executive director of the American College of Pediatricians.
            </p>
            <p>
             "If you have a child as young as three who is confused about their sex, and the treatment involves changing their name and their dress...in the process, you are indoctrinating all of the children around them...we're not just stopping the body developing, we're also permanently affecting the brain,” Dr. Cretella said.

              I'd like to know how a busy professional at age 49 happened to have a baby. Is he adopted, is he a social experiment ? She was married before and divorced with no children, remarried to Younger in 2010. Did her connections at Red Nose provide her with a child???

               There are a couple of others as well.  I believe this is an arranged plan between the mother and red nose and the doctors that are supporting this, so they can gain attention for their Gender Ideology Push.

            The mom is likely well connected. Is she a member of the order of the eastern star? She seems to have the entire court siding with her and caring only what psychologists affirming the mother have to say. This is what tells me the woman has powerful friends that are playing along with her social experimentation of her own child.
           </p>

            They will use the outcome for pushing future political agendas. This is the type of generational legal maneuvering that goes on. "You have to break a few eggs to bake a cake?" Layering of laws for desired effect has been going on since long before any of us were born. It will not stop. I wish I knew a way to help the father.
           </p>
           <p>
            The father will lose this battle, sadly. I wish him well and am sorry to say this, but he will lose. The courts will keep him tied up and broke until "Luna" is of age to complete the hormone therapy.
           </p>
           <p>
            His only hope would be to find a masonic psychologist willing to go against one of their own to help this child decide on it's own gender identity in some neutral setting, away from either parent.
           </p>
           <p>
            The child can not be mentally diagnosed with
            <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/histrionic-personality-disorder">
             https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/histrionic-personality-disorder
            </a>
            until they are over the age of 18, which would be far too late for "Luna". BUT Histrionic personality disorder seems to be common among those that undergo mockingbird programming. From what little I have read from this post alone, this kid seems to seek attention and want to conform to which parents desires he is around. Symptoms of Histrionic personality disorder. Does he exhibit other symptoms?
           </p>
           <p>
            Symptoms
For a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder to be given, five or more of the following symptoms must be present:
           </p>
           <p>
            Self-centeredness, uncomfortable when not the center of attention
           </p>
           <p>
            Constantly seeking reassurance or approval
           </p>
           <p>
            Inappropriately seductive appearance or behavior
           </p>
           <p>
            Rapidly shifting emotional states that appear shallow to others
           </p>
           <p>
            Overly concerned with physical appearance, and using physical appearance to draw attention to self
           </p>
           <p>
            Opinions are easily influenced by other people, but difficult to back up with details
           </p>
           <p>
            Excessive dramatics with exaggerated displays of emotion
           </p>
           <p>
            Tendency to believe that relationships are more intimate than they actually are
           </p>
           <p>
            Is highly suggestible (easily influenced by others)
           </p>
           <p>
            For these symptoms to be considered a disorder, they must cause significant impairment or distress in an individual.

             I highly value your opinion.  I am sorry to read that this may not bode well for James.  remember us talking before about the Easter Star.  This is so sad.  Even though he probably doesn't have those symptoms I am sure she will find someone that says he does. The sad thing is, (as if this isn't sad enough) his brother will be severely traumatized as well.  She doesn't care if she ruins the whole family. The father is going through the fight of his life, for the life of his son.

              Dr. Anne Georgulas is a mother of four, two teenagers and two young children. She’s aboard certified pediatrician of the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP). The ABP’s General Pediatrics Certificate is recognized throughout the world. Dr. Anne’s pediatric credentials signify a high level of competence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Anne is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Children’s Medical Center. She trains the next generation of pediatricians in her style of compassionate, professional care. She focuses her teaching on differential diagnosis. Dr. Anne’s students learn to consider the whole child, the whole family, and the child’s environment.
             </p>
             <p>
              That’s an important difference. Pediatrics is a unique profession. It’s just not enough to have the best professional credentials. Professional care doesn’t mean the best care. No one can teach sincere compassion for children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Anne’s clinical practice is not just a profession – it’s her vocation.

               Evidently not.  She doesn't have any even for her own.  And I have to ask, where did she get these two twins?  I am seriously wondering where they came from.  This woman should never have been able to give birth. To think that she is teaching her brand and her style, well it is frightening.

                I personally had enough of cps/dhs/dcs/juvenile, in home care givers.........and all the gangstalking they do out of petty revenge.
               </p>
               <p>
                My life was turned upside down by these systems. I even had my name called into fusion centers and put on terror watchlist over petty ass in home care givers being fired for bringing drugs into my mothers home, stealing from her, committing medicare fraud. I can go on and on about what I've seen first hand.
               </p>
               <p>
                Report them? To who? The same systems that want these workers to work for minimum wage and fill out reports that go to assessment by hhs?
               </p>
               <p>
                For now, it seems the gangstalking of my personal life has stopped. IDK if it will start up again and I hope it does not. I really got sick of these people and all the bullshit word games.

                 So sorry for your experiences with CPS.  We know they are beyond corrupt.  Evidently her own peers have reported her, up until now with no results.  I admit this is an impossible hurdle, but I am praying nonetheless. &lt;3

                Look at this..........a mother of four? Two teens and she is 55? She has either defied reality and given birth in her mid to late 40s or she has adopted.
               </p>
               <p>
                Are the twins actually children of one of her teens? Is Younger the father of the twins, birthed by one of the two teens?
               </p>
               <p>
                This woman is masonic in some order, I am certain. When I do google searches of her name and the terms masonic or order of the eastern star, this local paper keeps coming up.

                I understand why everyone wants to ignore the elephant in the room, but foster services were founded by a mason. These people like using other peoples kids for their social experimentation's. Every judge is a mason. Pretty much all cps/dcs people directly involved in the kids case will be masons or rainbow girls, job's daughters. demolay, etc. These people are everywhere. Most are good people, with good hearts. That doesn't mean they all are and even the good ones are sworn not to go against their own in court.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pushing the transhumanism shit is part of albert pikes vision. The high level masons use the seven secrets(incest, homosexuality, transexuality, pedophilia, necrophilia, bestiality, cannibalism) to control one another and these kind of court cases will be used to justify more alterations to the legal systems in the near future.
               </p>
               <p>
                I get how unbelievable this is but you'll never change the systems when no one wants to acknowledge how they really work. These secret, not-so-secret orders are all throughout history and apart of the rise and fall of most nations. All sectors of society are governed by their members.
               </p>
               <p>
                I feel bad for this kid and his father, but there is nothing we can do. This kids life is a game for these people to destroy, all so they can push new laws to dissolve the family unit. Giving the cps systems more impact and authority over a child's life. Removing parental rights.
               </p>
               <p>
                Unless people can start finding the actual masonic connections, names and lodges the people involved in the kids case are part of, I doubt there is anything to stop this from moving forward. The courts will only care what the mothers side has to say. They will only care what the psychologists the courts or her have paid to justify what they are doing to this kids life.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sad as hell, but this kid is a pawn in a game I really do not want brought back into.

                   They all appear adopted to me. One girl is 100% Mexican or South American looking. The older girl has a long face and jaw. I doubt a woman this “accomplished” in her career is going to have three different fathers withheld kids. I believe 100% with

                   that she is an Eastern Star no question. A regular coven member is not this career driven with this much influence but an Eastern Star would be. Yes, female judges are all Eastern Stars worldwide. She is hiding behind the church but she is not Christian they wear the cross and attend church to fool while they deceive others. These people are evil to the very core. I think this young boy is a sacrifice as they all have to do this with a child. Sadly, if he ever recovers from this he is going to grow up HATING women so deeply he may well act out deviently as many serial killers and/or rapists do (not saying he is going to do so but this has been the case many times before).

                    Here's a question for all of you...............is Younger and Ann using everyone with this. Younger makes a pleading gofundme for legal defense, but instead it is used for a sex change for the kid?

                   <p>
                    I trust nothing about OES members. The one I dealt with was trying to steal my niece to pimp her out to drug dealers. That OES woman's brother was running drugs between vegas and the state I live in. He is on the sex offenders list. That OES woman lied out her ass about everything. The entire system felt content to try and railroad me.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I found the cps detective was a rainbow girl. The upper cps lady over the case was OES. IDK if the CASA woman was OES, but I'm guessing she was.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I can go on and on about the strange crap I discovered and went through, but long story short............I sat through the entire court hearing, refused to participate. Refused to swear on a bible. I was denied a lawyer. I qualify under americans with disabilities act. I told the judge my diagnosis. He allowed me to sit quietly and listen to all of the rehearsed lies being told. At the end, he ask me if I had any questions for my niece. I had one single question regarding her lying on the affidavit. The judge ask her the question and he heard what I did. Her voice cracked as she was trying to think up a lie. No one prepared her for.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I understand why my niece went along with them. She had known the OES woman and her daughters for over 8 years. She barely knew me and hated my home. She hated rules and wanted to do as she pleased. The OES woman promised my niece heaven and earth. All she had to do was sacrifice me.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Blessings to that judge and I know he was masonic. I seen him spinning his class ring. Making hand signals to the CASA woman and some group of other women that I'd never met before the hearing.

                     Woooooow. Unbelievable what you had to go through. Yes I believe you were the sacrifice for her and they were pushing her to do it and get her in their ranks. The justice system is a complete farce worldwide as they have infiltrated virtually everywhere. Do you have any relationship today with your niece or know how she is doing? I’m hoping you do as you sound like an extremely bright and compassionate person.

                     Now the first part of your comment is bang on Maurice!!! I was wondering why the father wouldn’t have known his wife belonged to the Order of the Eastern Star to begin with since he is apparently a Christian man. A true Christian cannot become either a Freemason or an Eastern Star to begin with. However, they always attend a church to hide and deceive others. It would make no sense for the husband or father not to have known this. So yes indeed, where is the money going? Well, they are deceiving Christian people again by getting them to fund the “legal battle” which is ultimately the sex change operation for the boy. Brilliant. Thank you for pointing that crucial point out.

                      My niece is now 19. She has her own place with a long term boyfriend. I don't speak with her much, but I run into her at times when I visit my mother. My niece's mom now is care giver to our mother and my niece lives a few houses away from them.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I've told the girl I forgive her. I'll always love her, but trust really is a piece of paper. I wish the girl the best in life. She is very talented with photography and a few other art forms. She earned a scholarship(idk to where). I'm not sure what from, but she graduated and I hope she uses that scholarship.

                     <p>
                      I tried teaching her, only she can break the cycle of poverty and stuff she was born into. She must own her deeds and not blame the world. I tried teaching her the seven virtues of Christ and the virtues of Bushido. Maybe someday she will understand those things and become better than she once was.

                      I put nothing past these evil people who are in lockstep with the devil.  But I thought the gofundme was for the father's legal bills.  But you are saying that if he is in on this horrid scam then it will go for the sex change of their son?  I'm trying to understand your take.  It's all to hard for me to think the father is in on it too, although anything is possible.

                       Sarah Scott ,a friend of Jeffrey Younger the father, has set up the savejames at gogetfunding and she also is mentioned in various articles (see above) If she wasn't legit I would think that the father would have shut her down as well as the pastor mentioned in the article above. Who is saying otherwise?

                      <p>
                       Also, see my article with links to the presiding judge's FB page. People need to fill up her FB page with their opinion of the travesty of Texas family court justice. Remember, this woman has to run again for reelection at some point and doesn't need bad publicity.

                        This is so awful.  I just want to pretend it never happened.  It goes from bad to worse.  That judge, I hope to God she loses.

                         Too bad you don't have FB. I don't put any personal info on it, they ask for your birthday and I give a wrong one. You should see Kim Cooks FB page, preening and posing in revealing bathing suit, wearing a turquoise ruff as part of her judicial apparel, talking about uniting families. I wrote "Shame on Texas" on her FB page.

                          Texas has very lax laws for fathers  Mothers make all these types of decisions, as if fathers don't even exist.  Sure she will keep up this caustic political push.

                       Simply put, -how would it be possible for the Christian father NOT to have known his wife/mother of his children (2 twin sons) was/is an Eastern Star member? ES members go to regular meetings (weekly/bi-weekly/monthly) and have a large group of members. How would he not have known she was involved in this Order? An actual true Christian person cannot be a member of Freemasonic organizations and she is 100% NOT Christian. Anyone involved in the occult love screwing people over and taunting them. This is a well known fact. So just as Maurice mentioned, it is highly possible that the Christian father is not actually Christian but is playing the victim to get funding from people, many in their church and other Christians, to actually have them pay for the young boys operation. That would be the ultimate fuck over and that is definitely something so sinister, sick and twisted that occult grounds get off on. This is actually possible. Trust no one.

                        That is pretty nasty if true.  I don't doubt it is a sincere possibility.  There are a couple of things now pointing at a scam by both parents.  Or the father taking advantage of the whole situation for his monetary gain.  There are some evil people in this world, and he may be one.

                       I hope the father is a good man and trying to help the boy, but yes. I worry the gofundme may not be used for what it says it is for.

                        There are strange things within this case.  It is a grabber of a story and then it leaves you scratching your head. I have searched but nothing new yet. The good thing is that it is all over the internet.  Including many stories countering the gender ideology and the puberty blockers.  This might be waking people up.  I sure hope so.

                       It's tough to be sure, because the elite use the Hegelian Dialectic (playing both sides). The father may not be "in on it", but he could be unknowingly controlled.

                       The Intel agencies do this a bunch. Consider the FBI's entrapment of retarded people committing "terrorism". The agency supplies the materials, and may even radicalize/induce the person with payments/promises. Though the "terrorist" thinks they are operating of their own free will, or in relation to an actual terrorist organization, they are actually an unwitting intelligence "asset"

                        I'll have to remember the term Hegelian Dialectic. It is far easier to say that, than it is to explain the concept of intentional contradicting sides for overall gain of the group. Unintended side-effects. Plausible deniability. Etc.

                        It's all sick.  Either way.  I am hoping that the father turns out OK.  Everything we research is so evil I don't want him in the mix too.  Church Militant is pretty good with their research, but it's early in the game.  I have been checking on other stories.

                         I've realized with all charities, only give money when you personally know or have good reason to trust them.

                        <p>
                         For too long "charities" or "charitable causes" have been able to scam the public. Pretty much all overseas aid is criminal or sponsors criminal elements skimming money off the top.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Keep your aid as local as possible. Build up your family, community, and local charities where you can see what work they are doing, and not relying on the propaganda pics they send out

                    I totally agree that they are evil to the core.  I also thought it odd the girls looked so different and wondered if adopted.  Possibly started as foster Children and maybe even attained through CPS, like the Hart Family Children.   These sick people have many connections as we know.  Yes, there is surely a network within this Eastern Star that facilitates this type of operation.  You and

            kids are always telling us "they have rights", I guess James doesn't know he has rights.  Mom needs a bitch slapping
as does the doctor.....This is where I have no problem with custodial interference.  :(

             Not sure it's the kids but kids repeating what they hear. The kids' rights argument is the main argument of the rebranded nambla types. Seeing people buy into this argument of all over the place thinking it's progressive and really about the rights of kids rather than about manufacturing "consent ". Good intentions are a doozy for those unaware of the very real evil in the world.

             My heart is hurting for James.  I don't even know that he knows what it all entails and what her plans are.  She definitely needs to be locked up. There is something seriously wrong with this woman.  Yes a B Slap is in order.  I am wondering if she wanted one of those boys to be a girl or if she is doing this to get back at the boy's father, but whatever her reason,  Someone needs to step in and do an intervention.  I say it again, She Seriously needs to be locked up.  And Good God, Where are the Grandparents?  Dear Lord.

             This made me so sick I sat on this a few days.  I couldn't make myself go back to read it again and post it.  But I felt it was my duty to make others aware that even in Dallas Texas such evil exists.  Dallas.  Think about it.  I agree there is nothing at all wrong with this young boy it is the mother that is morally and mentally deranged. I am praying for him and his father.  I don't know how this will turn out, but I hope sanity will prevail and that the site Sex Change Regret and Save James will help turn this around.  I understand your anger.
