            <em>
             Conspiracy of Silence

             I only just saw this because I have been away to see family but thanks for the ping - very thought provoking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whilst I was with family I watched that new Ready Player One piece of Spielberg shit film with my younger cousin, and as a film itself it was bad but in terms of its
             <em>
              message
             </em>
             ... it was
             <strong>
              <em>
               gross
              </em>
             </strong>
             . I don't know if you've seen it or know anything about it but it definitely had the message that if you think you like someone online they will probably be on your side in real life and if someone online is a bad person, they will be easily distinguished from an ally or a good person. It truly desensitises kids from being groomed online. Very creepy.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm only going on this rant because it seems to be your area of knowledge, haha. You should probably know better than I how creepy it is.
