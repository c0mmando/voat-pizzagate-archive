There is another thread here you might add: the Nancy Schaefer angle, which shows that in her case Georgia state Child Protective Services were taking kids from predominantly poor families and basically this was another market for kids that seems to be being used systemically. </p>
<p>See: Former Georgia State Senator, Nancy Schaefer was an outspoken opponent of Child Protective Services (CPS). Schaefer authored an investigation in which, among other findings, revealed the following:</p>
<p>“…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets.</p>
<p>The Adoption and the Safe Families Act, set in motion by President Bill Clinton, offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child. Employees work to keep the federal dollars flowing.</p>
<p>The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1998 reported that six times as many children died in foster care than in the general public and that once removed to official “safety”, these children are far more likely to suffer abuse, including sexual molestation than in the general population.</p>
<p>That according to the California Little Hoover Commission Report in 2003, 30% to 70% of the children in California group homes do not belong there and should not have been removed from their homes.</p>
<p>…poor parents often times are targeted to lose their children because they do not have the where-with-all to hire lawyers and fight the system. Being poor does not mean you are not a good parent or that you do not love your child, or that your child should be removed and placed with strangers.”</p>
<p>In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as The Second Mile, procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.</p>

<p>Schaefer allegedly wrote a book naming Georgia names and was killed along with her husband before publication (I think in DC). </p>
<p>Maybe there should be a state CPS thread, where stories on this are mined. 
Reports of similar state child theft in the UK have been ongoing. Numerous stories in UK media over last few years as well. </p>

             OK that is good but the whole thing is really a global child sex/abuse ring or network of rings, so these various stories start coming into contact with each other. The Dave McGowan backgrounder is really important.That a bunch of ranting about YouTube gets more upvotes than this is really pathetic. There is a Negroponte link to MIT and laptops being sent to Africa to kids.
