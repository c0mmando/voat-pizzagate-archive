<p>Came across this blog compiled by Laurie HaNdrahan.  Epidemic: America’s Trade in Child Rape.She lists arrests of both law enforcement professionals and educators and provides a brief bio that includes an overview of their crimes. Each story is an eye opener and shocking as to what is going on across America. The level of depravity is beyond belief and shows there is no &quot;love&quot; in pedophilia. These people could rightfully be labeled as monsters who would molest any tiny thing that moved. And the sheer numbers of the images and videos consumed demonstrate how even one Pedo can spread this filth and garbage while destroying the young lives of those they come into contact with. </p>
<p>The really frightening thing is that this is the Deep State -- the resistors to laws protecting children and arresting those perpetrating crimes. They vote for those who give them free rein because there is a network. How else would these images be traded? And many of these individuals made their own pornography by videotaping the molestation they engaged in. Hence, the sewer pile gets added to and the perps sicker. </p>
<p>It\'s important for us to stay aware so thanks to Ms. Handrahan for her work on this issue. </p>

<p>The following summary of 103 law enforcement officers (LEOs) arrested for trading in child rape updates earlier research.

            I believe the Universities and Colleges and other schools have been infiltrated with Pedo Heads.  The reason for that is to exonerate and slap the wrists of offenders and to hire their pedo friends and abusers.  Also to further sex abuse of our children and mess up their lives and ours.  So Sick.

             Schools are needed to help prepare the next generation. If they're screwed up psychologically, what better way to ensure a vote for the Pedo side of politics. They really are playing filthy dirty. I feel sorry for the kids. They're not taught to think and now they have pervs preying on them in institutions where they should be kept safe.

              Yes, were are all these people coming from.  The mug shots I have seen on tv are  priceless and details include, drugs, former sex abusers, drunk and disorderly and duis.  PULLLEEZZE.  Give me a break.  How do we get around this?  People if you are reading this, Run For Office On Your School Board.  It is easier than you think.

                I wish I had.  I did work with children and did some teaching of civics to the children but only to those teachers that cared.  Years ago.  You can start by volunteering and getting to know people and attending meetings.  Being Seen.  People will start recognizing you.  That's when you throw your hat in the ring.  You can host a small coffee at a meeting place in your library.  Let people know what you want to do for their children and let them tell you want they want.  This is how you get started.

            Hello, I'm a new user so I can't post a new thread yet please check this out, I was searching for excercise work out videos for my girlfriend and some of the suggested results were videos from brazilian little girls doing "gimnastics" but is just too sexualized, why is YouTube letting this to happen?? Check out this video
            <a href="https://youtu.be/Xb3xMn76zg0">
             https://youtu.be/Xb3xMn76zg0
            </a>
            there is an adult also kissing, touching an tickling the little girl, is too wierd and sexualized, I've already reported this and many other videos with the same content, there are some Russian girls doing the same "gimnastics" videos.

             I know a lot of people have complained to YouTube about these types of videos. There's been a lot of discussion on Twitter about it, also. They will ban anyone posting about  Alefantis and Pizzagate, but they won't ban sexualizing kids?
            </p>
            <p>
             Something is truly wrong, but let's keep up that pressure.

            Either we are fortunate and the very few ( as 'they' say ) child rapists that exist in Law Enforcement and Academia are being arrested....
           </p>
           <p>
            Or both professions are replete with predators that rape, torture and kill children.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm leaning towards the latter.

             Law enforcement, educators, clergy, politics, show business &amp; medcine are all professions where people interact from a position of superiority, authority and form their own enclave with a cotterie of followers. I.e they are all Narcistic professions. Hence those professions are stuffed full of abusers.

I'm here to tell the Mods to fuck off and die.

            I have used Handrahan's university staff list for redpilling in the past, good - but sad - to see she also has a list of law enforcement professionals. Thanks,

             I wasn't sure how many people knew about the site, but figured I'd post it if only for pizzagaters to use as you have.

             I can't get over those stories. Each one is a nightmare for the child/children involved. To think that some were using their own children in this sick fantasy if crazy. It all goes to demonstrate what we're fighting for.

              Yes, I had to take a break when I read it for the first time, it just creeped me out.
             </p>
             <p>
              I see it like this: If only one child could be saved, because we redpilled someone and he/she became more aware of these issues, and maybe reported some observations to the police, so that an abuse could be stopped, it was worth the whole pizzagate investigation.

               But realistically, ecause these scumballs are so prolific in accomplishing evil, stopping one person means saving a lot of kids. They wreak a lot of damage. Then there's all those cases that one bad cop can derail. It's imperative these people do not hold positions of authority.
