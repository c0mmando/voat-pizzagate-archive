            That's close to Palmeira Square and Palmeira Avenue.  Why is that of interest, you ask?  From a killer twitter thread on pedophilia in the UK:

             Let's now turn our attention to another person who became director of 47/49 Palmeira Avenue (Management) Ltd on June 21, 1997, one Garvan Hickey.
            </p>
            <p>
             Garvan Hickey is also listed as having been director of 'Fun in Action for Children', a charity in Preston Street, just over half a mile from Palmeira Avenue.
             <br/>
             Understandably, any links to children's charities set alarm bells ringing ...
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://funinaction.org.uk">
              https://funinaction.org.uk
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Anne Mary Elizabeth Copeland is a more recent appointee as director to Fun in Action for Children. She was also a Trustee. Interestingly, Anne worked at the Cabinet Office, the Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Office.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's leave 47/49 again for a moment and head back to 11 Palmeira Avenue. As we pass by, take a look at No. 43, the Brighton and Hove Reform Synagogue, where the incumbent rabbi Andrea Zanardo was inducted by rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, daughter of Greville of Braunstone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Apropos Braunstone/Braunstein, an incident in the vicinity in late 1967 in which a grenade was thrown into the house of the cantor of the Hove synagogue, Rev. Bernhard Braunstein, could easily have resulted in a conflagration similar to that some 30 years later at No. 11...So who was behind the attack on Rabbi Braunstein?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, it was none other than Nicholas van Hoogstraten, the owner of the No. 11 death trap which killed five and blighted the lives of others.... Hoogstraten was, of course, no stranger to fires and arson. Hamilton Palace, his semi-finished tribute to his own grandeur and notoriety, is built on the site of High Cross House, a nursing home which was unexplainably burned down.
            </p>
            <p>
             And here's another question for you to mull over: Why did Tim Sainsbury declare 47 and 49 Palmeira Avenue as a Member's Interest 2 years before he was appointed director and 2 years before the devastating fire at No. 11?
            </p>
            <p>
             And as this thread is all about coincidences, here are two more for your perusal before we turn our attention to the other directors at Nos. 47/49:
            </p>
            <p>
             Firstly, Palmeira 11, site of the deadly conflagration, is a mere 1.2 km from Brunswick Square where VIP parties were held.

He was to spend the next 8 months in hospital...Lea Homburg survived; Mabel, his wife-to-be didn't. She impaled herself on the railings below after leaping from a window ledge to escape the flames. Lea's brother Adrian died inside the blazing flat, only identified by dental records.
             </p>
             <p>
              At 13, Lea had followed his older brother Chris to the newly opened Bryn Alun children's home in Wrexham, part of the lucrative empire run by the child abuser John Allen.

             <p>

             </p>
             <p>
              On the evening of Allen's return, Lea, Adrian and Mabel were at a party on the third floor of 11 Palmeira Avenue when a fire was started in the stairs. It was arson, first pinned on an unemployed air steward who walked out in front of a lorry just 4 days later.

              I am a person who suffers from entity possession while following the
             </p>
             <p>
              practices of Sant Thakar Singh. Entity possession varies in its seriousness
             </p>
             <p>
              but more than 10% of Sant Thakar Singh's initiates worldwide suffer from it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have sought to leave Sant Thakar Singh and follow a safer teacher of Sant
             </p>
             <p>
              Mat but none is able to break my connection with Sant Thakar Singh and so I
             </p>
             <p>
              am trapped. I am in a position of real suffering and many other Thakar
             </p>
             <p>
              initiates suffer similarly.
             </p>
             <p>
              You should know
             </p>
             <p>
              INITIATION is IRREVERSIBLE
             </p>
             <p>
              Initiation is a very serious choice that has many long lasting
             </p>
             <p>
              consequences. It is not a decision that should be entered into casually but
             </p>
             <p>
              should rather be given the most serious consideration. The choice of inner
             </p>
             <p>
              connection to the Master can not be undone once established through the
             </p>
             <p>
              initiation. As part of the initiation process you will form a subtle link
             </p>
             <p>
              with the Master sometimes called receiving "the inner connection" that you
             </p>
             <p>
              can not give up unilaterally on your own no matter how hard you try. Only by
             </p>
             <p>
              finding yet a higher Master and taking his initiation can the bond to the
             </p>
             <p>
              old Master be broken. In many respects the choice of taking a Master is a
             </p>
             <p>
              more critical choice to your well-being and happiness than getting married
             </p>
             <p>
              as a marriage can be ended in divorce but the inner link of connection to a
             </p>
             <p>
              Master can not be broken by any efforts and endures even after death. It is
             </p>
             <p>
              important that the person you are accepting initiation from be completely
             </p>
             <p>
              ethical and perfect and that you be truly compatible with that person. After
             </p>
             <p>
              initiation, you will be connected with your Master at high level inside your
             </p>
             <p>
              consciousness. Your higher mind and soul will be blended or merged to some
             </p>
             <p>
              extent with the Master. This is a powerful connection of great intimacy and
             </p>
             <p>
              strength. Such connection can be a source for good where, under a perfect
             </p>
             <p>
              Master, over time you take on some of the noble qualities and competencies
             </p>
             <p>
              of the Master but can also be a source for evil and entity possession if the
             </p>
             <p>
              Saint is not 100% ethical and competent. Sadly, many many too many of the
             </p>
             <p>
              initiates of Sant Thakar Singh suffer from chronic entity possession. In
             </p>
             <p>
              compassion and honesty this fact can not be covered up and left undisclosed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please be very very careful before you consider initiation. It is not
             </p>
             <p>
              possible to reverse the choice in some cases if the Master is strong and
             </p>
             <p>
              unethical.

                IG has everything, first place to look. Just put hashtag symbol and then search away. The kids are woke. Another good account is
                <strong>
                 LIZ CROKIN
                </strong>
                .
               </p>
               <p>
                Coincidence - the above account referenced seems to have read this thread! She updated her IG with a photo of Heather :)

              I'm exhausted too. But when I realized a few years ago that we were all being scammed by some very evil  and sick people/entities I decided '
              <em>
               not on my watch
              </em>
              .  I was angry with all the resources that were put out to cover up these crimes against humanity.. and the arrogance that went along with it.  It brings me pleasure to use their own tools against them.

               Texas woman pleads guilty to sex-trafficking 9 year old girl to former Humane Society of US VP David Wills

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Authorities say a South Texas woman has pleaded guilty to sex-trafficking a 9-year-old girl... David Wills, a former Rockport resident accused of assaulting the victim, was arrested in July
               <strong>
                and released on a $5 million bond
               </strong>
               ."
              </p>
              <p>
               ..Turns out David Wills from Rockport is the former president of the Michigan Humane Society as well as the former VP of the Humane Society of the US. Even though the mainstream media hasnt touched it... There are plenty of articles documenting his ties to these organizations available.
              </p>
              <p>
               ..Coincidentally, the Humane Society backed candidate Clinton in her bid for president, and called Trump a threat to animals.

"David Wills landed the presidency of the Nashua (NH) Humane Society in 1972 with the help of then-HSUS president John Hoyt’s recommendation. When he took over, he was just 19 years old, making him the youngest person ever to head a major humane society. Wills left six years later amid accusations that he stole funds, with estimates ranging from $10,000 to $2 million."

             In a surprising move, and after a direct appeal from the  former Minister of Health Li Ming-liang, the parents of the victim agreed to donate the girl's organs.  Organ donation,  while legal in Taiwan, has not been encouraged by the  government.  DOH maintains an organ database, but for  religious and cultural reasons, organ donations are not  popular and there is a serious shortage of transplantable  organs in Taiwan.  Many patients reportedly travel to China  or the US for transplants.  The Tzu-Chi Foundation, a  respected Buddhist charity, has been advocating organ  donation and has established a bone-marrow donation center.  Interestingly, about half of the donations go to patients in

            "We" know a lot, there are VERY strong connections between Dearman, Supreme Master Ching Hai &amp; Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, Dearman did voice-overs for Supreme Master, one of them was about Haiti

           <p>
            He also did 16 other voice-overs for her.

            He even started a website called "Hoaxtead Research" after other activists began a website called "Hampstead Research" to mock us, the researchers and activists.  Here is today's offering from that horrid site, use your VPN as always... I am a smiling pepperoni on the slice of pizza on their little meme today found here, slagging us all off as "conspirtitards"

            All activists in the UK are silenced.  Threatened with jail and worse.  It's an impossible situation.  We need help getting the word out.  We have fought tooth and nail for every video that still exists on the internet, our work is hard to find because we've had to go underground but we are here with tons of info.  My facebook page called "Believe The Children" is named for the fact that the cult defenders say they lied, the children cannot lie about things they shouldn't even EVER know about.  It's a cover-up from the very first day when parts of the childrens testimonies were concealed and never used in court.  The case never made it past the secret family court system.  The case has never been fully investigated by police because they were implicated.  The concealed evidence taping is called "The Jean-Clement Recordings" and you can find the audio and transcriptions (1000's of man-hours of volunteer work) here

            A few Facebook pages exist, the largest is the creator of "Cannabis Cures Cancers" has written hundreds of articles and put them into his photo section.  His page has 100,000+followers but very few pay attention to him for some reason...there seems to be cognitive dissonance. Here's one of his photos on the CF connections

            It's been a hell of a fight, we are really tired and need more people to see this, to see what is going on...it's ugly and it wears on you.  I'm here if anyone needs any info....tons of screen shots, links, connections, you name it.  It goes deeper than you even think, you haven't see the worst parts of it all yet, but you'll get there if you keep digging. Sorry to say.  Peace!
