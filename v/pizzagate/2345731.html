<p>In a disturbing report, Porn star Stormy Daniels tells In Touch magazine that Trump had an affair with her right after his wife Melania gave birth to their son Barron.</p>
<p>In fact, multiple media reports indicate Donald Trump paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016 to keep silent about a sexual affair the two had more than 10 years ago. The payoff came right before the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>Daniels (given name: Stephanie Clifford) told the magazine that Trump said she was “just like his daughter” Ivanka.</p>
<p>Discussing her sexual affair with Trump, Daniels told In Touch:</p>
<p>We had really good banter. He told me once that I was someone to be reckoned with, beautiful, smart, just like his daughter.</p>
<p>Reporting on the story, Spin Magazine notes:</p>
<p>Our now president reportedly comparing a woman he was allegedly sleeping with to Ivanka is just another creepy addition to his long history of going out of his way to sexualize his daughter.</p>

<p>This alone would tell me that PG is REAL, something is about to go down and they are running SCARED.</p>',

Your sick,  all of you,  it's disgusting to watch you rip most of these moguls a new ass but some fucking PIG MYSOGYNIST who shows us what a fuck up he is every single day becomes president and you idiots fawn over him like some kind of pariah.  Grossest display of human hypocrisy EVER. None of these fuckers are any good,  none of them,  get that through your head right quick.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the evidence that trump is just an interim told to act like the biggest fucker on the planet until they can install pence along with everything you'd ever want to know about an arch villain has been there right in your fucking faces the whole time and you want to ignore it and in fact make up the gayest thread ever in defense of him. Fuck you all for voting for him. Fuck Hillary too you cocksuckers will not hem me up in that faggot ass trap.

             In this whole mess, everyone is bad. The level of bad that Trump is, is different than the level of bad that HRC and friends are. They never let Trump into their club and they loathe him. But his putting them away doesn't change who he is and what he is culpable of, morally and legally. I am glad that i was right all along. Trump really is #PrezzoTheClown and galvanizing the media for 2 and a half years while the Army, behind the scenes, have been conducting their "Storm" and they call it. I can accept that. But I haven't been on the Trump train since long before Ivana was fed up with him and I ain't ever going back on that decision, no matter how many pedos go down during his special guest star presidency :)

              "Rabbi Louis Finkelstein, the head of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1943, writing in the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, "Pharisaism became Talmudism ...the spirit of the ancient Pharisee survives unaltered. When the Jew studies the Talmud, he is actually repeating arguments used in the Palestinian academies." [55] In other words, the Talmudic Lubavitchers are reborn Pharisees."

                Roy Cohn was reportedly "a Meyer Lansky organized crime syndicate operative who served on the Permindex board [xx], which is believed to have been Mossad's key operating front in the conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy."
               </p>
               <p>
                Cohn is believed to have used child prostitutes to blackmail politicians.
               </p>
               <p>
                Cohn is believed to have been involved in the Franklin scandal - a child-sex ring that reached the Reagan White House. [xxiii]
               </p>
               <p>
                Cohn aided Roger Stone in Ronald Reagan’s 1970-80 presidential campaign.
               </p>
               <p>
                Biographer Burton Hersh writes about Roy Cohn:
               </p>
               <p>
                "When New York attorney John Klotz began to investigate Roy Cohn on behalf of a client…declassified New York government files and spadework by a private detective substantiated the allegation that there was indeed a 'blue suite' at the Plaza, Suite 233.
               </p>
               <p>
                "'Roy Cohn was providing protection,' Klotz discovered. 'There were a bunch of pedophiles involved. That’s where Cohn got his power from - blackmail.'"[i]
               </p>
               <p>
                In 1987, "Trump took over Lansky's Mossad/CIA money-laundering front, the Mary Carter Paint Company, then renamed Resorts International, from CIA frontman James Crosby." [xxxiii]
               </p>
               <p>
                "Cohn was involved in the child sex ring run out of Manhattan's Plaza hotel."
               </p>
               <p>
                Trump bought the Plaza Hotel in 1988.
               </p>
               <p>
                Katie Johnson claims to have been lured, at the age of 13, to one of Epstein's underage sex parties in New York, where she was violently raped by Trump [ii]
               </p>
               <p>
                "Detective James Rothstein had an opportunity to have a sit-down with ... Roy Cohn.
               </p>
               <p>
                "During this sit-down, Cohn admitted to Rothstein that he was part of a rather elaborate sexual blackmail operation that compromised politicians with child prostitutes." [iii]
               </p>
               <p>
                Peter Fraser was one of Roy Cohn's lovers.
               </p>
               <p>
                Fraser says that Donald trump was certainly Roy Cohn's apprentice.

               You're spot on, Gothamgirl. People will look for any reason to hate him, that comment is an easy one to misinterpret/misrepresent if one is intent on 'proving' that Donald is incest or otherwise a deviant.

               It's CNN-level banter, really xD

                Yeah, thing is, pedo creeps don’t go around advertising it all over the place. For instance, all the creeps we KNOW are creeps never say anything like that (Biden, Terry Richards, Epstein, on and on and on). Makes no sense that Trump would be the ONE person to publicize it. Sounds more like something a dumb dad would say. Which is what I think it was.
