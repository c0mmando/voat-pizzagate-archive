            Do you have any social media links for such individuals? Would like to see what you are talking about. Looking a bit at their histories may give us clues as to where some of the strange behavior is coming from.  Perhaps others could share theirs here too. Am intrigued, but I haven't personally witnessed this.

             I don't want to drop them yet because it will cause them to go private. There are sooo many of these people. You just follow who likes it, who responds and it just leads to more and more of them. Some are obviously part of it but have no really damning picture to bother saving but some can be really in your face. I want to put together collages to support what I see because you really have to conenct the symbols and code words to see what they are really saying. Showing these pictures out of that context would make me look crazy to anyone who doesn't follow pizzagate.

              Well, understood - and good luck in the hunt and archiving. Thought you might have an example that's not particularly linked to the ones you're currently investigating. Will have to keep an eye out, I guess.

              Makes me think back to that chick from Heavy Breathing. I mean, one moment she's a nanny, and a few years down the road she's on stage in a ski mask talking about killing babies and putting up weird pedo album art on shitty music. How, exactly, do these people get into this kind of thing? Was it a strange school or university program? Some sort of fraternity? I highly doubt they have craigslist ads saying, "Hey... how about becoming a satanic child trafficker today? Earn the big bucks!"

               This shit has been going on for many decades. I imagine almost all of them were born into it or kidnapped at a young age and raised into it. Not all of these victims are killed. They are used to make more of themselves or standby units for something in the future.

               My personal guess is a combination of being born into these masonic families and some being mkultra victims that are "adopted" in to make more of themselves. Some of these people have a really creepy blank stare that just screams brain damaged. Like sociopathic brain damaged.

            Looking at these people, some look pretty miserable for traveling so much. Also sex bruises and cuts that I am suspect about.  Also they are just so openly casually satanic too. Maybe its just me that is surprised about that.

            Excellent post.
 Let's add that many "mothers" tend to hot 20s somethings that groom customers and victims of blackmail. Another trend that is not universal is that handlers are connected to overseas NGOs involved in orphans. Back on the continent we see lots of child advocacy Foundations that launder the money of human trafficking. Remember they receive revenue through the evil pedo market, but also cultural capital and  big donations to tax haven silos. Conclusion: human babies are extremely valuable assets. Pedocrats clearly see little living human bodies as objects and commodities.
Edit: grammar
