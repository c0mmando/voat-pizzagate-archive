That the suspect is an undocumented illegal has caused a furore regarding US immigration and open border debates.</p>
<p>I came across this tweet that reports of someone calling themselves ‘Black Anon’ who has posted on 8chan that Mollie Tibbet’s father is ‘In Deep’.  In fact, Robert Tibbets was Vice President/Marketing Executive at HOK - formerly Helmuth Obata and Kassebaum, described on Wikipedia as the Largest US based architectural design company.  HOK partnered with US Green Building Council and the Clinton Global Initiative to build a new orphanage and children’s centre in Haiti</p>

<p>In the comments that followed I unrolled a thread by <a href="https://voat.co/user/AlwaysIntegrity">@AlwaysIntegrity</a> that raises some pertinent points and questions that would certainly seem to indicate a need for further digging.  For example, he asks why Rob Tibbets left his job only days before Mollie’s disappearance, and that her disappearance happened along the Highway 80, a known Human Trafficking route which leads into Toronto where his company HOK has a large base, and also why, of the many kids we all talked about on Voat that went missing Iowa in late July, was Mollie’s case so highlighted?  More curiously however, this thread also mentions the possibility that Rob Tibbets and Laura Calderwood are fronts for Mollie’s real parents who live in Minnesota and that Mollie has the real name of Miriam.  Finally, he touches on some creepy tweets and retweets on Mollie’s Twitter account:

<p>The creepy tweets are further explored in this thread roll and would indeed lead in the direction of a Satanic connection with Mollie together with links and retweets involving Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, currently being sought out by SRA victim Fiona Barnett for apology for his father having raped her at Bohemian Grove. Tom Hanks also gets a mention  the retweet maze.

<p>Given this, and what we know about Satanists and anyone deeply entrenched with the Clintons it’s fairly justifiable to ask, was Mollie kidnap and murder associated to SRA?  Was she kidnapped and held captive for a July 27th Ritual?  The night of the blood moon and one of the most significant dates in the Satanic Calendar?  
</p>
<p>Indeed, the explanation of Christhian Bahena Rivera the 24 year old Mexican undocumented illegal immigrant arrested for her murder that he followed her and then conveniently ‘blacked out’ with no memory of what happened to her before finding her bleeding in the trunk of her car, to his then recalling carrying her body and dumping it deep in a cornfield is strange at best.  Later police statements have said he described being ‘drawn to her’ and followed her in his car before chasing her on foot before confronting her before lapsing into his sans memory ‘episode’ and others describe how he ‘heard voices’. directing him.  How many time have we heard that one?  Was he subjected to MK Uktra programming to acquire for nefarious ‘others’?  Reports also state that he was identified by CCTV footage of his vehicle.  I’ll stand corrected if necessary as I’m  not sure about the US but I know of few illegal immigrants in the U.K. who can afford a car, let alone be able (or foolish enough) to have a vehicle registered in their own name and home address

            Programmed to Kill by Dave McGowan tells in detail how people are chosen sometimes early on by our govt . who are mentally ill, unstable and vicious. They are groomed and programmed for just this type of murder.He also says they usually have help but that fact is kept from the public in the glaring publicity during trial...also Wayne Madsen stated Franklin Graham mission outpost in western NC  called Samaritan's Purse was used for refueling of planes carrying people to black sites for torture. Wayne Madsen was named by CounterPunch as the last American journalist.

            Makes me wonder about Natalie Holloway who was murdered in Aruba. I always wondered why the story got so blown up. I remember the entire summer it was on Fox 24/7 it seemed. Now that you guys mention it, it might have been a giant sacrifice.

            :  I reread the posts and thread; still intrigued.  Im gonna be on the lookout for some more info on condition of MTs  body when found. It may tell us whether she was killed right away or if she   was held captive and killed later.  Maybe law enforcement was trying to hold off on gory details for the benefit of the family but a body out in the horrible heat for weeks would have attracted scavengers by the time she was found such as coyotes and vultures unless she was killed and dumped much much later.  Covering her with cornstalks would prevent disovery by air. And I wonder whose land had the butterfly. That could have been a bit of whimsey. But overall the story is not adding up and we will need to revisit later Thanks for the post.

             It’s a gory prospect but it a known ritualistic thing that several stab wounds can be made to the body and evil bastards have sex with the wound.  It’s horrible to think of it but the 27th July is a hugely significant Satanic date. But not sure how it fits that she wasn’t discovered until Aug 21st.  I’ve also read somewhere that corn has Satanic permutations.  (Children of the Corn comes to mind).

            Definitely the dad is more than sketchy. What he said in the initial investigation was creepy, weird, and made no sense to any normal human being. It would only make sense if one had a context and what could that be? Here's the quote:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/21/mollie-tibbetts-missing-iowa-student-found-dead-sources-say.html">
              http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/21/mollie-tibbetts-missing-iowa-student-found-dead-sources-say.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "The bottom line is somebody knows something," Rob Tibbetts previously told Fox News, adding Brooklyn is a small city and “you can’t do anything there without someone seeing it.”  ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Rob Tibbetts stayed optimistic to the end, theorizing his daughter must have been with someone she knew and would return home safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It's totally speculation on my part, but I think Mollie is with someone that she knows, that is in over their head,” he told Fox News. “That there was some kind of misunderstanding about the nature of their relationship and at this point they don't know how to get out from under this.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Seriously, why would he think she was with someone she knew and that this person "misunderstood" the nature of the relationship? Was that because the father was involved and hadn't okayed his daughter being expendable? There's more, too. They really set the stage for her to have been taken in any number of ways. They even speculated that her door was left open. I guess that was in case they wanted that out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure what went on there, but the dad is up to his eyeballs in this.

             Yes, the father practically described the accused perp except they didnt "know" each other but for a few minutes. He kinda makes a pass from his vehicle, she rebuffs him, he persists, she becomes scared and threatens to call cops. Why didnt he back up so she couldnt see a tag number and then skidaddle. He perceives himself in trouble so kills her to prevent deportation.  The dad may have a similar encounter.

              It could easily be that or that she was grabbed without the dad's permission. Maybe she was targeted and he was hinting to the group involved, that you don't know who she is and that she's above you in the hierarchy because of me.
             </p>
             <p>
              And did the family move to SF? Why? Was this a recent move? It's just bizarre. The whole thing makes no sense.

            I thought about the disappearance of Kyron Horman when I heard about Mollie. That case has never been solved. They both got more publicity than thousands of other missing children's cases. Why? It does seem strange. SRA is a possibility.

             It’s sad to say but I honestly think the reason why all disappearances don’t get reported is because there’s not enough social media/tv time! I mean these kids get Abducted daily. Hundreds, thousands. How could the news pick up all these stories. There’s not enough time in the day to report on all these horny dumbasses. We can only hear about a few. Their doing what they can. Here’s to much evil out there to respond to everything. There’s not 24926 hours in a day ya know. Think about it.

              How sad. So, who wants to be the first to donate to starting an internet site to publish every missing child in each state? More people need to be enraged that this can happen to anyone's child.

            Hmm. I'm not convinced. The reason I think that is because it would be a spectacular own goal to have an illegal held out for all to see as the killer. That obviously goes against all that they are trying to convince the American people of. The damage done, in this regard, by this one case, is huge. And I think it got so much spotlight because it's obviously a 'good' event so far as Trump/Republicans go, seeing as it is precisely something that Trump has been talking of. You've got to remember that the internet and news isn't only full of leftist/democrat influence, it is also full of right/Republican influence. For me, that's what you've got here. The leftist response in the media going on the defensive would back that up as well.

             : I generally agree with you but here nobody knew the killer was going to be an illegal immigrant for the weeks that Mollie's disappearance saturated the news.  Her boyfriend should have been the first logical suspect to rule out. Inasmuch as she was over 18, she was free to disappear on her own whereas a child would be deemed a kidnapping victim  to be taken anywhere in the country and more in need of extensive coverage.

              Ah okay, not being in the US I wasn't to know how it played out in the media all the way through. Hmmm. The illegal 'own goal' still seems like a problem to me though, they definitely wouldn't have wanted that to be headline news.

               If you are not of the USA, its hard to realize how big we are, 3000 miles coast to coast with a great deal of autonomy for each state. Thus news from a small town in Iowa  seems strange unless it had national implications.  If an illegal alien had been suspected from the start I could see the rationale.
              </p>
              <p>
               Judging by the dearth of feedback, I guess it was just strange for a handfull of us. The significance of a blood moon  is  not to be overlooked. Does this happen all around the globe?

            I'm done with coincidences.  Comey in a cornfield on June 16th.  This girl disappears shortly thereafter.  Right around a satanic holiday.  Makes me wonder if the Deep State "gave" Iowa to Comey for his service.  Maybe Comey will run for Governor?  Maybe part of his gift required a very public sacrifice?  Stranger things have happened.
           </p>

            And the illegal is a little too clean looking for me.  Almost everyoen of the illegal killers is tatted up.  This guy isn't.  And the murky details on the mode of murder?  It very well could have been a ritualistic killing and LE isn't divulging.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's quite a message they sent to POTUS.  These people must perish.

            Ohhh, ultra creepy about Comey!! His comment too- "new growth in Iowa and around the country"? Now that's just an odd thing to say if he was really talking about a cornfield popping up as it has nothing to do with the rest of the country. Now if this theory is true about harvesting Americans for their sacrifices, it sadly makes a lot more sense.

            :  I thought your post was silly until I read thru it. If you are from the UK and read about MT, then you are rjght that there was extensive and far reaching coverage .  As bad as  I felt about this missing girl, I was bewildered by the news coverage. Unless she was related to a famous person, I didnt understand why I was hearing about it 1000 miles away. How many kids and young adults in Iowa and around the country went missing during the same timeframe as MT?
           </p>
           <p>
            The other thing was the rapidly increasing reward $$.  It all reminded me of the Madeline McCann early  in the days/weeks of her dissapearance.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other issue was the multiple stab wounds which apparently made by a small implement. Stabbing after death occurs when victim and perp know each other  and there is rage directed at victim. How convenient for the accused to have a means to stab her when it was an impromptu killing, maybe it was a pocket knife he kept in his vehicle. And why didn' t he take trouble to bury her? How could her unburied body lay in the heat for so long without attracting a circle of vultures that surely would have been noticed in the small town drowning in news coverage. BTW, did you notice in one of the aeriel photos of  the large butterfly created by  plowing or planting? Weird.
           </p>
           <p>
            I cant figure out the evidence presented on the job loss preceding the dissappearance. Can you explain or elaborate, please.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nor am I grasping the names and 2 sets of parents issue. Miriam is a rather oldfashioned name and I could see where a nickname Molly might arise. Take care when. trying to link names via Internet. I was shocked to find 4 names like mine in my county, 11 thruout the state and I didnt bother to determine nationwide names like mine.

             If you google 'mollie tibbetts uk news' you will see that it received an unusual amount of coverage. Is this how they celebrate their  satanic sacrifices? By plastering it over the news?

            Usually victims of violent death who are connected to social affairs, have their parents connected to judeo-satanists. Molly Tibbets, like Seth Rich, or even Michael Jackson were all involved, therefore it's highly likely their parents are involved with judeo-satanists. The more absurd the case is, the more probability of parent's involvement in judeo-satanism.
