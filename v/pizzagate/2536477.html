            Yes, been waiting for something like this! Sorry Bryan but all the connections you had have dried up and now you are standing alone!! Pathetic that through all of the revelations(and there have been many) the sycophants in Canada had no problem allowing you into their country and filming in Montreal on at least 2 occasions. Maybe now, because of outside pressure, Canada may be forced to grow some! It just disgusts me, and I have seen it first hand, the way the Entertainment industry and in particular weak apathetic losers in Canada, allow this behavior and will go out of their way to punish those trying to reveal the truth. Why??? For what?? Some bloated narcissist like Singer?? I can't even look at his face, I want to punch him!!
