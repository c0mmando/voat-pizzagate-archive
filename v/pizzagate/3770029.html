            Why try and get it taken down? Its better to see who these people are and what they are about and they are obviously telling ya. Yeah its disgusting and against everything you think is right but, how about just avoid it. Better the in your face style then trying to hide it, or is it just me?

             Just you, imo, even more disgusting evil predators are created by going to these sights in my opinion and more demand for them create more victims.  Why leave them open and be part of the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would never like that to be just out there and my young grandchildren click on it, it is not even on somewhere you have to purposefully click.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thats like leaving a large poop on your doorstep, putting up with the sight and stink, to let people know what they like.  All it does is attract flies and germs, no one wants that available.....anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             My whole view here is because of the children.  These people are sick and it is infectious and needs to be routed out.

              I just feel it is a pretty dangerous thing to be demanding censorship on something a few people or even many people don't like. You have the choice to not look at it, exit a video you find offensive, or do anything you wang but just because you or whomever would prefer it not exist doesn't mean it should be wiped from existence. I'll agree to disagree with you and hope you never get your wish

               well just because you think it is okay for evil to exist so that evildoers can watch does NOT make it right.  This causes a demand for this crap, and
              </p>
              <p>
               CHILDREN are being put in these videos. So its not a case of  'live and let live'
              </p>
              <p>
               CHILDREN might come across this evil perverted material, since there is no restriction on it.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would hope that a decent person would put the children first and the sickos at the bottom of the list in allowing such filth to remain in the open for any age to see.
              </p>
              <p>
               Enjoy your perversions, and your defence of such grotesque materials, but don't expect decent people to agree with your point of view by not reporting it.
              </p>
              <p>
               My concern is for innocent people not perverts.

                You are a joke, how do you feel justified saying all this bullshit to a stranger? You don't know me yet you wanna insist I am a pervert. Guess what- one thing I have learned over the years is when a person cries loudly about the sake of the children, thats the one you gotta watch out for, so fuck you, and shut the fuck up you ignorant piece of shit

            Die Antwoord are trash! Look up the accusations that have come out against them. A girl named Zheani said that they groomed and trafficked her when she was a teenager, and that Ninja raped her and posted "revenge porn" of her online. If you search her name on youtube, there's a bunch of info on it, and she wrote a rap song about it that starts off "You said you fucking picked me cuz I look like your daughter. Sixteen? You're a disgusting pedophile cunt,"
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, and Yolandi and Ninja have a daughter they adopted as a baby, who they named Sixteen. They make me sick

             I didn't watch all of them, I put them on silence and dragged the line across to see if they had further pizzagate stuff.  Because, I have had posts taken down for not linking enough stuff, hence me not having posted much here!  Just trying to do the right thing.  Was I wrong?

              No, nothing wrong, but I guess I was asking what took you to the first video in the first place.  Just seems like an odd video to just "stumble" across.  Plus, like you said, they've obviously been on there for years.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, you can do a "report" of videos ... if you say "copyright infringement" or something like that, they'll usually take down the videos immediately, leaving the person(s) who originally put up the video to have to defend it.  If a video is old, chances are the original posters are not even around anymore.
