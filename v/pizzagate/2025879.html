              You're smart to not do that, honestly although I've been on the internet for 17 years I'm still an IDIOT when it comes to some things.  This whole pizzagate investigation has / is complete changing how I participate online.  I actually didn't even think I personally could be
              <em>
               found
              </em>
              on the internet, but when someone said they'd doxxed me from my name on Facebook I thought.... wait, what, how?!  Did a google search of my name plus city, and boom.  Fifth link down there was this fricken website that had me listed.  They've since taken down the info, but that was scary!!  (I've also changed out my current domain whois info to dummy info so hopefully they won't be able to spot me that way)

              Isn't it weird though that most legit sites for dating would actually tell you, you can't login until you're VERIFIED.  Have you tried to find as much info on these sites, like who owns them, and link them to anyone that way?

               P.S. I attached forensic proof to prove I'm not bluffing about Heidi Hendry's connection to the Greens Party David Shoebridge who's involved persecuting my 70 year old father with their proxy Garry Burns.If the attached document showing her address in Hanoi is true, she'll be ridiculed in Parliament for not even being a legal candidate, and stand to loose her US citizenship. If her handiwork is false, then she's peddling false documents with false qualifications to get close to me - stalking. Take a pic. One or the other, it can't be anything else. True or false document.

               Here is how filthy the persecution of my family is. Excuse the language. I can't mildly put this. Speaking of security I received death threats - even against my wife and child from this Garry Burns who associated with Heidi Hendry who's doing the Greens party's bidding stalking me, because her boss David Shoebridge of the Australian Greens party goes into court with Garry. So I'll just cut and paste two comments about the recent saga of the gay mafia tactics being used against my family - as well as my employer in Vietnam.

              <h2>
               This is Garry Burns or his sock puppet Jez Smith our gang exposed his facebook page talking about his love of underage boy sex in this youtube video done by my associate Tom.

               Garry just got NCAT.nsw.gov.au court to rule you must not critize Obama's friend Terry Bean (he says so on offical whitehouse dot gov youtube channel) being arrested for Underage Boy sex because haters must not hate gay marriage "queer heros" doing underage boy sex. Here is the judgement:
               <a href="https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/569ec29ee4b05f2c4f04aa7d">
                https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/569ec29ee4b05f2c4f04aa7d
               </a>
               The court ruled you also must not critize two gay marriage activists Mark Newton and Peter Truong must not be villified for calling the USA, Australia and Russia homophobic for delaying their kidnapping of a young baby without adoption / real surrogacy papers (human trafficking / kidnapping / anal rape of a 22 month old baby) Hear them say it in their own words on Government TV saying it's homophobic to be against gay dads baby rape

               - tiny uniform resource locator slash abcplugspedos - These men are now in Jail for 40 years in the USA after the Australian government broke it's own laws to issue a passport without a DNA test to alleged surrogate parents, so the Australian government is responsible for that baby boys anal rape in 7 countries by fellow gay marriage activists. Remember Gay dads are inclusive of NAMBLA you can't seprate that fact if two men can marry and get kids. Aren't we all proud of a new class of rape that didn't exist without gay marriage or gay adoption - gay dads incestual baby rape from birth (2 weeks oral 22 months anal) that it is a hate crime to loave. So love it up - love up your gay dads baby rape or be a homophobic hate criminal. Garry Burns got the court to rule it's a hate crime to detest gay marriage activists like Mark Newtown and Peter Truong fucking infants in court. Here's the judgment:
               <a href="https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/55da812de4b0012d84a75507">
                https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/55da812de4b0012d84a75507
               </a>
               The newspaper covered the decision and said he should stop "gay bashing online" as if you critize men who plead guilty to fucking infants you are criticizing all homosexuals because the court ruled they are the one and the same (i didn't say it - read the newspaper - criticizing mark newtown and peter truong = gay bashing)
               <a href="http://www.theherald.com.au/story/3172166/ex-cabbie-told-to-stop-gay-bashing/">

               </a>
               Let's all be proud of his achievements normalizing infant sex. Decent homosexuals should disown him, but I don't see any decent homosexuals denouncing Garry Burns work to normalize pedophilia by criminalizing dissent against acts of it done by queer heros like Terry Bean

               I'm married with family. My wife gives me a safe haven in a country a country where the government doesn't order it's citizens to respect and apologize for homo-sexually vilifying baby rapists. I deserve to die if I use a dating site with this sweet deal I got. I guess it's back to the drawing board for another way for the OTO pedophiles to frame me.
              </p>
              <p>
               I might just leak this old email. A week after Ted Osisus gay dads baby buyer met me and David Bottrill of Australian OTO child sex cult called my employer as a stalker this shit went down. Physical stalkers coming after me. I named and shamed them here, and got them fired from their job as a security risk (only to go to the next best school where diplomats send their kids in Hanoi as the IT manager)
              </p>
              <p>
               Michael Centre - United Nations Security Service - Hanoi,
(aka Michael Smith News - sorry to break your cover mate ;)
              </p>
              <p>
               I need to talk to you about an incident that occurred last year of a UN employee stalking a UNHCR confirmed political refugee (in Hong Kong before Snowden (me)  see document at (short link banned by voat) that I had to steal from hospital records as the UNHCR gives out no paperwork to applicants in HK.)
              </p>
              <p>
               As the matter will be esclated to a Parliamentary Inquiry in the near future, possibly publically I have to at least go against my better judgement and make my complaint offical to the UN in Hanoi (for fear of reprisals).
              </p>
              <p>
               Also see why I dropped the UNHCR application there, due to corruption in your organisation documented by the Hong Kong Human Rights Comission to Ledgo (government of HK) at
               <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/59838263/Hong-Kong-Human-Rights-Comission-attacks-UNHCR-atonymous-management-of-refugees">
                http://www.scribd.com/doc/59838263/Hong-Kong-Human-Rights-Comission-attacks-UNHCR-atonymous-management-of-refugees
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               The employee is Heidi Hendry of UN International School in Hanoi who has David Shoebridge MP sleeping over at her house (advertised on her twitter - archived since she pulled it along with her whole online profile) - who tended to my employer (I have a copy) a resume claiming she was a US/UK/AU citizen. If that document isn't resume fraud then she broke US citizenship legislation and Australian electoral laws if she didn't do fraud in the document. You can't be a ciziten of the United States and Political Candidate in a foreign government. Even voters in foreign elections lost their citizenship in the Supreme Court - so this is definatlely up from that.
              </p>
              <p>
               She never quit her job there and was involved in a failed entrapment operation at my former Employer of Niteco.se - in Xa Dan II. The incident involved threats of making false police complaints (now admitted on tape to my father / wife) in order to the original document involving her political scandal with her fingerprints all over it, because she was the Australian Greens Party Political Candidate For Murray-Darling Region.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's best a breif you in person. David Shoebridge MP her associate is going into court with Garry Burns who is suing my father for the crime of homosexual vilification of two published gay marriage activists who had anal intercourse with a Russian infant (Mark Newton and Peter Truong - note the later was a Vietnamese Australia).
              </p>
              <p>
               Because you can't believe this I'll just cut and paste a comment about this citing the case law of the pedophilia normalization activism her associates are using - and remember the see the actual court transcript of this pedophilia suspect (talking about having sex with boys online) at scribd.com/luke_mckee from my father's case.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a Parliamentary Inquiry into Garry Burns being possibly set up by the NSW Parliamentary Secretary for Justice and other concerned stakeholders in Australian and this incident of Garry Burns and his connection to your employee is relevant to those proceedings.
              </p>
              <p>
               The gay lobby isn't happy with me knowing the dirt I have on the US Gay Dads Ambassador Ted Osius and his boyfriend Clayton Bond who tried to be the first gay man to break Indonesian law with diplomatic immunity and procure a child there "hint: Google DJakata Djournal Septi" and see what comes up. They are also not happy I have the names of 100s of gay men doing overseas illegal commercial surrogacy breaking domestic laws here, in Thailand and Cambodia and our state laws in NSW, ACT, QLD. She is a gay activist and she's stalking me abroad. He had a gay dads baby buyers festival in Hanoi recently called AseanPride.com - celebrating gay families in Vietnam, where gay men getting kids here isn't exactly legal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Heidi Hendry never quit her job at the UN when she tried to become my superior at my place of employ, and rather than work with someone I don't trust I quit before her first day. She never took the job and the chances of an admitted associate of David Shoebridge MP who walks into NCAT.nsw.gov.au with Garrry Burns trying to be my boss in Vietnam - we both know the world is too small for that and this to be anything else but stalking.
              </p>
              <p>
               That's enough to get you started to line up an appointment to talk about the issue. I can bring a dossier of evidence. She also brought in an official from the Australian embassy and begged my employer to call the police on me for got knows what.The employer refused and she wasn't hired. I have recorded voicemail to back up the claims how desperate they were to get the original document back. Is she your employee or ASIS/ASIO or just an operative of a foreign political party embedded in the UN's owned school to get access to diplomats children and metadata about their parents?
              </p>
              <p>
               I dropped in to see the UNHCR commissioner in Hanoi 3 years ago. You might want to mention this happened, as she's s stakeholder.
              </p>
              <p>
               The submission to the Parliamentary inquiry will be public document in all likelihood. The Greens party she was with just legalized overseas exploitative commercial surrogacy paying Cambodian and Vietnamese women who travel there less than 1 dollar a hour for use of their crotch to breed babies for gay men. It's called the Sodomy party for good reason.

              </p>
              <p>
               As the complaint is serious maybe you could provide me some feedback on if you can or will take any action against this. Does she serve the UN's interest if she's working against it - and working for a state actor?
              </p>

            I thought I would put this here in a time sensitive fashion just minutes after I read the threatening emails from these pedophiles trying to project their own child abuse fantasies onto me. I'm a seasoned political activist and Political refugee, so I frankly am not freaking out. In fact I'll just go watch some TV and get back to programming.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Let this be a warning to all pizzagate researchers
            </strong>
            Hide your identity or the pedophiles will try and play games with you like you see here.
My lifestyle makes it is impossible for me to be a pedophile :) My wife and her friend are in the same room now and all my movements are tracked where I am. I'd love to see a failed allegation be made against me and have it defeated. It will only expose how desperate they are are to extradite me for 60C NSW Crimes Act that has a 100% death in custody rate before me. That kind of blocks extradition based on that fact alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Gay dads" exist because it provides the perfect cover for two males of unknown sexual preference to acquire children. Previously pedophiles had to steal other peoples children, but now thanks to "gay dads" we are hearing stories of children being raped from birth and legally owned as sex slaves. And then pedophiles sue you for exposing cases like that "Mark Newton and Peter Truong", i.e. my fathers case

            Hear him talk about it before he was found guilty of disrespecting those who buy and rape children from near birth (2 weeks old), and are allowed to own them in this brave new world we live in. If you point that out the gay/OTO/pedo mafia will come for you it's as simple as that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's my father talking with me about the crimes of the OTOAustralia.org.au Dr Gregory John Tillett founded special gay police before they came after him and sued him as well for disrespecting convicted pedophiles Mark J Netwon and Peter Truong (case law details:

            </a>
            Yes it's official in multiple cases pedophiles who said the magic words "I am gay" before they did the abuse must not be vilified under the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act 1979 '93 Crypto-Lesbian Clover "No' Moore amendments only used by her staffer and boylover Garry Richard Burns)

            This pedo troll is anon because if I unmasked him he probably knows what will happen next or at least what I would try to arrange for him back home in Australia.

             It reminds me of something I've posted the other day in
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
              v/pizzagatewhatever
             </a>
             . 
I was on youtube and I started seeing weird pedo titles and pictures on random suggested videos... disgusting. I immediately took the screenshots and didn't open the videos. 5 minutes later, the videos were back to their original names and pictures. Weird!

            Are they trying to upload child porn to dating sites pretending to be me? Or what I don't know. I've already emailed support of the 3 dating sites so far begging for the IP addresses of these cunts.

             Really do them Methodists admit they drink blood, piss and shit in spirit cooking OTO cakes of light too and say on Camera children must partake in orgy rituals too? I didn't know. Please provide sources.
Wanna be sued for religious vilification like the OTO is doing to us? I need to find a Methodist and you need to be in VIC or ACT Australia for it to work.
