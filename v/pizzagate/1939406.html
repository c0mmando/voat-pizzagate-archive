<p>The Rothschilds aren\'t at the top of the food chain, but they are one of the top public figures for the Jesuits. They also weren\'t always called the Rothschild\'s, the used to be the Bauer\'s. So, before we get into the Rothschild name, we will go over Bauer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bauer- 
&quot;Origins Available: Danish, German</p>
<p>The historical and enchanting region of Austria is the birthplace of the distinguished family name Bauer. Austria, which was originally home to a Celtic people, was conquered by the Roman Empire in about 15 BC. Following the fall of Rome, Austria was repeatedly invaded by barbarian tribes, such as the Vandals, Visigoths, and Huns, who swept in from the east. During the 5th and 6th centuries, the Alemanni, Avars and Slavs settled Austria. The Avars were defeated in 785 by the Frankish emperor Charlemagne, who set up the East Mark, which later became known as the Österreich. Otto I defeated the Magyars in 955. Austria was ruled by the Babenburger dynasty until 1278, when they were succeeded by the Hapsburg dynasty, which ruled Austria until the 20th century.</p>
<p>Bauer Early Origins</p>
<p>The surname Bauer was first found in Austria and Bavaria, where the name contributed greatly to the development of an emerging nation which would later play a large role in the tribal and national conflicts of the area. In later years the name branched into many houses, each playing a significant role in the local social and political affairs.</p>
<p>Bauer Early Notables (pre 1700)</p>
<p>During this period prominent bearers of the name Bauer were Bruno Bauer (1809-1882), who was a controversial German theologian, historian, and student of Hegel. Ludwig Amandus Bauer (1803-1846)...&quot;</p>

<p>Moving on... Now we get back to the Rothschild name since there was no mention of the term Jew in Bauer..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rothschild Early Origins-</p>
<p>The surname Rothschild was first found in Brunswick, where the name was anciently associated with the tribal conflicts of the area. They declared allegiances to many nobles and princes of early history, lending their influence in struggles for power and status within the region. They branched into many houses, and their contributions were sought by many leaders in their search for power.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Recorded in the spellings of de Rothschild, Rothchild, Rothschild and Rothchilt, this is a famous surname of Austro-German origins. It is said to have been habitational, and to originate from a house or houses which had a red shield as the doormarker, and this may well be so. Before the advent of street numbering it was the popular practice to designate a property by some form of display. In time the only properties that continued with the practise were inns and hotels. Most early recordings of the name are protestant, a few Catholic, and sometimes Jewish, and this multplicity of religions can cause confusion, but in fact has nothing to do with the origin. The famous banking family of Rothschild traces its origins back to a Meyer Rothschild, born in Frankfurt in 1743. As to what this family were called prior to this time is unclear, but it is almost certain that Rothschild was a name adopted by them. Prior to this date they would almost certainly have been refugees from the Turkish Empire or Middle Europe. Early examples of the surname recording taken from surviving German church registers of the period include: Simon Rothschild, who was christened at Bantrupe evangelical church, Lippe, on April 29th 1714, and Edmund Rothchild, christened at Burgsteirfurt katholic church, Westfalen, on July 14th 1813.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Treaty of Paris of 1763 designated
King George III “Arch-Treasurer and Prince Elector of the Holy Roman Empire.” And “according to the Encyclopedia Judaica [sic] the Rothschilds bear the title “Guardians of the Vatican Treasury.” The Vatican Treasury, of course, holds the imperial wealth of Rome. Imperial wealth grows in proportion to its victories in war — as the Jesuit empowerment Regimini militantis ecclesiae implies, the Church-at-War is more necessary than the Church-at-Peace. According to H. Russell Robinson’s illustrated Armour of Imperial Rome, Caesarean soldiers protect themselves in battle with shields painted red. Since the soldiery is the State’s most valuable resource (the Council of Trent admitted this in preferring the Jesuits to all other religious orders), it is easy to understand why the red shield was identified with the very life of the Church. Hence, the appropriateness of the name Rothschild, German for “red shield.” The appointment of Rothschild gave the black papacy absolute financial privacy and secrecy. Who would ever search a family of orthodox Jews for the key to the wealth of the Roman Catholic Church? I believe this appointment explains why the House of Rothschild is famous for helping nations go to war. It is fascinating that, as Meyer Rothschild’s sons grew into the family business, the firm took on the title Meyer Amschel Rothschild und Sohne, which gives us the notariqon MARS. Isn’t Mars the Roman God of War, whose heavenly manifestation is “the red planet”? There is powerful cabalah here, and there’s hardly an acre of inhabitable earth that hasn’t been affected by it in some way.”</p>

<p>“International finance and banking are 
NOT primarily ‘Jewish’. Many of the most powerful banking interests in the world are run by ‘Gentiles’. One of the most powerful forces in international banking is the Knights of Malta, a Roman Catholic military order controlled by the Jesuit Superior General. Sadly, even a certain segment of the ‘alternative media’ helps to propagate the LIE that ‘the Jews’ run international banking. Interestingly, one of the titles of the Rothschild banking dynasty is ‘Guardians of the Vatican Treasury’. ‘The Jews’, as a people, have been used for centuries as a ‘scapegoat’ by these international banksters and their secret societies, such as the Jesuit-controlled Knights of Malta. To label ‘the Jews’ as running banking, Hollywood, etc, is to throw out the proverbial ‘red herring’ designed to throw us off the scent of the ‘real controllers’.”</p>

            since they are deleting truth elsewhere. Realize you must know that it was proven through DNA studies in 2013 this truth regarding the Rothschilds (Baur). These alleged Jewish bankers are not Jewish at all. what was known as the Khazarian region. They practiced mysticism and were involved in the oral Talmudic practices but are really just Luceferian Jesuits. That is the great deception as you stated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people do not know the Vatican supported, funded, &amp; were part of Hitler's SS. I know this not by just reading history but know an eye witness whose father was in Hitler's inner circle and family were German Royalty. Stood on stage with Hitler in Berlin at age 8 during his German Youth speech to millions. She survived the war by never told the story until age 80 years when she told it to me in person. The Catholic Church was used to help indoctrinate children inside her school and inside her Fathers Movie Theaters he owned all over Germany in Munich.
           </p>
           <p>
            She also witnessed Hitler &amp; SS in her home involved in unspeakable evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            She did not know the truth until after the war when American soldiers rescued her and brought her at 17 years old along as the death camps were opened. She could not forgive herself until age 80 after releasing the burden and speaking the truth which she did to me on her deathbed. She was a very famous artist and I promised her I would tell the truth and her story in due time if it would benefit others.

             I had no idea about the DNA studies, but I know that most of the Nazis were trained at Jesuit schools. Including the propaganda master Joseph Goebbels.

             That's some awesome first hand knowledge. Please think about writing that up, keeping you anonymous for now. Personally, I would love to read the whole story, reguardless of what the shills say.

              Yes it is truely an amazing story. This person was/is world famous. She never trusted anyone with the truth but for reasons I can't explain right now she trusted me and over a year long period of time she told me everything. She was a close advisor to Dr. Carl Jung as well, I am not sure if everyone knows was a double agent working directly with Allen Dulles. She named names as well and lived in the US for the last decades of her life.
             </p>
             <p>
              She left hidden partial manuscripts and told me secret information that confirmed it all. She died on my Birthday at age 80 in my arms, old enough to be my grandmother in 2010. The last thing she ever did was sing Happy Birthday to me in her strong German accent.
             </p>
             <p>
              The story is hearwrenching and beautiful at the same time. She had never cried since she was eight years old until that final year. She cried in my arms for 3 days straight at the end.
             </p>
             <p>
              I promised if I ever told the story or wrote it I would only do so if it would help others know the truth. She said before she died it was now with me and she trusted me with it all and released me to share.

            A follow-up to my M. A. Rothschild family lineage post:
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh fuck, a couple of the Rothschild family headstones have an odd symbol on them, which could be a rose on a cross. Except the cross is X-shaped within a circle, and the rosey-looking blob is not centered but towards the top of the symbol.

            </p>
            <p>
             So, judge for yourself on the rose idea. My roommate thinks it's a bird. Also we only see the lower legs of what I call a cross. The circle might be some kind of wreath. There's some interesting detail at the top I don't understand.

             In the link I gave Springmeier thinks the red sign symbol was a six-pointed Seal of Solomon. It's not clear why he thinks so. However if this indeed was the family symbol wouldn't it show up on the gravestones?
            </p>
            <p>
             Great, now I'm even more paranoid than Fritz Springmeier. :)

            Here is Mayer Amschel Rothschild's paternal lineage, from geni.com:
           </p>
           <p>
            Uri Feibesch (Fajsch) zu Bacharach
born 1475
           </p>
           <p>
            Elchanan zur roten Rose
aka "Elchanan ben Uri", "Han", "Hon", "Hane", "Elkan", "Elchanan Bauer?"
born circa 1496
           </p>
           <p>
            Isaac (Isaak) Elchanan Bacharach, zum Hahn, zum rot. Schild
aka "Isaac Elchanan Rothschild", "Isak Bauer?"
born circa 1528
           </p>
           <p>
            Moses Isaac Rothschild
aka "Mosche Rotschild", "Mose zum rot.Schild"
born estimated between 1533 and 1591
           </p>
           <p>
            Herz Moses Rothschild, zur hinteren Pfanne
aka "Hirz Rothschild zur Pfanne", "Herts", "Hersz", "Naftali ben Mosche", "Hirsch", "Hertz"
born estimated between 1540 and 1660
           </p>
           <p>
            Kalman Herz Rothschild, zur Hinter Pfann
aka "Calmann"
born estimated between 1569 and 1689
           </p>
           <p>
            Moses Kalmann Rothschild
aka "Moses Bauer", "Mosche ben Kalman Rothschild"
born estimated between 1634 and 1688
           </p>
           <p>
            Amschel Moses Rothschild
aka "Anschel ben Mosche Rothschild"
born 1710
banker and goldsmith
           </p>
           <p>
            Mayer Amschel Rothschild
aka "Mosche Meir"
born 1744
           </p>
           <p>
            So we see a big variation in surnames, in fact all the 'zur', 'zum', 'zu' stuff means 'from' or 'of' I believe and predates surnames. However the surname "Rothschild" has been kicking around a long time before Mayer Amschel, "Bauer" is in there too. Seems like changing your name and picking a new surname was no big deal. All of these guys lived in Frankfurt-am-Main and all but the first buried in the same cemetary, geni.com includes photos of headstones. Note also that Mayer Amschel's dad was already a banker and goldsmith.
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes me wonder why the whole Rothschild name story is so bandied about. So what? The really interesting ancestral name to me is Elchenan zur Roten Rose. Does 'shild' merely mean 'plaque' or 'sign' and the original sign was a red rose? I think of Rosicrucians, they didn't start till 1616 officially. Their symbol is a red rose on a crucifix type cross (generally Jewish people don't like such crosses).
           </p>
           <p>
            The fringe conspiracy theorist Fritz Springmeier writes in his discussion of the Rothschilds:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The origins of the Masonic and Rosicrucian movements lie with the medieval alchemists. Manly P. Hall, Freemasonry’s greatest philosopher writes, ,,During the Middle Ages, alchemy was not only a philosophy and a science but also a religion. Those who rebelled against the religious limitations of their day concealed their philosophic teachings under the allegory of gold-making. In this way they preserved their personal liberty and were ridiculed rather than persecuted.
...
The oxide produced using quicksilver was considered magical and mystically identified with the god Osiris. As the reader may have already figured out, alchemy practiced Hermetic magic from ancient Egypt. Alchemy was really a front for the mystery religion of Satanic witchcraft. The leading alchemist was a german Richard Bauer who was alive sometime in the 14 or 15 hundreds. Richard Bauer is said to have been the only alchemist who was successful in transforming lead to gold. Whether that report is meant in an allegorical way, or some other way I do not know What I am trying to communicate is that the Bauer family was a leading alchemical family which secretly practiced Hermetic magic during the late Middle Ages."

             Good work! I'm sure the premise of the Rosicrucians was around long before they were officially named Rosicrucians.

            You are exactly right, certain ruling elite are re-serving the largest Jewish families up as scapegoats, to use them as examples and a sacrifice, just as they did to institute the original state of Israel through the first two world wars. It is their opus dei, the grand design and plan for their nephilim egregore.

             AN OVERVIEW OF THE OCCULTED POWERS
            </p>
            <p>
             Lurking behind the “Democratic Facade” (the so-called “democratic” governments that the public sees as the guiding hands in our world), are the Occulted Powers (OPs). The OPs are a criminal conglomerate of the local royal families throughout the world who are intermarried and/or interoperating with the global network of Jewish bankster families. Under this worldwide royal/Jew “elite,” there are a variety of secret societies (such as the Freemasons) and criminal gangs (such as the Triads) who recruit useful “commoners” into their conspiracy and run societies at the street level.
            </p>
            <p>
             As with any large gang of criminals, there is some degree of competition amongst the families as they compete for power, position and wealth within the syndicate, but they are all united in furthering their collective control and exploitation of the human race. They are the ones who have been pushing for ever more centralized control of humanity; they are the “globalists.”
            </p>
            <p>
             An interesting thing about these OPs is that they have their own system of spirituality, which can most accurately be called “the Mystery School.” Whether the gang leaders at the very top actually believe in the spiritual mumbo jumbo of the Mystery School, though, is unclear. There may be some sort of “spiritual” force feeding them their religion, or they may have simply made it up as a control mechanism for their underlings. Whether it’s real or made up, though, it plays a central role in everything they do.
            </p>
            <p>
             With this in mind, have a look at the Masonic art outside of the New Carrollton Federal Building in Lanham, Maryland…
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://redefininggod.com/understanding-the-nwo-strategy/">
              masonicart
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             …This sculpture depicts the Left Hand Path and the Right Hand Path of the OPs’ occultic spirituality. As you can see, the Left Hand (which sits on a black base) is pointing over to the open Right Hand (which sits upon a white base). This reflects the OPs’ practice of using the Left Hand (the “dark side,” which brings about destruction and chaos( FREEMASONS; 'JEWS' Chabad-lubavitch kabbalists ) to scare people into the open, welcoming Right Hand (the “light side,” which brings about construction and order (ie, THE GREEK ORTHODOX (RUSSIAN) CHURCH, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH = JESUITS).
            </p>
            <p>
             If you look upon the world situation now, you can see that the Anglo-American branch of the OPs are acting as the Left Hand (bringing terror, war, and theft that is destroying the existing world order and scaring humanity towards something new), and the BRICS branch of the OPs are acting as the Right Hand (“opposing” the actions of the Anglo-American axis and welcoming humanity into a “peaceful, fair” new world order that they are constructing THE REAL NWO; microchips, hi tech slavery). Once you understand this basic idea of how the Two Hands work together to control the world, everything you see around you starts making sense.

              If you understand the depth at which these people have been working real alchemical magical spells over long periods of time, such as the Hegelian dialectic, through generations of their rich families, you can begin to get a grasp of what it took to orchestrate WWI and  WWII, as PURE CATALYSTS or empathy engines, for the institution of the original state of Israel in 1948. Millions of lives sacrificed to moloch, satan, lucifer, enki, enlil, whatever name it chooses, with concentration camps set up on a pentagonal grid, feeding the worlds ley lines while propaganda does the rest of the work.
             </p>
             <p>
              We all know ISIS is a western created terrorist organization to scare people from their homelands to wreak havoc on western values, saving Israel for last, Isis will stage a massacre of non-involved 'true' jews and muslims, bringing about in self fulfilling prophecy the word of the bible and koran, serupticiously convincing billions of the validity of the bible and koran and a 'unification' of religions, and finance, for the entire world...

              The rebuilt temple (to satan) in Jerusalem.
             </p>
             <p>
              Imagine the sacrifices it is going to take to rebuild this one.

            The problem with calling them "Jews" is most Jews don't have a clue about the globalists evil ways. The people pushing to have them called Jews are the same people who push to have every gun owner labeled as a lunatic and every constitutionalist a right wing racist.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, I supplied enough proof to show that the richest family in the world, who everyone claims is Jewish, isn't answering to Isreal they are answering to Rome.

             I do know they played a large part in the state of Isreal. This thread proves that's their cover, synagogue of satan style. The people of Isreal don't deserve to be blamed for the doing of the Jesuits. Look at what the plan is for those people...

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the 'agentur' of the 'Illuminati' between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion. We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.

                  Jewish encyclopedia is fact?  U know what cryptos are right (assuming ur tellin me german church records say theyre jesuits)?  By the way are they the actual records or an author telling u so?    Also if it was a jesuit master plan to wipe out israel n the mid east, y protect israel so much (in the press, with us n other countries aid) so that 75% of the western populations dont even realize israel is at least as to blame as palestinians?

                   German Church records prove they're Catholic. The Jewish encyclopedia inadvertently admits they are the keepers of the Papal treasure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The people who claim the Jews are behind everything always say to look at who you can't criticize. The Jews are openly criticized every day. The Jesuits, not so much. You can't talk about the black pope. Take this thread for instance.. Im pretty sure it's been completly removed from the "hot" algorythm on this site.

I'm not on here as often as I probably should be, but is there any actual clout to this claim, or is it just like most claims here?  Source please.

            Nice work!  But riddle me this...jesuits have been in existence for what, 2000 years or less?  How long have the talmudist been around?  Like 6000+?  Probably more as they tend to hide our history?  Just sayin'

             I'm not trying to prove that the Jesuits are older than the Talmud. I'm trying to show you that the black pope and his crew are the ones hiding behind the Jews. You know, the Synagogue of satan.

i am as "white" American and gentile as it gets. baptist raised. non-religious. humanist. 
as if it matters. 
thanks, but i don't interrogate the racial and ethnic identities of people i meet based on my own theories and assumptions, in order to harass or intimidate them.

             Half of the people you stormfront guys/gals claim are Jews or "crypto jews" aren't even Jews. So, the numbers are skewed. Not to mention, if you're the richest people in the world and you control everything, you hire who you want. Who better to hire than the people you're hiding behind? Chess not checkers.

            you're obviously insane. most people know nothing about this crap, and most 'jewish' people i know aren't religious and aren't evil, they're normal americans. your lack of semantic discernment is troubling and yet not surprising. what do i hold onto? humanity, ethics, compassion and love.

            nope, it takes your power away. bash satanism, elites, evil, war, organized religion, pedophiles, etc.... stop giving idiots ammo to hurt their fellow citizens who are simply living their lives as part of the masses.

            Some say Loyola was an Illumbrado/Allumbrado. Even the crappy Wikipedia says: "Ignatius of Loyola, while studying at Salamanca in 1527, was brought before an ecclesiastical commission on a charge of sympathy with the alumbrados, but escaped with an admonition."

            Weishaupt also had ties to the Alumbrados. Hey Alumbadros, Illuminati, it's the same meaning, the illuminated ones.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's an interesting article by researcher Juri Lina. He claims the Spanish Conversos (I prefer this term because 'Marranos' means 'pigs'!) founded the Alumbrados.

            It's interesting Lina gives Rothschilds original name as Meyer Amschel (not Bauer). What's with that?

            therefore, they are not jews.... and jew bashing is simply a misdirection that confuses many good people who will take no part in this type of rhetoric.... call out zionism on its face when required... not a people, not a whole religion.... one could as easily argue that catholics and various christian sects are evil and satanic as well.... yet it is "jews" who are consistently referenced in forums like these, with all manner of vile rhetoric and ((special)) attention. Just as your material referenced, the elites sow division within the masses to prevent unity....blacks, muslims, gays, abortion rights and right on down the line.... we the people are more alike than different.

            It's interesting that in later years the Frankists moved to (Rothschild home town) Frankfurt, became sort of a paramilitary organization (followers spent their time drilling), and were rumored to be supported periodically by barrels of (Rothschild?) gold.

                 You are a trained SJW, even if you don't realize it. You have the same train of thought as BLM except they're negative images of each other. Not only are you getting cucked, but you're a major part of the problem with the world. You eat uo the glovalist divide and conquer technique because 1) you're a useful idiot or 2) you're a paid shill.

            NO, they are not.  The families at the TOP of the food chain you have never heard of. They are not in newspapers, and their photos aren't on FB and Twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            “International finance and banking are NOT primarily ‘Jewish’. Many of the most powerful banking interests in the world are run by ‘Gentiles’.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are repeating Phelps' and Unhived Mind DISINFO.  They are ALL JEWS because of interbreeding/intermarriage (see below).  Jews CREATED Catholicism and Christianity to mind-enslave the goyim and conquer the West.
           </p>
           <p>
            EVERY POPE HAS BEEN A DE FACTO JEW.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Gentiles" in the Vatican are Tribe of Dan de facto Jews, cousins to Judah and their partners in crime.  The Danites/Aryans have been interbreeding with Judah for MILLENNIA.  That's why I call them de facto Jews.

             What are you going on about? The Rothschilds are one of the thriteen families. They ARE at the top of the food chain. Where are you getting this angle?  "NO, they are not. The families at the TOP of the food chain you have never heard of. They are not in newspapers, and their photos aren't on FB and Twitter."...Then how do you know who they are or that THEY exist? Name them, or present your source that the Rothschilds and other 12 families ansewer to them. Interesting you are quick to shoo people away from Rothschilds. Look no further, they own all the central banks.

             from our friend "Wisconsin is corrupt"

             Sabbatian Frankist 
It is all connected, and we will dig into this further, but here are quite a few things that we do know if you can help connect more dots with the bigger Sabbatean Frankist illuminati picture. 
We know for certain that the Clintons have deep rooted connections to Racine, Wisconsin. We can expand in any number of ways on that if needed, but they are tied through Chuck Schumer and Knights of Pythias as well as John Podesta and Pilgrims Society, and many other connections. Racine is also tied to the RNC and John McCain (who we know through a close contact) through Paul Ryan and others This are just a few reasons why Racine is a main "Root". We also know for certain the Clintons aligned with Bruce Willis and Demi Moore along with others in Hollywood circles awhile ago, and they aligned with Ashton Kutcher who we know personally (his real name is Chris). The art, music, movie, media and tech industries are aligned through many of the same groups. We know they use Art in Embassies and other programs to assist in smuggling, and they create front groups to control both sides of every issue. The most recent is Ashton Kutcher, John McCain, the Clintons, the corrupt church, corrupt 'foundations', and corrupt law enforcement joining forces to create The Fight to End Exploitation. We also know Timothy Dolan personally, and know that he was groomed in another cesspool of St. Louis and moved to Milwaukee to cover up pedogate in the church. He is the real Black Pope. 
We have deep, well-founded concerns about Trump and our own government. Trump's campaign was given information well before Pizzagate ever started (as was Sanders campaign). Jill Stein was the only one to show a genuine level of concern, however she failed to fully comprehend the bigger picture and is misguided in her efforts which we can explain later. Loretta Lynch personally stopped RICO investigations in Racine that were connected to local, state, national and global racketeering networks that included the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiatives and other significant groups. The feds worked with corrupt law firms to kill local cases, and refused to investigate other overlapping cases that were clear cut cases of brazen criminal corruption among officials at all levels. We know with absolute certainty that Racine, Wisconsin enforcement is controlled and complicit to extreme levels of trafficking, abuse, murder, stalking, racketeering, and other nefarious activities among those involved. They use the mafia and gangs openly. Nothing is printed without consent of the handlers. 
What is happening in Racine is not only criminal corruption, but something much more evil and sinister that is linked to population control, mind control, open slavery, education and religious reform, industrial reform, community policing, racketeering, blackballing, extortion, blackmail, embezzlement, murder, trafficking, pedo and sexual deviation, and satanic ritual abuse. There are so many connections it is scary. Open pizza ovens at Bohemian camps, corrupt pedo Boy Scouts, freemasons, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Pilgrims Society, DHS connections, Rotary, Vaccine programs, Zika virus and mosquito test labs, some of this stuff may seem ridiculous on its own, but after seeing what these people are capable of and who is involved, you begin to understand how it is all connected. It is much too complex to summarize for most people, and we have something bigger in the works along with protection mechanisms, however when you know your own government is involved, there may be nothing that can be done. Here is an excerpt from a blog that we are concerned may be true about Trump. 
No one will investigate Racine, Wisconsin. Not the local, state or federal authorities. Not the media. No one. It is the most taboo subject in the world. We never wanted to have to tell everyone about Racine. We don't want a YouTube channel. We only want to be safe, and we are concerned that may not be possible when no one will understand how deep this goes. Demons, pedos and secret societies run Racine, they run Wisconsin, they run Pennsylvania, they run Arizona, they run Denver, DC and other hubs, they run Hollywood, and it appears they run America. Everyone ignores it, and the only option is to tell people the truth about little Racine hoping they will some day understand what a big role it plays in this global nightmare. 
Rabbi Marvin Antelman (193?-2014) deserves credit for exposing the origin of the modern Illuminati in a "heretical" Cabalist Jewish movement named after its progenitors Sabbatai Zvi (1626-1676) and Jacob Frank (1726-1791.) This mostly Jewish movement which includes Freemasons assumes the identity of the target population and subverts it from within. A Jewish authority, Gershom Scholem, describes them as "demonically possessed." They are the satanists behind Terror, Communism and the NWO. Trump is one. - See more at:

            <p>
             <p>
              Here some translation and background:
             </p>
             <p>
              Me'ir Amshel Bauer changed his name twice.
             </p>
             <p>
              First from "Bauer' to "Rothschild" around 1750,and later he changed his first name from "Me'ir" to "Mayer". in around 1802.
             </p>
             <p>
              Symbolism and meaning of these words in German and Hebrew are important.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bauer in German means Farmer or Builder,
             </p>
             <p>
              Rothschild means Red Shield in Old German,and translates into Hebrew as "Magen Adom',and that means "Shield/protector of Adom/Edom/Red "  Adom /Edom means  'Red"
             </p>
             <p>
              Me'ír means Bright ,Enlightened in Hebrew.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mayer means Leadsman or Mayor in German.
             </p>
             <p>
              Amshel means "People of" in Hebrew.
             </p>
             <p>
              So let's see what changed:
             </p>
             <p>
              Me'ir Amshel Bauer-----"Bright/Enlightend one (of the People) of the Farmer/Builder."
             </p>
             <p>
              Mayer Amshel Rothschild------"Leadsman of ( the People of ) the Shield/Protector of Edom"
             </p>
             <p>
              So "Bright Farmer/Builder " became "Protector of Edom".
             </p>
             <p>
              In Judaism the Edomites are very bad news,so Rothschild is hiding behind names and activities ,but are the real enemy of all Jews.

              Oh, are you saying all child molesters are Jesuits? In fact, is there any specific link between Jesuits and child molesting? Sounds like you have made up your mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps you misunderstood my comment. There are many people blame Jewish leaders, Zionists, Sabbatean/Frankists, OTO, royals, bankers, etc. etc. So if it's not actually the Jesuits  (and I am not a fan of them), promoting that the Jesuits could be behind it could actually be a deflection. Frankly I don't know. Perhaps it's all of them. I posted on this thread because I wasn't aware of a Rothschild/Jesuit link.
             </p>
             <p>
              What about any responsible person who 'hogs wealth' to provide for themselves in old age? Oh, gosh, people are starving. I think you are some kind of Marxist, very young person, Mr. Puppet.

               What I know is a lot of politicians went to a jesuit school. I think it would be a good idea to make a list of all the elite people we know that went to a jesuit school. Some of those elite schools have been having rape or pedophilia scandals.

               I know new french president Macron went to one, and started dating his teacher when he was officially 16, but probably 14 or less. They're married now but the persisting rumour says he's actually gay. One of the man linked to him, Matthieu Gallet, got the job of director of the n•1 public radio at 40, and was before that the "protégé" of several big media persons and politicians (all of them gay, one involved in pedophilia scandals as well) in France. 
I have sources for all of this, I need to make an article but it's all in french.
