   DC Devotchkas (devotchka means young girl in Russian) apparently knows a lot about Comet Ping Pong, and how "by night, things get sexy"; they also rave about young girls' first periods.

<p>Why does the blog obsess over first periods and candy crush? Why does it post pictures such as <a href="https://postimg.org/image/4r90aj4lh/">this</a> or <a href="https://postimg.org/image/we8g2r5zr/">this</a>? Is Liza, an apparent waitress at Comet Ping Pong, the author of this drivel?</p>
<p>There may be several insights and/or names of interest on this blog. There are pictures of Bryce Reh (manager of CPP) and his girlfriend/wife (caption &quot;we fell in love at comet ping pong&quot;) and things like:</p>

<p>The King of Smug, Bryce Reh, says gems like, “Liza, you were a C grade waitress, but you’re B grade now” or “My wife is the best at everything because she’s Serbian” and “I’m not gay because I’m married.”</p>
<p>Everyone does their job well and parties hard afterwards. Especially, self proclaimed “God’s Gift to Comet,” Matty PG. </p>

<p>Also, who is the old man in the picture with the caption &quot;Just lurkin, just lurkin, just lurkin&quot;? Does anyone get the joke?</p>
<p>I haven\'t digged deep enough into the material. I thought it warranted a post already. And TV-generation drivel bores me like you wouldn\'t know; I\'m not even getting all the references. I need your help looking at this.</p>',

            I just read most of this blog, here's my take: I'm not seeing much in it. This girl likes to write funny and stupid stories about herself, and her friends. She makes good-natured fun of her older relatives. When she's writing about "socialism," she's describing socializing/being sociable (purposefully, and I found that part kinda clever). Her stuff about Comet Ping Pong, well, we already know their MO, so this doesn't give us any big surprises. All-in-all, this sounds like a creative, young girl, with a bunch of friends, with more experience than some girls their age, and less parental supervision/discipline. They'll blossom (or have already) into hipster adults, be annoying in public, contribute nothing measurably productive to society, and look fabulous until they hit about 36.

            Full disclosure I had discovered this in November, and had posted it on

             r/pizzagate
            </a>
            before the ban (inside a thread about something else), it got forgotten (I could find no reference of it on Voat).
