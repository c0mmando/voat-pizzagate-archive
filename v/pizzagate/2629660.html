<p>&quot;WASCO, CALIF.  — </p>
<p>A convicted child molester in California was beaten to death by a fellow inmate just five days after his arrival at the prison where he was to be processed into the larger prison system. </p>
<p>Agustin Duran, 66, was attacked Saturday in a day room of Wasco State Prison, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation officials said Wednesday in a news release. Wasco is a short-term prison where incoming inmates are processed, classified and evaluated, both physically and mentally, to determine the appropriate prison requirements to serve out their sentences. </p>
<p>Duran was booked into the facility July 2 from Los Angeles County, where he was sentenced to 55 years to life for lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 years old, the news release said.</p>
<p>Prison officials said correctional officers responded around 7:20 p.m. Saturday to the day room after an inmate, identified as Andres Donicio Ayon, 19, began beating Duran in the face and upper body with his fists. </p>
<p>“An alarm was sounded and all inmates got down on the ground with the exception of Ayon, who continued to strike Duran,” the CDCR news release said. “Responding staff utilized a pepper spray grenade and Ayon complied and got down on the ground in a prone position.</p>
<p>“Staff placed Ayon in handcuffs and escorted him to a temporary holding cell.” </p>
<p>Duran was taken to a triage area for treatment and was airlifted to an outside hospital about an hour after the attack, the news release said. He died there the following afternoon.</p>
<p>Ayon was treated for minor injuries in the prison’s infirmary before being placed in the Administrative Segregation Unit. Duran’s slaying is being investigated as a homicide, officials said. </p>
<p>Ayon, who was booked into Wasco June 22 from Kern County, is serving a six-year sentence for second-degree robbery and use of a deadly weapon, the news release said. Kern County District Attorney’s Office investigators are assisting in the probe of Duran’s death. </p>
<p>The case that put Duran at Wasco was apparently not his first involving sexual molestation of a child. California’s Megan’s Law website, which tracks registered sex offenders, lists him as a registered offender since at least 2013. </p>
<p>Duran was previously convicted of sexual battery, lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14 years old and annoying or molesting a child with a prior conviction for a specified sexual offense, according to the website. Details of his previous cases were not included in the information.&quot;</p>

            We have reached the point where our jailed criminals have more decency, integrity and morals than those on the outside.   Sorry, but I feel very little sympathy for pedophiles abused in prison.  Yes, it's tragic all around because usually the pedophiles were themselves victims of sexual abuse. But they are now adults and they have the power to not act on their urges.

            A group of men were convicted of a gang rape and murder of a young woman. They brutally tortured her before she died.  In prison, some of these men were attacked by other inmates, who stuck a steel pipe up their anuses with barbed wire in it. The steel pipes were then pulled out leaving the barbed wire stuck up their anuses.

            Some of these gang members with life long criminal records should have committed the crime, they all started out as protection for their communities right? Child molesters hold no race boundaries. I’m sure they prefer their particular type but like all rock spiders they get what they can take.
The real crime is how was a previously convicted child molester out of prison? You rape a child or are in possession of child porn and you are convicted, you go to prison until you become a fossil.  Personally I think you should be killed, but that would never fly these days, so in lieu of that back to option 1.

            I guess this molester's urges were just too strong. Such persons do not make  good parents to begin with and they should just be castrated,  and I am dead serious.

             There is debate about the efficacy of castration or any other preventive measure, and because of this, there should be no second chances for child rapists imo.

             "Rape crisis workers say that violence, not sex, is the real problem, which castration fails to address. "This misfocuses the issue and feeds into the myths about rape," said Denise Snyder, executive director of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. "Sexual assault is a crime of violence and aggression . . . not the product of an uncontrollable sex drive."
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem is often in the brain, not the testicles, said Barbara K. Schwartz, director of the Sex Offender Treatment Program at Twin Rivers Correctional Center in Monroe, Wash. A rapist who has been castrated "could still be a phenomenal danger. He can go out and, instead of raping people, he can assault them with broom handles or bottles or beat them up or kill them." "

              you are right about the literature but there you are dealing with chemical castration  which may not be as effective as people think.  Ancient cultures employed actual removal of the testicles to create eunuchs to  serve and guard harems.

              Gelded horses  and nuetered dogs are  for the most part  quite neutral sexually,  only occasionally aroused..
             </p>
             <p>
              I agree that rape of an adult peer  is based in large part on violence and power  but  I am not convinced as to.children.   Men, and its mostly men , aren't  commiting a violent act when  watching child pornography.  Those with violent urges  will select violent pornography.  The news is filled with men murdering children devoid of any sex.  So I think we still have a long ways to go to understanding all of this but I favor drastic measures (other than murder!) until we know more.   Thanks for the discussion.

               From the article:
              </p>
              <p>
               "In Denmark in the late 1950s and early 1960s sex offenders were permitted to choose prison or surgical castration. Research on 900 castrated sex offenders showed that the rate of repeat offenses was low, about 5 percent."
              </p>
              <p>
               Here they are talking about surgical castration.  My point is that even a "low" 5% rate of reoffending is too much.  So is anything above zero.  The assault of even one child by a person who has previously been identified as an offender is simply not acceptable IMO.

                Thanks for that info.. Those are better results than I would have expected. But what can we do? A life sentence in a prison to insure 0% recidivism?  Bill Clinton got a bill.passed that called for 3 strikes, ie felonies, then a life sentence which in the case of a  child molester could very well turn into a death sentence.

                 Life in captivity is appropriate IMO.
                 <strong>
                  You can be assured that child rapists are keenly aware of what their lives in prison would be like if caught and convicted, but they still make the decision to rape
                 </strong>
                 .
                </p>
                <p>
                 I ask you, how is it appropriate to release a KNOWN predator with ANY potential to reoffend into a society full of innocent children?
                </p>
                <p>
                 How many children do you think it would be okay to put at risk in order to ensure that a convicted child rapist doesn't get hurt in prison?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I believe you don't really want to put any children at risk, but I urge you to think about this in real world terms.  When these creeps are released from prison, children are at risk.  It is a fact.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We need to take off the rose-colored glasses and adjust penalties to match crimes.
                 <strong>
                  A child's entire life is stolen when he or she is raped--their whole life--and they didn't get to choose whether or not they wanted to have their lives ruined.
                 </strong>

            Nobody cares when a child molester is killed, but I find this glee distasteful given how we all know that wrongful convictions based on false rape accusations do happen... :/ I don't think we should tolerate our prisons being this barbaric for anyone, even those we wish death. I highly recommend Louis Theroux's BBC documentary on Miami prisons if you haven't seen it. Let's not let ourselves become monsters just because others are.

              Really? Why would you say that? Consistently, in a prison full of lawbreakers- some murderers, the pedophile is always looked down on and sometimes is killed by them. What do they know?

               : I  happen to be against capital  punishment  even for molesters and all to frequently fellow prisoners play judge, jury and executioner. Im not opposed  to life imprisonment, solitary confinement, physical and chemical castration.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now I wonder how many molesters will serve no time because a judge doesnt want to see the culprit murdered.

                I happen to be FOR capital punishment. Especially for child RAPISTS / MURDERERS.
Pizzagate/ VOAT exists because these SCUM have not been executed. They HAVE NO FEAR, therefore the global Satanic Empire is run by them and CHILDREN ARE CONTINUALLY HARMED, to the detriment of our civilization.

            ive been to jail, plenty of times. I WAS a degenerate. Now I am reborn in Christ and Work on myself constantly. But in jail pedo are killed. and beaten if not killed. Most of the time when a new inmate comes in the other will ask the basic question, what are you in here for? Most pedos arent stupid enough to admit to it, so they come up bullshit stories, and they change over time. if we get a jacket (your charges on paper from the court / record ) on someone nd it has pedo shit on it. you are going to be beaten to a pulp and told to PC yourself. PC = protective custody with all the other skinners. Beating pedos does increase your rank in gangs and status in there. NO ONE likes them. even the guards will tell the inmates on the low that an inmate is a pedo, he knows what we will do. they will look the other way MOST of the time.

             hey Giiost glad you’re here and that you are living a better lifestyle for yourself. It’s tough but keep doing what you’re doing. I don’t think I’ve seen you post on pizzagate before, what brings you here? If it’s personal no need to answer.

              even the guards will tell the inmates on the low that an inmate is a pedo, he knows what we will do. they will look the other way MOST of the time.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So it sounds like this must be a pretty common occurrence nationwide...which makes me wonder why it's in the news this time around? I wonder if this is part of the public narrative push to protect pedos as victims?

              100% I agree with that thought. Skinners / pedos are always killed and beat up in jail. most of the time ruled suicide. unfortunately this one was caught on tape right?

              Well, if that is their  purpose, they had better stand back, it will only infuriate the prison and public even more so.  One thing I can tell you, is that the whole area where the Child Rapist lived, is infested and loaded with sex offenders.  Whenever they are on a map, they have to be on a sex offender list.  That means they are considered dangerous.  They must be very bad to be on that list.  Would not be surprised if LE is involved in this whole mess.  They jury made sure he would at least get 55 yrs.  As I said, there is no way LA would let a pedo get 55 yrs.  Something behind the curtains here.  Possible arranging of his death and those guards letting him die off.  A set up for sure, imo.  That whole area is a planned community for pedos. But for what reason?  Someone said they remembered a pizza parlor in that area.

              YES  Way too many imo.  Wonder if there is something going on in that area.  Is there not a law about how many in a neighborhood, there should be.  Also near schools as well.

            The 19 year old probably was a victim, knew a victim, or had a relative around the age/knew the victim. Just stating the obvious here. Or like another said, he just hated pedos.

             Probably a mix of hating pedos and gaining some friends in prison. A guy I knew was serving time in federal for drug trafficking (coke/crack). First day he saw two senior guys fighting. Turns out one guy was an old biker and the other was a pedo.  Pedo ended up dying and the biker who was a lifer anyway ended up being a bit of a celebrity in his yard. People were giving him smokes, hash, hooch etc. If its one thing nobody likes. Its a god damn Pedo.

             Yes, most def he could have been a victim.  If he was, what Sweet Revenge.  I don't think he would care for serving more years.  Hopefully more will come out about this case.

              Sure it will. The dude could be in there for slaughtering children or some shit, but at least he saved the taxpayers money for someone who murdered one of their own. Waiting to see where this goes.

            The dead sex offender child rapist was 65.  His attacker is 19.  The rapist has been arrested before for child sex offenses.  We know his must have been doing this for decades.  Could Ayon, the attacker, have been one of his Victims? Or does he just hat Child Rapists as much as we do.  Don't know, but either way this is still good news.  He did our job for us.

              Lots of angles. The wrestlers who said Jordan knew about the doctor touching their manly no no places were also involved with the penitentiary system. Could be another form of blackmail. At least you get the point that there is no reason to extend your stay when you are 19.

              There are all kinds of gangs yes and willing to do almost anything to get out.  I also am wondering if this Duran was protected by LE and they now wanted him out of the way. Was he part of something they did not want to come out in a trial?   I can't imagine any sex offender getting 55 years in LA.  Something is up with that.

              It is not so simple. I saw guys bragging about their crimes in county, only to get you to admit yours. Ever hear of undercover cons? Same thing happens in a place like that. Throw in a corrupt warden and staff, and it is hell on Earth. You may cheer him on, but he just extended his sentence. He is just a stupid kid. Freedom with 35,000$ is a better place to start a fight.

               Yessir, did a few years in a couple of federal pens and a state pen. I'm aware of how it can work. In this case however the kid attacked him in the middle of the day-room. He was either trying to make a name for himself (with 6 years left) because he's a crash dummy, or more likely he flipped the fuck out because the motherfucker tried to rape him. 
..either way good riddance to the souless fuck he killed.

                Yep, Things can get mighty strange when you lose your freedom. Another scenario is a fake story, and missing pervert, because he knew something. The kid who killed him might be free right now, and no one would ever know. They could scrub the initial article tomorrow and we would probably not notice it even if archived. Ever hear of the prison mortician? Huahuahaha!
