<p>The dude in the video is not &quot;Bill Wood&quot;. His real name is &quot;David Brockbrader&quot;...And he is a convicted child sex offender.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BOISE – A federal jury in Boise today found William N. Brockbrader, 40, of Garden Valley, Idaho, guilty of failure to register as a sex offender, U.S. Attorney Wendy J. Olson announced.</p>
<p>During the three-day trial, the jury heard evidence that Brockbrader, in 1998, was convicted of three sexual offenses against a minor while serving in the United States Navy. After serving three years of incarceration, Brockbrader was released on parole in Utah in 2001. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December 1997, the defendant, William Newel Brockbrader, was convicted by general court martial for the crimes of Sodomy, Carnal Knowledge with a Child Under Age Sixteen, and Indecent Acts with a Child Under Age Sixteen, violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Articles 125, 120, and 134. Superseding Indictment at 2, Dkt. 30. On April 21, 1998, a military judge sentenced him to dishonorable discharge, confinement for 11 years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a reduction in pay grade. General Court-Martial Order Number 18-98 at 1, Ex. A to Motion to Dismiss on Statutory Grounds, Dkt. 61-2. The confinement and forfeiture were suspended to allow Mr. Brockbrader to participate in a sexual abuse therapy program. Id. Brockbrader was released from custody in June 2001.</p>
<p>When Brockbrader was released, he signed a &quot;Prisoner\'s Acknowledgement of Sex Offender Registration Requirements,&quot; in which he acknowledged that he was subject to sex offender registration requirements in whichever state he resided: &quot;I am subject to registration requirements as a sex offender in any State or U.S. territory in which I reside, be employed, carry on a vocation, or be a student.&quot; Acknowledgment, Ex. B. to Motion to Dismiss on Statutory Grounds, Dkt. 61-3. Brockbrader also acknowledged that, if he moved to another state, he must report the change of address to the responsible agency in the state he was leaving and comply with the registration requirements in the new state of residence. Id. He registered in the state of Utah in 2001 and apparently continued to register in Utah through 2008. He then apparently moved to Nevada and then Idaho. Brockbrader\'s travel from Nevada to Idaho allegedly occurred &quot;on or after April 24, 2011.&quot;</p>

            Thanks for the heads up on the nature of this Wood guy. Unfortunately, since you've chosen a username spoofing one of our well known subscribers and might be mistaken for him, I have to give this our "Possible Disinformation" flair. That conduct shows ill will.

             I flaired this "Possible Disinfo" due to the impersonator username. Since we don't have an official rule on the matter, that seems like the prudent course.

            Did they have knowledge of his crime known before or after his interviews about looking glass?  Just wondering since they blackmail the ones with power/control/information.   Did Kerry casidie know.  I heard she threw him under the bus.
