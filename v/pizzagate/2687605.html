<p>There is also this one that would almost depict an outdoor pool- <a href="https://imgur.com/a/33RuJPD">https://imgur.com/a/33RuJPD</a></p>
<p>Which thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/user/letsdothis2">@letsdothis2</a> discovered there WAS an outdoor pool -</p>
<p>&quot;In this image <a href="https://imgur.com/a/aHooW4W">https://imgur.com/a/aHooW4W</a> you can see the leaves on the floor. So, I thought that would mean an outdoor pool or something like that. Guess what? Biltmore had an outdoor pool which was built by Edith Vanderbilt in the 1930s but later filled in <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/22/9c/3e229c7ab68a1a82d51886196fb6dc22.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/22/9c/3e229c7ab68a1a82d51886196fb6dc22.jpg</a>  ; <a href="https://www.biltmore.com/blog/article/in-the-good-old-summertime">https://www.biltmore.com/blog/article/in-the-good-old-summertime</a>&quot;</p>
<p>More from <a href="https://voat.co/user/exposethecriminals-">@exposethecriminals-</a> </p>
<p>&quot;I believe it\'s highly likely some of the pool paintings of children are based on them being harmed, or worse, in the Biltmore House pool -- I have made many, many comments in this thread supporting that. But many people don\'t notice who writes what comments, so, I just want to clarify that before my comment, below. I\'m just trying to add more information, not take away from the pool information:</p>
<p>By the way, in case this is helpful to anyone -- from personal experience:</p>
<p>As someone who is a survivor of Pedogate (1960\'s - approximately 1980\'s,) although I\'ve never officially been to the Biltmore Estate, I have recognized three areas of it since v / PG and v / GA started researching it.</p>
<p>I basically just recognize having been on the main staircase, and in the fourth floor room with the spiral staircase that looks like an office (&quot;the observatory,&quot;) in a bad but not horrible way. However I get a very bad vibe-memory from the third area, which is the room at 5:40 with the architectural model of the house. I can only assume they must have done horrible things to us children in that room, and maybe still do. All three areas are in this video from 4:45 - 6:10 or so:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/HCpgA-zD0H0?t=285">https://youtu.be/HCpgA-zD0H0?t=285</a> &quot;</p>
<p>There are also apparently tunnels under the estate as shown in this Reddit post -</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/98c2ll/about_the_biltmore_pool_found_this_while_looking/?sort=top">https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/98c2ll/about_the_biltmore_pool_found_this_while_looking/?sort=top</a></p>
<p>And also this photo of the waterfall just outside the estate that has a large drain that could be easily accessed by a person- <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mzmUOrD">https://imgur.com/a/mzmUOrD</a></p>
<p>Edit: Spelling and grammar</p>
<p>Edit: Adding more pictures and info</p>
<p>Edit: More from <a href="https://voat.co/user/exposethecriminals">@exposethecriminals</a></p>
<p>&quot; A 1900 book describes the Biltmore House pool as being 50 feet long x 50 feet wide, and marble.</p>
<p>It\'s not that size, and it\'s finished with glazed tile, not marble. I\'m thinking the dimensions were maybe a mistake/due to wrong information, and calling it marble may have been a manner of speaking, as the room is mostly marble??</p>
<p>For what it\'s worth:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/biltmore00albe#page/n5">https://archive.org/stream/biltmore00albe#page/n5</a> :</p>
<p>“Biltmore Photo-Gravures” (1900) by H.Taylor Rogers, Asheville</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/biltmore00albe#page/n7">https://archive.org/stream/biltmore00albe#page/n7</a> :</p>
<p>In the basement is a Turkish bath [\'gymnasium/lounging room\' on the floor plans], with a marble plunge, 50 x 50 feet, and electric illumination from beneath as well as above.</p>
<p>If you use the banquet hall\'s dimensions of 72 x 42 feet as a guide, and compare the size of the pool to the banquet hall on the floor plans, the pool is not even close to 50 x 50 feet.</p>
<p>You know what is basically 50 x 50 feet? The creepy sub-basement &quot;plant storage room.&quot; Under this heavy marble trap door <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ITumw9i">https://imgur.com/a/ITumw9i</a> in the Winter Garden on the main floor was open space down to the plant storage room two floor below. The ABC article states the plant storage room has been replaced by a staff break room. However in looking at their photo, and then at the floor plans, correct me if I\'m wrong but I think the break room is just one floor down from the Winter Garden.</p>
<p>It might be nothing, but why such a deep and tall plant storage room, unless I\'m looking at this wrong? The conservatory for plants, meaning The Conservatory, which is its own separate building from the main house where the Winter Garden small conservatory is very large, was built in 1895 like the house, and is not too great a distance away. Maybe the conservatory was too humid for some plants, I don\'t know.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: Looking through some Vanderbilt stuff on g--gle I have discovered that in the Vanderbilt Mansion in Long Island, New York there is a mantle piece and fire place that has a sculpture and art around it. So thank you to Mike Cernovich for giving me the eyes to see this! That the images represent the Ovaries aka female reproductive system. Just like Mike has shown us in his video on the #Avo Superbowl commercial! I can\'t find his video, only trash articles about him. This would be easier to understand if you could see his video. But anyway, here\'s the art for the time being..</p>

           you can see the leaves on the floor. So, I thought that would mean an outdoor pool or something like that. Guess what? Biltmore had an outdoor pool which was built by Edith Vanderbilt in the 1930s but later filled in

           "I believe it's highly likely some of the pool paintings of children are based on them being harmed, or worse, in the Biltmore House pool -- I have made many, many comments in this thread supporting that. But many people don't notice who writes what comments, so, I just want to clarify that before my comment, below. I'm just trying to add more information, not take away from the pool information:
          </p>

           By the way, in case this is helpful to anyone -- from personal experience:

           As someone who is a survivor of Pedogate (1960's - approximately 1980's,) although I've never officially been to the Biltmore Estate, I have recognized three areas of it since v / PG and v / GA started researching it.
          </p>
          <p>
           I basically just recognize having been on the main staircase, and in the fourth floor room with the spiral staircase that looks like an office ("the observatory,") in a bad but not horrible way. However I get a very bad vibe-memory from the third area, which is the room at 5:40 with the architectural model of the house. I can only assume they must have done horrible things to us children in that room, and maybe still do. All three areas are in this video from 4:45 - 6:10 or so:

           " A 1900 book describes the Biltmore House pool as being 50 feet long x 50 feet wide, and marble.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's not that size, and it's finished with glazed tile, not marble. I'm thinking the dimensions were maybe a mistake/due to wrong information, and calling it marble may have been a manner of speaking, as the room is mostly marble??

           In the basement is a Turkish bath ['gymnasium/lounging room' on the floor plans], with a marble plunge, 50 x 50 feet, and electric illumination from beneath as well as above.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you use the banquet hall's dimensions of 72 x 42 feet as a guide, and compare the size of the pool to the banquet hall on the floor plans, the pool is not even close to 50 x 50 feet.
          </p>
          <p>
           You know what is basically 50 x 50 feet? The creepy sub-basement "plant storage room." Under this heavy marble trap door

           </a>
           in the Winter Garden on the main floor was open space down to the plant storage room two floor below. The ABC article states the plant storage room has been replaced by a staff break room. However in looking at their photo, and then at the floor plans, correct me if I'm wrong but I think the break room is just one floor down from the Winter Garden.
          </p>
          <p>
           It might be nothing, but why such a deep and tall plant storage room, unless I'm looking at this wrong? The conservatory for plants, meaning The Conservatory, which is its own separate building from the main house where the Winter Garden small conservatory is very large, was built in 1895 like the house, and is not too great a distance away. Maybe the conservatory was too humid for some plants, I don't know."

           EDIT: Looking through some Vanderbilt stuff on g--gle I have discovered that in the Vanderbilt Mansion in Long Island, New York there is a mantle piece and fire place that has a sculpture and art around it. So thank you to Mike Cernovich for giving me the eyes to see this! That the images represent the Ovaries aka female reproductive system. Just like Mike has shown us in his video on the #Avo Superbowl commercial! I can't find his video, only trash articles about him. This would be easier to understand if you could see his video. But anyway, here's the art for the time being..

            Ok so turns out the house in Archer that is said to of been the Biltmore Estate is actually Cornelius Vanderbilt 2 house that was on the corner of 5th and 55th New York, it's been demolished now and has a Presbyterian Church on it. The mansion in Archer is almost identical to the real mansion.

             Maybe that's how the Vanderbilts make their money still, through running sick "amusement" parks(s) as you theorized in your excellent comment, linked below, for which they could charge millions followed by lucrative blackmail of the park attendees and/or their relatives.

              Well what do they do now? From being a big talked about family back in the day and STILL owning the largest private residence in the US I'd never heard of them until the other day.. Now all I've done is try and find the connection here. What if at night this estate is transformed into some sick sort of "wonderland"?? And that would be perfect, use it to bribe and blackmail people with, plus it's already riddled with cameras so no need to worry about setting that part up. You can choose to use "the garden"  "the forrest" pick a room, Farrrk this is sounding more and more likely the more I think about it. Follow the white rabbit down the hole and you're on a train to Wonderland.. also Alice Vanderbilt rented a mansion called "Lands End"...

Bonnell played a leading role in the movement to strengthen ties between Protestants and Roman Catholics and was presented with a silver medal for ecumenical services by Pope Paul VI in 1966. He also served as co-chair of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Billy Graham's first great city-wide evangelistic campaign was held in Los Angeles in 1949. At that time he made a public promise that he would never have any theological modernists (theological liberals) on his platform. Dr. Graham's first evangelistic campaign in England was held in the summer of 1954. On that tour he was accompanied by Dr. John Sutherland Bonnell, the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in New York City. Dr. Bonnell was also the president of the Ministerial Association of New York City, which was dominated by modernist ministers and churches. On Dr. Graham's British tour Bonnell was working to persuade him to hold a campaign in New York in 1956 under the auspices of the liberal Ministerial Association. During that time a group of Bible-believing pastors and laymen sent Dr. Graham in England a telegram asking him to hold an evangelistic series in New York City sponsored by "a committee of twice-born men."
             </p>
             <p>
              On his return to the States Dr. Graham announced that he would come to New York in 1956 sponsored by the Ministerial Association of New York City. The committee of Bible-believing men sent a delegation to Dr. Graham begging him not to confuse the line between the gospel of grace and the false gospel of the modernist churches represented in the Ministerial Association.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association was the primary force for the founding of the Lausanne World Evangelism Conferences back in the 1980s. Especially in recent years these conferences have called on all churches, including the modernist ecumenical churches of the World Council of Churches and the Roman Catholic Church to cooperate with the evangelical churches in evangelizing the world for Christ.
             </p>
             <p>
              More recently, in the spring of 1994, a group of both evangelical and Roman Catholic leaders signed a document called "Evangelicals and Catholics Together" (ECT). This document asserts that there is one Church (including both Protestant and Roman churches), that, therefore, they must work together in evangelizing the world for Christ, and agree that there will be no sheep-stealing, that is, proselytizing of members of one church to depart and join another church. ECT dismayed multitudes of Christians and elicited vigorous criticism from many Christian circles.

              When Vanderbilt’s Dudley Field opened in 1922, it was the first stadium in the South built exclusively for college football. But the venue has hosted more than athletics events over the years. Such was the case when the Rev. Billy Graham brought his popular evangelical crusade to Nashville for the first time. On Sept. 19, 1954, the last night of the crusade, an estimated 65,000 people filled the stadium (pictured, in this photo taken from the roof of Memorial Gym). Graham would conduct two more crusades in Nashville over the course of his career: in 1979, again at Vanderbilt; and in 2000 at what is now LP Field.

              Very interesting indeed.. There has to be a reson why this is all being brought up.. I also found while researching the family- Alice Vanderbilt- Alice in wonderland? Can't find anything yet to make that connection but on her wiki page it says this with, uh hum, some familiar "charities"
             </p>
             <p>
              From her wiki-
             </p>
             <p>
              Alice donated to various charitable causes. Throughout her life she was a large supporter of the YMCA, Salvation Army, Red Cross, Trinity Church and St. Bartholomew's Church. She and her husband donated Vanderbilt Hall to Yale College in memory of their eldest son, Bill, a student there when he died in 1892. She gave the front gates to her former mansion on Fifth Avenue to be placed in Central Park. Mrs. Vanderbilt also donated a facility to Newport Hospital in 1903 in memory of her husband, Cornelius.

            So.. My new theory on this connection coming up and Q posting about it is.. That this Estate is still being used when it is not open to the public, I feel they use it as some sort of sick "amusement" park where people pay top dollar to come and spend an evening there fulfilling their sick fantasies. It would be perfect if you are a sicko. Going back in time to your own "movie" set and then carrying out their sick acts. The Vanderbilt family built grand central so it would only make sense that they had their own secret railway built under this estate, the perfect way to bring in their guests for the night without being seen and no-one would suspect a thing as the place is "closed" through the night. I mean, why would they decide to move out of a place like this and open it to the public if they carried out their "hunting" parties and other sick shit here. This place would hold too many memories for the family to just let it go, so instead they "move out" and open it to the public, taking away prying eye's that might be trying to do stories on the family. So they now use their underground access to bring in their guests that have paid millions for a night at the estate. Makes sense to me..

             This is what someone purportedly said about a ritual in Asheville (same town as Biltmore):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "We skinned that baby alive to the scream of 'hail, Satan!' We then draped it's intestines around the candlesticks of our altar. I cut the baby up into pieces, and each person ate some. Later, I took the skull and remains home. I forced the remains down the garbage disposal to conceal evidence from the police, and then burned a candle to Satan on the baby's skull.And when the mother, my girlfriend, felt bad about giving up her baby for sacrifice and went tot he police, we decided to make an example out of her as a warning to the rest of the coven:
             </p>
             <p>
              "We took her up the side of one mountain overlooking Asheville...we laid her on that altar, and the sacrificial dagger was placed in my hands. I took that dagger and cut her open from neck to groin, and she was sacrificed. To this day her parents don't know what happened to her."
             </p>
             <p>
              The jewel of Asheville, NC, is the famed

             Yes, Vanderbilt's Biltmore is in Asheville, North Carolina.  Asheville is the satanic mecca of the east coast.   Also in Asheville is Seely's Castle (Overlook Mansion) rumored to have satanic rituals held there:

The pretence they use is that “the home is too poor” to take adequate care of the children. What frequently happens then to those seized children??? …  Barack Hussein Obama … visit(s) the 12 Bones barbecue each time they come to town, which is more often than is publicized.

             I agree.  It sounds plausible and also makes sense to me.  The Royals in many countries attend similar hunting parties so why not Biltmore.  Just imagine if that ever got out.  What in the world would Cooper and Gloria do?  Definitely flight risks.

             Pizzagate + Missing 411 = Large Scale Tunnel Network
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I suspect pizzagate can be connected to Missing 411 and investigated in the following context: 1) Its a culture of people that want to normalize the 12 perversions.
2) They hide in the shadows and traffic in co-oped systems of tunnels and basements that stretch around the world.
3) Major Conflicts are connected to this. Many for example don't realize that ISIS took over the Sadaams tunnel network. They have been using it for sex trafficking of children.
4) In the West, National Forrests are a prime place to abuct. Comet and Buck's Fishing and Camping uniquely have a forrest strip behind their buildings. That area is a wash with a aquaduct built underneith. This is very simliar to where kids are found in Missing 411 reports.

            Comparing the tapestry and the paintings might be a breakthrough, I think. I always thought the adults portrayed might be patients from a mental hospital maybe? They look worn out and tormented.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, we should keep in mind that the paintings were all done from photographs (or some of them). Meaning, may these be people who were photographed at some point on the premises, a longer time ago? Why were they at the house in the first place?

              Maybe they do. In Britain, some mansions that are open to the public are used out of hours.

               So another thought, that if they did use this place out of hours it would be like a film set for them, some sort of sick fantasy land, almost like an amusement park for them... What if that's exactly what it is??? WTF They take the underground train in at night and pay for private "tours", that's it, that's what they do...

            So looking for the ladder in Pegasus I came across the upper level they made which seems pointless, but similar to the level in the pool. It doesn't have the ladder in the photo but there is one as I can remember the photo and the top level moves? Something like that. Anyway.. 
This is the level

            and notice they are all watching something? Just like they would in the pool..
           </p>

            And then wtf is this picture?

            Just thought that once that ladder is pulled up from the pool, which I Am sure it would pull out, that it could almost be like some sort of fight/battle pit? Where they could all stand around and look down on what ever is happening, my thoughts are they put the rottweilers and dogs in the shallow end..

            Well one thing's for sure, that pool depicted in the Archer cartoon is definitely referencing the Vanderbilt pool; there are far too many similarities for it not to be. Who is the creator for this cartoon? It would be worth looking into them.

             you can see the leaves on the floor. So, I thought that would mean an outdoor pool or something like that. Guess what? Biltmore had an outdoor pool which was built by Edith Vanderbilt in the 1930s but later filled in

             They're all close enough to not be exactly alike, she would of painted these from their photos. They would make minor alterations as to not make them exactly alike the scenes as to incriminate themselves. Keep them the same but slightly different, enough to be kept as a memo but not as evidence. And the "artist" would add her own touches

                im getting confused by multiple posts and reposts re the Vanderbilts. Somewhere I stated that Biljana D. exhibited in Washington DC in  2009,, then spent 2010-2011 in NYC as a visiting professor at the Parsons School of Design which was Gloria Vanderbuilt's alma matter. Gloria is still alive, still active in the NYC arts scene. Thus it would come as no surprise if Gloria and Biljana knew each other.

                 Yea I know, I made 2 posts as the first one started gaining more infor then the comments got messy, we can now connect BD to the Vanderbilts and I Am sure with a bit of digging we could find a photo of them together.. There was some nice infor in the article I shared but mods removed so I'll create a new post including the 2 old ones and then make the connection as found by you. I feel there's something to this all so sticking with it for now as I feel this family could be the upper echelon

                   Well you could say all of it is speculation, but it's the speculation that opens up the cracks and exposes things or people.

            I posted this in another post here. Again, I'm not sure how relevant this is, but I visited the Vanderbilt Museum in Long Island, NY and this small statue/fountain creeped me out:
            <a href="https://imgoat.com/v/137765">
             https://imgoat.com/v/137765
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It might not symbolize anything sinister, idk. This was the summer home of William K Vanerbilt II. The fountain is located outside at a small round pool that is now filled in and covered with grass. The tour of the inside was super disappointing as you don't get to see much of the house and you are escorted around by shitty guides pretending to be people who supposedly frequented the house. I learned useless stuff about Elizabeth Arden and was taught through shitty acting how important the Vanderbilt women were when it came to women's suffrage.

             Hmm.. the top of the statue is certainly odd, it could almost resemble a grave/burial? As it looks nothing like hair and can almost see a body/bones in it. Oh and what a "coincidence" that another pool has been filled in! Definitely graves.

              I am wanting to know what that is as well, on top of the statue, between those cherubs/babes.  I too wondered.  Looks strange.  Could possibly be a grave marker of sorts.  Telling what may be there.  Creepy is what it is.

              Yeah, I posted again only because of your mention of the filled in pool at Biltmore. I can understand filling in an outdoor pool if it's not being used. One less thing to maintain.
             </p>
             <p>
              Supposedly the pool was filled with water from the Long Island Sound and also drained right back into it.
Definitely not a grave or burial. It's literally right outside the pool. The pointed ears of the demon like figure creeped me out... Obviously along with the babies. However, I don't know symbolism. Perhaps someone else has a better explanation for this statue/fountain? I just got an eery feeling in the moment.
             </p>

              I frequent this sub often, but I wasn't looking for anything nefarious when I went on the tour. I actually first heard of the Biltmore Mansion after doing simple research when I got home bc the tour I went on was so bad and I wanted to learn more about cool things they didn't talk about. Biltmore returned more results.

               The pointed ears are on many of the devil-types we have seen pictured.  Satyrs have pointed ears and the d-evil as well.  The worship them.

               Thank you! And Re ladder in the pool, I pointed that out in the other post, I said why would it be made like that? Not taking the steps till at least a half decent height to be accessed from the floor, even though there is a shallow end with stairs you would think for ease of access when no water is in there they would have steps going right down, if it was my pool and ladder I certainly would. My theory that just came through is they tied people up and filled it just enough so they had to swim or some sort of sick idea like that.

              Wow! Great find!! Notice the ladder - where you can climb down, but not so easily climb up again.

              This is also interesting, because I looked at the artist's other works (artist that did the alleged 'Vanderbilt' pool paintings), and she also portrays men and women, obviously held captive, before a background of tiles.
             </p>
             <p>
              I always assumed these paintings were referring to her experiences in the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s, were they had concentration camps for adults, and rape camps for women and girls.
             </p>
             <p>
              It never occured to me that there might be adults held captive in the Vanderbilt pool or a similar site.

Guastavino tile is found in some of New York's most prominent Beaux-Arts landmarks and in major buildings across the United States. It is used in a huge number of architecturally important and famous buildings with vaulted spaces.

              Great find.  Yes I read the butler in Archer was forced to live in the empty pool, until it was later filled with water to hold the submarine.
