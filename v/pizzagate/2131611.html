             I've run into several ominous reports about the exploits of an unbelievable number of news anchors, revealing a huge subset of society that seems to be in some ways untouchable and part of an intricate cog in the machine of sex trafficking. It only makes sense that they would HAVE to be the most compromised individuals because they're asked to lie to the public on a daily basis.

            Further in there is a thread that has a Part 2 listed within it talks about Peter Nygard and Jeffrey Epstein having a passion for Eternal Life. Sick how they plan on achieving this and what they are doing in the mean time before they achieve their "Life Long" Dream.  Also it says this as well:

            Abducting large volumes of young kids, allows large volumes of "free" plasma to be extracted from their blood. Also larger sample, with a greater degree of "controlled variance", to test and sample on. Smaller people are easier to house, hide, manipulate, feed, and experiment on. As they age, using scopolamine and unethical psychological manipulation, they can freely sell them or use them.   THINK this is so very important information.  ARE they keeping kids locked up in places where they take their blood and also use them for experimental purposes and who knows what else horrible torturing experiences?  Think Mengele.  I put NOTHING past these Jekyl/Hyde Morons.

            I recommend extreme caution with Myron Fagan, this is a limited hangout. Fagan was a member of the John Birch Society, which was run by the
            <a href="http://watch.pairsite.com/belmont.html">
             Belmont Brotherhood
            </a>
            , a project of Scottish Rite Freemasons and members of the Council on Foreign Relations.

            There isn't a super secret group behind the scenes that no one has ever heard of, and no one can find or investigate. There are real groups, that can be found, investigated, and exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth is, the Illuminati conspiracies are designed to waste your time looking for a group that was disbanded in the 1780s, instead of looking at Freemasonry.

             I'm a mason and there doesn't seem to be much going on there conspiracy wise.  The buildings are crumbling ruins that the organization can barely afford to heat.  It costs 6 figures/month  to heat our vacant palace.

              You are correct. Lower level lodges are in massive disrepair, town and city lodges are losing membership and freemasonic influence, as far as those lodges are concerned, have little or no political sway. But you are simply failing to gauge the temperature of your spiritual environment and instead, like most apprentice and most likely most master masons who have no spirituality, are too caught up in the camaraderie and possibility of advancement in your little boys club to NOTICE THAT THE BIG BOYS ARE DONE RECRUITING... generally. They're already in their final phases of the plan and the old money that  propped up those lodges moved away or was siphoned off by the bigger lodges. Please do not try and play us as fools when we know grande lodges around the world are thriving, well built and funded. Seems like you just got in the game a little late.

              You've had the experience of seeing things that had been there the whole time, have you not? Perhaps they've told you that masonry is based on Christianity, or that it's a fraternity for honorable men to meet on the level.

               I can only judge from the city level.  State and National aren't even on my radar.  At a city level, there is no connection and the lodge has zero influence.

                Understood.  I am thinking it is very compartmentalized.  Do you agree?  Or, do you think the organization as a whole is good?

                I have read that you are not told the true nature of Freemasonry until you reach the 30th degree.  That's what makes me suspicious of secret societies and societies with secrets.  If new people are told at the very beginning what it is all about, then they would never join.

                 It is compartmentalized but i've always felt that was because no one cares.  Everything that happens inhouse is unpaid labor and the internal squabbles are over frivolous matters.  It's an endless drain on your free time and there is no reason to participate in the day to day.  The reason i joined was because I wanted to see inside the big old mysterious building next to city hall.

                 The charitable foundations and trust funds that the organization created are absolutely for the betterment of society.  It's a place where "old money" could put their wealth to work in perpetuity funding hospitals and eyeglasses for poor people.

             I do appreciate the heads up on this point. I posted this necessarily for the pizzagate and Sally Quinn references and kinda sorta glossed over on that aspect of the report. Interesting you mention this aspect because we all have to be aware that there has always been planted provocateurs in these kinds of situations (donkeyote; dohnkeyote; don kehote;etc, etc) to try and control the narrative and direction of a controversy.

              The ONLY difference between our views of PG is you dont think its fair to punish a group collectively, because you are a brainwashed pussy.

              And since you insist on serving subpoenas to every single individual we find is the only remedy, it will never end, so nice job bitch.

             Do you really think MSN  operations have changed?
            </p>
            <p>
             I am thinking  MSN is jumping in because they could not squelsh
            </p>
            <p>
             this truth.  So now  they are weaselling in to get all peoples' attentions
            </p>
            <p>
             in order             TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVES.
            </p>
            <p>
             Above all, shadow government wants to control us.
            </p>
            <p>
             They control us by attempting to or outright controlling our thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
             I say Watch Out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shadow government want us as mind controlled slaves.

            <p>
             That is, the ones they 'let' live.

              Jet fuel is basically kerosene and it doesn't slice through steel beams at a perfect 45 degree angle either.  Those beams, had they been exposed in the first place, would have crumpled and bended at the weak heated points; but the buildings would have held up like some demented junga. And why the fuck didn't the sprinkler systems work? Nobody ever asks that question!

                  On our way back from the Convention the group of us  Berniecrats (4) jumped into our King Size beds and turned on Fox News.  We figured they were the only ones that would report the closest truth on HER.  We were not disappointed.  They covered the walk out!  Believe it or not.
