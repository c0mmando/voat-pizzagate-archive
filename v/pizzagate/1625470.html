<p>as hotdogs stand for boys, we ask ourselves - where is this stand? is it really in Hawaii?</p>
<p>There was just a bust of child sex trafficking in a beach hotel in Haiti, called Kaliko Beach Club and Resort Hotel:

<p>As other pointed out, this hotel is very close by where the clintons had their honeymoon:

<p>If you scroll down that page you will find another place called Obama Beach, which is described as &quot;A favorite destination for U.N forces in Haiti&quot;.</p>
<p>Todd Stern, as we know, was the United States Special Envoy for Climate Change, leading talks at the United Nations climate change conferences and smaller sessions, appointed by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on January 26, 2009:

<p>Now think about it - If they hid children for sex trafficking in one beach hotel, and with all the massive evidence that the Clinton Foundation and those close to it were running a child sex trafficking ring from there - it only makes sense other resorts and hotels in that area were in on it as well. We only heard about Kaliko hotel because that\'s where the bust was. the whole haiti smuggling ring could be running through those beach resorts!</p>
<p>Kaliko Beach Club is actually 2.6km (6 minutes drive) from the Obama Beach Hotel:

<p>Obama was born in Hawaii.
So Hawaii could be a reference to Obama.</p>
<p>Could it be that Stern is talking about a hotdog (children) stand (trafficking place) in hawaii (obama beach, where all UN people love to hang out)?</p>

            I think you are on to something with these resorts and I think it's worth looking into the founder of DigiCell, Denis O'Brien because he was convinced by Bill Clinton to open a bunch of luxury resorts in Haiti after the earthquake. He is also one of the Clinton Foundations biggest donors.

            Have you listened to Joel Gilbert? He wrote the book "dreams of my real father" and makes a very strong case for obamas father actually being the communist pedophole Frank Marshall Davis. Obama being this mans son and a red diaper baby is far more dangerous and damning than just being born in Kenya. It seems from Joel's work that the whole birther thing was to throw people off track and prevent them from looking at him being franks son.

            Obama wasn't born in Hawaii, that has been proven to be a lie.
Why is the beach called Obama beach? I'm having a hard time making the connection between Haiti and Hawaii. Sorry.
