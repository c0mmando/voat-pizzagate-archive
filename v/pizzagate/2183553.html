            No, it's not good enough. May I remind you that everyone in Hollywood is also aware of the "downside" of being a member of the Church of Scientology? Retired police are even well - paid security guards for the cult, guaranteeing LAPD loyalty. I assure you pedo behavior, rape, 100% forced abortions if you're a Sea Org member is the norm.
           </p>

            The attitude of LE is if you don't like being harassed where you live by a pedo neighbor then you should leave. Ditto for any employment opportunity no matter how desperate you may be.
