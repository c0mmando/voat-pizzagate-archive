<p>Obviously some have done good things but are these NGOs accountable to any government? Who gets to go through their financial records? </p>
<p>To me, it looks like the UN is protecting these pedophiles and the NGOs which are part of the problem. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/un-sex-for-food-west-africa-refugees-ngos-abuse-exploitation-a8374451.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/un-sex-for-food-west-africa-refugees-ngos-abuse-exploitation-a8374451.html</a></p>
<p>There are names named in this article.

<p>So, my thought is that if people wish to expose these organized pedophile rings, it\'s not enough to just look in one area or at a few people. These are world wide organizations. These pedophiles are the elite and wealthy power brokers in Washington DC and have connections all the way to the UN and on an international level. They hide behind and within charities and will blather on and on about how they LOVE the children.</p>',

            At one time , Wayne Madsen , was one of the few truth tellers in the US...more and more are emerging with social media. He had a side kick who was just as good at journalism without the fame. Sylvia Germack...she lived in Yugoslavia while the US was breaking it up.....stated that the NGOs were an integral part of that operation. Fly in with arms, fly out with drugs etc. And that Joe Biden was big in it back then. It is still going on in Venezuela.....current news is they are not allowing aid to help the poor starving people. Well, why did we not give aid to Yemen where people were being slowly starved to death?

            No NGOs do any good..they just further the debt currency system..
All people , for example the nepalis family, need to gwin an understanding of how to use their meagre income to reduce debt at the US treasury...they then gain the protection legal and military as well as financial from the US..
It ends poverty..
Each of us are surety to the debt system when we use central bank notes...we become merchants inside this debt system..and as merchants they can settle at the US treasury ..by using central bank notes tonreduce US debt..
The US would then as debtor and trustee of their names which are roman trusts, provide security fornanybservice theybprovide for the community..
Evenn a beggar on the street has this remedy

              In practical terms its a simple process...similar and even easier as depositing a cnetral bank note into a bank..
..but it takes a while to understand why u have this remedy..
             </p>
             <p>
              The remedy is to reduce debt at the US treasury..
             </p>
             <p>
              At the moment we use our notes to increasr debt by directly or indirectly depositing our credit into a bank...
             </p>
             <p>
              U can take the same process and flip it by giving ur credit to the US treasury..its ur own treasury...u secure its credit via ur social security account..
in return as u have reduced their debt ...they have to acknowledge that u have surety rights over them..
Ie..they have to setoff (pay) all ur bills , including housing , food, etc..
             </p>
             <p>
              One has tonunderstand that all coubtries are roman pirate corporations..they r legal because they have licence under papal bull dum diversas..
Utube : dum dicersas papal slip of enslavement
             </p>
             <p>
              We volunteer to be slaves of the war under which vatican operates and volunteer to be surety to the pirate corporation ie former colonies...now known as countries..
             </p>
             <p>
              Like i said the practical is much easier ..than understanding the system we r under..because we have been programmed to think the reverse..we have been walking upsode down the whole of our lives...
             </p>
             <p>
              If u read my previous comments u might understand..

               You're right. I don't understand. Mostly, I not only don't understand how this works, what it does or what to expect, I don't understand the details about how to do what ever it is you are suggesting I do or where to file some claim or something. Can you explain the process or provide a link to an explanation. I'm really lost here.

            Fully agree on this. There are so many accusations, and coverups in this scenario. Another avenue for exposure are the foundations for kids, CPS, scouts, and child find initiatives. the light is on and the roaches are fleeing.

             Totally. I will never look at organizations that seek to "help" children the same way. I grew up believing those were good organizations but the first to fall from grace in my eyes was Child Protection Services. Who minds the people who mind the children? No one? I worked for a couple of weeks at a CPS facility. I didn't see anything suspicious other than what I saw at lunch time. We workers sat at a separate table but I could see the children at other tables. Well dressed, looking clean and well fed. The food was the same as what the children ate and I can tell you, they ate really nice food. Way better than what I could afford at my home so I loved working there if only for the food. Since I worked at the horse stables cleaning, painting, running for feed and doing repairs, I had zero interaction with the children and I preferred it that way. Not that I don't like children but I seem to only care about kids if I know their name and speak with them. Lacking that, they were just an unknown to me that I happily served. They would come out, ride horses and ponies and then leave until the next group showed up. Another lady handled that limited interaction. Beyond that, I know nothing but what I was constantly reading in the papers about kids who ended up being abused after passing through institutions such as the one I worked at. Kids who are taken from sketchy parents who could have done better but the kids weren't in any real danger. Then, reading on I find the kids end up being beat to death at a foster home. WTH? Who vetted those care givers? Who's watching the watchers? Google these events and dozens show up on the google page. If that's what is hitting the news cycle how much more abuse goes on that doesn't get in the news.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was abused as a child until the courts took me away from my mother as an infant sleeping under a bridge. Then courts returned me to my parents after they got a house to live in. From there it got worse and worse until the courts again stepped in and rewarded me back to my Grandparents. No coaching, no supervision and things got steadily worse until I ended up in a youth correctional facility as an incorrigible run away. No one ever once asked my why I was running away. The focus was solely on my bad behavior of trying to escape abuse. How dare I run away, right? No one even once asked me what prompted me to flee over and over. After a year they sent me back to live with my Grandparents who were now afraid to start something that would end up in the courts again. My older brother and sister had no such worries and the abuse began again in earnest with my Grandparents keeping the hands off policy but letting the abuse continue under my brother and sister until I fought back. This time the police were not called, it didn't revert into a brawl that included my Grandparents. Eventually everyone was just too afraid to beat me. It never ended well.

             Compared to what I read in the news cycle, I was the lucky one. What of those who spend years and years in horrid abuse? We have a case here in Riverside that was concluded yesterday. Children living their entire life up to adulthood in some of the worst abuse I have ever heard of.

              Thank you so much for your personal reply. It is testimony and experience sharing like this that will lead others to the truth of what is. Reading of your experience is heart wrenching and inspiring all at the same time. Your having gone through this and being able to share it fills me with hope for others who have been through similar times.
             </p>

              My vigilance around child crimes was seeded through our pedophile grandfather that abused my sister for 7 years and the brutal and lasting effects that followed. It was all kept secret and my sis was put in a ward to deal with her emotional problems or as I see it now to "deal with" "the problem". We have come a long way as a family through the trauma and our willingness to explore, share, and support. When this was going on in the 70's my Mom tried to go the legal route and with my dad being a lawyer no-one would touch it. From the age of 8 to 19 I always wondered wtf was going on in the house. It all started to become clear after we, as a family became more aware of circumstances and their affects.
             </p>
             <p>
              My inability to connect with or understand the perpetrators, their enablers, and the failed system is somehow a relief and I believe that 90% plus of humanity would feel the same. We are now at a time of shift through stories and testimony like yours and advocates and victims/survivors coming forward in growing numbers.
             </p>
             <p>
              My heart goes out to you and I wish you well. Again, a tip of my hat to you and your siblings.

               I'm shocked. Damn. I'm trying to formulate a reply.
              </p>
              <p>
               What's strange is how it's similar to my experience even in spite of the differences. I believe my uncle victimized my sister. My brother said he was forced to give oral sex. I know the uncle tried with me but I was a touch me not kid after being beat by my mother. I just loathed people touching me. Not in a thought out way but I was just wary. So I didn't get bothered after that one attempt. So, lucky me? But I was hated by both my brother and sister and frequently beaten. Not just by them but by my grandparents and my uncle. Anything could bring it on and no one was ever disciplined in any way for hurting me. The sexual abuse of my sister I never knew about until one day when we are both in our forties she told me and it just clicked because I remembered that night when it happened and what she said perfectly dovetailed with what I saw but didn't understand. Always no one was allowed to talk about abuse of any kind. My grandmother would always quell any discussion of wrong doing or abuse of any kind. About that time I found out for sure my grandmother was verbally abusing me over basically nothing. She was just pissed off and having a bad day and told me I was the worst person she ever knew. WHAT??? So I asked her, "Worse than my uncle who raped my sister starting at four years old, raped my brother around the same time and tried to molest me? Worse than that?". She just stared at me in shock. Her face went pale and she slapped me hard in the face. Ohhh I was angry. I just stood there and glared all my anger at her. She covered it up. She fucking damn well knew and covered it up. Sweet talking little church lady covered it up. Self righteous little church lady covered it up and she KNEW! She damn well knew and did nothing. She knew because my sister would have bled and soiled her underwear. Grandma washed the underwear, knew what it meant and covered it up. I should have asked her, "did you bleach the stains away, did you wash her guilt away?" But I just stood there and stared at her. Anger and loathing. The woman who took me and raised me and supposedly loved her grandkids enough to raise them herself and she covered up the worst abuse because ohhh her precious drug addict son needed protection from his crimes. She continued to cover for him even after this. I will never understand it and she's dead now but I hope there's a justice in the afterlife. My sister's life is wrecked. My uncle got her hooked on meth at 15 and she's been a meth addict ever since. She's been on the streets, selling herself for drugs, trading cars, cash and her body for drugs. It's dirty disgusting and she is an expert liar who will destroy anyone who reaches out to help her. My brother is better only by degrees as he tried to kill me at age four. He literally spent an hour trying. To this day I am terrified of suffocation. It's a part of me I can't get rid of. I can sort of forgive me but I can't trust him as he's sort of psycho in a primitive way. I also can't associate with my sister as she's just too dangerous.
              </p>
              <p>
               But hey, we carry on and do good where we are with the people we can help. I can't help my siblings, they are beyond that. I can't change my family but I can change me and I can do good.
              </p>
              <p>
               "My inability to connect with or understand the perpetrators, their enablers, and the failed system"   It's odd that this is exactly my feeling. And there's that thing about child abuse. It's always a secret no one wants to talk about and when you're a kid you don't realize how wrong you are being treated. You can't even form such a concept to mount a protest.
