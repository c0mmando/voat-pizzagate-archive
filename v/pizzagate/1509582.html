            If this man is in great danger already and has "instructed you to post this here", maybe he'd be willing to help us out on the Pizzagate investigation.  Clearly, he knows what he's doing and, I doubt he could get into any more trouble than he's in right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps you can ask him, yes?

            Seen a same message before on /pol/ . Will definitely keep this name in mind and archive however please if you can, give hints or elaborate on what Taylors threat is?  It wont mean much if he were to disappear if there was no suggestion as to who is involved. As an associate do you have a dead-mans switch?

            I sympathise with your predicament ,if it is true.  But there are some red flags which would make removing your post very probable.

            <li>
             If you wanted to gain maximum exposure of the issue it doesn't make sense to post  here in a relatively small sub On a relatively small website.
            </li>
            <li>
             You haven't posted this anywhere else , where it would make more sense
