<p>Nothing alone may be convincing. And each little thing taken alone seems coincidental. It\'s the entire package which makes it very eerie and quite terrifying. There seems to be overwhelming evidence that pedophilia rings are within the government as a means of blackmailing people as an initiation tool to preserve power, control, and wealth under the guise of satanic rituals/black magic into their secret cabal. Pizzagate is NOT simply about a pizzashop. It\'s about a mass network of child trafficking through possible means of the Clinton Foundation involving many people regardless of political party association.</p>
<p>Although there have been many accounts of this throughout the years, what ignited the investigation were the suspicious emails from John Podesta via Wikileaks. John Podesta is a former chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign and a former Cheif of Staff to Bill Clinton. Wikileaks has a 100% accuracy record for revealing government corruption over 10 years.
Please read in entirety  before you make up your mind and be aware that propaganda programs have existed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">like project mockingbird</a>, and likely still do exist in order to control the people and prevent them from knowing what is truly going on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, I would like to mention that there seems to be quite a few cases where criminal networks exist and provide access to children for the purposes of sexual exploitation and child pornography to elite clientele in the political and business worlds. Many people mysteriously die, such as those involved in the  <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=9">Franklin Credit union case</a> . It’s an exhaustive list so I’ll let you go down the rabbit hole <a href="http://archive.is/20161104012145/pastebin.com/Jn2LfXg4#selection-1275.3-1275.32">here</a>. So it’s good to be aware when considering the absurdity of these out-there claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was actually a full 1994 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">Discovery Channel Documentary</a> that covered pedophilia rampant in our government, but it was banned and never aired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The largest pedophile ring had been exposed  <a href="https://truthkings.com/days-recovering-weiner-hard-drive-fbi-makes-large-child-sex-trafficking-raid/">(covered by nbc news)</a> coincidentally after Anthony weiner\'s laptop was taken.</p>

<li>
<p>And another <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-paedophile-ring-police-arrest-51-men-a7432441.html">pedophile ring exposed in Norway.</a></p>

<p>Let us not forget about the American Financier/<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/06/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-once-claimed-co-founded-clinton-foundation.html">Co-founder of the Clinton Foundation</a> and sex offender/pedophile, <a href="http://www.pizzagate.review/index.php/Jeffrey_Epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> , his good relationship with <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/14/bill-clinton-ditched-secret-service-on-multiple-lo/">Bill Clinton</a> , along with various other high ups in the government and his <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html">Lolita express which he used to fly people to his private island home for pedophilia related vacation trips</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman named Laura Silsby was caught trafficking children in Haiti, and Hillary was sent <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776">emails regarding her updates</a>. Laura Silsby was let <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread541416/pg6">off the hook by a Clinton</a> appointed  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/32/323249_-os-haiti-us-legal-adviser-to-u-s-haiti-missionaries.html"> convicted sex trafficker</a>. She is now <a href="http://archive.is/xFplZ">an associate to the amber alert system involved in finding missing children</a>. A woman who was <a href="http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillary-clintons-scandalous-conduct-in.html">investigating these ties to the Clinton Foundation was just found dead recently</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dbdz9/i_found_a_smoking_gun_monica_petersen_found_dead/">MT</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/about/board-directors#FrankGiustra">Frank Giustra</a> owner of Radcliff Foundation is a big donor to and board of directors for the Clinton Foundation. Elpida, which is a branch of the Radcliff foundation happens to have what looks like a blatant <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwmnPagWgAAqHoS.jpg">pedophile symbol</a> in <a href="https://i.sli.mg/jg6KfI.jpg">their logo.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Podesta is <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488">good friends</a> with known and admitted pedophiliacs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert">Dennis Hastert</a>, Podesta recieved an <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11508">email saying it’s time for Hastert to vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island after the news broke.</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Podesta likes artwork portraying cannibalism, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/c4zYA">this one is in his office</a>.  John Podesta\'s brother, Tony Podesta\'s affinity for provacative art which includes <a href="http://www.pizzagate.review/index.php/Louise_Bourgeois">Arch of Hysteria</a> which represents pain and <a href="https://i.redditmedia.com/MVSZwoVeIFIuUqQhQsshS2J-dpq7EzYc-OucwuFuyTE.png?w=887&amp;s=e4cbddbaeb6432870a4c290ec1da5e91">resembles Jeffery Dhamer\'s victim\'s pose</a>. Tony Podesta is a lobbyist in Washington, and is an employee of the Saudis who also have issues with Child Trafficking. The Podestas seem to be a fan of Katy Grannan\'s and biljana djurdjevic\'s artwork which often portrays <a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">naked teenagers</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/xyW2L">child abuse</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>References to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch"> Moloch</a>  ( the god of Children Sacrifices) and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">sacrifices of chickens</a> were  found in the Wikileak emails of the DNC staff to Hillary. Not surprising as Bill Clinton wrote how he was fascinated with <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SsOoBXt-aWEC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=my+life+the+early+years+bill+clinton+voodoo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1QO8jsqHDU&amp;sig=GoeA-O0Wj1kJr3fq-rD9hgjTTE8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifxIPWvI_QAhXmgFQKHdGIB8EQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=my%20life%20the%20early%20years%20bill%20clinton%20voodoo&amp;f=false">voodoo magic in his book</a> and that Hillary Clinton wrote her thesis on her hero, Saul Alinsky\'s, book in which he has an <a href="https://archive.org/stream/RulesForRadicals/RulesForRadicals_djvu.txt">acknowledgement for satan. </a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marina Abramovic is a must mention along with  her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ys-Lfu4Sc">spiritcooking</a> which is satanic in nature involving blood, semen, &amp; breast milk and John Podesta\'s <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893">invite via email</a>.  Marina stated on an AMA that in private dinners, <a href="https://i.redditmedia.com/z484j2EbaVB3AEldtwSmeBQ3CQl3Y9ubnJVjGZwVR9M.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=197e25797dd2c4ca4784a0155e574c20">it\'s NOT art</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marina Abromovic is often seen with many Hollywood actors, <a href="http://archive.is/3EkB8">including Pamela Anderson, Will Farrell, Nicole Richi, Kirsten Dunst, and many many others as they enjoy their spirit cooking dinner cannibalizing a naked human shapedcake</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interesting that pedophilia seems to be commonly known by celebrities who speak out, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roW238dfUUk">Corey Feldman</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/movies/elijah-wood-hollywood-child-star-pedophilia.html">Elija Wood</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>References to pedophilia via known <a href="https://i.sli.mg/3tJhM5.png">pedo code</a> like <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cheese%20pizza">cheese pizza</a> in the Podesta emails, such as the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433">handkerchief pizza/map being left behind</a>.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code">Handkerchiefs are used as code for sexual preferences,</a> , and victims of pedophilia express that it’s collected as a souvenir after being placed <a href="https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg">under the victim</a>.  Other code words found in the emails like: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613">playing dominos on cheese or pasta</a>? and an email titled &quot;Pizza.jpg&quot; where the message is <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8673">&quot;doesn\'t get any better than this&quot;</a> with an <a href="http://pedocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pizza.jpg">attachment of a little girl eating pizza with two females</a> who happen to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgbXLWZtv0Y">women captured investigating human trafficking in NK; Euna Lee and Laura Ling.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A worthy leaked government email to check out where pizza is obviously a code word: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/18/18817_re-headcount-for-pizza-.html">&quot;Who all is in the Austin office today who is going to want pizza? We only have one slice and we need to know how thinly to slice it.&quot;</a></p>

President Richard Nixon (who raped me) organised the break-in into the Democrat headquarters to steal a little black book containing the names of all the VIP pedophiles including Nixon and his best buddy Billy Graham. Listen to detective Jim Rothstein who headed USA's 1st VIP pedo investigation unit.

            Hello all. Anyone investigating pizzagate should take a look at a 56 second video some, hmm I wanted to say guy, but that would imply him being human, will just call it it posted on utube. I do not want to give its name, but all you have to do is type in GOT CHEESE PIZZA?. Now anyone that has been investigating pizzagate knows what a cheese pizza is. Not sure if it is trying to be funny, if so why would it want to poke fun about something so serious. You will know what I am talking about because it says it loves playing ping pong, hmm. WHO is this subhuman? Very very disturbing video, if IT is being serious. I look forward to reading the comments about this one.

            One thing I found curious. Terasol claimed their pedo logo was a Saint Jude's fundraising logo.

            I looked all over and could not find a Saint Judes fund raising logo that looks like that. Yet the Washington Post claimed it was.

            I believe all of this chronicled evidence to be credible and valid, however, I believe Wikileaks has and is always being allowed to play an agenda where the gate keepers have willingly permitted Wikileaks docs fluidly.  Have we been played for Soros' agenda of eliminating free speech and controlling the tool of free speech, the web?????  What are the chances a massive scaled false flag occurs at Comet Pizza where like Sandy Hook it's filled with flaws akin to pieces in a puzzle that will never fit like a jigsaw????? Are those leaked docs of Jimmy Comet with strange instagram pics purposely placed along with the weirdo band and symbols done to completely fool as to take the bait and hello! Goodbye Pork Pie to our rights and free speech like Mr China????

             No doubt many of us have questioned this, you have to when addressing any subject, but to put it simply, the amount of people that would have to be involved would be too many. In the film "The Prestige" the idea of assuming a role so religiously is proffered. For this, what you are suggesting, to be like that would require dozens and dozens of people to have lived that way for a long time otherwise they wouldn't be able to stop internet searches from revealing the truth (which it is, slowly). I'm sure that Soros' direct involvement with regards to the "Fake news" angle is only a product of the fall-out of Hillary not getting the presidency, as he had hoped. The 'fake news' thing is a band-aid on that, and I think the motive is looking ahead to 2020 - elections are fought for over many years, this is the first attempt at paving the way. Remember one thing, Hillary once said "Never waste a good crisis". To me this is the Democratic party (that name is such a misnomer) not wasting a good crisis.

            I've been reading, and looking at links here for about a month. Here are my most important points. POINT #1: I've wanted to comment here, mostly just in support of the work. BUT, I thought I had to create some anon email account to create an account here on voat. Then, I just clicked "register" and found out there's no need to provide an email address. Maybe my admission of my own "duh" will reach other people, and bump up subscriptions. So here I am, not just a watcher but a participant. Here's my POINT #2: I'm a slightly-over-the-hill person, in a small town. I will not approach this topic with my elderly and underage friends. But I am talking about it with others. So, multiply ME by some number. I have no reason to believe that isn't a large number, because I'm not special. You people, who are doing the work, have more support and attention than you or I can begin to know right now. Thank you.

             I'm over the hill too. I've had to Google some of the terms used as they are new to me.
The struggle I have is that despite persons already knowing of this problem in terms of public cases like Saville and others etc (I'm in the UK) they just don't want to believe that it is a current problem. They make comments like 'well that was the past, things are different now, we know more, we know better'.  This causes them to just shutter off and turn away.  Its heartbreaking.  Real children are suffering, right now.  I struggle with what I have read.  I don't understand why anyone would commit such cruelty and inhuman treatment to anyone, let alone children.
             <br/>
             Thank you to all who have/are working so hard.  Like the gentleman/lady above wrote, you have more support and attention than you realise.

            Forgive me if I missed this somewhere in your summary, but I just found about a claim that
            <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/clintons-internet-supporters-allegedly-using-porno.html">
             David Brock's use of "million dollar trolls" via Correct the Record
            </a>
            to shut down Bernie Sanders forums (
            <a href="http://thebernreport.com/facebook-statement-bernie-group-closings/">
             Facebook, if I understand the story correctly
            </a>
            ) using...child pornography. If this information is correct, and I've seen multiple articles with pieces of this story, that places child porn in the hands of employees of James Alefantis's boyfriend doing work on behalf of the Clintons. Perhaps somebody here can come up with good sources on this, or debunk it if it isn't true.

            Crossed ping pong paddles are a common logo for ping pong. Do a google image search. There are hundreds and hundreds of them. They may look vaguely like some symbol, but they are ping pong paddles.

            I found something else I had to make an account so I can post this.. kind of creeped out to be perfectly honest. Following your investigative line there I went thru Dr Pong's website and was following his linked links and found a passworded site. This is the website Tanzinsicht.de. Now I googledITanzinsicht.de pizzagate and found 3 other threads from other websites mentioning this and saying "hey has anyone heard about this" and they have all been deleted. So, Tanz in sicht translated from German means "Dance in sight" or worse yet, Tanz can also mean play, or fuss... Honestly sounds like an open nod towards doing this shit in plain sight so messed up. I feel like this could be something huge... Thoughts?

            That's because she wrote that in her blog, right?

            Hey, I love how you've put all the links in 1 message, but I think it would work better if you made a shorter message with a few key links in it. People seem to be getting overwhelmed by all the information. I've had a few people tell me they stop reading the message  after the 2nd or 3rd link. You can add a link to this bigger message in the shorter one for people who want to see more research.

            I'd recommend a hook in the first few sentences. The Heavy Breathing performance with references to sex with children, and the IG pics and use of pedo slang in said pics and emails should be at the very top as a hook. If I was the typical lazy fucking mainstream media watching moron, I might stop reading once I see the intro, we need a visceral, disgraceful hook, thats the pics and video.

            This stuff listed here has been covered by MSM though, the historical stuff has mostly been covered when these scandals broke, even if they were only covered in some instances, decades after the fact.  I'm thinking of newcomers who are very skeptical but checking it out for the first time - they'll be far more likely to see what's going on if there are MSM sources that they relate to as they re still in that bubble, than sources that they could dismiss as the 'fake news' sites they've been hearing all about.

            One thing I need you to do for me now:  Archive those links instead of sending us there.  archive.is

            That, too, might be a honeypot, but I'll bet dollars to donuts that at least "theapes" one is.

            There is another thread here you might add: the Nancy Schaefer angle, which shows that in her case Georgia state Child Protective Services were taking kids from predominantly poor families and basically this was another market for kids that seems to be being used systemically.
           </p>
           <p>
            See: Former Georgia State Senator, Nancy Schaefer was an outspoken opponent of Child Protective Services (CPS). Schaefer authored an investigation in which, among other findings, revealed the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            “…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Adoption and the Safe Families Act, set in motion by President Bill Clinton, offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child. Employees work to keep the federal dollars flowing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1998 reported that six times as many children died in foster care than in the general public and that once removed to official “safety”, these children are far more likely to suffer abuse, including sexual molestation than in the general population.
           </p>
           <p>
            That according to the California Little Hoover Commission Report in 2003, 30% to 70% of the children in California group homes do not belong there and should not have been removed from their homes.
           </p>
           <p>
            …poor parents often times are targeted to lose their children because they do not have the where-with-all to hire lawyers and fight the system. Being poor does not mean you are not a good parent or that you do not love your child, or that your child should be removed and placed with strangers.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as The Second Mile, procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.
           </p>

            The man who wrote that story on Schaefer then died 12/15, researcher Dave McGowan.

            Schaefer allegedly wrote a book naming Georgia names and was killed along with her husband before publication (I think in DC).
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe there should be a state CPS thread, where stories on this are mined.

            Also: Reports of similar state child theft in the UK have been ongoing. Numerous stories in UK media over last few years as well.

            Too many bad sources here, if I was visiting for the first time that would put me off! Please can you use mainstream media sources for the events such as Norway paedophile ring and biggest child  pornography bust, and previous cases? And then for the rest just link to the evidence. No linking to news sites for the raw evidence, we need to make sure people see that this isn't about people just reading fake news sites and believing them etc!

              I mean use MSM for the old news about the Dutroux stuff and the historical stuff. The reason is because people coming here for the first time to learn about it, if they see these things were reported about in the media that they still at this point trust, it will be more real for them, than if they see stuff on a website they can dismiss as being 'fake news.' I thought the point of this was an introduction to new investigators, but also as a way to show skeptics that it is all real.

              Sorry I mean the Dutroux stuff. The post that is linked to is a great post, including info on lots of different CA scandals, but the original post was full of links to evidence and sources. The one shared here doesn't seem to have any of those links in it, it's just the text of the post, so to someone skeptical it'll look like it's just someone making up stories, unless they search for themselves, but it seems not many people bother doing that!

                I'm not a journalist, I did train as one a long time ago and then realised it was an awful profession full of awful people. Half the time I think all the disinfo and bias is just out of sheer laziness - so many journalists just make stuff up or just leave writing their article to the last minute, so they'll just call up a friend for a quote and see what other people are saying and cobble something together. I expect most of them haven't even bothered to look at any of the stuff pizza gate has found out, and just assume it's all nonsense because they're worried their friends would laugh at them if they took it seriously. Just a lot of very vain, shallow people who want social cachet without any effort.

            I feel like you've discredited the same allegations you make by reaching too far. Providing irrelevant stories as proof, and things that are ridiculous in the same space. If you wish to be taken seriously you might want to remove many of those. Spiritcooking? Seriously? Is this a joke?
           </p>
           <p>
            Serious allegations mean you make your case seriously. Including every damn thing makes you look like an idiot with a cork board covered in newspaper clippings and string. Rings in other countries are irrelevant, and you actually lead with it.

             I think the rings found in other countries being first is to show that these things do actually happen, and do involve senior politicians/elites etc. It sets the stage  for understanding the rest of it. But I agree that there is too much not good stuff in there, bad sources and links to awful websites. I don't think the spirit cooking is irrelevant though, because it shows how they are into weird things related to occult practices. They aren't normal people like most of the rest of us.

              Perhaps then the thing to do is to separate the background stuff out. You need a simple cogent argument to get traction. You link someone here that massive reading list will get them to bounce.

             O.P. here. I'm fine, and no I didn't get any threats or anything.  I just don't want to be involved anymore for multiple reasons. I'm retiring from pizzagate because 1.I have a busy schedule and I felt the main thread was burden on me with extra responsibility and extra effort keeping up with a sticky thread. 2. It just kinda takes a hit on your heart and mind when you realize what's going on.. 3. I haven't kept up with the current findings as there's some large points people wanted me to include. I felt bad I couldn't include them because I wasn't sure what they were talking about. 4.I just simply want to get away from all of this and no longer want to think about any of it because it just makes me really uncomfortable.

              It is scary shit if proven real (as in public). I can only hope we are all horribly wrong, but I fear we have just hit the tip of the iceberg.

              Understandable, I know it's been hard here too. I've been trying to share with close friends but none of them really take me serious.  The girlfriend isn't even taking me serious.  But I'm standing my ground I know we have found to much for this not to be going on.  It would make less sense if that were the case.  Best of luck and I hope you can find some peace.

             Thanks for doing that. Please do not accept anyone with a new or too recent account or who has shown shill behavior on the sub. Actually the person to take over this role should have made significant contributions to the investigation as this would more effectively exclude risk that she is a shill.

              The qualifications for this include their ability to create an easy to read megathread that isn't debunked 50 times in the comments and remains unchanged from them.  People that organize things are sometimes not the best at being on the forefront.

              No.  That was me assuming urgency - it's not overly urgent, he just made his contribution and wanted someone to pick up the baton.

               I agree that the person doesn't need to be a good detective to be a good organiser. But it's also important to make sure that the person isn't a shill, and filtering based on account age and participation so far is a good criterion. It's not totally fair because there are many new accounts who are honest people. But it's safer because there are many more shills among new accounts than among older ones. This post being the public face of the investigation, making sure that the person who maintains it doesn't have a vested interest sabotaging it is paramount.

                The person who creates the best replacement post will have the sticky until those that are doing the investigating find fault with it - the person with the sticky will have ZERO power over anything at all, and will lose the sticky as soon as they start posting garbage.

              I handed it over to the mods because it was too much responsibility for my busy schedule and being that I wasn't closely following the new updates it became a burden to keep revising and having to follow along. At this point I'm just not wanting to think about this uncomfortable stuff anymore, it takes a toll on the mind.

               Understood, C. It really does. I've worked a women's jail ministry &amp; also worked w/a recovery group. Just at that level alone, after awhile, it takes its toll emotionally, spiritually, &amp; 
mentally, not to mention, @ my age, physically.

               I understand. I have to say I went through the same process. Since realizing the truth I find it hard to focus on anything else because I can't help thinking of the poor kids locked up in some gloomy dungeon somewhere in Washington DC and being completely ignored by the complacent establishment and brainwashed crowds out there. I feel that if we don't help them nobody will, and they'll die there, and more will come.
              </p>

               But at the same time keeping focused on the issue when progress is slow isn't constructive. I think this investigation will take a long time to break through. Regardless of the amount of evidence we have, it will still have to pierce through a thick and incredibly dense layer of media collusion, and an even thicker layer of mass hysteria. People are so amazingly dumb, lazy and irresponsible that they prefer spending an inordinate amount of time repeating the same preprocessed drivel they heard in the media, and acting scornful to anyone who says otherwise, rather than spending the 20mn it would take to read the facts about pizzagate and form their own opinion. They just don't want to know, they are content herding and feel really afraid of being rejected by the group if they dare standing out. This is a battle we will win by convincing smart, courageous and open minded people one by one but those are rare and far in between so expect a very slow progress. The rest of the crowd will turn around instantly, herd behind us and pretend they had known we were right all along only once we have reached critical mass.

               Things will likely speed up a little bit after Trump's inauguration as some newspapers are just opportunistic and will instantly switch from left leaning to right leaning to follow the power. That won't make them more likely to expose a problem that is widespread on both sides of the right/left divide and that their management is likely involved in. But at least they won't have a reason to use pizzagate bashing to further a leftist agenda and their will be less cheer leading from HRC supporters.

               Personally I'll keep checking what's going on here and helping where I can. I'll probably do sprints when there is a breakthrough that opens new avenues for investigation. I'll keep doing my best to spread awareness about the case around me and out there. But I can't be entirely focused on that so I'll just make it a part of my routine going forward.

               One thing is sure though: having kids myself, I feel literally sick thinking that they are not safe anywhere, and that most reputable, powerful and educated people are actually the ones I should trust the less. My perspective about the world has changed, and there is no way back, so there is no way I'll just move on until I can be confident that we have effectively erased the corruption that's perverting the highest levels of society.

             Planned parenthood was not caught by okeefe. They called the police immediately after he left.

             Its why people didnt believe his DNC videos.

             The ACORN vids were total horseshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh confused the PP and ACORN vids. PP was not "caught" because the only thing Okeef proved was yes fetal tissues do indeed get sold. Planned parenthood was not making a "profit" The tissue sales certainly were not even covering the costs of said abortions.  But they did show the public that aborted tissues are indeed still used. Something not many people were happy about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then ya got ACORN was his video that I saw him dressed as a pimp talking about child prostition and running for congress. Absolute and total bullshit...They called the cops immediately after he left. Okeef was 100% full of shit in that video.
            </p>
            <p>
             They found ACORN employees scamming taxpayers though. By faking registrations and taking the commission off of them.

              Of course they caught PP. So what if PP called the police after he left... he had enough of their own words to show exactly what they were doing. He caught a lot of voter fraud in NH too, foreign political parties helping candidates, etc. ACORN was convicted, remember.

               Well that's a fair point. They were never caught helping people scam benefits or certainly never aided in child trafficking.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, your right I did not mention they indeed were up to some voter fraud. And I believe also helping foreign interests funnel money to canidates?
              </p>
              <p>
               Oh actually, the foreign national bit was never proven. Really what they busted ACORN for was several employees wrote in fake registrations. The purpose for the fake registrations is because employees were paid based on how many registrations they made.
              </p>
              <p>
               That is a good counterpoint. All in all though a program that helps poor people know what benefits they qualify for should exist.

               His ACORN bullshit though? completely fucked up. He actually got a very good program shut down that helped people to navigate the complicated system of how to get the help they need.

              It’s fair to say the Tromovitch view does not represent majority academic opinion. It’s likely, too, that some of the academic protests against the “stigmatisation” of paedophiles are as much a backlash against the harshness of sex offender laws as anything else. Finally, of course, academic inquiry is supposed to question conventional wisdom and to deal rigorously with the evidence, whether or not the conclusions it leads you to are popular.
Even so, there really is now no shortage of evidence about the harm done by child abuse. In the latest frenzy about the crimes of the past, it’s worth watching whether we could, in the future, go back to the intellectual climate which allowed them.

               fake news is absolutely real. If you think half of these newsites aren't making exaggerated claims or spewing outright sensationalist lies by twisting their 'sources' (which it looks like people like you aren't checking after all), if they even have any, in order to make a large profit from going viral, think again. Or think at all. For example the website linked, as well as CNN, you cuck. Learn to evaluate a source, or is critical thinking too much to ask? Oh wait I forgot, you wanna turn voat into your own safe space.

                  Double reply, because I owe you a real response instead of just going on the defensive.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Encouraging the fake news narrative is something this subvoat has been hit with in the past few days by very clear infiltrators.  Calling something a "fake news site" furthers that narrative.  Instead, I think we really ought to stay away from a term that is largely being to undermine us.  I don't see why you have to call it a "fake news site" when you can just call it "not a credible source".  Labeling things as "fake news" is a dangerous thing to do because of the context it carries.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That said, I don't want to create an echo chamber.  I want critical thinking.  I think too many of us get swept up in insignificant details and don't want to acknowledge when something is truly innocuous.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And thus I engaged in the same behavior by calling you a shill. I was following the crowd and was too aggressive toward you in my reaction.  I apologize for that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Unless you really are a shill.  In which case fuck right off.

                   You're right, I could have just called it a uncredible source. On the other hand, it was an opportunity to make the point that just because fake news is being used to discredit us, does not mean fake news is not real and dangerous to this investigation, which judging by many of the posts I've seen, especially lately, especially the ones which make it to the front page, is an an important point to make. Either way, nothing much came out of it, it got about 5 points in total, so mbleh.

                   Yeah a little bit, but eh, I don't know. I see a lot in common with some of the alt-right/neo-nazi/whatever-they-are-I-don't-know and SJWs -- more than I think either group realizes.

                    This really needs to be investigated with a centrist eye.  Go too far in either direction and you fall off the deep end, which I'd say a lot of people here have already done.  Sometimes we see these theories that are super sketchy, then people respond saying "I knew it!! Hang them all!!"  or "They can't get away with this forever!!", just taking everything at face value.
