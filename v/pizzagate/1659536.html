            Fuckwit mod Millenial_Falcon just deleted this post about Robert David Steele. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Stop posting the disinformation garbage of Robert David Steele
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Robert David Steele is a man that thinks Lynn Forester de Rothschild is anti-establishment, that she's some kind of caring capitalist that is for the people. He also thinks similarly of Michael Bloomberg. We know that Lynn Forester flew on Epstein's jet, we also know her circle of friends include Clinton, Brock, Podesta and the rest of that loathsome bunch. Further, Robert David Steele is now pushing the line that Podesta isn't really that bad, that he's a pedophile LITE and we should be more focused on the Republicans, they're the real bad guys. He's also concocted a pedophile story around Mike Pence and the Flynn resignation that is completely unsubstantiated. When you add in the fact that he keeps attempting to undermine Trump calling him an "accidental" president, that Trump never actually intended to win, that the majority are not behind him, that Trump should be listening to Steele because he has all the answers, you realise this guy is a total disinformation agent and most probably malicious. Do not trust anyone at this point that claims to be ex CIA.

             I like the way you think. And I always say, once a spook, always a spook. I do not trust Steele, but I thought he had a lot of good info. But I have no doubt he has an agenda and is attempting to lead astray in one are or another. He is not one of us. He is an "expert", and by his own admission, he is a huckster. Still has valuable insights. Upvote for not getting on the train.

             Good analysis.  I also found it strange that he thought Ralph Nader, Cynthia McKinney and Jesse Ventura should be brought in for a roundtable.

              Yeah, the guy is full of nonsense. I'm looking over his Public Intelligence Blog right now, reading a post he sent to FBI director James Comey. Check this out:
             </p>
             <p>
              PEDOPHILIA/SNUFFING USA. This is the game-changer going forward – the John Podesta emails are the opening we have all been waiting for – and there will be more. We are both devout Catholics, we both know the Church is part of the problem, but the impunity of the 1% — the financial elite and their political servant class – is the larger problem.

             ya, I'm no expert pizza investigator, but this guy says dumb shit and seems to WANT to give interviews. also consider that that DHS insider was recommending for Victurus Libertas to interview the guy and it all seems like one big disinfo campaign. Maybe I'm too skeptical because the DHS provided some interesting stuff, but it's all too strange that they're connected.

            I have been back and forth on Israel and if they are good or bad I knew they were blackmailing us but I wasn't sure if they are involved and how that would work. When I saw the Trump Netanyahu presser and how Trump kept hinting like they had a secret and everything was going to be great between us and them now I worried Trump was going to be blackmailing him now because he had nothing on Trump. I also suspected Netanyahu was making a threat to expose something when he announced about telling what happened to the missing kids...So it looks like Trump actually just told his buddy the gravy train was ending.

            Three days ago here I posted in a comment -

           <blockquote>

             So I want to throw this out there for your consideration. I think when there was that definite buzz "Arrests Immanent" not just from VL but other sources too, that was law enforcement playing the internet a bit to rattle the targets, get them to act out. If you know you are guilty and you start seeing that message all over the internet, it works your nerves and that's when people make bad moves like moving or dumping assets, shredding files, selling off contraband cheap, etc...Because he has been a channel for good info, I think we have to keep in mind that their leaks might not serve our interests every time, but a bigger picture interest that they have. I have come to see the buzz created online within watchful communities as one of the weapons both sides are using against one another.&gt;

             FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees.&gt;

           <p>
            So I called it, which I think I should document as good analysis on a tricky subject that had everyone's attention for days.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next I said, " I also think WorldCorp is some kind of psy-op, not sure which side."
            <br/>
            The WorldCorp site and the Heavy Breathing videos share a similar trash aesthetic, and goal - to degrade the population and entrain it.   If I had to come down on one side or another, I'd say the WorldCorp site, it's material, and the JP Father video, is black hat CIA.   Or a mix of white hats leaking video from the black hat site.  Which means I still really can't decide.  It was pushed very very heavily.  Who was pushing it/selling it to us?

             Good thoughts.
From what Steele said, something tells me, he IS FBIanon. Because what he says is, that FBI anon did just guess (rattle the cage). That means FBIanon does not know.
But he just skips that part, without any explanations, why he believes that FBIanon was only rattling the cages - he just makes further conclusions, as if it was totally clear to him, that FBIanon was not real.

             Also notice this quote from the state of the nation article -
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             At the Special session that Kutcher spoke at, McCain insulted him in passing, saying he was better looking on tv (pedo comment?) and Kutcher responded by throwing an air kiss.  Some here have seized on this as "proving" Kutcher is in bed with pedos.  I firmly disagree.   This was a "kiss my ass" response from an actor who is used to scrutiny and knows how to "kill" with kindness so to speak.   I think Kutcher is firmly in the camp of actually taking down pedos.   The shillery on this site is strong, and untrusted characters seem to pop up out of nowhere to constantly discredit anyone who lifts their head above the crowd to work on busting or spreading the word about pedogate - Kutcher, Seaman, RoseAnne even IsThisGameOfThrones.

              Kutcher was on Real Time with Bill Maher in 2008.  He said the election was a tough choice for him as he liked McCain and Obama which really confused Bill and his audience.

               Anybody that knows anything about the reality of what has been going on in the world would know that Obama and McCain are on the same team and pupett's pf the deep state. That was a hard choice for Kutcher? Hopefully he is just an airhead, uninformed or gullible. I am guessing he is the usual celebrity asset shilling for the masters.

              You obviously don't know that video:

             </p>
             <p>
              Demi has huge problems and judging from that video obviously is not mentally healthy, has no normal sexuality and is instable.
After watching that video I rewatched Kutcher's presentation and that changed my mind: his feelings are not authentic - nothing is authentic.

               I'll take a look.  I do agree right off the bat that Demi is unstable and especially went through a black period before and after her divorce.  But I do not think that makes her a Satanic ritual abuser.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't agree that nothing is authentic.  You and I are very real ; ).  and my heart goes out to you.  It is not quite that bad.  and we will win.  we will win together.
              </p>
              <p>
               EDIT:  I already saw the whole video.  Here is what i wrote about it elsewhere
              </p>
              <p>
               To be honest, no, I don't think being a drunk attractive girl who is used to everyone in the world thinking she is the bomb in 1985 grabbing a kid and over smooching him is strange. I have known such types and in their world it seems that they can do no wrong. I actually believe it was of a harmless intent. In fact what I think is that it was not premeditated at all and dizzily for one second thought she was giving the kid a sort of "birthday present" that he'd remember forever, his first kiss or something along those lines. At that time we were just coming out of a hedonistic period and people were totally untrained in ideas about power imbalances, grooming, and innapropriate touching, handling and such. Not saying that is alright, it was just a different era.

               This whole "they are ALL in on it.  Don't trust Hollywood"  gets to be too much.  Do you know how many working people live in Hollywood running on a rat wheel to make ends meet?  I am from there.  Not every single person is a pedophile because of geographic location, even higher profile people.  I don't think Demi Moore is in ot it.  I think she was drunk and did something really gross and stupid but I don't think she rapes infants and drinks their blood, which is the blackmail program for power.   Sorry, just my opinion.   If any better evidence suraces I'll be happy to take a look at it, but this stuff is lame   Like the argument "Kutchner dated his wife when she was underage"  Yeah, they were both younger once.

                 don't start getting crude.   This forum is for discussion not just singing a chorus of "YES!!!!"  Skepticism is valued and your lack of it coupled with an aggro obscene response only casts doubt on you bucko.

                 adding:  whatever Demi Moore did 30 years ago at a birthday party in front of a camera is not going to convince anyone but the feeble minded that that is proof that Ashton Kutcher is today lieing at a Congressional session about an anti-trafficking effort.

                  it's not going to convince anyone, but that video with Demi Moore makes you go WTF, is this chick MK ultra'd out of her mind or just underage drinking and acting sloppy? Someone claimed the kid she kissed/made out with was 15, but the kid looks like he's no older than 12 and it's just weird. if you flip the genders and have a 19 year old man do that to a 12-16 year old girl in public, he gets his face caved in and then a jail sentence.

                   absolutely it is replusive and the kid is just confused.   The problem I have is that this is being used to smear Kutcher, I suspect because they can't find anything more convincing on him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   She's young (under 20 I've been told) drunk, it's 30+ years ago and it is fully on camera in a well lit restaurant in front of a bunch of friends and family at a birthday party.   I can give anybody 1 pass under these circumstances.   This doesn't smear Kutcher. Everybody should live their life under a microscope going back decades and see how well they come off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I agree the kid looks young, maybe 12.  Even if he is fifteen it looks weird and wrong.

                    Don't you think the fact that such behavior is condoned out in the open is kind of strange though? that's sets off at least yellow flags in my book. I don't trust anyone or anything at this point, but like you said I can't condemn or smear Ashton over the actions of someone else 20 years ago. It is in the back of my mind though.

                     To be honest, no, I don't think being a drunk attractive girl who is used to everyone in the world thinking she is the bomb in 1985 grabbing a kid and over smooching him is strange.  I have known such types and in their world it seems that they can do no wrong.   I actually believe it was of a harmless intent.   In fact what I think is that it was not premeditated at all and dizzily for one second thought she was giving the kid a sort of "birthday present" that he'd remember forever, his first kiss or something along those lines.  At that time we were just coming out of a hedonistic period and people were totally untrained in ideas about power imbalances, grooming, and innapropriate touching, handling and such.  Not saying that is alright, it was just a different era.

               Thanks for posting this - I definitely learned something.
              </p>
              <p>
               First though I disagree with the poster for several reasons, and she does say right up front that this is just her opinion, so fair enough.  This is just mine.
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                She says the woman behind Kutchner "isn't trustworthy" with absolutely no cause.
               </li>
               <li>
                "I don't trust Kutchner."  Your opinion is not enough to convince me of wrongdoing on his part.  There are many people who don't like any person from Hollywood or the entire west coast for that matter.   Or anyone that isn't a professed Christian, etc.  This is not good enough or convincing to me.
               </li>
               <li>
                She tries to entrain the audience with - "you are going to instantly look past all he is doing" because she doesn't like him and is going to say negative things while showing his image.   Still not convincing whatsoever and I am starting to really distrust this woman speaking.
               </li>
               <li>
                "It's more of a portrayal"  "There is some moment to the truth then some stillness".   Sorry this is just babble and not convincing whatsoever.
               </li>
               <li>
                Focus on the woman behind again.  I don't care about her at all.
               </li>
               <li>
                AHH!  Finally we get to something, and it has nothing to do with the sweet female voice on the video which by now I don't trust at all.  Originally I watched a portion of this testimony but I did not watch it all.   Kutcher says, "This spotlight was enabled by the McCain Institution (RED FLAG)...a man I find to be a WAR HERO (false information) John McCain.
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               Ok that's what makes me suspicious.  The video OP could continue to do her somersaults of assertions and emotive "truths" and have no impact, but I didn't know Kutchner actually sent this valentine to McCain, besides the air kiss.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yes, now I am suspicious.  But the analysis on the video I am sorry to say is just an opinion, presented as entraining, and repels me.
              </p>
              <p>
               A hard look at the McCain foundation is what is called for.

            Anon private citizen investigation is the equivalent to wearing a protective bee suit and the people who are doing wrong don't know how to stop us, hence all the tactics we've seen; fake news, shilling, misinformation, personal threats, etc. Back on 4chan when this all started they were really trying hard to scare people off of it, saying things like 'i know who you are' etc... Nothings working for them. The power in coming after someone personally is in scaring others, since we're anon and independent, that doesn't work either. Basically they're fucked. They're a bunch of antiquated old hippy dipshits that don't understand how technology is impacting all the old ways of doing things such as managing civil disobedience, controlling media, etc... They're like little kids playing hide and seek and they think if they can't see you, you can't see them. We're calling them out at every turn, we're reading they're emails, etc... This is a new era of accountability that's just getting started and will only grow. Even the old conspiracy theorists are having trouble competing for attention. Everytime I here 'my inside sources tell me...' I think huckster. After dhs anon made claim that 1/3 of DC is pedos, several of these hucksters co opted that statement as something they got from secret inside sources.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was a kid a friend and I found a large hornet's nest, from quite a distance, 100 or so feet away we threw rocks at it, until we hit it, and took off, nothing happened, made a clean getaway. The next day we came back to inspect the damage and assault them some more, I picked up a rock and as soon as I got my arm raised up to throw, a hornet shot down at a ridiculous speed and stung me right in the bicep. We didn't get swarmed like the cartoons, just one astonishingly smart fucking bee was all it took, I never fucked with those hornet's again.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like we're throwing rocks at a hornet's nest, but wearing bee suits. One of the creepiest things about posting on here is knowing that I'm part of a group of posters that includes some of the very people we're trying to get, they're right in here with us, the nasty pedos that have done the things we're trying to stop.

             ''hucksters co opted that statement as something they got from secret inside sources''. So damn true. Also, form day one on Reddit I am quite sure that the creeps were in here trying to sway things and send us on wild goose chases or chase down leads that would make us look ridiculous. Enough here have been savvy enough to sense that and so far not all that much damage has been done. I have a feeling with Frank Giustra in particular, that everything coming out about him is buried and yet still, some of us keep reposting that material

             This gave me a chuckle.  Indeed.  One thing they absolutely can't fight or win against in our quest for truth are some of our most valuable innate skills and human strengths -  variously called such things as gumshoe detective hunches, woman's intuition, intuitive logic, supernormal sensing, hive mind, collective consciousness, technomysticism, counter psy-ops, truth dissemination, oracular forecasting, empathic response and downright old fashioned spiritual guidance.

             Another hucksterism statement 'in my book I...'
Of course not all self promoters and book writers are hucksters, is just that they have a hard time not crossing lines of integrity when it comes to attention seeking, add we all know.

            #SaveTheKids  A key part of the communication strategy is to inform people that this is non-partisan, and the evil infects both parties. This helps disarm those on the left or who are opposed to trump. And then point out how both the left/Democrats and the right/Republican establishment vilify Trump, and the media absolutely hates him. They have to wonder why everybody in power is so opposed to him, and #PedoGate gives the answer.

              Exactly- and I'm trying different ways of redpilling people. I start with Franklin. And "The Finders" and then Sandusky.... and not all at once. Over a few days...So there is a pretty obvious documented pattern: Police involved, Media/newspaper involved, judiciary involved, and CIA involved. Around the world Saville, DuTroux, Hampstead, etc - so USA is the

            This was a nice bit of info....
Q. Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low-level arrests.
           </p>
           <p>
            A . FBI anon did a “bank shot”. That’s a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“.
           </p>
           <p>
            It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about “Russian influence” and utter silence on “Mossad” influence in our power structure?
When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of “people” i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliath’s noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have to go, but please contact Robert David Steele, the former CIA agent we discussed. I am sure he would appear on your channel. You are providing a real service to the people and we hope you will continue to speak up for the regular folks who are concerned, rightfully, as to the state of our nation.  Take care!

              red pilled my child's father today, my old social studies teacher a couple days ago (a lover of russia but not putin, man I bet she lost it when I said it was fake news around him too), hmmm whos next?  I'm trying to be selective as casting a wide net with all the info at once rather than breadcrumbs is not how to approach the masses.

               Good for you. Exactly - to come at friends and family that a satanic cult is running the world and sexually abusing and sacrificing children would not have interested me before I opened my eyes. As I've said before I come at it from a historical basis with Boystown/Franklin and usually bring up "The Finders" and share that US Customs reports showing it was turned over to CIA as internal matter. Evidence convinces people not me. I ask them to disagree and tell me what see if don't see it as I want to firm up or look at it deeper.

             Inform everyone you can, by showing them the evidence that convinced you.  Bring them here to the voat thread, emphasize that people disbeleiving it without investigating it first ENABLES children to be abused, raped, and murdered. Show them 'George Webb' channel on Youtube.  Spread the info.  THEN you and everyone you inform needs to harass the FUCK out of your elected representatives.  Picket outside their offices, protest all their events, until talking about Pedogate is completely UN-AVOIDABLE.  Make it a ballot issue, as much as pot legalization, as much as tax cuts, as much as immigration.  It is time to PUT ON THE PRESSURE!  We must FORCE every single elected official to choose a side, and those that choose to protect pedo's we need to broadcast that THEY ENABLE violence against children, rape of children, and murder of children.

              We need a strong central organization to co-ordinate events like protests, marchs, etc for awareness of Pizzagate.  If BLM and Soros can do it, we can too.

               The MOST important thing is to red-pill people and wake them up.  Education of the public is our #1 weapon.  Do your best not to make it political, make it about the children, show that there hasn't even been an attempt to FAKE an investigation.  Show that there is a huge blindspot in our law enforcement that is ignoring the abuse, rape, and murder of children.
