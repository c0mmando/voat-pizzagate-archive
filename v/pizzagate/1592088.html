            I'm one.  For a while, I thought that PG --&gt; "fake news", but I then heard that the "fake news" meme was being fired up prior to the start of the PG investigation.  So, now I believe that the PTB used a weapon they already had started to use, expanding its purpose.  (I think it started off as a way to explain why people were voting for Trump instead of Hillary.)  Others argue that the "fake news" meme was being rolled out in advance of PG by PTB who knew PG was about to break, but that seems a bit tin foily IMO.

            On this point: "February: Stratfor CEO George Friedman frustrated by not being told what "Pizza Party" codeword means[11]", refencing this email:
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/39/399189_re-i-need-to-add-.html">
             https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/39/399189_re-i-need-to-add-.html
            </a>
            -
           </p>
           <p>
            After reading the email I don't see the CEO questioning the meaning of the phrase "Pizza Party".  Instead, it seems like the CEO is saying that his COO is keeping him out of the loop as to all the particular details of Tim's "Pizza Party" proposal, and he wants to be more involved.  Additionally, the COO's response to this complaint mentions the "pizza project" and "pizza meeting" without any explanation of what that means, so it seems like that both have an understanding of what "pizza" is referring to in this instance.

            Have I missed something?

            If not, I would suggest changing the description of this timeline point to: 
February: Stratfor CEO George Friedman frustrated at not being kept in the loop concerning the latest details of the "Pizza Party" proposal, or "pizza project"[11]

             You are correct, and let me know if you feel what was posted is in some way misleading. My point in including this particular email, however, was to establish the use of "pizza" in codewords which are known to have other meanings.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this case, George Friedman does directly reference a "Pizza Party" codeword, but it's likely in reference to the "PIZZA" test of their website/susbcriptions/etc. It still confirms the use of "pizza" as a codeword, which actually has been referenced by the MSM in events such like this:
             <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/11/pizza-cia/">
              https://www.wired.com/2011/11/pizza-cia/

             <p>
              If the point is simply to point out the fact that pizza is being used as a codeword, you could just say:
February: Stratfor CEO George Friedman emails Stratfor COO Darryl O'Connor to discuss a project code-worded "Pizza Party"[11]
             </p>
             <p>
              Although I don't think the original description is terribly misleading on the whole, I do think it is inaccurate to say that the CEO was asking about the meaning of the "Pizza Party" codeword, and I can see others using this detail to discredit the whole premise.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think this email actually makes a stronger case that pizza is being used as a codeword than the Stratfor email discussed in this thread(
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1541689">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1541689
              </a>
              ) which discusses the wired article you referenced.  Although it is clear in that email/Wired article that the spies in Lebanon were using "pizza" as a codeword, unfortunately it also seems that the Wired article is saying the spies were specifically using "pizza" as a codeword for their meeting place: "Pizza Hut".  It's the fact that the choice of their codeword, "pizza", was so close to the actual public name of their meeting place, "Pizza Hut", that makes the choice of the codeword, according to the Wired author, "one of the stupidest, least secure code words in history".  Also unfortunate, it seems that there really is at least one Pizza Hut restaurant in Beirut, Lebanon.
             </p>
             <p>
              In defense of the idea that the codeword "pizza" may have had a meaning greater than "Pizza Hut", it should be noted that the Wired author does say, "An anonymous U.S. official denies to ABC that CIA’s Hezbollah network actually met in a Pizza Hut".  However, it is easy for someone to say that this US official was just trying to protect sensitive information about the meeting places of their spies.  All said, I think this article is too easy for deniers to say that the codeword in this instance was only meant to refer to Pizza Hut.  It is this fact that makes the George Friedman email more important in establishing the idea that Stratfor used "pizza" as a codeword, but it makes it too easy to deny by having any inaccuracies in the claim.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lastly, what did you mean when you said "it's likely in reference to the "PIZZA" test of their website/susbcriptions/etc"?  What would a "PIZZA test of their website" mean?

               Ah, you may be unfamiliar, but the "PIZZA test" has been the source of a lot of Stratfor's emails pertaining to coded use of the often-capitalized "PIZZA". This most likely was a test involving how they received subscribers to their paid mailing list, but they used bizarre codewords like "pizza" and "pizza test with horses".
              </p>
              <p>
               At first Pizzagate researchers thought they certainly had to deal with pedophilia, which not all instances of seem to indicate, but some most certainly mention the aforementioned test using bizarre, coded terms.You might find a lot of interesting WikiLeaks emails which were compiled and archived by yours truly, ctrl+f and look for pizza to find emails about the PIZZA test and more:

                After reading more about the "Pizza Party" tests, I do agree with you that it looks like George Friedman was referring to Tim Duke's work on the redesign of their credit card landing pages, which Tim Duke refers to as "Pizza Pages"(
                <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1326067_testing-the-pizza-pages-your-list-.html">
                 https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1326067_testing-the-pizza-pages-your-list-.html)
                </a>
                ).  For the reference of other readers, here is a "Pizza Report" where Tim provides a Word document showing his old and new credit card pages:
                <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1345661_revised-pizza-report-.html">
                 https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1345661_revised-pizza-report-.html
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                At the surface, it does seem like Tim was just redesigning the checkout webpages to more effectively bring in subscribers to Stratfor's "intelligence newsletter" (
                <a href="https://lp.stratfor.com/subscribe-2017">
                 https://lp.stratfor.com/subscribe-2017)
                </a>
                ).  However, I'm not sure why that would need such a secretive codeword, and I agree that there are many strange references to the project.
               </p>
               <p>
                Perhaps this was a project to sell CP through their public newsletter signup form - to do this you would need to have server logic in place to flag specifically listed users (either by email address, like
                <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7f3e11060b1716111806100a081e110b3f1a131416110c0c0f1e1c1a511c1012" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
                 [email protected]
                </a>
                , or credit card number) to allow them to receive extra special CP content instead of the normal newsletter.  The emails do show that the signup pages are referred to as a "Pizza Passthru" -

                Anyway... do you know what the "TUSIAD test simulation" was about?

            As so many people were marching in the street breaking windows and screaming. This incredible citizen investigation was chasing down truth. Not out of greed, or politics, no specific idealogy. The need for justice on behalf of the most innocent. Those who joined with hatred and false motives were taken down and weeded out by all of us coolectively. Much work has to be done for sure but if anyone questioned the moral courage that can be found in individual hearts that collectively will join together with clear purpose they should be ashamed. The heros committed to all of this especially as we moved from the 4chan/8chan..to reddit...the donald..youtube...to Vimeo..twitter...to gab.....to Voat.  And everybody in between. True heros with moral clarity on a mission for justice. Demanding truth and expressing it in the most powerful right guaranteed in the USA constitution. Freedom of speech. The collective stood up on behalf of the silenced-from the most innocent to the many witnesses that have been trapped in that trauma-and spoke Truth to Power. That is the epitome of justice. All involved in the wrong side of History....You have been served!!!!

              Yes. I pray hearts can find healing as the collective conscience of truth stands up. There are many victims. Innocent children, as well of a current generation of "silent witness" full of so much pain and sadness. Helplessness is the most traumatizing experience for the soul whether you are 5 years old or 30 yrs old...it traps the soul
This is PTSD.  I hope we can teach the world that there often is no perfect answer...sometimes one has to take the next best choice. " 
There needs to be moral clarity from the top down. Principals moral logic with a mission. Identified by the leaders and explained to the citizens. Let the sunshine in. And as demonstrated by this massive investigation the collective moral conscience will rise up to the challenge and support the mission. This provides freedom  so the trauma does not get trapped. Not elegant speech personal knowledge. Thanks

             I have made all the updates as per your submissions and they're spectacular. The Clinton email really puts things in perspective when you look at it on the timeline, plus I threw in the fact that they had no permits to relocate to Dominican Republic for great justice.

            I think you missed this NLCR WikiLeaks for January 30th, 2010:
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3752">
             https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3752
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, under aliases, you should probably put short names as aliases. For instance, when people message Hillary Clinton it sometimes appears as just an "H".

            PBS Frontline aired a good piece on Trump and the election last night and they actually did a good job. Talked chronologically about Wikileaks and Podesta and Comey etc. and the effect all of it had on the election, somewhere about in the middle of the program. Almost as if they (Frontline) had experienced a little red-pilling themselves. It was exciting to watch.

             I imagine tons in the media know and are desperate chomping at the bit to report on it.  But the previous administration would have certainly had their jobs and probably had them placed on the JTTF "harass you until you die" list.

Pizzagate is a debunked[2][3] conspiracy theory that emerged during the 2016 United States presidential election cycle alleging that John Podesta's emails, which were leaked by WikiLeaks, contain coded messages referring to human trafficking and connecting a number of restaurants in the United States and members of the Democratic Party with a fabricated child-sex ring. It has been extensively discussed in the media and discredited by a wide array of sources across the political spectrum, described as a "fictitious conspiracy theory" by the District of Columbia Police Department and determined to be false by multiple organizations including Snopes.com, The New York Times, and Fox News.

             It's open to the public in the sense that anyone can apply to help WikiLeaks. They, however, must approve an account for you to then publish content. It took me a good while to finally get in touch with them (considering I've been trying since November when Pizzagate started), but I think they have recently started to seek more published content relating to their leaks and hence have reached out to the Pizzagate community a couple times.

             More specifically this is the section of WikiLeaks in which non-official members are allowed to publish content and "speculative threads". There is a disclaimer at the top stating WikiLeaks does not specifically endorse content published here, but it should also be noted that everything published thus far on the Pizzagate page is directly related to WikiLeaks material.
