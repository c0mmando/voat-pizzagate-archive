            I would be careful about running pentesting against websites that aren't yours. That's kinda a great area of legality. But having said that, thanks for doing it

            So, I dug into all these websites along with a lot of others back when someone posted instructions on how to use xhydra to login into Comet Ping Pong. sli.mg screwed me when they went down, so you are going to have to take my word for some of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, I used HTTrack to sownload everyone's websites that I thought could be relevant. That is when I found some weird stuff on lhohq with CIA planes and a rotating pedophocracy email list.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found CP on easthamptonbabysitters.com which is run by infant masseuse, Kevin Reynolds, a friend of the Clintons. Kevin Reynolds also featured himself on Facebook masturbating into a lake. I submitted it to authorities who never responded, but I did notice that the CP  was removed off the hidden end of the site. He also has a vacation concierge service that involves being sailed around on a boat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Comet's login just had a list of files and each one needed a password. The files were encrypted and we got a couple, but I was never able to do anything with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            They redid both websites after the shooter and the look is very different now. It is possible that they have set it up specifically to mess with people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evie's Crib was another one that seemed suspicious and, if I recall correctly, it seemed that the same hand made easthamptonbabysitters,  Evies Crib, Comet and Bucks' sites, Pizza Packet, etc, the first clue being the 90's style web design between them all. I was at this skill level in high school, in creating sites and it was weird when you keep coming across crappy 90's style sites with the exact same stylistic choices and layout of pages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, they outsourced everything after that. I really don't think there is much to be found and I would recommend checking other sites provided by the same current services and compare their file structure, because it is probably the same. Whoever was doing the sites before isn't doing them now.

             You can get around the "Too many requests" by setting your HTTP request user agent to look like the google crawler. - Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html) - Or the mobile version of with this - DoCoMo/2.0 N905i(c100;TB;W24H16) (compatible; Googlebot-Mobile/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html).  I have had this work in the past.  Good Luck!

             It didn't really help, just gave me back the things you see on the site (including the fonts and such) - that much could easily be figured out by right clicking on the page itself and going to "inspect".

              I think the pen results you got is somewhat misleading. Many urls shared in your scribd list are dead. That can mean two things:
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               Those files were already cleaned up.
              </li>
              <li>
               Or the pen test relied on the most commonly used words (a dictionary) to probe for directories/files and report the stats.
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              The problem with the latter is that an invalid url path could be interpreted as forbidden (code 403), with implication that the path itself actually exists. So if you go to
              <code>
               https://www.cometpingpong.com/pay-to-play-pizza/kids/
              </code>
              , it may give you the "403 Forbidden" stat code, which showed up on most of your links. It does not mean that there is actually a directory named pay-to-play-pizza on that website; it only means that you did not have the permission to poke this url path. I think this is something worth considering, before jumping to the conclusion or following down an empty path...
             </p>
             <p>
              Of all the links in your list, may I ask which urls were valid?
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks!

               This sounds really plausible. But why would the two scans find different directories if the second option was the case ("Or the pen test relied on the most commonly used words (a dictionary) to probe for directories/files and report the stats.")  Wouldn't the results be the same for each?

                The results would be different, if the pen test only runs a subset of the dictionary words. This may have to do with speeding up the pen test. Remember, it is a pen/probe test, it does not have to run at every combination.

                I would say running the pen test may be useful and speedy, but you should manually verify that the links are good, that the links actually point to meaningful files. It is not good enough to use the 403 code as an indicator. And when you do find a valid file, use the archive.fo to preserve its content. For some tricky websites that do not let you archive the links, you could use proxy sites to indirectly archive the sources. I have used this method several times for this purpose.

                  429 means you are making too many requests and the site rejects the requests.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  403 means the site has configuration in place, that forbids you for probing/discovering the directory path.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For the 429 code, you would have to try it at a slower pace, to see if it returns any other code. For the 403 code, you cannot know if the directory is valid or not. If you hit a valid file, however, you can still validate its existence. For example,
                  <code>
                   http://cometpingpong.com/good-directory/
                  </code>
                  may give you a 403 code, but the
                  <code>
                   http://cometpingpong.com/good-directory/pizza.php
                  </code>
                  may give you a proper file. And this is how you verify the directory
                  <code>
                   good-directory
                  </code>
                  itself is actually valid. But without hitting a valid file, you may never know. Another exception is if the site is misconfigured to show directory listing, where all files are listed, simply by navigating to the directory in question.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To answer your question, yes, it could lead to somewhere. But that is unlikely to give you the desirable outcome. But if you have a good list of words in your dictionary, you could probe it through proxies, and do it

                    This has to do with the pen test website that sends out too many requests within a short duration. For example, it sends out 20 URLs to probe for with in a few second. Websites do not like that and it could be perceived as an attack. It is also not very nice to drain a website's resource by making too many requests, because the site has to serve many users/customers, not just your pen test.

                     So a combination of my test plus customers/users is making those pages that currently say "too many requests" unusable. How could those specific pages once again become usable or when would I be allowed entry (if this is the case and I'm not reading all of this wrong).

                      The bottom line is, the website does not like any user making too many requests. Maybe you could try testing one url per 1 to 5 seconds. I am not sure if you have any control of this parameter, if tested through that pen tool website. If you do have this option, you could just rerun your pen test at a slower pace.

            I'm by no means a 1337 Hax0r, but I did do some analysis on this many moons ago.
            <br/>
            Perhaps someone with more talent could pick up where I left off.

            On both cometpingpong.com/protected and bucksfishingandcamping.com/protected the code is virtually identical, this code shows that the login button simply reloads the page but expects POST data.
            <br/>
            See line 1 below.
            <br/>
            The POST data is entered in the Password field.
           </p>
           <p>
            This could probably quite easily be brute forced by someone more knowledgeable than myself.
           </p>
           <pre><code>&lt;form action="" method="post" class="cc-protected-area"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
    Password-protected area
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p class="cc-protected-note"&gt;
    This page is accessible with a valid password only.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="cc-protected-note"&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Password:
&lt;/p&gt;

              All u have to do to reset ur student loan to zero dollars...is instruct the debt reduction dept of theUS tressury and agree to use ur credit to get them to reduce their debt...in return for resseting and settling all charges against ur name and any future charges..
Get  an acknowledgement that since u r going to bank with them to reduce their risk u are their surety with surety rights oveer them..
U signature and application created the loan ...not the govt or bank..its ur consent that created credit into existence for ur name ..which is a trust account ..
             </p>
             <p>
              Try it with 2 dollars...and email the US treasury that u want to reduce their debt by 2 dollars ...
Anyone on the planet can do it..i have confirmation by email from the US treasury..

                See, the shills here dont like what im teaching u ..
Look at the negative vote...
They know this is the solution to make u untouchable to the authoritities ...and outiside thier authority...with u being the authority over the US..
They got us thinking we r their servants ...when we run the show , whether in peace or their war game...
They always require our consent ...
When we decide we dont want to play and lend our energy to the wwar game they lose their power...and we gain ours back from lending it to them...we run the game of peace..
I am going to charge a private individual for libel...and all damages will be paid to the US treasury..u can place similar charges on any public officials..including the pedovore inc..
We r the trump ...
Its our game of peace...they have programmed us to pplay the game of war ...we cant tame that game ...but we can turn it off on them..by battling the self ...they become irrelevant

                First it involves a one sentence email to the debt reduction department if the US treasury...
Asking whether when u provide credit or assets to reduce their debt that  they will accept ur surety rights over them and thus agree to set off any charge in ur name , past , present and future..
..
First confirm that with them for urself or any group u want to form
               </p>
               <p>
                Ure one email away from them acceppting ur offer..
They have to...the US is ur treasury..
               </p>
               <p>
                Its no different than when u hand or loan over ur credit to the debt banking system..
               </p>
               <p>
                One created more debt to survive...
The other reduces debt for u to servive...
               </p>
               <p>
                Which one do u choose...? War or peace

               I'm not 1337 Hax0r either but this is why you don't post it to the public if you find a potential vulnerability. Instead, try to find the Hax0r in this community and approach him with PM.
