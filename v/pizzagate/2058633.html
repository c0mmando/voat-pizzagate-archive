            What amazes me as well, is his wife.  How in the world can a mate, knowing that all their years together have been a lie and being married to a pedophile, still stay. I just don't get it, it boggles the mind.

             It is beyond disgusting what is going on in this country and also the world.  I so agree with you, that it needs to stop.It has taken years for this to get to this point and it will not be gone overnight.  But I really truly believe we can make a difference.  We have to make others believe that it just because it is so, does not make it right, and that it can be changed.

             What is your solution or idea?
            </p>
            <p>
             You know 18 year olds go to high school too, right?
            </p>
            <p>
             I dislike the general concept of 'fucking', naturally I think marriage is probably the way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the whole age of consent thing seems very strange to myself.  The first thing is what you point to, 16 with 40+, the arguement that I hear is that a 16 year old isn't intelligent enough to know what they are doing or is capable of being manipulated.  But why then do these ideas suddenly vanish when it's two 16 year olds or something?  Further more, if someone is 16 and may not have the most worldly experience on hand, wouldn't a 16 year old having kids with someone who might have more, rather than equal or less, worldly experience be a superior route?
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, concerning the concept of adulthood, intelligence and maturity.  They try people in court as adults as young as 14, the drivers license age in south dakota is 14, 16 in Illinois.  If you are trying people of these certain age ranges and giving them immense fatal responsibilities they damn well better be adults.
            </p>
            <p>
             Third.  The spectrum of responsibility placed on a persons shoulders is often broken and random.  I don't understand the system at all, the age of consent varies wildly from state to state and nation to nation, from something like 12 to 21 or married only.  Ultimately I feel a maturity test would sort this out pretty neatly, they use these in court cases for young, I am sure this can be applied else where.
            </p>
            <p>
             Something that worries me immensely is white birth rate, people creating this immensely negative taboo surrounding human sexuality disappoints me.  I am not saying I support pedo stuff remotely, I am saying 16 years old with the ability to drive a car, cut the umbilical cord.

              The age of consent in DC should be 18.  Also, Congressmen should be barred from sexual relations with Pages.  It is too easy for the Congressmen to use their power and influence to take advantage of such young people.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the age of consent needs to take into account the age difference between the participants.  It makes much more sense. Just to be clear, I am not arguing that teenagers should not have sex.  I am saying that politicians should not be involved.  Maybe I should have made that more clear.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think you make some valid points, and I do not pretend to have the full solution. However, I know that DC is a cesspool of sexual degeneracy when it comes to people in positions of power.  Have you read the Talmud?  Based on your username, you probably know all about it.

              Have you seen this video before?  It is a short 10 minutes, and it would be great if you can listen to it all.

              Bush Snr and Jr are both Zionists and New World Order globalists.  I think they are both Luciferians, too.  If this is the world they want to create, then it is worth fighting against.

               I understand the idea that there is a fear of power abuse, but to make it an all around law and illegal 100% bar none end of discussion because of a potential scenario seems absurd to me.

               I am guessing a lot of this extends well beyond the kind of idea I am referring to.  The guess is this involves children, to me 16 isn't a child, certainly not if they can drive a car or something.  I think this is a critical distinction on this topic.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hear of cases where a 17 and 18 year old do it and the 18 year old goes to prison.  Even something like a 16 year old and a 25 or whatever year old doesn't automatically imply anything nefarious to myself.  What I am driving at is this sort of idea sounds like a witch hunt in a lot of situations and a victimless crime.

               I suspect crypto currency isn't as ideal as many imagine for various reasons.  Part of me suspects that it is largely a zionist invention or ideal.  I don't know for sure though.

                OK.  So the law needs to be narrowly tailored to prevent abuse by politicians, but yet it allows younger people to have their fun.  Agreed?

                Yes, the video illustrates the problem that needs to be solved.  I am sure you are aware of Sandusky, Hastert, and many others.  I don't have a problem with 14-18 year olds going at it, but it is a huge problem when a 55 year old Senator is screwing a 16 year old high school student.  At least, to me it is a huge problem.

             My post was about Illinois.  I don't know if Gill is Gay or not, maybe he just did not have enough votes.  Maybe he is gay, but that does not mean he is a pedophile.  The people of Colorado need to protest and carry signs out in front of everyone that voted no.  The push must be on.  I still have hope in our voters.  My friend from Ill. is calling everyone she knows.  She is in mortal shock.  So get on the stick people in Col.

              hojo --
There are "teams" here but they are involved in anti-Jewish posts which I occasionally down vote.
Probably what you don't like about my posts is making clear that it is MALES who are our sexual abusers of children...which even right wing women's organizations confirm.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are also "teams" here which remain obsessed with homosexuality and who try desperately to convince the public that it is homosexuals who are our sexual abusers of children ... though heterosexuals are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child.
             </p>
             <p>
              And just to confirm this for you -- I've probably only cast 10 or less down votes for anyone here since I've been here, but I'll be sure now to substantially increase my down votes when I see homophobic or anti-Jewish posts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks -- !

              Not sure why I was tagged in this message? While I do often have differing opinions from Votescam (and occasionally DarkMath) they both seem sincerely dedicated to the cause. Slander is such a problem here.

             I KNOW.  I have a friend there and she is flabbergasted.  Totally amazed.  Remember the phrase from the song NY NY.....If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere.  It just takes some elbow grease and contacting the right people.  Some states are almost totally corrupt like the small ones (CT)  but not all. We must not give up hope. which is easy to do when you are on here all day everyday seeing nothing but sordid sad news.

              Carmencita, you get a hold of all the best news. = : O )   You rock.
             </p>
             <p>
              You cover the whole spectrum.  Wow, imagine no statute term limits.  Can't even imagine that, not on my deck, its all been up soo long ago.  I didn't even start to remember the 90% until 40 years later,  The greater the trauma the greater the forget.
             </p>
             <p>
              What people don't include in this discussion is that we were made to forget for a very long time ON PURPOSE.
             </p>
             <p>
              The article says: “At times, survivors of abuse need time to discover the courage to address these horrific and awful crimes.”   That's true, but their is another side.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's not time that's needed for the courage, but time needed to simply remember what was forgotten by the effects of repeated trauma and drugs.  This remembering if it does occur, is a reality shattering time for any survivor.  It can be a very long time later but remarkably detailed.

               Thank you. Yes, it is true, sometimes and most times you do not remember well into adulthood and then when it is told, it is not the true story.  When it is finally pulled out it is so much more horrid and painful than what was  remembered.  It is beyond what anyone can endure, so they remember only what they can take.  It is so very tragic. Hastert is a terrible man.  And so are the others.  Anyone that takes away a person's childhood in that horrible way should be locked away forever.  They are a danger to society.

            It's important to note this is for the State of Illinois only. It's not a federal law. Is there also an Act in Congress doing the same thing? Probably not as 50% of the mother fuckers are pedophiles as it is.

             Well, I never thought it would happen in Illinois with the types of Dems that head that state, so there is hope.  We must always have hope.  Maybe the office of Scalise should be contacted?  Idk, people should send a letter, either way.  We know some who are suspect, and those will be a waste of time, but others should be contacted.

              It's worth a try but I wouldn't get your hopes up. The entire Scalise "shooting" may have been another Smith-Mundt hoax to get an assault rifle ban. How do I know? The person who took the video of the "shooting" would have run away if it was real. Only an insane idiot or a shill would film a man randomly shooting people with an AK-47 assault rifle. It defies comprehension.

               I know, that is a possibility.  But people should still contact their lawmakers.  We have no way of knowing at this point.  It is only a short letter.  It will only take a few minutes to write up and then send off.

              This is not the only issue.
             </strong>
             More can be done around SOL's to protect children.
            </p>
            <p>
             The statute of limitations should be eliminated retroactively for all civil cases of CSA.

               Why SOL Reform?
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Identify Predators
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Disclose the identification of previously unknown predators to the public so children will not be abused in the future.
              </strong>
              Predators generally have more than one victim.
              <strong>
               While criminal SOLs can not be retroactive, civil SOLs can be.
              </strong>
              Publicly identifying predators could have the dual benefit of bringing justice to victims and preventing future abuse by the same perpetrator. When California passed reform legislation, over 300 previously unknown offenders were publicly exposed and hundreds of previously unknown victims were able to come forward.

              .  I am not an authority on law but maybe there could be an amendment added or something called a rider (sorry if there is a better choice of words).  I am always in favor of more ways to protect our children.  Thank you for your comment.

             I was amazed to find this.  I have been a huge supporter of this law as I am sure many members on here are as well.  YES, this must be submitted by Congress.  We should all push our Federal Lawmakers to sponsor and sign on to this Bill.  Pronto.  I will contact mine and am sure I will only get a form letter, but at least they will know my views.  And believe me, my words will be strong.

            I was seeking new info on Hastert and this eventually evolved.  Great news for our children.  This applies to pizzagate because it helps sex abuse survivors gain a voice against their abusers which is what we are helping to research and investigate. We are all working towards ending this scourge and bills like this will lock these criminals up and get them off the street.   If this law were in place for the Hastert case, he would have been in jail until his dying day. We must push our law makers to come forward and not be afraid to stand up for our children. This is the kind of man that we need in our state govt.  He is a Dem.  There are good and bad on both sides.

             Remember how the Podestas are good friends of Hastert's? And when he was arrested, instead of expressing disgust or shock JP just seemed sad that his friend was being held accountable for his abuse of children. Speaks volumes, no?
