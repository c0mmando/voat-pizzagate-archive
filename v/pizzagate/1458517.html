              It is what it is.  But there is so much preposterous crap on here these days, anyway, this is hardly the worst offender.   Such as this nonsense, left up for 5 hours today by the so called "mods"

             <p>
              It's like no one commenting even bothered to read the article which is understandable because you have to look through comments to even find it.  But it clearly states that the transgendered guy stopped wearing drag long before caring for Obama because their type were harrassed and killed for it.  It doesn't say he runs a ring of prostitutes now but takes in laundry.  At any rate its just a load of horseshit except for the bare fact that the individual cooked and cared for Obama for 2 years.  He was not pimping out the kid at least FROM THE EVIDENCE in the article.  Its not even connected to pizzagate and these mods who act so important and "by the book" couldn't care less and let that stay up.  What a joke.

             That doesn't work because the Reverend's address is listed that he is in 689 Broad St. that address did not exist at that time period as far as I can tell.

              Ok, I did look at your information more carefully just out of curiosity. I found dead ends also. I think the name is Theodoros instead of Theodozos. Also, the passenger list says "father" for paying for her trip... could be her father back in Greece. You're right, I don't find this Theodoros anywhere. He could go by a different name, though. I looked at a Greek Orthodox Church in Manhatten (Annunciation), I didn't see his name for past priests (record went back to 1800's). I'm not sure about the Broad street address in 1910, however there is a Broad Street in Manhatten. Scholar probably just means student. It is possible she came over as a housekeeper, I know a student from another country who came to USA as a nanny 10 years ago and worked as a nanny and waitress here as she went to school, now has a master's degree.

               Also in the Book about white slave trade it talks about the American lady dressed like royalty makes friends with the parents but leaves without ever taking the girl.

               Again doesn't work. She's 47 years old and is still a housekeeper when applying to become citizen. From Wikipedia  "Many trafficking victims are women and girls from impoverished rural regions of the Amazon, recruited and coerced into prostitution in urban nightclubs, bars, and brothels, often through false employment offers or promises of education.

             In 1910 Mary's mom immigrated from Greece. In the time period it was mentioned in the book on white slave trade for Americans to travel overseas and find the prettiest girls to enslave in brothels. They may offer them education for the girl In America. On the passenger manifest it shows us that she was a "scholar" at 16 and that she was likely a victim herself because she was traveling alone and paid for by a "Reverend" father. I've included Mary's birth certificate online record to show that this is in fact Podesta's grandmother

            Also in the same book it mentions that people would have girls in places like Ice Cream Parlors. It also says that in Rome "Many bakers, barbers and keepers of taverns, baths and drug stores were also traders in women." Makes sense why they would use pizza places
