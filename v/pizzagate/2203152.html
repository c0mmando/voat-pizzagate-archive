            He had enough of the publicity stunt his PR reps told him to take part in. I predict he flees the country he'll fly to France where Polanski went outside US extradition then he'll start a new film company there and live out his life in luxury. He'll say he can't get a fair trial in America too much negative publicity and no jury would give him a fair trial. The French will be happy to have him they will treat him like Hollywood Royalty and he'll have a lot of financial investors in Europe.

            He probably can't get better. He would have to figure out why he has the urge to overpower others and I doubt he considers that urge to even be a defect. It wouldn't be worth the grief and introspection to him.

           <p>
            If he even comprehends introspection.

            Its funny that people will actually think that this fat greasy Jew piece of shit is "trying to get better." People really can't see that Harvey is a smokescreen for all the other stuff going on. They're using him as cover while they scramble. I imagine he may "commit suicide" after he's outlived his usefulness.

             I agree. He is the bait they tossed us hoping to appease us enough to drop Pizzagate action. I think it embolden us even more to take them out from behind the curtain.

              Hillary seems to thrive on it.  (okay she has some brainwashed fans, but most of her supporters have to know how corrupt she really is, just like 'everyone knew about it' Harvey associates looked the other way).

             Agree, Harvey Whinebagger should be spending time contemplating prison.  Narcissists are incapable of believing that they are to blame (for anything).

             These people think they are smarter and even more qualified than the professionals in their cases. It comes with being able to boss and bully people all day and get away with it. They dont take reality well or realize that they are in fact no longer the top man on the totum pole anymore. I mean when you hold a position of power or deal with minors you are in a position to be in charge. They dont take losing that power well and arent in these places to get any serious recovery...The bottom isnt low enough YET as they say in 12 step programs.
