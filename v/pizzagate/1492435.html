            Well, to be honest, I don't think skepticism is negative. I'm still skeptical about whether the ultimate conclusions of pizzagate are true or not, but feel free to peruse my comments and see if you think I'm anything less than completely open-minded that it
            <em>
             might
            </em>
            be true and that
            <em>
             something
            </em>
            is going that
            <em>
             seems
            </em>
            to be connected to both occultism and pedophilia. In reality, I think everyone who is actually investigating this
            <em>
             should
            </em>
            be skeptical, even if they have to force themselves to be, because it will help fend off confirmation bias. I'm just an observer to this investigation, but my skepticism helps me to focus on the things that, taken together, really do seem damning, while ignoring most of the other stuff that seems like a major reach bordering on paranoia.

            That said, I was a little surprised by Crowder's take on the issue. He essentially dismissed it but didn't even claim to have looked into it, which seems pretty odd to me given my impression of him. He has said in the past that he's not a conspiracy theory guy, but I'm not really one either, per se (though there's some subtlety in my position on conspiracy theories). Still, pizzagate is not your run of the mill conspiracy theory, but merely the suspicion, based on a mountain of circumstantial evidence, that something is happening in the U.S. that has already happened in plenty of other places around the world, along with the claim that all this stuff warrants a
            <em>
             legitimate
            </em>
            investigation by people who have the tools and authority to probe it fully.

            Stefan Molyneux is one of the worst because of the subtleties. He's pure socialist. He pushes nothing but Fabian socialism all packaged up with liberal wrapping and a marxist bow. His mother's a Bolshevik...

            I think some of the "silents" may be backing off due to an ongoing investigation that may relate to material found on Weiner's laptop. They may be getting "waved off" so to speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            Milo Yiannopoulos, during his appearance at Miami University on December 5th, said about Pizzagate, "I got a number of phone calls, with Washington area codes, saying, 'Not Yet.'"

             “They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,” he said.

             So NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn’t,” Prince contended.

             “There is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they’ve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,” he stated.

            The short answer is that the sheer numbers of "guilty enough to go to jail" is just so very very high. The long answer is that serious investigative sites, such as VOAT, have a tremendous work load ahead of us. Emotionally everyone wants justice as soon as we wake up to the reality of it. But realistically the wheels of justice are slow.
Just keep turning that grindstone, because victory is not just certain . . . it is INEVITABLE.

            Look at David Seaman. They deleted his WIkipedia page. A mistake? A shot across his bow? He protested, it came back... but when he didn't stop, it was deleted again. That seems like a threat to me: "You can be disappeared." I don't know if David has family / kids, but threats are scary, especially when they seem to come from people above the law.

            my guess is that there will be a war. Obama will start a war rather than let pizzagate surface. If it fades away, trump may be able to get in office. but there is a holding pattern in effect. We will have to simmer here for 40 days in uncertainty.
