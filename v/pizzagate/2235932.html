             Fifty years? You are either very bad at your job, or just not that smart (Im guessing MSM) but he verifiably tried to turn them in a long time ago, there is even a police report, yet they didn't care then either, so what you are saying is the epitome of stupid. If you doubt it, it would take about 10 seconds to verify online, but God forbid you actually try to inform yourself. Why don't you actually look into the back story before you jump online spewing moronic shit.

              Maybe you need to think outside the box. Reporting something that you know will never be investigated by those whose job is to cover it up is hardly evidence that Feldman is fighting them. They allow him to say all he wants on TV for what reason? He has said not a word about Satanic ritualistic abuse.

              No, he didn't. He never named names or did any of that. That's why nothing was followed up on.
             </p>
             <p>
              And he stood up for Michael Jackson and called out Robson as a liar. Come on!

              Hope you didn't give any money. I'm trying to warn you.

               That is categorically untrue, and somehow I think you know that. It was even covered on some larger outlets, not that that makes it true. But there is a police report. Feel free to look it up. And he did did do exactly what you are saying he didn't. Here is one account I was reading the other day, but again, feel free to do your own work. And in the meantime, stop misinforming people. But again, somehow I think that's intentional. And by the way, I am not advocating for Corey, or his absurdly high costing movie. Only that what you are saying is verifiable false.

               </p>
               <p>
                Read his Trump tweets. Take a minute and think about Michael Jackson. Think about when Feldman had the chance to speak on national TV (Dr. Oz's show), and threw out chum nothing burgers and thought the public would bite? Really?
               </p>
               <p>
                The only thing stopping me from getting angry about any of this is you sound like. I defended that shill until blood came out of my ears. The two things that did it were seeing those tweets and watching a video of "Corey's Angels." Feldman is a sick perverted deviant that is in hell. No, he's not "going" to hell, he's there!
               </p>
               <p>
                There's no doubt he sold out his friend Corey Haim, and his going to the police was probably meant to stop Haim from doing so. He was Haim's handler. There's always a Judas and Feldman was Haim's. Feldman wasn't an A-lister, but Haim attracted the attention of the A-list pedos. Feldman knew that and devised a way to keep him near by being a fucking betrayer/rat. That's why he went to the cops, but he never told them anything. But by doing that, he was able to tell Haim, "You see? They didn't do anything!  I told you they wouldn't listen! And I don't want you to set yourself up to be harmed!" Yup, played the hero and protector right up until Haim ended his life.

                 Well, I truly appreciate your genuine response. Actually makes me more open to your perspective. I do see your point, but supplying a MSM link does you no good. I think at this point, I will take your thoughts into consideration and be cautious what I believe. But I still feel much of it is conjecture and opinion. I will wait for something concrete, but thank you for pulling back, after my clearly heated response. You are a bigger man! lol. But seriously, I am open to it now. I will certainly come back here should any news break. Stay Vigilant.

            Well most of us are not surprised, for we called it when he first predicted it.  Sure that they may have had an agreement ahead of time.  If he is donating to Clinton and denies Pizzagate exists then I am sure they would not let him get away with outing anyone REALLY BIG.

            "Feldman responded to the news of the investigation getting shut down on Twitter, saying, “MAYBE NOW U WILL #BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY I NEED 2 DO IT MY WAY: LAPD Not Investigating Corey Feldman’s Abuse Claims.”
           </p>
           <p>
            I am really very sorry that you were taken advantage of 25 years ago Corey, it really is a horrible thing that happened to you, but, unfortunately, this statute of limitations thing is an ominous sign of your own inaction and complacency.
            <strong>
             You dragged your feet sucking on the teet.
            </strong>
            Of course, you and a huge number of your peers in Hollywood, with the stealthy magic wand of plausible deniability of 'fear of reprisal of health, home and career", have carelessly let the gears of Hollywood grind down thousands more children so that YOU could preserve your face in perpetuity.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't want to see and certainly much less would never pay for a movie about your life, Corey Feldman. If its anything like the train wreck your band was than most certainly not ever. See, you are worse than the classic Hollywood narcissist, you think you're relevant AS A STAR. But you're NOT. You're a HAS BEEN. BUT, you are relevant AS A HUMAN, and we should all care about that, BUT WHEN YOU SOLICIT MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT  WE ALL KNOW SHOULD COME FROM A PLACE THAT REQUIRES NO MONEY. Point is, sure, you can't name names because it wasn't YOU that was raped, but you know who did, WHAT THE HELL IS TEN MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO DO IF YOU'RE FACED WITH THE SAME SITUATION AT FILMING?
           </p>
           <p>
            Bro, your ROLE is over, you don't have the goods and what goods you do have arent yours to capitalize off of...
           </p>

            DO US ALL A FAVOR, LEAK IT ANONYMOUSLY, LIKE THE ALLEGED ROBERT DJ THREADS. Or better yet, spill it all in some emails and have WikiLeaks drop a staged hack.

             you are clueless! he DID report this to the LAPD (utterly corrupt) before the statute of limitations, as he mentions in the article (that you didn't read), and they TURNED OFF THE RECORDER during his statement &amp; never pursued the matter further.

              ...sure, sure. I believe Corey. Its just that I wonder why he never told US they 'turned off the recorder' until Oz had to DIG it out of him. Its bullshit that's why, he was too busy dreaming up his own little misogynists fantasy cult mishmash of the wonderland ranch and the playboy mansion.

               well that's speculation. i just don't know - i'm not like some uber corey feldman fan who knows a lot about him. i think i'm trying to hold onto it as a thread of hope. i do feel like i get where he's coming from because i am also a target of these people, and their savagery and evil knows no bounds. i don't think most people can grasp that, unless you've been through it like i have.

             You are uninformed moron, who is shaming an abused individual. Everyone now knows, thanks to the REAL media, that he tried a long time back (its on record and has been covered many times, feel free to look it up, God forbid you do your due diligence) when the crime was still within the statute of limitations, yet they didn't care then either. You are pathetic.

             Asolo that is disappointing coming from someone who makes as many bad ass posts as you do. I don't understand who it serves, other than the perps, to mangle the already mangled victims that try to speak with whatever little bit of soul they have left.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is exactly what Harvey Weinstein and Company hope happens to victims that try to speak.

             There seems to be some here who think that a person living in hell should follow some sort of scientific method for getting out of hell and reporting this stuff. There is not blueprint for that because few escape, and for those who escape, nobody is hardly ever prosecuted for the crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a reason for that too. Its the same reason people in our government won't squeal. Peoples families get threatened, etc...you know the drill.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please be judicious and discerning when meading out punishment like this. Corey is fucked up, we know that, he has to be though, he has no choice.

            'LAPD officials told Page Six on Thursday that they would not be launching a full-scale investigation into the allegations because the statute of limitations has passed.'
           </p>
           <p>
            “The alleged accordance is out of statue and Robbery/Homicide have no avenues to pursue the case. However, the LAPD applauds Mr. Feldman for coming forward, as an out of statute assault report could potentially bolster any current and forthcoming case as it creates a pattern of behavior. The latest rash of sexual assault reports are particularly troubling and the LAPD encourages and will gladly take a report from anyone who feels they may be a victim,” an LAPD spokesperson said in a statement.'
           </p>
           <p>
            'It took the department just a few days to decide that they were not interested in pursuing the case, despite the fact that new sex crimes have been popping up in Hollywood on a daily basis after producer Harvey Weinstein was outed in October.'
           </p>
           <p>
            'Many critics and skeptics of Feldman’s claims have suggested that he is just doing this for money or publicity and that he should have gone to the police to make a formal complaint. However, the quick disregard that this case was given by the LAPD shows that the laws in California are set up in such a way as to make investigating older claims of abuse nearly impossible.'

             Read somewhere that California has no limitations.  So, maybe that is why there is such a big coverup?  No slap on the wrist for a child in Cali?  That is why Polanski skeedaddled.  If only there could be one big name at a young age to name a Biggie it wood hit the Airwaves Big Time.

              I'm a bit confused now - how can they then argue they won't investigate due to the statute of limitation?
             </p>
             <p>
              Original article was a bit longer than citations above - said something like the st. of l. would be six years for 'normal sexual assaults'.
             </p>
             <p>
              This would mean assaults on adults?

               Creative Wording, imo.  What does that mean, Normal? I would want to read the fine print.  Who knows what is applied in Hollywood. That is certainly an choice of words.
