            Do you think the guy who originally posted this video to youtube (he earlier in a council meeting said if comet ping pong was open after midnight it would 'contribute to rape and murder) actually posted it PRETENDING he was concerned about impeding foot traffic and safety regulations, but actually just wanted to document the screams?

            I don't mind revisiting this video.  There is nothing definitive here - the guy could be turning because it is weird to see people playing ping pong on a public sidewalk blocking a front door access area.  Or he could indeed be turning because something seems "off" including sounds coming from the pizza place.  So this brings me to my comment on the video - why put these guys out front?  maybe to attract attention, though they certainly don't seem interested in doing PR or getting anyone inside the restaurant.  On the contrary, it looks to me like they might be guarding the front door.  No one exits or enters during the video, despite the fact that the street is clearly parked up, cars are going by and the buses are running..  These guys could be the "heads up" people there to block the entrance to the general public while whatever thing is making children scream takes place, and also they could delay any unwelcome guests and sound an alarm to "clean up and look right" to any people inside conducting questionable activities.

            Apparently Comet Pizza was told not to have people on the sidewalk playing a game in which a ball could cause a distraction to drivers and danger to players since they are adjacent to traffic, and also are blocking a public walkway.  CP fought in city council over it - why so committed to this weird placement CP, when you have plenty of space inside for ping pong tables?  Why was it important enough to spend time fighting normal restrictions that all business routinely follow regarding sidewalks?
