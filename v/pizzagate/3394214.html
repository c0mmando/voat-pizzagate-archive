<p>In two cases, Epstein boasted about donations he never made, a major university said. In a July 2014 press release, Epstein claimed he provided “critical funding” for scientists at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to restore five Mark Rothko murals, and in a September 2014 press release, he said he gave money to the MIT Media Lab to teach toddlers computer programming.</p>
<p>The Rothko press release “was simply not correct, and was issued without our knowledge or agreement,” and the toddler press release was also “completely incorrect,” said MIT Media Lab spokeswoman Alexandra Kahn in an email.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Rothko himself refused to adhere to any art movement, he is generally identified as an abstract expressionist.</p>
<p>..In 1936, Rothko began writing a book, never completed, about similarities in the art of children and the work of modern painters.[26] According to Rothko, the work of modernists, influenced by primitive art, could be compared to that of children in that &quot;child art transforms itself into primitivism, which is only the child producing a mimicry of himself.&quot;[27] In this manuscript, he observed: &quot;Tradition of starting with drawing in academic notion We may start with color.&quot;[28] Rothko was using fields of color in his aquarelles and city scenes. His style was already evolving in the direction of his renowned later works. Despite this newfound exploration of color, Rothko turned his attention to other formal and stylistic innovations, inaugurating a period of surrealist paintings influenced by mythological fables and symbols....</p>
<h1 id="md-seagram-muralsfour-seasons-restaurant-commission">Seagram Murals–Four Seasons restaurant commission</h1>
<p>For Rothko, this commission presented a new challenge, since it was the first time he was required not only to design a coordinated series of paintings, but to produce an artwork space concept for a large, specific interior. Over the following three months, Rothko completed forty paintings, comprising three full series in dark red and brown. He altered his horizontal format to vertical, to complement the restaurant\'s vertical features: columns, walls, doors and windows.</p>
<p>The following June, Rothko and his family again traveled to Europe. While on the SS Independence he disclosed to journalist John Fischer, who was publisher of Harper\'s Magazine, that <strong>his true intention for the Seagram murals was to paint &quot;something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room&quot;. He hoped, he told Fischer, that his painting would make the restaurant\'s patrons &quot;feel that they are trapped in a room where all the doors and windows are bricked up, so that all they can do is butt their heads forever against the wall&quot;</strong></p>
<p>While in Europe, the Rothkos traveled to Rome, Florence, Venice and Pompeii. In Florence, he visited Michelangelo\'s Laurentian Library, to see first-hand the library\'s vestibule, from which he drew further inspiration for the murals.[71] He remarked that &quot;the room had exactly the feeling that I wanted ... it gives the visitor the feeling of being caught in a room with the doors and windows walled-in shut.&quot; <strong>He was further influenced by the somber colors of the murals in the Pompeiian Villa of the Mysteries.</strong>[72] Following the trip to Italy, the Rothkos voyaged to Paris, Brussels, Antwerp and Amsterdam, before returning to the United States.</p>

<p>The Villa of the Mysteries (Italian: Villa dei Misteri) is a well-preserved suburban ancient Roman villa on the outskirts of Pompeii, southern Italy, famous for the series of exquisite frescos in one room, which are usually thought to show the initiation of a young woman into a Greco-Roman mystery cult. </p>
<p>..The Villa is named for the paintings in one room of the residence. This space may have been a triclinium, and is decorated with very fine frescoes, believed to be painted in the early-middle 1st century.[3] Although the actual subject of the frescoes is hotly debated, the most common interpretation of the images is scenes of the initiation of a woman into <strong>a special cult of Bacchus, a mystery cult</strong>[4] that required specific rites and rituals to become a member. One of the defining features that help identify this as a Bacchian-related mural is the depiction of maenads, the female followers of Bacchus. </p>

            I had been trying to find the full article of Epstein funding that kids game for weeks now. Thank you!!

           <p>
            I cant believe MIT let a convicted pedophile fund a childrens game. I dont care how desperate the school is for money, that is just unacceptable.

            Cannibals everywhere. Some, like Zombies, eating brains. Also in today's DM, "Prince Andrew ‘was seen in paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s New York apartment getting a foot massage from a young Russian woman called Irina’, top literary agent claims." Elsewhere, "So [Simpsons TV show creator] Matt Groening got a massage from a kid [who claimed she almost barfed 'cause his feet were all crusty and nasty] on Epstein's Lolita Express. BAD HOMBRE." Now we have Jeffrey, Andy and Matt all into foot massages from young teen girls. Is Dan Schneider from Nickelodeon also on Epstein's flight log?

            Here's a clue as to what Epstein and his high and mighty friends were up to: "Newsweek: Time to Rethink Taboo on Cannibalism?" Is this timely story intended to prepare the peasantry for what is about to be revealed. Just as the numerous recent articles about Deep Fake videos are intended to prepare us and bring doubt upon videos that may emerge of elites engaging in horrific deeds with children?
