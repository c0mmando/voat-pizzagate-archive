<p>Brock Pierce is a controversial figure who has received surprisingly little attention despite connections to the Clinton Foundation, digital currency Bitcoin and involvement in a notorious scandal involving a child abuse ring.</p>
<p>Brock was a member of the <a href="http://archive.is/8u6Js">Clinton Global Initiative</a>, former <a href="http://archive.is/o355g">child actor</a> who appeared in films such as the 1992 classic Mighty Ducks and Disney’s “First Kid,” and <a href="http://archive.is/unQKX">Chairman of the Board at the Bitcoin Foundation</a>. Pierce also co-founded the Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), a forerunner of video sharing site Youtube.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/j3R80">DEN</a> was founded in 1996 amid the rapid growth of the dot-com bubble. It raised $72 million in investment before even opening in 1999, a massive amount of capital considering that, at least on the surface, DEN was not yet providing investors with anything in return. At the time <a href="http://archive.is/XRsbe">news sources scoffed</a> at the massive salaries top executives were paid when the company was not even creating revenue. An SEC filing obtained by Hollywood periodical <a href="http://radaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/deninvestorlist-wmbbb.pdf">Radar Online</a> reveals that DEN\'s investors included a shocking number of big name personalities such as media executives Garth Ancier and David Geffen, former Yahoo CEO Terry Semel, film producers Gary Goddard and Bryan Singer, Wall Street czar Mitchell Blutt, A&amp;M Records head Gilbert Friesen (now deceased), former Disney executive David Neuman, manager and label executive Gary Gersh, investor Jeffrey Sachs, former Congressman Michael Huffington, actors Ben and Fred Savage, and tech companies such as Microsoft and Dell. The lack of apparent revenue raises questions about what investors in DEN were expecting in return.</p>
<p>In 2000, DEN suffered an absolute disaster amid <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/michael-egan-bryan-singer-lawsuit.html">claims</a> by employees and several Hollywood child actors such as <a href="http://archive.is/cnlXt">Michael Egan III</a> that Pierce and his partners, Chad Shackley and Marc Collins-Rector ran a child abuse ring with a number of other Hollywood directors and A-list actors, many of whom were financially tied to DEN. Egan <a href="http://archive.is/054PY">alleged</a> that between the ages of 15 to 17, he would be given alcohol, cocaine and other drugs and was raped repeatedly along with other young boys who were present. The abuse allegedly occurred at the house shared by Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce as well as on trips to Hawaii. On at least one occasion, Collins-Rector threatened Egan with a gun to force him into compliance. Egan filed a civil suit after his reports to the LAPD and FBI fell on deaf ears. Individuals named in the suit <a href="https://archive.fo/NmO0S">included</a> Pierce, Collins-Rector, Shackley, as well as Bryan Singer, Garth Ancier, Gary Goddard and David Neuman.</p>
<p>Mr. Egan\'s allegations mirror other similar claims made by actors such as <a href="http://archive.is/f255h">Corey Feldman</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/sQt3P">Elijah Wood</a> that child sex abuse is rampant in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Pierce and his co-accused resigned from DEN and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1200664-mike-laurie-deposition.html#document/p9/a164000">fled hurriedly to Spain</a> to escape the FBI. Collins Rector was apparently <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1200668-brock-pierce-deposition-faswag.html#document/p17/a163233">primarily concerned</a> that investor David Geffen wished to kill him over the scandal. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1200668-brock-pierce-deposition-faswag.html#document/p11/a164022">Depositions</a> taken from Pierce revealed that Geffen had purportedly been paying an employee to spy on DEN, and that he had been <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1200668-brock-pierce-deposition-faswag.html#document/p6/a164019">fed information and stolen faxes</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <a href="https://archive.is/qSAdg">Collins-Rector</a> was the only individual charged with sex offenses in relation to the scandal. Brock Pierce was never able fully escape negative public opinion over the role he played however. When he became the Chairman of the Board at the Bitcoin Foundation, at least 10 members <a href="http://archive.is/eTsHN">resigned</a> in protest. Several <a href="http://archive.is/AlF8p">resignation letters</a> explicitly listed Pierce\'s association to pedophilia and child pornography as the reason for their departure.</p>
<p>Pierce is one of several public figures dogged by allegations of child sex abuse with financial or social ties to the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>Why is this old case relevant? You\'ll find out tomorrow. There is a reason that the media does not want to acknowledge Pizzagate.</p>',

            there's a documentary about this on youtube. forget what it's called but it starts off with different strokes i think? then goes on to families who wanted their children to follow their dreams etc, and i'm pretty sure Brock Pierce was a victim himself. He started out as a child actor as well and the whole ebay photos scandal shit wasn't he or Chad the most bought picture? they had their own image without their knowledge being sold to pedophiles. I'm not saying it justifies anything but just pointing out that he was abused and I'm guessing he learned to cope by just seeing it as the price fame and fortune costs.

            I think this path needs to be re-explored....

           <p>
            The actual catalogue was posted to reddit at the time.... it was weird. I cant recall enough to be able to find it though. But it was a really long thread.

            But i think you're correcting me, rightly so, as I think what you are linking to and I was referring to are the same thing....

           <p>
            I mistakenly thought it was CS, but now I believe it was RDJ

            &lt;--- this has some good info on Pierce
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you OP for this thread, Pierce has been on my list of people that need to be looked into (along with the Emanuel brothers - especially Ari).
           </p>
           <p>
            Bitcoin has always been interesting to me too... I know it is used as currency on the dark web because it can't be traced.  So the sicko's can pay for all the child porn, etc and not be traced.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like everything these people do on the outside (CF, CGI, CPP, Bitcoin, etc) is all just a cover that seems on the up &amp; up, but is really used for evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is bitcoin how they are paid to move children around?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was Julian Assange trying to post his death switch in the bitcoin block chain to tip us off?  We need to follow the money.  Can we somehow trace CF/CGI through the bitcoin block chain??  Is it possible?

            "Bitcoin forum tried to take him down in 2014; he wriggled away
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are all the investigation threads. Tons of info in here:

            They never pinned him down 100% but Brock was:
- a member of the CGI
- business partners with a weirdo who made the viral "Yes We Can" celebrity video for Obama's 2008 campaign
- currently on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation
- still in contact with big league pedo Marc Collins-Rector even though he says he's not (see bitcointalk threads) 
-based on his alternate fb account, he's heavily into Satanism and the dark occult
-he goes to Burning Man every year, hangs out with big name tech execs
-one of his close friends and fellow Burners, Autumn Radtke (young tech exec), died under mysterious circumstances in Singapore 2014. Brock's business partner was visiting Singapore at the time of her "suicide". Lots of weird shit there. They were involved in some kind of virtual currency exchange startup.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other associates in LA: Ken Rutkowski, Michael Quigley, Gary Goddard
           </p>
           <p>
            The leading theory is that Brock Pierce and Rector were arrested in Marbella in 2002 with a massive stash of child porn, and were flipped into being US government informants.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this were the case, Brock is a blackmailed government asset with a direct role in the management, PR, and lobbying efforts of bitcoin.
           </p>
           <p>
            He could be working for CIA/DIA/NSA/FBI/DEA
Nobody knows
Maybe we should find out :^) "

             the primary purpose of btc wasnt that pedos can pay others for their sick shit but that you have an decentralized bank free currency like your own, without control from an government or bank. even without bitcoin there are several ways for anonymous payments. do you really think that the elite pedos need bitcoin so that nobody would be able to trace their transactions? bullshit. they have a ton of possibilities and bank accounts that are invisible, or in the worst case they can just open regular banking accounts with palse identities and false passports. then you have prepaid credit cards loadable via ukash paysafe etc.

            DUDE -- Do you recall there was a post on reddit a couple years back that was talking about the "sex catalogue" of hollywood that had the effective bios of various actors which were available for sex-trafficking. Included in these were George Clooney and Hayden Panettiere -- and that there was a poster who was validating all this shit - and he was doxxed to a degree that the overwhelming conviction was that the doxx'd-revealer-of-info on Hayden Panettiere was
            <strong>
             <em>
              Charlie Sheen
             </em>
            </strong>
            (CS)
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically the ITT-experience was that CS was high on coke and spouting off to the internet and making claims that all the top actors/bodies in hollywood were for sale via this sex-catalogue and that many 'arabs' partook...
           </p>
           <p>
            And look what happened to CS -- he got neutrilized in a cloud of coke and hookers... and is silenced, effectively, now......

            Don't know where else to put this but since its about Hollyweird I shall put it here. Did you know Shia LaBeoufs father is a convicted pedophile who is currently on the run and has had his name and conviction wiped from the megans law database for no apparent reason?

            I watched a documentary about this the other day. The Collins-Rector guy has the creepiest face that ever there was. There were a few people who had been abused at DEN, and the film looked at how what had happened then had affected them into their adult lives - it was incredibly sad, one became an alcoholic and ended up going cold turkey, having a seizure and becoming severely brain damaged. Poor Mike Egan ended up with his lawyers withdrawing his lawsuit and writing grovelling apology letters to the accused pedophiles, it was reported everywhere that Singer et al had been vindicated and that Egan was just a con artist, and now Egan is in prison, convicted in December 2015 of fraud and sentenced to 2 years in prison. I guess all of that serves as a warning to anyone else who might have considered speaking out. The documentary I mentioned, I think it's called 'An Open Secret,' makes it clear that Egan wasn't lying - there were several victims that spoke out and various other people including victims' parents and people who work in the industry.

             YES! I just commented in this thread about this documentary, couldn't remember the name everyone go see it if you haven't already. What I was mentioning was how Brock Pierce was a victim as well, he never comes forward but you can understand why if you see the documentary and how far his boyish looks got him so I'm guessing he learned to stay quiet. Very sad.

            Yep, that was the guy. People need to check out Hollywood more because we aren't going to purge DC of this ring if we aren't also focusing on the people in the media who have an incentive to cover it up. Hit them from all angles.

             Well, I'm reporting on it, so hopefully more people will listen and get back on his case.

             Because he's blatantly a rapist and child molester, albeit one who seems to have been groomed himself. Not everything is black and white.

             It sickens me what these evil sickos do to innocent children. The trauma, suffering and memories never go away (speaking from experience).  I can't wait to see them all burn in hell.

                Yep. He had about ten different sites which have all been dead since January 2015. Everything but
                <a href="http://www.jeffreyepstein.org/">
                 http://www.jeffreyepstein.org/
                </a>
                and I've noticed that the Recipients tab has disappeared.
               </p>
               <p>
                Incidentally, I've been doing some digging on these defunct sites and you're not going to believe the shit that I've dug up. You know that Epstein was connected with a woman named Nadia Marcinkova, right? She's the personal sex slave of Epstein who along with Sarah Kellen was procuring young girls and also abusing them for Epstein's pleasure. Well fuck me, I found her Daddy! I found Papa! This guy sold Nadia to Epstein at 14 according to what I've read. Sold his own daughter to pedo Jeff! But wait, it gets worse - THE GUY IS STILL BUDDIES WITH EPSTEIN!!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT!!!!!!
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you want me to make a thread showing you how I found this out???

                     Individuals, like Epstein, are essentially "middle men"/fallguys, for older billionaires., Essentially working as a "laundering" hub, acquiring, attaining, or filing whatever, under their name. Doing experiments or funding black projects, through his bank accounts, on on his lands, or though his connections., Similar to how the Mafia conveyed orders through only one individual, so there would only be one guy to blame., But not the head guy(s). Epstein has tried to come off as an intellectual and philanthropist, which gave him "a blanket from scrutiny for a while"., But many figured his money management firm as the criminal enterprise that it is. IRS obviously couldn't prove otherwise --- or legally fight long enough. Feel free to check the archives for his former website(s),

                     Once you connect the dots, you can blatantly follow public evidence, showing these guys are the ultimate "mafia"., Constantly laundering, colluding, committing treason, market manipulation, etc. I mean, what other logical reason and qualifications, would Epstein have to "earn" him a chair on the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Rockefeller University Board., The Mind, Brain &amp; Behavior Advisory Committee at Harvard, etc. Let's not forget, this is a man that didn't even finish college., And has sourced the start of his wealth as assumed, "gifted".

             This is going to be very, very interesting.  It fits in with a theory I had about some of the new tech companies...I thought I was going crazy or being ridiculous ..then this...great stuff.

              All large tech companies also have govt contracts which means they not only spy on us, but that all of those employees sign NDA's. Even the janitors. So when nefarious things are going on, someone with a conscience thinks twice about becoming a whistleblower. Hopefully Trump demolishes the whistleblower restrictions BHO put in place.
On another similar note, I just heard James O'Keefe talking about how he has people placed within the MSM and places like FB and if there are bad things going on, it will be on tape. Oh happy day!

              If you want to look into tech groups and Hollywood, start looking at various movies that are being rebooted. A lot of times there is a reason they remake certain films.

               I should add for those that aren't making the leap. Mass control/thought influence can performed via television. DEN was a steaming media content provider. As this broadcast format was/is considered to be the new medium and replacement for terrestrial and cable/sat programming, heavy Attention was paid to its use in mind control. Also, the Internet isn't regulated like broadcast is. Something to think about.
