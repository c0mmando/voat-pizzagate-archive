<p><a href="https://youtu.be/q87ceocHZdA">Harvey Weinstein\'s HANDLERS/Zionist ILLUMINATi/Warner Music Group</a></p>
<p><strong>Leonid Blavatnik</strong> is worth 19 billion USD, making him the richest man in the <strong>UK</strong>.</p>
<p>He has been very charitable towards <strong>israel</strong>.</p>
<p>Leonid Valentinovich Blavatnik is a Ukranian-British-American-Jewish billionaire.</p>
<p>After the fall of communism he was able to buy up companies in Russia very cheaply.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group">Warner Music Group</a>, formerly owned by Time Warner was bought by <strong>Blavatnik</strong> in May 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Industries">Access Industries</a>, with the ubiquitous pyramid as it\'s logo.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Len Blavatnik?</strong> <a href="http://global-citizen.com/who-is-len-blavatnik/">http://global-citizen.com/who-is-len-blavatnik/</a></p>
<p><em>&quot;Len Blavatnik’s gilded reputation is everywhere, yet relatively little is known about the nature of the man behind it. In the early Noughties, the peripatetic mogul bought a Gatsby-esque home next to Kensington Palace and decided to make London his base while maintaining his US citizenship.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;</em><em>Blavatnik’s</em>* social life is varied. His close circle in London includes <strong>Sir Ronald Cohen</strong> and <strong>Jacob Rothschild</strong> . He also likes to throw his London and New York homes open to a wider circle of glamorous young people — actors and musicians, as well as writers such as Simon Sebag Montefiore and Andrew Roberts.&quot;*</p>
<p>But, it seems, he is much more than just a London Socialite and \'friend\' of the <strong>Rothschilds</strong>.</p>
<p>It is said that people like <strong>Blatnavik</strong>  and <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2017/05/06/billionaire-superyacht-showdown-whos-who-at-the-2017-cannes-film-festival/#406348d3354b">Abramovich</a></strong> are nothing more than <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/nov/2/20031102-111400-3720r/">FRONTS for other Jews like the Rothschilds</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Arrested oil tycoon passed shares to banker</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;LONDON (Agence France-Presse) — Control of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s shares in the Russian oil giant Yukos have passed to renowned banker Jacob Rothschild, under a deal they concluded prior to Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest, the Sunday Times reported.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Think of knights and you may think of <strong>Sir Jimmy Savile</strong>, <strong>Sir Leon Brittan</strong> or <strong>Sir Len Blavatnik</strong>.</p>
<p>Blavatnik has links to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colel_Chabad">Chabad-Lubavitch</a></p>
<p>The newly knighted <strong>Sir Len Blavatnik</strong> was a very close friend of the late <strong>\'Rothschild agent\' Sir George Weidenfield</strong></p>
<p>Weidenfeld worked as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann\'s</a> (first President of Israel) chief of cabinet. </p>
<p>Weidenfield was friends with Helmut Kohl, Angela Merkel, Prince Charles, George Osborne and Michael Gove.</p>
<p>Weidenfeld was in <strong>Bilderberg</strong>.</p>
<p>At the start of World War II, George Weidenfeld, an Austrian Jew, went to work for the <strong>BBC</strong>.</p>
<p>George Weidenfeld was a friend of Flora Solomon, the daughter of the Jewish Russian gold tycoon <strong>Grigori Benenson</strong>, related to the <strong>Rothschild family</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Flora Solomon</strong> was a long-time friend of the British intelligence officer <strong>Kim Philby</strong>, who was a close friend of <strong>Lord Victor Rothschild.</strong></p>
<p>Lolita is about a boy. <a href="http://aangirfan.blogspot.com/2008/04/nabokov-lolita-and-pale-fire.html">Nabokov, Lolita and Pale Fire</a></p>
<p>At one time Weidenfeld shared a flat with the gay <strong>Cyril Connolly</strong>.</p>
<p>George Weidenfeld and his gay friend Nigel Nicolson founded the publishers Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 1948.</p>
<p>George Weidenfeld published <strong>Lolita</strong>.</p>
<p>Hitler\'s former finance minister <strong>Hjalmar Schacht</strong> was one of Weidenfeld\'s authors.</p>
<p>Weidenfeld published the memoirs of U.S. president <strong>L.B. Johnson, Henry Kissinger</strong>.</p>
<p>Weidenfeld\'s parties in London were attended by such people as <strong>Henry Kissinger</strong>.</p>
<p>Weidenfeld was a regular guest of <strong>Pope John Paul II</strong>.</p>
<p>Weidenfeld was a friend of the spooky Isaiah Berlin of the <a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2015/08/cedric-belfrage-and-kosher-nostra.html">THE KOSHER NOSTRA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>However, there is MUCH MORE to the Harvey Weinstein, AmFAR Gala, Geffen Circle, Cannes than meets the eye...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Lohan comes under fire for DEFENDING Harvey Weinstein and criticising his wife for leaving him - but Rose McGowan tells supporters to \'go easy\' on \'twisted\' child star turned sex symbol</strong>

<p>I was wondering why <strong>LiLo</strong> would be speaking out for <strong>WeinStein</strong> so fervently, and I\'m sure everyone here can guess why.</p>',

            LOHAN been raped/abused her whole life. Whole family are trailer trash gangsters; not her fault.
           </p>
           <p>
            Abused since she was a kid doing commercials, then did the Freaky Friday film and Herbie etc.
           </p>

            I think she is very talented and intelligent. It is really very heartbreaking. Do you agree

             WE are ALL corrupted, dysfunctional and fallible in a society that conditions us from birth. We are all suffering from some form of ptsd from a lifetime of frankfurt model state education, biased and intentional propaganda from entertainment and government and a number of other conditioning tools that have made us all complete hypocrites.

             You are right, she is a victim and empathy should be employed, however, she is choosing to stay on the wrong team, and they shall be judged by their fruits. Miss Lohan will soon someday learn, that she was used and extorted and turned into a propaganda tool to desensitize portions of the population to the possibilities of pedophilia that in turn prompted waves of sex crimes around the world that most likely have still left it's mark to this day. Sticking with Weinstein makes it embarrassingly obvious how messed up she really is.

              She is not capable of using rational thought. You are talking about her like she's a normal person.
             </p>
             <p>
              She is on a permanent cocktail of legal and illegal drugs and been subjected to god knows what since she was a young girl. She has never known a normal life. From the knowledge you display in your posts, you should know better than the average person, how the celebrity world works and how they are blackmailed/handled and that everything is deliberate, forced and calculated.

            Well,  wow,  I'll tell you creating this thread was like taking a shit with glass shards in it.  For some reason Voat is being VERY particular about proxies,  understandable in this ddos environment...  But even with a proxy off it took TWO MORE TRIES to create this thread after a horrible deletion caused by an automatic refresh from voats ddos protection.  So please,  if anyone is working on a long template piece be sure to save the body periodically so you don't lose it.  That or something or somebody doesn't want threads like these being posted.
           </p>
           <p>
            God speed and God bless y'all.

            Lindsey Logan is a mess.  I feel sorry for her, and have a feeling she is being controlled big time.  Also I have always felt that the death of Amy Wheinhouse was NOT due to a drug overdose.  Kind of strange, like that of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.  Just like that.  Gone.

              We have to notice how quickly the family or parents come out to make a statement and it always accepts the verdict of suicide or overdose.  Always amazing to me.  They know there is no use.
