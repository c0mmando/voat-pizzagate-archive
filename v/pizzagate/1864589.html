<h1>The main charge</h1>
<p>Marc Dutroux was charged of <strong>abducting, raping and killing four girls</strong>. He was arrested in 1996 in a case which rocked the nation (Belgium). Two of the children who he abducted <strong>starved to death in makeshift dungeons under his house.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I kept Julie and Melissa captive at my place, so I\'m not innocent. I kept An and Eefje captive at my place, so I\'m not innocent. I\'m absolutely guilty,&quot; Dutroux said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he has always maintained that he did not murder the girls. He accuses his second wife, Michelle Martin, of failing to feed Julie and Melissa. </p>
<h1>The evidence</h1>
<p>The extensive investigation into the girls\' deaths included forensic tests on <strong>some 6,000 hair samples</strong> taken from Dutroux\'s basement to try and establish whether the girls had any other visitors.&quot; </p>
<h1>The ring</h1>
<p>Dutroux admitted he had been part of a wider pedophile network but said the justice system did not want to pursue it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is a well-grounded pedophile ring,&quot; he said. &quot;I maintained regular contact with people in this ring. However, the law does not want to investigate this lead.&quot; </p>

<h1>2016: New victim story - She revealed it\'s an elite pedophile ring</h1>
<p><em>NSFW: not recommending for sensitive readers. Related parts quoted, the story in full <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/anneke-lucass-harrowing-tale-of-sex-trafficking-am/">here</a></em></p>
<h2>My Name Is Anneke Lucas and I Was a Sex Slave to Europe\'s Elite at Age 6**</h2>
<p>My mother sold me, and drove me wherever, whenever she got the call. The boss of this pedophile network was a <strong>Belgian cabinet minister</strong>. The clients were <strong>members of the elite</strong>. I recognized people from television. Their faces were familiar to the masses, while I was confronted with the dark side of their power addiction — the side no one would believe existed. I came across <strong>VIP\'s, European heads of state, and even a member of a royal family.</strong></p>
<p>Around my <strong>sixth birthday</strong>, in 1969, I was taken to an orgy for the first time, in <strong>a castle</strong>. I was used for an S&amp;M show, on a low stage, chained up with an iron dog collar, and <strong>made to eat human feces</strong>. </p>
<p>After four years of surviving the network, <strong>when I was 10</strong>, a new guest brought along his 20-year-old son: tall, dashing, blond, and blue-eyed. He boldly advanced toward me. I smiled, and he called me a little whore.</p>
<p><strong>A year later</strong>, when he was through with me, I was of no use to the network anymore, and was to be killed. When my torture began, he stood watching, laughing.</p>
<p>I was led away to a small room, and strapped onto a butcher\'s block. The man who tortured me <strong>was one of the defendants in the notorious Dutroux case</strong>, which, when it broke the news in 1996, was believed it would <strong>blow up the Belgian pedophile network</strong>. But instead, eight years later, <strong>only Marc Dutroux received a life sentence.</strong> I should have died that night in 1974 on that butcher\'s block, but my life was saved at the last minute.</p>
<p>While I had been tortured, the young man had been negotiating with <strong>the politician in charge of the network</strong>. They made a deal: he would work for the politician, <strong>extend his shady services</strong> in exchange for my life. This one good deed eventually cost him his own life. In this milieu, any shred of humanity is a deadly weakness.</p>
<h1>The sentence</h1>
<p><strong>Marc Dutroux, 47, faces a life sentence for the abduction, abuse and deaths of four girls</strong>, two of whom were apparently drugged, wrapped in plastic and buried alive. The other two died of starvation in an underground chamber where he left them while serving a three-month sentence for car theft.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Dutroux was also found guilty of kidnapping and raping two girls who survived</strong>. Their testimony and their return with the jury to the dungeon where they had been held provided the most dramatic moments of the trial.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mr. Dutroux\'s <strong>former wife, Michelle Martin, was convicted of imprisoning the abducted girls and of rape. She faces as many as 35 years in prison</strong>. Also convicted of kidnapping was <strong>Michel Lelièvre, 33, whom prosecutors described as Mr. Dutroux\'s \'\'faithful companion.\'\' He also could be sentenced to 35 years.</strong></p>
<h1>The non-sentence</h1>
<p>The man who Mr. Dutroux said led that ring, <strong>Michel Nihoul</strong>, was acquitted Thursday of all charges of complicity in the abductions. (He was found guilty of dealing drugs, peddling false documents and trading in stolen vehicles. Mr. Nihoul faces up to 20 years in prison.)</p>
<h1>Current situation</h1>
<p>While only 2 persons were convicted of child rape etc., and 1 more person on kidnapping, <strong>the elite (mentioned by the victim above) is still walking free</strong></p>

            sixth birthday

            , I am flairing this "New Evidence" although I agree with you that the timing of the latest revelations, and the organization that published it, do raise questions about whether this is intended to distract us from US rings with Euro trafficking.

             No I hadn't, thanks, but now I checked it through with keywords "raped" and "royal" (separately). There's info, all right. I did wonder why there's no mention about any hair samples.

             Interestingly, 4. point in the notes claims that by 2010 there was only one victim who went public:

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              On the internet you can find several prominent skeptical articles about the only witness who ever went public: X1. It's obvious that these articles still have a huge capacity to seed doubt. Just know that all of the claims they make have been based on manipulations, as this article will show.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Is this new victim, who went public on Dec 2016 really the 2nd ever?

Classmate who X1 said should have seen some of the abuse in Knokke and Gent. Marleen didn't confirm the abuse in Knokke, but did state that "there were sexual contacts between X1, that Tony, the mother of X1 and the housekeeper." [120]

Housekeeper of X1's mother in the 1980s who apparently didn't do a very good job, as the home of X1 has generally been described as dirty and messy. Pregnant for the first time when she was 18 years old and ended up with 4 children from 3 different men. She was in therapy for a while.
Unaware that a camera was taping her confrontation with X1, Verniers accidentally confirmed during a break that Tony, the mother and X1 all had a sexual relationships with each other. She also stated that she didn't believe that X1 was lying. After X1 pushed a little bit, Verniers also confirmed that she suddenly left the house after there were indications that her 18 months old child had been abused. When investigators tried to interview the by then 16 year old daughter, the confrontations ended in panic attacks and denial. No follow-up investigation was carried out. In March 1997, investigators found out that Verniers had a lot of phone conversations with Marleen van Herreweghe. On one day Verniers received 38 telephone calls from acquaintances who also contacted Marleen that same day. The investigators suspected that an effort was made to get the stories of these two women straight. [121]

"Odette" was a mistress of Tony V. in the 1980s. She confirmed that Tony often visited the mother of X1 and that she assumed that Tony had an affair with her. Odette: "I myself was kind of hungry for sex and like Tony there was no one better in bed... He tried to get to know everything about you... He liked to give people the feeling that he could blackmail them... I don't know what to think about the whole X1-affair and I find it hard to believe that Tony had something to do with those child murders. But still. When I read the book of X1, I cannot deny that everything she wrote about Tony is accurate, down to the smallest details. That was a shock to me." [122]

At least two of the locations in Knokke where X2 claimed to have been abused were also pointed out by X1. Another street designated by X2 faced the hotel of X1's grandmother. [123] Additionally, some of the abusers mentioned by X2 turned out to be the same as those mentioned by X1, like Vanden Boeynants, Baron de Bonvoisin and the Lippens brothers. There appears to be some confusion whether or not X1 recognized X2 from a picture. [124]

X4's parents lived nextdoor to one of the locations where X1 said she and Carine Dellaert had been abused.

X1 identified Nathalie W. as a victim of the network [129] and apparently situated her at the sexclub Les Atrebates in the early 1980s. [130] X1 also recognized her father. [131] Nathalie W., on the other hand, correctly identified the pimp of X1 as "Anthony" and as a friend of Nihoul (whom she also knew). [132] Apparently, both X1 and Nathalie W. independently referred to Nihoul as "Mich". [133] Additionally, X4 identified Nathalie W. while Nathalie W. identified the mother and a sister of X4 by name.

Confirmed the abuse of X1 at her grandmother's hotel-villa in Knokke. She remembered only one name, "Monsieur", which turned out to be correct, judging from X1's testimony. Like X7, Chantal gave many details which could be found in the testimonies of others, for example that she was forbidden to cry during the abuse or that she was not allowed to go to the first floor. [134] X4 recognized Chantal S. as a victim of the network.

              .	Parents of a classmate:	
In 1979, X1 mentioned to a classmate the abuse that was going on at her grandmother's hotel-villa. After this girl told her parents, X1 was invited over to retell her story. Knowing that X1 could never know all these details without having experienced them, the parents informed the principal of the school her daughter and X1 went to. X1 went to the principal, a nun, to repeat the story and showed the bruises in her neck. The nun told X1 that she was "a fantasizer" and called up her grandmother. Besides being heavily punished, X1 was sent back to her parents in Gent in an effort to stop the rumors that were going round the neighborhood by now. When X1 disappeared from school, the parents of X1's classmate assumed that she had been taken up in a child protection program. However, more than 10 years later they found out that this had not been the case. The girl, nor her parents were asked to testify about X1. [138]

            Equineluvr, what is wrong with you? This post required alot of time researching and prepping for publication as so many of Anonopenpress  posts do. I am not a researcher but I am a consumer of this material and just as I am avidly reading and digesting a thoughtful post, you come along and piss on it. I gathered that the sex slave story produced by Global Citizen was made possible due to the integrity the citizen board members brought to the company at that point in time...or is this the current board. At any rate, board members are innocent until some evidence comes  along to the contrary. And I think the readership here and the OP would agree that evidence to the contrary wouldn't surprise anybody. We have come to expect it. So if you have some damaging info,  it will be welcome. There's no need for the ad hominem attack.

            You might as well delete your whole list of names attached to "Global Citizen" along with your argument that it's reliable. You could keep the link of Global Citizen up along with BBC &amp; NYT. But don't  try to convince anyone on here that it's a 'credible source' bc 'look at all these globalist's names' bc they only have credibility with destroying nation's sovereignty &amp; are part of the problem bc they elevate the most corrupt people in the world (like HRC).
           </p>
           <p>
            BBC, I mean the main guy there was pedophile and everyone covered for him til he was dead. That shows what kind of people work there. I believe BBC has new owners now.
           </p>
           <p>
            NYT, always &amp; forever hard left, but doesn't mean this particular story they highlighted has much spin since it has the girl telling her story. If they put a left spin on her story, you would see at the end of the story "We have set up a go fund me page to raise money to help get pedophiles
            <em>
             out of jail
            </em>

             Good points. I find the list of names important, especially if this is the 2nd ever witness who went public with her own name. The date of publishing (Dec 19, 2016) is two weeks after the Ping Pong false flag which has been repeated by MSM ever since. (In unbelievable amount of articles, btw). They really tried hard to debunk pizzagate, but I did
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1838110">
              something
             </a>
             to debunk them back.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this new victim story, there's of course a possibility that someone is trying to save her/his skin or that someone is trying to move the focus back into Europe, publishing stuff like that in the middle of the pizzagate. I'd say those names are worth having along in our investigations in either case. I didn't find dirt on any name, even that I do not trust all organizations mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
             edit: There's also a possibility that this witness story is being used for some unknown purpose in the future.
