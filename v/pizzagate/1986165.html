<p>From the article:
&quot;“It was a short introductory meeting,” Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement. “I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.”&quot;</p>
<p>However, apparently the meeting was a set up by...Fusion GPS...
&quot;“We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,” Mark Corallo, spokesperson for Trump’s outside counsel, said in a statement released a few hours after the original New York Times story published.
“Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the president and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier,” Corallo continued, referring to the strategic intelligence firm hired by anti-Trump Republicans, then by Democrats, to do opposition research on the candidate.&quot;</p>
<p>This is an EXCEPTIONALLY good sign.  The outing of this meeting comes right after meeting with Russia.  Kushner is HIGHLY suspect in my mind and DJTJr made a GREAT judgement call by including Kushner.  Interesting that even though the meeting was a complete set up, they talked about kids...wonder how that was to work into the narrative?  No matter now as BLOWN THE F**K UP!</p>',

            Why do they care? I honestly don't understand. Off all the things to discuss or lobby or be concerned about why care about restarting an adoption program? It's such a strange choice of a "cause" to pursue. Does Trump Jr need to adopt a child from Russia? Does Kushner? If not, who cares about resuming the adoption program?Honestly, I am missing something about the big picture. Could someone cue me in?

            400lb hacker did it.

            We never met with any Russians.

           <p>
            OK, Russia did it.  Why didn't Obama do anything about it?

           <p>
            OK, maybe we met with Russians, but we never discussed policy.

            If there was collusion, that's not illegal.

            Ok, you have documents saying I met with Russians, well I did meet with Russians, but it was just over adoption and I never told my Dad.

            What?  The Russian we met with says we were colluding to lift sanctions imposed by the Magnistky Act?

            I would be careful about attributing a sinister motive to this.  Russian orphanages are notorious for being overwhelmed and understaffed, which can lead to an abusive environment.  There are images online of rooms full of infants which are rarely held and disabled children who have been confined to the same bed for years without being properly cared for.  Keep in mind that not everyone who adopts has ill intentions.

            Yeah, in fact, I bet both Putin AND Trump rose on the backs of wealthy Jewish criminals decades ago just to set them up for downfall in 2018!

            Hillary &amp; Co have no more credibility. It's all gone. This was a pathetic attempt to frame Trump and it failed like all the other attempts have failed.

            that pumping out these phony scandals with Russian Prostitutes and Golden Showers will just backfire on them.

            Robert Mueller's "evidence" for impeachment will be laughed out of Congress. Mark my words.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only smack down that's coming is for Robert Mueller &amp; Co. Mueller has gang raped the rules by hiring only lawyers with ties to Hillary &amp; Co. That partiality will not only invalidate whatever immunity he's given out it's also going to make a great case for Obstruction of Justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            So to all the lawyers involved in Robert Mueller's fishing expedition if the Navy Seals catch one of you hooking on a Yellow Fin Tuna to simulate a real catch then you get to walk the plank along with everyone else.
