                  You need to learn how to take constructive criticism and how to read the rules. Your immediate angry reaction makes you appear weak. You can’t even control your emotions, temper, or behavior. SAD!

                  Given your response, I almost feel like assuming you posted your stuff on purpose here, since you knew that it would get pulled, and could bitch about 'muh evil mods'. Or how come you've been here for four months, and still don't understand the rules? :-)

            , thanks for clearly explaining your logic re: how this is related to pizzagate, as well as editing to include the evidence this may be an orchestrated smear. I am giving it the "Accuracy in Question" flair as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you happen to know if Wohl has ever had anything to say about pizzagate or human trafficking? We try to keep track of who the disinfo pushers turn out to be, since there are many.

              He's arguing the Mueller investigation = the Cabal trying to stop DJT from exposing their pizzagate blackmail crime syndicate...falling under the "and/or the systematic cover up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities" portion of Rule 1...that's what I took from his first paragraph, anyway.

               So, literally anything about the Mueller investigation, or investigations against Trump, or about DS trying to stop Trump or Trump attacking DS fits?

              <p>
               Is it DIRECTLY when there's no direct link shown?  Is PG the only explanation for the events that occurred?  Is RM one of the PG-accused?  I'm not seeing any of this.

               If he's arguing it, I don't see any reference at all to PG-related stuff. Mueller was accused of rape of an adult, no?

                I wouldn't say the minutia of the investigation. I think in this case he was arguing there was a specific attempt to take down Mueller ("game changer") that falls directly under the same information warfare as Wikileaks and Seth Rich. "the Cabal trying to stop DJT

                True...he didn't spell it all out word for word. It seemed pretty obvious to me what he meant by witchhunt, but I read it after those six vampire posts with ten million shitty links, LOL. If I have to explain, he obviously didn't argue it well enough. I also felt it was worth leaving up due to whether David Wohl was another wolf in sheeps clothing pushing disinfo, which the post was also about.

             No, but Jack Burkman is hitting back hard. He's not giving ground on this and one would think he'd use the escape hatch (Wohl) if this was a smear. In other words say something like, "I only asked Wohl to put out feelers, but I never authorized him to pay anyone." Instead there was this:

              The allegations of paying a woman are false.  The left is trying to defend Mueller against sex assault allegations so they attack me in desperation. The establishment media knows that Mueller may go down over this--they want to deflect attention.

             :The existence of Parsons is in question. It was in that article I posted. That's an independent journalist saying the company denies Parsons worked there. Sara Carter RT'd that story so ... I'm still neutral. I really don't know. Tomorrow we'll all be able to form a more informed opinion. I want to hear this woman's name and hear the evidence. Even if the woman is ''credible,'' they have to have at least present strong circumstantial evidence to back up this claim .... if there is a claiim.

             Yup, Mueller is a scummy dirty boy. He's been running interference and covering up for these pigs for his entire life. I just want him to get nailed and put in jail for what he actually did and not because of fabricated lies. Plus I don't want any sympathy shed for this scum sucking degenerate, and that's what he'll be getting if these charges are false.

              I hope he gets what's coming to him.  I don't like that he is still in the spotlight.  He needs to be taken down.  Maybe this is how they will start dismantling him.  I think the charges are probably true.  Another Narcissistic act.   I tried to find another link that was better, but it seems to have disappeared.  Ahem, wonder how that happened.

                They are working fast and hard.  They hopefully are not planning this FF that is in a new post.  They are getting extremely desperate because I read that red early voting was out pacing the blue votes.  This is getting really scary, they will pull out all stops that is why this FF news could be a possibility.  I am already being attacked because I asked for prayers for the Jewish Children.  My God.  That's why we are here.  For Our Children.  For All of Our Children.  The Innocents.

And I have to defend this on this forum. Disgusting.  They never stop!  Yes we are are to defend All Children and to Stop those that defile and abuse them.

                 It's horrible that you're being attacked. Not right at all. They're children. Children are innocents.  It's our job to protect them.

                 I just don't know what's going to happen. I know the armed migrants will be at the border trying to start trouble and incite violence. And now there's a post about a FF on Nov 1st. They have to win these elections, but at this point, things will backfire if they try sh*t. It already is backfiring. It's why the early voting stats are not going the way the looney leaders of The Mob envisioned.

            Robert Mueller KNOWINGLY sent 4 INNOCENT men to prison for 30 years. These imprisoned men fought for their lives &amp; justice for years &amp; years. 2 of thise men died in prison, the other 2 were finally released &amp; given millions of dollars. Mueller worked WITH Whitey Bulger. Mueller + 9/11. This guy is beyond corrupt. So, for those of you here trying to defend Mueller &amp; trash this woman's story, you're wasting your time...and ours.

             True.

            <p>
             Look how Monica Lewsinky was trashed. If she hadn't saved that blue dress, that's how history would have recorded her: as a lying, delusional, looney-tune who was out to destroy Bill Clinton. Luckily, she was smart and listened to good advice. The problem is that women we like sometimes lie and women we think are skanks sometimes are telling the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll be very interested in what she has to say and find out if she has any evidene. Can she prove she was at the St. Regis. Can she prove that Mueller was at least there and had opportunity. Goddamn, I wish I could remember what was said about the St. Regis. I think it was in one of my threads and I don't remember. I'm going to look through my submissions and see what it relates to. Unless I posted in a submission and the St. Regis came up?

              I'm hearing this story is false. Made up by Jacob Wohl, who is trending #1 on Twatter right now. Tit for tat for the Kavanaugh thing, was the reasoning? I should've been slower to react to this story but, Robert Mueller is nonetheless, a wicked evil creature.

               Well, Jack Burkman burned the last time I ever take him seriously. Jacob Wohl I don't know. If Gateway Pundit took it down, he must be leaning in the direction of not getting caught up in promoting this smear ....

               Lies and manufactured crap was the way I didn't want it to go, but looks like it went there! Doesn't change my mind about Mueller though. He's still a POS.

                 He should be, but it rarely works that way. Especially because he's a radio personality. That's what I read. I've really never even heard of him before. But this is basically what the Dems did. I didn't approve of them doing it so not going to be hypocritical, but remember women accusers getting their mortgages paid for? Yeah, no. And I didn't take this down because there is some controversy. One of the women who said she was offered money allegedly never worked at the firm she said she did. Now this was the firm's statement to a journalist, but she could have had a different name when she was employed. The news conference is Thursday, and if this hasn't been totally debunked by then, we'll get to see if this is a dog-and-pony show or if it has legs. If they can't present evidence and name the woman involved in this, then I'm not posting about it anymore. There was one more thing ... what was it ... oh, right, Burkman. He really came hard t Mueller stating he was abusive in the workplace and he harassed women all the time. Is it true? Don't know. Could be more craziness. I don't know what's going on so I'll remain neutral with a slight lean towards this being BS because of it being Burkman.

              Ok so, I'm now hearing this story is false. I will take my lumps . However, I stand by the point I was trying to make. He's a POS &amp; as corrupt as they come. Why wouldn't I think it plausible?

             Nobody's wishing it's true. I'm wishing that if it is true, that this woman gets the justice she deserves.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe you're confusing not wishing this woman is lying with wishing it's true. It's the first. I don't want this woman to be a nutcase making up lies. The other thing you're leaving out is that my opinion of this man is so low, that I think he could be capable of such an act. Then there's the crowd he runs with. We've learned what other members of this cabal engage in and it seems to focus on depraved sexual acts.

               Well, for me, it's too late for that. I already know they do this and worse ... or just as bad. It's horrific, but so is murdering children.

               I really hope she's telling the truth. It's what I always hope. That people speak the truth. I'm so sick of all the lies.

             Yup.  This is fake.  Before this 2010 rape accusations.  Burkman's and Jacob Wohl were trying to get the media to bite in a different story about Sexual harrasment in 1974.

            I believe her and feel compelled to help this poor victim with a GoFundMe for personal security. To help her with the credible threats she will face from not only the corrupt FBI and DoJ, but the Clinton crime cabal.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect her loved ones have already been threaten by the IRS. Hell, her former neighbors and kindergarten class mates are most likely already being squeezed by Obama loyalist as I type.

             I feel the same way and will be the first donor.

            <p>
             Even though I have no idea who the fuck she is, there is not a doubt in my mind that she is telling the truth and has been traumatized beyond repair. I wonder if
             <s>
              me too
             </s>
             she too had a bout of amnesia and whether putting in a second door triggered remembrance of the attack.
            </p>
            <p>
             It doesn't matter. I'm selling my house and emptying out my 401 so I can give her every cent I have. And that press conference is unnecessary and just a chance to harass and burden a troubled soul. It's so unfair asking her to say anymore or offer more proof than her word alone.

                 Don't know where you're getting that I believe her. I haven't even heard anything yet. I was waiting to hear her speak and present her evidence, but it looks like I won't even do that.

                 Burkman and Wohl are reprehensible if they did actually manufacture this to create a smear. Nobody wants that . Nobody.

                 So Mueller is a dirty POS, but he did not engage in this behavior.
