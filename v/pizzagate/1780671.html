            I find that the homosexual issue is often used as a sophististicated front to not only sheild but also impliment the agendas of the monsters that rule and live among us.  The fact that they spread fear through the implication that all homosexeuals are pedophiles, a fallacy from the get go, but as pointed out it is also being used to normalize pedophilia suggests this is true.  And if you are critical you are labelled and corraled too boot!  In terms of strategy, I would say this qualifies as 'mind fucking your opponent'!  What kind of mind comes comes up with this sort of insane stratetigizing and agenda?  Not one that is a healthy human mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            To understand what kinds of monsters we are really dealing with we must have some knowledge of what it is we are trying to understand.  'Know your enemy' is the cliche'.  So with regard to PG we are actually talking about a subset of a more general group.  To answer the question asked, in short we are dealing with the clinical psychopath and sociopath, in all of its manifest possibilties.  The way 'the homosexual issue' is being used strongly suggests the mindset of this pathology, imho.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm confident that if we subjected the so called world leaders to the battery of tests to identify psycho-sociopathic characteristics we would probably find a large swath would not only test positive across the spectrum of degree but there would also be a lot of really high scores and probably plenty of clinical positives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keeping this in mind we always need to be on gaurd or vigilant.  Please realize there are some insane things going on in society and for the 'normal' human being none of it makes sense because they are not  clinical psycho-sociopaths, ie their brains are working for the most part. It is incumbent upon all of us to realize:
1) Our society is literally sociopathically structured and in a respect we're almost all afflicted to one degree or another.
2) Society is being ruled by psycho-sociopaths.  This does go a long way to understanding the insanity of the world.
3) Though it is nearly impossible for a healthy human to undertand the psycho-sociopath it is possible to identify them as difficult as it is.
4) This infliction upon our species is independent of demograph.  Clinical psycho-sociopaths are found equally in all populations.
5) Educate yourself and everyone you can, per the usual protocol.  I suggest the following documentary as a good start!

            If I'm not mistaken and as others have suggested in a multitude ways that this has been going on for a long time!

            For a more indepth investigation into our divided brain I suggest looking into the work of Iain McGilchrist even though it is a broader context that doesnt directly deal with mental pathologies.
