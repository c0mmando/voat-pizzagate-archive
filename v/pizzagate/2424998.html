            Blondeau scares the B-Geezus out of me.   Sentient’s AI doesn’t just crunch data to find patterns - it can make real-world decisions. These algorithms mimic the way biological life evolved on Earth - thriving by killing off the weakest members of a species, until only the strong survive and reproduce, for millions of generations.   THIS IS THEIR PLAN.  We are the weakest members.
