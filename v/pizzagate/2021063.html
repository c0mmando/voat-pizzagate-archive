<pre><code> According to a NY Post 2015 Article, Charity Navigator, which rates nonprofits, recently refused to rate the Clinton Foundation because its “atypical business model . . . doesn’t meet our criteria. Charity Navigator put the foundation on its “watch list,” which warns potential donors about investing in problematic charities. The 23 charities on the list include the Rev. Al Sharpton’s troubled National Action Network, which is cited for failing to pay payroll taxes for several years.&quot;

<p>American Thinker reported that “The $20,000 CGI (Clinton Global Initiative) membership fee was waived for Charity Navigator, which reported it as an in-kind contribution, according to the AP. The news organization said Charity Navigator chairman Michael Thatcher claimed his group joined CGI “to mingle with world leaders and promote its ratings.
Various sorts of people are willing to pay millions of dollars for the opportunity to mingle with the high and mighty assembled by the CGI or CF. To be on the receiving end of such favors is an inherent conflict of interest.”</p>

<p>An excerpt from is testimony:</p>
<p>&quot;I want to begin by thanking Representative Greenwood for the invitation to speak to you today. My name is Dr. Thomas Murray, and I am a member of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC). NBAC was established by President Clinton in 1995 to advise and make recommendations to the President through the National Science and Technology Council and to others on bioethics issues and their policy implications. My fellow commissioners on NBAC come from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds, and include research scientists, religious scholars, physicians, lawyers, and members of the public. My day job is as President of The Hastings Center in Garrison, New York, an independent non-partisan research institute that addresses fundamental ethical issues in the areas of health and medicine, the biomedical sciences, and the environment. I serve on the Committee on Ethics of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and am the author of The Worth of a Child.”</p>

           <p>
            There is a small town in NY where the Rothschilds or Rockefellers "imported" their colony of "operatives" from Europe when the United States was first established.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were sent off to different places in the US to infiltrate civil society and act as spies and agents for Roth/Rock.  The two guys who started the Mormons were among those who originated from this town.  I seem to remember it was a name like "Garrison".
           </p>
           <p>
            Also who was the prosecutor or lawyer involved with the JFK assassination named "Garrison"?  There might be a link there.  "

             I could not find any Mormon/J.Smith/B.Young ties to Garrison NY, but it sure has a lot of ties to Rockefeller and Rothschild.  It's definintely a power center."

            Garrison, New York seems to be a nexus of dark science and Clintons. I wonder if besides cloning the weird experiments with stem cells is a topic for these think tanks.  Lots is being done with wound healing, good medicine, but also crazy AI half-human-robot crazy "science" is going on.

            They do awful things to prisoners etc. with zero ethics involved, rubber stamped by these "bio-ethics" monsters.

            This is very, very good new info.

           <p>
            "Hastings Center in Garrison, New York"  - -  on that board member - is really useful. Garrison is the home of the website, Charity Navigator servers.  And "bioethics" is a catchword for cloning.

            I am adding all this to my blog as a separate post.

            pretty stupid question. if CN didn't give CF 4*, CF would have killed CN's family and their dog -- their dog first, in front of the kids. option: murder CN on the street and make it look like a bungled burglary. eg. an offer CN couldn't refuse.

            , nice post. I'm giving this a "Potential Lead" flair to add eyeballs. :-)

            If you want to get rid of the hideous formatting, edit your post and look for spaces that were added in front of the paragraphs you quoted. Delete the spaces, then hit preview and see how it looks. You just want a &gt; in front of each paragraph of the quoted material...no spaces.
