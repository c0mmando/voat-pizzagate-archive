<blockquote>
<p>Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz revealed in an interview on Sunday that he has proof that former Democrat President Barack Obama ordered the FBI to investigate someone after far-left billionaire George Soros asked for the investigation.</p>
<p>Dershowitz’s remarks come after critics have attacked President Donald Trump for tweeting about matters related to the Department of Justice, which led to Attorney General William Barr publicly asking the president to stop last week.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of White House control of the Justice Department during the Kennedy administration and I don’t think we saw very many liberal professors arguing against that,” Dershowitz told Breitbart News. “I have some information as well about the Obama administration – which will be disclosed in a lawsuit at some point, but I’m not prepared to disclose it now – about how President Obama personally asked the FBI to investigate somebody on behalf of George Soros, who was a close ally of his.”</p>
<p>“We’ve seen this kind of White House influence on the Justice Department virtually in every Justice Department,” Dershowitz continued. “The difference this president is much more overt about it, he tweets about it. President Obama whispered to the Justice Department about it.”</p>
<p>“You said that George Soros asked Barack Obama to have his Justice Department investigate somebody?” Breitbart News pressed.</p>
<p>“That’s going to come out in a lawsuit in the near future, yeah,” Dershowitz responded. “I have in my possession the actual 302 form which documents this issue and it will at the right time come out, but I’m not free to disclose it now because it’s a case that’s not yet been filed.”</p>

            I think is funny that you so called diggers have NO clue what attorney client privilege means....Dershowitz was Epsteins lawyer making it illegal for him to divulge ANYTHING he may or may not have learned about Epsteins crimes to the public or anywhere else...that does not make him an enabler. IF that were true we'd have every single defense attorney in the country in prison.

             No one said he needed to divulge it. He was not, however, forced to continue as Epstein's attorney once he found out what Epstein was doing. He could have walked away. Instead, he flew to Little St. James and got a massage. Nor was he forced to intimidate witness' families or the prosecutors, which there are multiple reports of him doing.

            I don’t trust Dersh. I’m sure Soros pays many people for many things. It could be true but he just can’t be trusted. Why in the world would he say that after Epstein was “offed”. He’s cutting his own throat.

              I know, and it is so sad. I pray all the time that their suffering will soon end. I do know that this evil is world wide and has become very entrenched. I just heard about trafficking out of Iran. That is a new one for me. Hellfire is too good for these evil F*cks.
