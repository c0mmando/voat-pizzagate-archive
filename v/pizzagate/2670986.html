            (Portland, OR)  --  A man accused of stealing an airplane and crashing it to his death in Washington state has ties to Oregon.  KATU reports 29-year-old airport worker Richard Russell once operated a bakery in North Bend with his wife.  Russell and his wife operated the Hannah Marie's Artisan Breads and Pastries for three years there before moving to Washington state.  The Seattle Times says Russell was a well-liked Christian youth leader who was described by friends and family as quiet, warm and compassionate.  Russell allegedly stole the empty Horizon Air Bombardier Q400 from Sea-Tac Airport on Friday, performing tricks and maneuvers before crashing on a wooded island about an hour later.

            Where is Ketron Island? Who lives there?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ketron Island, the site of a crash of a hijacked Alaska Airlines plane taken from Sea-Tac Airport sits in the South Puget Sound.
           </p>
           <p>
            The privately owned island is reachable only by ferry and is served by the Anderson Island-Steilacoom ferry run by Pierce County. The population listed in the 2010 U.S. Census was all of 17 people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 221-acre island was supposed to be named for William Kittson of the Hudson’s Bay Company, who supervised the construction of Fort Nisqually in 1833, according to the book Washington State Place Names. The name was bungled while transcribed to a map, giving the island its name.

            Palatial Ketron Island home sells for $1.1 million
           </p>
           <p>
            A 5-acre estate with 1,000 feet of waterfront, commanding views of Puget Sound and the Olympics and a midcentury home built in the style of renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright on the northern tip of Ketron Island has sold to a Lacey couple.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 5,300-square-foot home, which is equipped with its own pier and a guest cabin, was featured in both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal when it went on the market last year. The News Tribune wrote about the home last August.
           </p>
           <p>
            The new owners are Thurston County restaurateurs Nicole Pham and her husband Jim Porter, according to Karen Vincent who handled the sale for Morrison House Sotheby’s International Realty. The estate originally was listed for $1.77 million. Then it was reduced to $1.299 million. It sold for $1.1 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            The couple own a small chain of Lemon Grass Vietnamese restaurants in Thurston County.
           </p>
           <p>
            Marion Chenaur, who with her husband owned the property for a quarter-century, sold because she was a widow and she wanted to live where retailers and public services were closer than on the island. The island has 20-some residents. It has no gas station, store, mail delivery or refuse pickup. The only public access to the island is via a four-times-daily Pierce County ferry from Steilacoom.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many island residents, like Chenaur’s late husband, commuted by their own boat to the mainland. Island residents maintain their own dock in Steilacoom.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pham and Porter may use it as a family retreat while maintaining a home on the mainland. They were unavailable for comment Friday afternoon.
           </p>
           <p>
            The home was built for J.C. Morris, an Anchorage entrepreneur, who bought the entire island in 1946. He envisioned some 200 homes on the property with an island retail center, churches and a school, a quiet residential retreat in the middle of Puget Sound.
           </p>
           <p>
            Morris’ development ideas were never fulfilled in part because building out the island would have required construction of an expensive sewer treatment system to serve many of the home sites. The estate itself uses a septic system because the ground there is properly drained to allow one.
           </p>
           <p>
            The midcentury modern home, built to a design by Tacoma architects Harris, Reed &amp; Wilson that borrows liberally from the residential work of famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, remains much as it was when it was finished 52 years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            The home, which was built with narrow slices of Wilkeson sandstone, Montana slate and Washington granite, takes advantage of the sights that attracted Morris to the island after World War II.
           </p>
           <p>
            The home features an 800-square-foot living room with panoramic water views, a wine cellar, three bedrooms in the main house and a storage room on the ground level to store supplies brought from the mainland.
           </p>
           <p>
            The grounds include a lush garden and a beach populated with driftwood and small rounded stones.
           </p>

            There is much in all three of these links.  He used to work with Young People which has not been on MSM.  Also they started out in North Bend, Or.  and moved to the Seattle Area.  But really why did he choose Ketron Island of all places.  The Island seems to me to be a place for the Rich and Famous.  There are only 17 people living there and they need 4 trips a day from the ferry.  Also some have their own boats and they do not have garbage pickup.  Also, there are some Well Connected here, owning Restaurants, etc.  Lots to Dig, imo.

             Thanks for the heads up. Maybe the search was delayed because of the terrain or remoteness.

            This one doesn't sit well with me. He appears to be a decent guy with a good life. I understand that he could have been mentally ill and that led him to do what he did, but there doesn't seem to be any signs of mental illness or depression based on what has been revealed about him so far.

            I have zero proof to back any of this up, but as an on the ground air port worker at one of the largest airports on the west coast, is it possible he saw or got involved in some nefarious business? Are kids being trafficked through this airport and maybe he found out about it or got in over his head with something?

             Very good and a real possibility.  But I also find it odd that his wife deleted her Instagram which supposedly ad a lot of baker items on there, since she was a chef and baker.  A lot of artists and foodie people getting in trouble lately.  Also dying.  I had missed this story since I was away for the weekend with friends.  Finally someone mentioned it this aft.

              It looks like they sold the bakery in 2015. I haven't yet found what she has been doing since but probably something good related I'm guessing. I'm gonna keep looking.

                Where those F15 fighters controlling more than preventing?  Did they know why he was up there with that plane and wanted to make sure he finished the job?  Did they want him out of the way?

                Just a wild guess.  I feel that he either discovered something about his wife or saw something that was going on at the airport.  If he saw something really bad, like the moving of children, possibly he watched it a few times and now knew that he was between a rock and a hard place.  He knew they were going to get rid of him so he wanted to choose his way out.

                  (Portland, OR)  --  A man accused of stealing an airplane and crashing it to his death in Washington state has ties to Oregon.  KATU reports 29-year-old airport worker Richard Russell once operated a bakery in North Bend with his wife.  Russell and his wife operated the Hannah Marie's Artisan Breads and Pastries for three years there before moving to Washington state.  The Seattle Times says Russell was a well-liked Christian youth leader who was described by friends and family as quiet, warm and compassionate.  Russell allegedly stole the empty Horizon Air Bombardier Q400 from Sea-Tac Airport on Friday, performing tricks and maneuvers before crashing on a wooded island about an hour later.

                  A well liked Christian Youth Leader  -  Desperate men do desperate things.  OK, He works with kids and lives in North Bend Or.  Then moves to the Seattle area.  AND he works at an airport where we know they traffick kids.

                  Their bakery was in North Bend Or.  Oregon is a Cesspool and so is Seattle.  Funny they were so Christian and they ended up in these two places.  They made donuts aside from other things.  For some reason that jumped out at me.

                 I don't see a guy with a happy marriage taking this way out, so you're probably right that something happened with the wife or he knew he was in some serious trouble over things he had seen.

                 There is something really fishy, at least to me, and I have a feeling, to you too.  There seem to be too many of these people, chefs, music and movie industry people, including sports people that are dying.  And, if we pay attention close enough, there are small clues that tug at us, just enough to make us take a closer look.  But as we are looking, there pops up another one.  And another one and another.  Do you get the feeling that since Anthony B died, that Phil Rosenthal is slowly taking over?  He was involved with Everybody Loves Raymond.  Since Kate S died, we must also pay attention to designers.  Any that are in any of the arts it seems.  What's up with that?  Are they being killed off because they were ready to speak up, or someone was about to spills the beans about them?

                  I noticed that too.  The Secret Garden was one of my favorite movies and books.  Since getting red pilled I started wondering if there is more to that title.  I just saw the story on my local news.  Not much info of course.  Not what's really important.  Did he discover something about his wife, or was he involved too and they were soon to be discovered?  There are so many possibilities.  Just like Kate S.  I think that Instagram held too many secrets possibly.

            Unfortunately for the family, at the speeds involved the body probably resembles what happens when you shoot a water balloon out of a potato gun at a brick wall. The FAA will probably run DNA eventually. I saw a clip of the crash, the plane went in nose first at a steep angle, the impact was obscured by the trees, and a smoke cloud came up after a while. From video of the crash site it looks like the plane sheared through about 50-100 yards of large fir trees before impacting the ground.

            What I keep going back to is the fact this guy said he was messed up but hadn't known until recently. What exactly did he learn 'recently'? That seems so off. Until recently he had no reason to commit suicide. Then he does it in a big way.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for getting the plane in the air, working on these things is his job and he knew how to take off. In the beginning of the 'crisis' scanners were stating he had gotten up there and didn't think he could land it.

              In our group we definitely feel he saw something he shouldn't have, asked questions and was 'set straight.' This translated to learning he wasn't ok. Because he couldn't agree with what he was told.

                 See my new comment.  Lots in there.  Yes, he did choose it for a reason.  He was mixed up in some crazy stuff/or he wanted to point to the place for a reason.  You will see who lives there.

                   Yes and who lives there.  They are related to restaurants and are Really Loaded.  I think it is a place for them to have a lot of their kind of fun.  Possibly he found out about what was being brought there.

            How about the fact that not one MSM outlet has bothered to mention that there is no way that guy would have been able to get that plane off the ground and execute the maneuvers he did, without being a pilot.

             It may have been believable if he was even an airplane mechanic, but he wasn't. His job did not take him into the cockpit whatsoever, so how did he know what he was doing?

              They at least had flight training.  Supposedly.  Or the planes were hijacked remotely.

                Shit.  I've heard bits and pieces of this story.  I knew a lot of people hurt/killed in 9/11 in DC and NY.  Like all the other FF, there was never a doubt about any of the casualties.  This draws a lot of that together:
                <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/how-to-steal-an-airplane-from-911-to-mh370/">
                 https://www.corbettreport.com/how-to-steal-an-airplane-from-911-to-mh370/
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                I shudder in terror at the thought of those lost souls on a plane being flown remotely.  It was probably a MASCAS before the planes ever hit the Towers or the Pentagon.  All as a piloted UAV.  I've avoided flying for a while.

                 The airplane speeds dont match up with the altitude...cruise speeds at that altitude and viscocity is physically impossible..the forces on the engines and wings would rip it apart at that viscocity and altitude..
It was one of many live video hoaxes..

                <p>
                 So u personally know people who died on 9/11.
If so please.provide the names and we will check it on the social security death index..its public information..

                 so… it's my opinion that no persons were on flights 11 and 175, and flights 77 and 93 never existed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Look at the flight manifest of 77.  Over 30% were MIC employees

                   I don’t know how they called home on their cellphones because at that time it was impossible to do. U couldn’t get wifi or cell towers on planes. Todd Beamer “let’s roll” and they tackled the pilots... no plane hit the pentagon. It was a bomb, people were outside and saw nothing hit it, it exploded.

                    Airplanes in those days had phones built in to the backs of the seats. They cost some ridiculous amount of money, like $3 per minute or something. Heaven help you if you used it as a dialup line with your laptop and someone sent you a huge (1MB was huge) email attachment. Few people used the "airphones" (as they were called if I remember correctly) due to the high cost, but emergency calls were free. Todd Beamer called 911 and got an emergency operator named Lisa, who connected him with his wife, Lisa Beamer (just a coincidence that both were named Lisa). Of course you are correct that cell phones would not have worked.

                  I'm not ready to wrap my mind around that one yet.  I was pretty close to it.  I know a public shill, ex-mil on CNN "Who was there".  Puppet.  It affected all of us here in the most profound way that no one has really quantified yet.

                  I had to retrieve a young kid from school 1 mile from the Pentagon, 3 hours after the impact.  I drove past that gaping crater 3-5 days per week starting at day 4 on for years.  I know people closely who were injured in the Pentagon hit.  I saw the remnant injuries.  If it wasn't 77, then  was it that 4 seconds of video which looks like a missile strike? Something hit the Pentagon.
