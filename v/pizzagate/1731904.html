<p>He\'s <a href="https://www.naij.com/56283.html">not an actual doctor</a> but he does pretend to be one, and he even ran a fake hospital, called &quot;Ezuma private hospital&quot;. His hospital functioned as a baby factory to keep stock for his orphanage (I suspect he must have more than one orphanage as well as counterparts in other countries). &quot;Ezuma women &amp; children rights protection initiative: Homeless babies home&quot; in Owerri, Nigeria. Long story short his apprehension for his operation led to 16 pregnant
girls being rescued. However he was <a href="http://archive.fo/NB0lq">released</a> on the premise that that most of those charged for operating baby
factories had been released, so again he resumed his hospital operation.</p>
<p>He owns a number of resource based companies including <a href="http://etazuma.com/gallery.html">Eta-Zuma</a><a href="https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/2mp7au/zuma-energy-llc"> Zuma energy</a>, which i believe is expanding around the <a href="http://www.zumaenergia.com/?lang=en">world</a></p>
<p>He is a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/16/1658980_re-gv-re-os-nigeria-econ-bank-debts-80-efcc-operatives-storm.html">Stratfor client</a> as can be seen in the wikileaks. He\'s mentioned in a few other wikileaks as well. I\'m not sure if he is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma">Jacob Zuma</a> the ex leader of South Africa, but this would make sense as he sometimes names his companies Ezuma and othertime just Zuma.</p>
<p>I found his name because the article &quot;billionaire baby seller&quot; was cited in this <a href="http://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(15)00490-3/references">journal article</a></p>
<p>Somebody with this much money and influence certainly is connected to Pizzagate in some way. If anyone can help connect the dots.</p>',
