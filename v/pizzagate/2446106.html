            The guy is a weak beta. Katy Perry is a piece of trash. The guy is more at fault than Katy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Katy persuaded this beta to walk over to her and kiss her. Katy then pulled a fast one on the beta. The beta is at fault. Katy never forced a kiss, she only redirected the kiss. Katy tricked the beta. Katy is a trickster. If Katy walked up to him and forced a kiss, then that would be different scenario, but this beta clearly walked right into it and fell for it. This should be a lesson to beta's everywhere, you need to say NO and stand your ground, stop being weak and giving in like this guy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you see Katy's face when the guy said he never kissed a girl? Katy looked like a little kid in Disney World for the first time. She was shocked and determined to take his virginity live on air. Katy took advantage of the beta because she knew she could. I don't agree with this, but the beta should have just said NO, its that SIMPLE!

            There will be those that say Oh, it was just a quick peck.  The point is that she invaded his privacy.  These stars think they have a right to get into anyone's personal space.  He may have been saving that kiss for someone special.  He evidently did not think Perry was someone special. Yuck Factor.

             Katy did violate this guy, but the beta male clearly walked up right into the vampires face and proceeded to kiss her. He made a choice to walk up and kiss Katy. I don't agree with what she did, but the beta should have just said no. Its simple really.
            </p>
            <p>
             The US has been breeding more and more betas. Its a genius way to take over. Turn the population into weak beta males that can't say no and put them into stockholm syndrome. Scare the betas with some school shootings, take the guns and speech, and theres that! Easy as 1,2,3!

              Yeah, I noticed that too. Why did he just let her do it.  I think he was intimidated because he was on tv and he knew the country was watching.  I still think she knew from rehearsing that he was a gentleman and that he probably would come over to her if she called to him.  Also that he was not going to back down even though.  She really is the bottom of the barrel.  Yeah, and you are right.  The nation is raising a bunch of guys with man buns now.

             It is ironic that people who get upset over whether or not you use the correct pronoun seem to think nothing of disrespecting a person who has more conservative view regarding sex and intimacy.  Even if you think the guy is ridiculous for wanting to save his first kiss for someone special (yes, 19 is a bit old to have never kissed anyone) -- it is still wrong to be disrespectful to his beliefs.  Katy Perry may think that she is "someone special" -- but that was just purely egotistical.  I bet it was fun for her to "deflower" him, so to speak.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had a very good friend in high school who was molested by our band director.  After that, she became very involved in her church and met her husband while she was doing missionary work in South America.  Because of her previous abuse, she decided to wait until she was married for any type of intimacy.  She and her husband shared their very first kiss on their wedding day.  If her husband (then fiance) could respect her need to be in control of her body, surely Katy Perry could do the same thing for a guy that she doesn't even know.

              Katy Perry has no control. Not only did we see it that night, but in many other ways.  She IS controlled.  Also, maybe this Christian boy had also been abused and did not want to be kissed by a woman.  His abuser could have been a woman.  We don't know exactly what his real reason was, but again it is being disrespectful and beyond very embarrassing for him.  Why did she need to take him down like that?  She put him in a real spot.  I don't need another reason to dislike Perry, but now I have one.

              Good example of how some grooming begins in Pedowood. The contestant, 19, was clearly surprised (not in a good way) and Katy thought she was awesome. She's a shining example of a hypocrite.

              Adding:
Pedowood is part of Pedogate given the human trafficking of stars for sexual abuse, the involvement of big $, and inextricable link to the global cabal newly rediscovered via PG.

               LT, is there any evidence that Katy Perry is involved in pedophilia like there is for Christy Teigen, or that anything bad happened to this contestant prior to the show when they were a minor? If not, this really isn't directly related to child sexual abuse by the elite. It is indirectly related, but those submissions belong in
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                v/pizzagatewhatever
               </a>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               If you can link any previous research showing evidence KP was likely abused as a minor and edit that in, I think we could leave it up. Like, was she involved with any pedo producers, politicians, celebs etc. as a kid?

                No, other than her beta kitten programming, cabal imaging/messaging through her music, and overtly sexualized image designed to groom young children and tweens. IMO, the grooming tactics of the cabal are relevant as are Pedowood-normalization agents, including pop stars.
