<p>There are two attachments to the email. In the attachment titled &quot;Iowa clips.doc&quot;, there is an embedded PDF file with a short story of some sort that goes like this:</p>
<p>&quot;While sitting on our back deck the other day, I watched two squirrels playfully chasing each other back and forth across the lawn, creating crunchy noises as they ran through the fallen leaves. They dashed up, down and around the thick tree trunks. It looked as if they were playing a game of tag. I laughed to myself as they scampered far out onto limbs where the branches were almost entwined in nearby trees. Then they had to make their decision. Should they attempt the leap across or go back the way they came? As soon as those two scurried out of sight, I noticed a different one. He stood on his hind legs, holding an acorn in his furry little paws, nibbling away. That’s when I thought about the squirrels I’d observed in Greenfield last month. They were a pretty, reddish-brown color in contrast to the plain grey squirrels we have in my part of Missouri.&quot;</p>
<p>So yeh, it\'s weird especially when you consider the email is a about someone reaching out for a position under the Obama administration.</p>
<p>But I really can\'t figure out what it means.</p>

We all do. Here\'s something that isn\'t a larp. The people involved in this refer to the trafficking ring as a &quot;travelling circus&quot;. Remember the tunnels being dug in Comet Ping Pong? They are built on private residences too. &quot;Squirrels&quot; and &quot;mice&quot; work for the travelling circus and are probably associated with the tunnels. What these represent i\'m not entirely sure yet though. <a href="http://archive.is/dyLv3">http://archive.is/dyLv3</a></p>',

            I searched traveling circus in the Global Intelligence Files and Podesta emails and there were a few weird ones titled Re: Visit Liming in CO and I can see that Traveling Circus is mentioned until I open the email. Then it turns into a bunch of letters and I have no idea how to decode it. Any thoughts on this?

            If it's for a job application, and anon said squirrels and mice work for the travelling circus, maybe by inserting a obscure out of place squirrell reference, maybe that is the protocol for expressing interest in applying for a squirrel role with the travelling circus

            Maybe he's saying he likes redheads and is excited at the prospect of getting involved with a ring on an area with a different variety than that which he is used to. Perhaps the arrival of the squirrel with an acorn is a reference to ACORN.

            Mice like cheese. Squirrels like walnuts. They build underground storage rooms to collect the cheese and the nuts they find. Podesta's nickname is "Skippy", another famous squirrel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can't help but think of that creepy children's book, "The Secret Pizza Party", by Daniel Salmieri &amp; Adam Rubin. They also wrote a series of stories called "Those Darn Squirrels", and a book called "Dragons Love Tacos". Their books are filled to the brim with mice, squirrels, masked rodents and, of course, pizza's, ice-cream, taco's etc. etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Daniel Salmieri also illustrated a book called "The Dullards", about boring parents who won't allow their kids to join ...
            <strong>
             the circus
            </strong>
            . Lots of circus imagery in this book, and, again, lots of furry animals. Also a swirly blue/pink ball.
           </p>
           <p>
            And every book they write seems to be about boring parents, keeping their kids away from secret places of joy and fun. Every book seems to convey the message that it is OK to disobey your parents, visit the fun places anyway, and that it is OK to keep this happy secret to yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their latest book is called "Robo-Sauce". Here's a short synopsis:
           </p>
           <p>
            Parents need to know that Robo-Sauce, by Adam Rubin and Daniel Salmieri, the team behind Dragons Love Tacos, is the zany story of a boy who wants to be a robot, so he drinks
            <strong>
             a secret "robo-sauce"
            </strong>
            (the unseen narrator gives him the fictional secret formula for it), and all heck breaks loose. "Robo-Kid" activates a robo-rocket blast, a robo-laser blast, and a robo-tornado and rampages through town. All leads to
            <strong>
             robo-domination
            </strong>
            , and kids have to turn the book upside down to read the final pages of the "Robo-Book." It's crazy, silly fun. Parents may need to help younger kids fold the pages properly to create the Robo-Book (there are diagrams).

             I have Dragons Love Tacos and read through the book many times trying to find anything .... interesting. There's no pedo imagery and the story isn't as 'interesting' as some of their other books. I can see how the other stories raise concerns but Dragons Love Tacos just doesn't have much to stand on IMO.

              I don't know. Dragons are large reptiles and the satanists seem to believe the elites are reptilians in human form. According to some slang definitions posted at UrbanDictionary, taco can be slang for vagina, salsa can be slang for a woman's period or engaging in oral sex with a woman while she's having her period (we know the satanists have a thing for bodily fluids and menstrual blood is right up there), and hot sauce can mean fresh semen infected with HIV/AIDS. If the author is a satanist or pedophile using any of these alternate definitions, the coded meaning could be extremely inappropriate for children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, as many of us have recently learned, satanist pedophiles use code language, symbolism, imagery, numbers, and gestures that normal people aren't familiar with. They hide in plain sight and apparently believe this enhances their powers. We might be looking right at their subversive material and not recognize it. However, as we learn more about it, they are exposed.

               Okay, let's go along with that. First off, dragons aren't 'real' so saying they're reptiles....eh, I'll allow it I guess. The story goes dragons can't eat spicy salsa because it gives them tummy troubles. How would you relate that. The boy in the book has a taco party (nefarious) and he accidentally serves them salsa, which then causes them to spit fire and burn his house down. Then they build him another house. What would be the connection there? Not disagreeing with you, just putting it out there.

            ACORN was that Obama org Breitbart busted on. 
Separately, I have had a theory that the reason politicians will seek power, allow themselves to be compromised, I.e. "how they get them to do it" is because people who think they're special think they deserve special things. The guy who's never had a "10" for a girlfriend. Maybe just 4's and 5's. And now he's bald, too, he never will. They're offering him an 11. They're guaranteeing him she'll stay. As long as he wants. Or cars. They never had that classic Mustang, always some shit car. Some want a beautiful, reddish brown Indian child to rape. Or a roomful. That's his dream. Every Friday night for the rest of his life. Walnut sauce. Red brown squirrels. A whole traveling circus that leaves at dawn. They can make that happen. Nobody else ON EARTH can, for such an ugly motherfucker. They make the magick.

            , thank you for reposting this. I am flairing it "New Evidence" to get more eyeballs in here to help figure out the why the squirrel pdf is at the back of that Word document, and if there are any other references to "circus" "mice" or "squirrels" in social media hashtags, FBI archive emails releases etc.

Maybe it's a signal to those in the know to hide.

            There are two kinds of squirrels in Missouri, red and grey. I believe there are only grey in St. Louis, Columbia has both grey and red. I would suspect if this story was in a PDF there is something hidden in the metadata.

            My take on the traveling circus was that it was simply a way insiders referred to the operation of trafficking. That operation would include the victims as well as professional handlers who know the routine. So it literally may be quite the cast of characters as the handlers. Also, wrt the mice and squirrels, both are burrowing animals and ground squirrels in particular build complex tunnel systems. 
Squirrels also eat mice and even other squirrels when hungry...
Tunnels:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the squirrels and mice referred to by Anon are the workers digging the tunnels.

The other attachment is some article singing his praises/his accomplishments.  The squirrel stuff is embedded in the article.  So Is it normal for something like a little short story on squirrels to be embedded in an article on a "progressive's accomplishments"

               I agree, Infopractical. Read that last line again:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                That’s when I thought about the squirrels I’d observed in Greenfield last month. They were a pretty, reddish-brown color in contrast to the plain grey squirrels we have in my part of Missouri.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               That sounds eerily similar to the other Podesta emails about pasta received for Christmas. This article is dated October of 2008...where was this Wallace guy in Greenfield a month prior? Have there been any CP or pedo busts there? Does anyone really get this excited over squirrels being a different color?

            I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a guy watching squirrels. It is odd and out of place though.

            I too remembered this part of anon's statement and have been trying to find references to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Watching their behavior of the squirrels at my work I came to associate the mice and squirrels with digging and tunnels. Storing food away for later and constantly moving.  Could never figure out the traveling circus part.

              I watch squirrels way too much. One thing I noticed is one squirrel buries a peanut. Another squirrel watches, a more shy one who gets picked on by others. He then waits until the other one leaves and digs up the peanuts the first one buried. He kinda follows the first one and just dogs up whatever he buries instead of coming over and getting a peanut himself. Made me think of a network of people handing of hidden goods to each other without actual contact with each other.  Person a leaves a package somewhere kinda hidden and leaves. Person b picks it up never knowing who person a is.

               i would guess, if your conjecture is correct, that they are talking caches of child porn/abuse material - it would seem to impragmatic to be in relation to trafficking

               Very good insight!
              </p>
              <p>
               I too notice that squirrels bury their finds in the fall so they have food for the winter.  They always make little holes in my potted plants and flower beds.  So squirrels hide their NUTS underground.  Mice hide their CHEESE in holes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anon talked about tunnels in the same post about squirrels and mice.  So we know they have something to do with the tunnels.  He also said the tunnels were under residences and we did find some info on Hilary's home being over tunnels that were for water but abandoned long ago by the city.   her property backs up to a huge forest.  Podesta lives near the clintons.

               A Traveling show is a traveling circus.  Maybe circus references films they may sell?

                Oh fuck. I think I know what they're talking about. One of the things that has kept me motivated doing this is that our family has for 15+ years funded a Dominican orphan at Nuestros Pequenos Hermanos/Friends of the Orphans. When I saw that this charity might be connected to Laura Silsby's trafficking in Haiti via the Maccobees in DC, it made me ill. One of the ways they raise money and get new people to sponsor the kids in the orphanages all over Central America is by sending a troupe of kids to do traditional folk dances at churches. They basically go on tour. The kids stay in the homes of host families, and then perform at dozens of different churches in a given city/region. How do I know this?
               </p>
               <p>
                Because one year, our family was a host family. We had three young girls between 11 and 13, with an older girl who was in college supervising them. They spoke no English and we communicated via Google translator. This was about 10 years ago -- well before the Haitian earthquake. They were very timid, very insecure, and very overwhelmed with the food we made for dinner, etc. I wish I could say that they were just innocent kids doing their performance show for churches and not experiencing any coercion at all. But I can't. At the time, I felt like something was weird; but I thought it was the extreme socio-economic difference.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now, when I see this "traveling circus" shit...Goddamnit. Friends of the Orphans' main fundraiser is a traveling show of kids. I really hope this is just a coincidence.

            I think that "short story" could literally just be some guy rambling about squirrels, unless someone finds steganography in the PDF or something.

            Have to look at some of the other emails, though.

             I don't understand what this embedding thing signifies.  There would be no reason for the guy in the email to talk about these squirrels to podesta.  But if you're saying that the squirrel story could possibly be an article in the PDF that the guy didn't know was there?? I still don't know how to get to the squirrel story.  Someome on here found it embedded.  I found only a few lines of it when I searched squirrels in Podesta's emails.  The first few lines pop up as a "preview" for the email

              This is absolutely a classic example of steganography. The key word is likely one of the words in this short story.

              One of the most frustrating thing about #pizzagate is that there is a mountain of extremely suggestive, bizarre evidence - like the nonsense PDFs that were sent to Podesta, yet not a smoking gun. Not yet.
