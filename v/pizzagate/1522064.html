            Ingredients are hard to get in America, I've never spoken to anybody who ever cooked their own (plenty who have done that with meth).  And they guy you are quoting is one of the posters in the elite dawg forum.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also am a system admin for "stuff"  Big stuff really.  I can tell you that if you have an error like that and you're not hosting your own servers you don't just get to pull the plug.  46.105.136.217 is in france, the registrant for dmt-nexus.me is in the Netherlands.  Not happening.  I can also tell you that the guy who put up the site is freaking retarded, and I would not be at all surprised if it took him 3 days to fix the error.  Most people, and I mean this in the IT field as well, do not understand computers.  And, if you didn't build the software, and theirs an error in the code which gives off permissions it takes a long time to solve.  I bet bottom dollar that they were shitting bricks the whole time.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're using a template forum software.  Some have bugs, some have cache errors.  Especially when it was still much less refined in the early 2010's.  Not exactly computer wiz kids.  I would expect an error like that to stay up.  Over all.  I'm still excessively skeptical.
           </p>
           <p>
            But you know what.  I've considered your warning, given your familiarity with the site, and the extreme lack of posts (with this particular quote of yours "After the incident at comet today shit liek this is the worst thing you can do.") I'm considering you an idiot and moving on.  I have yet to see any convincing evidence to conclude that this is not what they had actually posted.

             I actuslly get a feeling that gathering from the effort the above commenter put into their explaination and defense of the site, they could possible be trying to sweep this under the rug. hmmm,,,

            WTF? I know the DMT nexus as well, having tried DMT. For those who just wanna know what kind of shit is on the secret forum, from the screenshots I can see there are threads such as "How to dispose of the bodies", "Snuff list", etc. Also tons of drug-trafficking threads, that seems to be the main purpose of the sub-forum. Also threads about trading drugs for sex "10g of coke for anyone who can bring in fresh junkies, preferably blondes", etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Discussions about falsely selling PCP and other drugs as MDMA/LSD. One called "I ATE A BABY. SERIOUSLY."
           </p>
           <p>
            Also many threads saying things like "Members can see this forum!?" and "Has the glitch been fixed?". Threads about baiting people in to buying by posting fake positive reviews of drugs. People asking for "expendables" to give up to the DEA to lower their own sentences.

             This is certainly...jarring to anyone with a conscience. But it looks suspicious to me. An "orgy of evidence" if you will.
            </p>
            <p>
             People don't talk so openly about murder and drug trafficking. And if you understand the origins of a lot of drug activity with the CIA, you might be more inclined to think this is some kind of a government-run honeypot.

              The 'big' man called for a meeting.  It seems we got 90% of the worldwide DMT market in our pockets and our recent 'project zombie' seems to be worrying the little man a bit.

              I had heard people speak of love with DMT, that it was such a loving experience. I could not understand this. For me it has only ever been cold, serpentine and completely without emotion. It was clinical beyond clinical. It left me feeling that love was purely a human construct, a simple rudimentary construct of our dimension.

             <p>
              Changa is commonly used to refer to a smoked blend of DMT that has been saturated onto leaves that contain harmala alkaloids, but there are several blends of changa that have no such MAOI. These are on occasion called enhanced leaf, and the particular blend I made is nicknamed "Electric Sheep" over at the dmt-nexus forums. 1/2 part Calea Zacatechichi, 1/2 part blue lotus petals, 1 part DMT freebase. I made a 300mg of DMT batch, making 600mg of changa, allowing for easy weighing.

             <p>
              After the putsch, the vice president of the League of Independent Scientists of the USSR, Victor Sedlecki, published a declaration in the Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda where he stated:
             </p>
             <p>
              As an expert and a legal entity I declare that mass production … of psychotronic biogenerators was launched in Kiev (this is indeed a very serious issue). I cannot assert for sure that that were exactly Kiev generators that were used during the putsch… However, the fact that they were used is obvious to me. What are psychotronic generators? It is an electronic equipment producing the effect of guided control in human organism. It especially affects the left and right hemisphere of the cortex. This is also the technology of the U.S. Project Zombie 5“. He further stated that due to the inexperience of the personnel who operated them the attempt to use the generators failed

              in Costa Rica, or anywhere else for that matter, ayahuasca should be approached with respect. Its benevolent shamanic uses do not intend to turn anyone into a zombie, but the strong psychotropic properties and high levels of alkaloids in the infusion call for its responsible use.

             Anyway, that's about all I can decipher from that one.  It's just strange, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was actually Obama that they were dealing with.
