            Why? The ring is closed now. Shut down. They've scurried away. It's all damage control and deception from here.

             Unless a lie detector were involved it'd be unlikely to yield useful information.   I just saw several people criticize the guys that got the 'walk through' today.    Wonder what questions should have been asked that might have revealed anything useful.

              I think the guy on the walk-through was just terrified the whole time he would be wacked. Something about being in person, in real life, that clams people up not used to detective work.   The only thing that will EVER work is true professionalism. Amateur means someone who does things for the love, that would describe most.
