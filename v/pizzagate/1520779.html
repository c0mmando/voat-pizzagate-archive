<p>John Podesta: Clinton\'s Mr. Fix-It</p>
<p>By Lloyd Grove</p>
<p>Washington Post Staff Writer</p>
<p>Wednesday, September 30, 1998; Page D01</p>
<p>It\'s a good thing John Podesta has a sense of humor.</p>
<p>He\'s under inhuman stress these days as the White House official in charge of saving President Clinton from himself. It\'s a job that amounts to cleaning up after a rogue elephant.</p>
<p>As deputy chief of staff, the 49-year-old Podesta is leading the frantic struggle to protect and defend a man who has disgraced himself, imperiled his presidency, damaged the Democratic Party and betrayed family, friends and associates -- John Podesta conspicuous among them.</p>
<p>Podesta\'s humor, appropriately, is dark and mordant. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>He\'s a thin, moody, wraithlike man who, before joining the White House, had a long history in Democratic politics. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Despite a cheekiness that borders on hostility and a sometimes snappish mien that colleagues identify as &quot;John\'s evil twin, Skippy,&quot; Podesta says he\'s forgiven the president for lying to him (and to everyone else) about his escapades with the former White House intern.</p>
<p>Which is to say: Podesta has forgiven Clinton for entangling him in the effort to find Clinton\'s former lover a good job outside the White House -- for which Podesta arranged a job interview with then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson. And he\'s forgiven Clinton for letting him repeat various falsehoods about Clinton\'s relationship with Lewinsky, under oath, to a federal grand jury. Both episodes figure prominently as possible grounds for impeachment in independent counsel Kenneth Starr\'s report to Congress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quote from Dennis Hastert in the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My feeling is that John has a good moral point of view -- and he certainly has a tough job to do,&quot; says Rep. Denny Hastert (R-Ill.), the chief deputy Republican whip and an old college pal of Podesta\'s brother Tony (the Podestas grew up in Chicago). &quot;He\'s tried to do it with as much dignity and honesty as he could possibly bring forward.&quot;</p>

            <p>
             To fully understand how John Podesta is managing the complex Democratic takeover of the federal government, you have to be familiar with Skippy, the evil twin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone who has worked for Podesta in the past decade knows Skippy, who first appeared during Podesta's eventful years as chief of staff in the Clinton White House. As scandal rocked the end of that presidency, staffers knew they had better come prepared to meetings. Otherwise, nurturing mentor John would be replaced by Skippy -- Podesta's quick-tempered, edgy and sarcastic alter ego.

            <p>
             Podesta’s restrained role is a surprise to many, who just assumed that Bill Clinton’s former chief of staff was coming in as a shadow chief of staff for Obama, making waves and getting involved in everything. This was, after all, the man whom Clinton staffers used to joke had an evil twin named Skippy to explain his flashes of imperious anger, slamming doors, slamming phones and berating staffers. He even kept a jar of Skippy peanut butter on his desk.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In homage to these skills, Podesta used to have a picture of a pig on a spit as his screen saver, but his staffers made him get rid of it, because he said: “They couldn’t stand looking into the pig’s eyes during meetings.”

            How much the media forgets and has changed!!
Case in point- we now have much more circumstantial evidence of terrible crimes by many of the government elite and they are completely ignoring it. 
In 1999, journalists far and wide accused the Clintons of waging war on journalism and of terrorizing and threatening journos who would "toe the line". Famously, Christopher Hitchens testified against Clinton in the congressional hearings and earned himself life long enemies- he died in 2011 of cancer.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He also wrote a cautionary article re: the Clinton Foundation (in Slate of all places) in 2009, asking WTF.
           </p>

            The media has changed so radically in the last decade. This stuff would never be published now, especially by left leaning mags.
He would be fighting this ridiculous censorship and BS if he were alive.
