CALLER
CALLER: I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH ALL OVER. I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR FAMILIES IN ARKANSAS -- I'M SPEAKING UP FOR THESE FAMILIES, WHEN DONALD TRUMP, OUR CHILDREN ARE BEING RIPPED AWAY FROM GOOD HOMES AND TERRORIZED BY CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES TO WHERE THEY ARE SABOTAGING PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS. THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES. AND FAMILIES -- AND NOT JUST ARKANSAS BUT ALL OVER WHERE THEY ARE PROMOTING ADOPTIONS AND HAPPENING TO ME AND FAMILIES ALL OVER. I HAVE A GIRL RIGHT NOW THAT IS HAVING HER RIGHTS TERMINATED AND DID EVERYTHING SHE IS SUPPOSED TO. AND WE NEED HELP WITH THIS.
           </p>
           <p>
            She mentions Alan Clarke from Arkansas has been helping but it's not enough.

            Maybe this is something we can start looking into? If CPS is involved than it would be all over the US not just Arkansas.+

            We need to support him and show him support because this seems like a very real problem. The 'Safe Families and Adoption Act' was singed into law by none othe rthan Bill Clinton himself. This seems oddly fishy.

            This is exactly what that caller on cspan was trying to say before getting cut off during the Trump inauguration. Keep digging on this. Could be important/connected.

            If anyone has it recorded ir knows someone who recorded the cspan coverage, you'll find the caller during the tv blackout during the lunch.

             Most children are not sent to a foreign country when they are legally kidnapped by CPS and they remain in this country.  There is a HUGE financial incentive for states to remove children where many end up in group homes and some foster homes where they are sexually abused, many run away only to end up being trafficked by pimps.  Here's an older article but still holds true today explaining the incentives for states to remove children from their parents.

             The last name was cram, the Girls father was abusive, at least to the mother, so and the daughter had a serious medical condition. And her mom has blonde hair and blue eyes, BTW.. so the mother left the abusive relationship and moved in an attempt to get medical insurance to take care of her daughter. After moving she requested help from the state to help her daughter. But instead of helping her they took her daughter, and told her that she was in a licensed foster care facility here in the United States. But it was a lie she was with the abusive fathers aunt and uncle in Mexico. The father may have been Mexican, based on where his aunts live, but the daughter was born in the United States as was the mother. Then they also lied about the girls death, saying it was from illness or something when not only was it from abuse but there was evidence that the girl was being tortured daily.. its a very sad story I must admit, and what the video also points out is the power that CPS has and abuses. Where they need to prove NOTHING to kidnap your child, and it has been used as retaliation many times in the past. They don't like you they take your kids. It also points out that often children are taken for claims of neglect. However neglect is much more common in foster homes than at home with your own parents. I understand that CPS is needed and important, but the level of power and what we know today I think maybe some reforms are needed.
