<p>JFK is still 50+ years old and MSM holds to their BS, 911 is now 15 years old and MSM still holds. PizzaGate is following the same path the conspiracy researchers will follow this shit for decades, but the MSM will always cover for their elite owners.</p>

<pre><code>I would look closely at Politics and Prose

<p>Search google images for &quot;politics and Prose Presidents&quot; you will see at least 5 presidents have had book signings there and many high ranking officials etc...</p>
<p>Bush, Obama, Carter, Clinton...all love that place...</p>
<hr />
<p>Say there were tunnels?</p>
<p>Say all the arab owed pizza blocks transferred from ( H. Gill/JDC ) in 2003 for free to CON.NEB ( Arab Emigrates Construction Company ) say that all these building are connected, say the purpose was to \'entertain arab elite\'. Say all the tunnels connect to Dupont Circle, then on to the White-House.</p>
<p>If any of this were true, why would they want a public record? Why would they allow anybody to know?</p>
<p>What if Andrew Kline (DOJ) is who we thought he was +40 days ago, before CTR shills told us this theory was debunked.</p>
<p>What if John Podesta &amp; James Alefantis Homosexual relationship was the key in this investigation? Note that Podesta Group is the largest PR agency for Arab\'s in DC, that means the Podesta\'s work personally for the Richest most powerful Arab\'s that come to DC,, why in the hell do you think they would have chosen this firm, unless it offered special services.</p>
<p>All buildings on block are related by the 2003 transfer, and since 2007 Kline/Alefantis ran everything on the block.</p>
<p>Certainly CPP is not HQ because Alefantis needed a nearby front to operate, but would not have wanted his place to be HQ. Most likely the HQ is Politic\'s &amp; Prose, where elite did actually come and go regularly and they held after hours meeting\'s by invitation.</p>
<hr />
<p>If there were tunnels, then they would do it that way because they clearly feel they are above the law.</p>
<p>Obviously, Alefantis has a fascination with tunnels and the DuPont Underground has a bit of a gay scene going on.</p>
<p>If I lived in DC, I would have gone to check them out, but I am not quite close enough.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, these people feel like they are above the law. Saudis buy and sell white girls on Twitter and the slavery of infidels is tolerated in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Nobody asks where they get the young white girls.</p>',

            Regarding the possible Podesta/Alefantis relationship:
           </p>
           <p>
            If true, I could see digging into their "joint business ventures" being a great shield as only the Dem elites would believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            "What, you're investigating this because Podesta and Alefantis are in a relationship? You must be a homophobe! Damn alt-right fake news Russian sympathizers!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, for this sort of relationship to have any element of "convenience", Mary P would likely need to be Claire Underwood-level aware of it, at least.
           </p>

             The homo-sexual relationship shows that they have been essentially married for years, a closet relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fuck anybody that say's queers are sacred. Alefantis went from David Brock to James Podesta, Podesta Brothers are the most powerful PR Lobby for the Arab States in DC.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that John Podesta &amp; James Alefantis are fuck buddy's the past 5+ years shows that during the entire process of pizza blocks that Alefantis was the 'manager' and Podesta/Kiline were the owners, the customer was Saudi, who prefer to FUCK boys in the ASS,
            </p>
            <p>
             Note people this is not about the "HOMO".
            </p>
            <p>
             Men who fuck little boys in the ass are not homo, they are psychopath's.
            </p>
            <p>
             Allow me to correct you then, John Podesta &amp; James Alefantis are in a "Psycho-Pathetic Sexual Relationship", gay they are not
