            Roy Moore portrays himself as a Christian and appeals to Christians with his antics, but he is always about Roy Moore.  I live in AL and have watched him for years.  I find the stories believable based on his sleazy self promoting character.  Christians are too easily duped by pastors and politicians who use religion to get tithes and votes.  Roy Moore's stunt of putting the ten commandments in the courthouse was a political play to the conservative Christians in Alabama, nothing more.  Whether or not the sexual misconduct charges are real, this man is a fake using religion to self promote.

            I'm suspicious of these allegations. The Washington Post, which broke this story, is dishonest and pushes a liberal agenda. The political establishment, which we know protects pedos, is desperate to keep Moore out of office. If he was one of them, they'd embrace him. Also, he's run for office multiple times over the past 40 years, has been vetted each time, and was never accused of child molestation until now when pizzagate is nipping at the heels of the pedos in office. We know the establishment uses the Alinsky technique of accusing your opponent of what you're doing, harming them and then making it look like they're playing tit-for-tat when they accuse you of the crimes you're actually committing. Also, while some of the charges are serious, they're trying to pile on with some that are nonsensical, such as: "Many years ago, he ordered wine while out with an 18-year-old when the drinking age was 19." I'm not saying he's innocent, but we need to know much more before condemning him.

             This may not represent the psychological pedophilia, but rather inappropriate sexual behavior.  Marriage of older men to teenagers was not unusual at the time and is still allowed.  Attempting to date teenagers would not have been perceived as out of bounds.  So the misbehavior is the undressing and sexual contact which at the time would have been perceived as out of bounds regardless of the ages because they were not married.  I have a neighbor here in Alabama who celebrated 50 years of marriage - she married out of state in GA (I think) because she was 15 at the time and didn't have parental consent.  So I don't think this indicative of pedophilia but rather of not following the Christian norm of no sexual contact before marriage.  He might have considered that as long as he didn't have sex (like Bill Clinton) he wasn't doing anything wrong.  This is not to excuse him but to counteract the claim that this can't be true because PEDOS NEVER CHANGE.  I don't think if true it indicates pedophile.  What it indicates to me is what I always thought true of the man he's a hypocrite and HYPOCRITES NEVER CHANGE.

              Alabama	The age of consent is sixteen. With parental consent, parties can marry at age fourteen. However, this parental consent is not required if the minor has already been married. (Other statutory laws apply.) Common law marriage is recognized.

               First the fact that three people have spoken up does not mean that that is every one who he might have approached sexually. 
 You will note in many cases after one woman gets brave enough to speak up others do as well.  That doesn't mean that the brave first one and the inspired following ones are all that were ever abused.  Do you think the few boys that have spoken up about Kevin Spacey or the ones that testified against Dennis Hasstert, or the ones accusing Weinstein are all that they abused?  Come on surely you know better.
Secondly one can be a hypocrite in many areas not just sexual matters.   Such as financial matters with a supposed non-profit....hmmm.

                Moore publicly said that he did not draw a "regular salary" from the organization, yet in October 2017, The Washington Post found that Moore had arranged an annual salary of $180,000 for himself from the foundation.[18] From 2007 to 2012, he collected more than $1 million; a number that far surpasses what the nonprofit declared in its public tax filings.[18] Furthermore, The Washington Post found that Moore arranged the salary, and in 2012 when the charity could not pay his full salary, Moore got a note promising that he would get the salary in back pay or a stake in the assets of the foundation.[18] The foundation also paid for Moore's health-care benefits, travel expenses, and bodyguard, and the foundation's website has regularly promoted Moore's speaking arrangements and book.[18] Furthermore, the foundation employed Moore's wife and at least two of Moore's children.[18] The Washington Post also noted that there was considerable overlap between the charity and Moore's political activities, with previous top officials of the charity leading Moore's 2017 Senate campaign and with the charity using the same fundraising firm as Moore's campaigns.[18]
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) warned the foundation about discrepancies in its tax filings in 2013, saying that the issues "could jeopardize your exempt status".[18] A number of charity and tax law experts have said that the foundation's activities "raised questions about compliance with IRS rules, including prohibitions on the use of a charity for the private benefit or enrichment of an individual".[18] Additional reporting by The Washington Post that October found that the $498,000 that Moore was guaranteed in back pay was not declared to the IRS; tax experts say that it should have been and that Moore would have had to pay more than $100,000 in federal tax.[112]

                To return to the subject at hand, something you seem unable to do, there were four women -- three of which accused him of NOTHING. There is no sexual misconduct in asking a sixteen-year-old out. NOTHING!!!! So WTF are you talking about and why is this an issue? Then, of course, one of the LIARS worked for Joe Biden!!!! Even has a pic taken with him ... how coincidental is that? Here's the freakin' little douchebag posing with the "never met a kid he didn't want to fondle" Biden!!!!

             Just playing Devil's advocate but you could argue that the Spacey situation started out similarly, with only one person coming forward rather than four. But then those of us in the know had heard all the rumours over the years, have seen the Epstein flight logs etc. If they had a clue, the Washington Post would have spread out the accusations to make it look more organic. Another fail for MSM

            With pedos/predators like Slick Willy, Weinstein, Spacey, Sheen, and others, there were all these rumors floating around -- FOR YEARS! People talk ... doesn't matter if they do it with the police. Seems Pedosta or some strategist is thinking again and using this climate to start a smear campaign.

            I am not convinced with this one but I do know that al media had reported Michael Flynn's alleged list of high level pedophiles in the White House, one of whom was supposedly (I would make a great lawyer lol) rumored to be Mike Pence's close friend. 
Perhaps comming indictments..... diversion by Saul Alinsky's playbook??

            Funny how the people on Twitter accusing Republicans of trying to excuse Moore, refer to their outrage over PG, but they make no mention of all the Democrat party paedos and rapists that have been arrested this year. Its like the only sign of anything bad is the PG theory. Deluded, head in the sand, morons.

             And yet no mention of Jacob Schwarts' (Deblasio's right hand man) who was arrested for child porn - when police found video of 6month old baby girl being raped on his laptop. That's 6 MONTH OLD - an age where baby cannot even walk, or feed itself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How about it Mitch, could you report on that?!!! You deep state shill!!! You are not a republican are you, any more than Mccain (photographed with ISIS!!) is a republican - you're Deep State shills!

             Every accusation should be taken seriously, but that doesn't mean every accusation should be believed. There are predators who rape molest, but there are also predators who ruin lives with false accusations or who coach, blackmail, or bribe others to do so.

            I am sorry, but I am not buying this one because of the political drama in this. The Dems and Republican Establishment want him out of Senate. Mitch McConnell spent millions trying to defeat this guy with Luther Strange and the voters soundly  rejected the Establishment's candidate. Moore is not a RINO and believes in Trump. You can't tell me that all the millions spent trying to uncover dirt on Moore they never found this until now? Also, the newspaper this woman went to hates Trump and hates this guy.  Seems like smear job, but only my opinion.

             Ya. How did Washington Post get such an improbable scoop. 30 some odd years after 4 alleged incidents, 4 women bring allegations independent of one another, each telling a similar tale that shames Mr. Moore. Moreove, the 4 different women independently come into contact with Washington Post around the same time. UNBELIEVABLE

              A local Alabama politics reporter said these rumors have circulated for years.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reporters who got this story are women which might have helped the women coming forward feel comfortable.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              It's not that 4 different women approached the Post, I think it's more like as the Washington Post was developing this one story they were trying to find other incidents or corroborating information and heard about these women.  They have 30 sources for their reporting.  Gadsen had 47,000 people back then.  Moore was well known in the town.

               I just don’t have confidence in the abilities of these reporters to get a scoop like this from 4 different women, three decades later.

                Who said the whole town knew?  I said a political reporter heard about them.   He did what a reporter does, he tried to confirm the story and he didn't.   The women talked on the record.  The ability to confirm a scoop is dependent on getting sources to confirm.  It's not more complicated than that.
               </p>
               <p>
                There have been a lot of women coming forward recently to tell their stories.

                He lefty quickly? Is that the story?  He is a Jesuiit. You think  they took a chance at letting an outsider come there? Did he notice the Masonic temple on the Island with the owl? You guys are part of the problem. Yeah, Trump was accidently let there not knowing anything about what they do, and never doing it himself, and left shaken. Pure comic gold. He seems to have recovered and forgot.

             The first way to tell if it is true or not, is to see the sentences more gave the pedos. He is known as the 10 commandments judge, so i suspect that these where harsh sentences.

             No. I think this was s deliberate smear campaign designed to fail. They want it to fail so that they can have an excuse to be slow reporting the pedo  stuff coming out of hollywood. I suspect that we will be seeing tons of fake accusations soon, by expendable pawns(no money to be sued), to discredit the real accusations coming out.

              I agree. I think they know a lot of "respectable" politicians that are going down with accusations of pedophila.  They will say not them they are just being politically smeared. I think this was a brilliant move for the Deep State.

               Depends on the evidence they have, in this case it's decades-old he-said-she-said allegations (not that these are without merit), it's likely there will be e-mail, financial data, maybe even physical evidence and/or videos/photos in the case of Clintons et al

               the problem is that this move destroys a lot of ground that they gained a while back with the"believe the wymin first" bullshit. This gives the usurper movements opportunities to steal what they built.

               That black cube stuff needs to be investigated, this is a huge red flag and a problem for them. I would not be surprised if foreign intel had moved their operations from monitoring US intel agencies, toward monitoring the private intel agencies, because they are more dangerous.

              I noticed you were suddenly using that term a lot suddenly. It is about as nonsensical as saying "revisionist." Shareblue have a seminar a couple of weeks ago or something? Not asking for a friend. Genuinely curious.

              <p>
               If you condemned Anthony Weiner, for sexting with 15 year old, but you defend Roy Moore for actually molesting a 14 year old, that's a classic case of motivated reasoning. You argue both sides of an issue depending on who's ax is getting gored as they say.

              <p>
               Motivated reasoning is familiar to anyone who follows political commentary.   For example when Obama was the president the Republicans pretending they were deficit hawks, now with a Republican president they are pushing a budget that raises it
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The amended House Republican tax plan will increase budget deficits by $1.7 trillion over 10 years, according to the CBO.
It will also cause U.S. debt to rise more than current projections, the CBO said.

                A classic case of motivated reasoning. In time of political hot battle an unproven accusation arises from enemy political camp and motivationally you call it "actually molesting." Read the Alinsky manual again. You made a D minus on this quiz.

                  It is possible that there is a schism between the old guard Bush/Clinton and the new guard Trump/et al
If this is the case they will consider each other the enemy. So in this Moore event the accusation would be flung by an enemy (old guard) at Trump (new guard)

                    As to your new toolbag word "motivated reasoning" neuro linguistic programming jargon, like I said, it is nonsensical usage of the term for those that understand how to think instead of remain stunted in "what to think." According to the definition of "motive" we would be dead without them. My motive for eating is because I am hungry.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    By false association you are associating the word "motive" with the context it is used in court rooms in criminal trials in the determination of guilt or innocence. Your hope is to convince your target that if they have a motive that it must also be attached to an ulterior motive.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Everything we do, other than involuntary bodily functions, is done with a motivating force. Nice try but you can't unleash your neuro linguistic demons into my brainsphere. Not happening.

                     Nonsensical usage?  Psychologists started understanding that emotion affects our reasoning decades ago.  Motivated reasoning as a psychological concept is almost 30 years old.  It's related to confirmation bias which I also mention a lot.   Confirmation bias goes back decades before that.   Confirmation bias is when you seek out or process facts in a way that support a premade conclusion.
                     <br/>
                     It's "the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs."
This can be a unconscious process.    You could say that folks resort to motivated reasoning when facts threaten their premade conclusion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     People have talked about motivated reasoning in the context of politics or conspiracism theorism for probably 10 years.  This may be where I came across, but it's not a new idea to me.  I remember the folks who didn't believe Bin Laden was dead being talked about in terms of motivated reasoning.
