            People that seek power are intrinsically fucked up in the head.  First it's having sex with teenage girls.  Then it's younger girls.  Then they get into sacrificing them to ..."satan"... or whatever.

            We could kill everybody in every government today and within 10 years, the pedophiles would be back in charge.  There are no good men.  There are only good ideas and values.  It's pretty fucking sad.

            Despite Epstein’s 2008 conviction on two felony counts of soliciting underage victims as well as adults for sex that would bring anyone else up to twenty years in federal prison, Epstein was allowed to freely leave jail during the day and only come back for overnight visits at his Palm Beach County Jail for a mere thirteen months of an eighteen month sentence...
           </p>
           <p>
            (This enrages me)
           </p>
           <p>
            Federal prosecutors even violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in allowing a plea bargain agreement for the human trafficking kingpin Epstein without even informing the victims. Obviously their civil rights were violated when prosecutors chose not to try Epstein and company for human trafficking and sex crimes. The current law specifies that human traffickers who also commit aggravated sexual abuse, which of course the guilty parties repeatedly did and much more, stipulates a lifetime prison sentence. Yet a slap of Jeffrey’s hand while allowing everybody else to walk away free is the grossest, most obscene miscarriage of justice possible
           </p>

            (Again, this is outrageous at the least. Money seems to influence the majority of the populace with some sort of power...never understood why people seem to forget their morals because of the influence of fucking cash)

             Money buys personal freedom. But at what cost to others? Look at what we have allowed of governments to get away with. We turned a blind eye to wars that made no sense. Not only that WE paid for it. The slaughter of millions of innocent people is far greater a concern then this. It's only because this repulsed us why we're so offended. How fucking sick is that? We even labelled the brave men who fought back as terrorists. We can't just cherry pick certain areas. It all must go. They must go and we must change with it. Otherwise this will all be for nothing.
