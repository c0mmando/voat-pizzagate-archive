<p>SELLOUT David Icke calls pizzagate researchers &quot;Trolls&quot; who prevent the flow of free information through &quot;abuse&quot;, yet mentions nothing about emails, instagram photos or the media blackout

<p>If you actually watch the video in it\'s entirety you will find that he supports many of the findings researchers have made in recent times and wishes people investigating pizzagate &quot;good luck&quot;.

<p>He does spend the first 10 minutes highlighting the amount of abuse that is directed at people who question certain \'evidence\' which is being dug up, some of which has been debunked btw. I actually agree with what he is saying and the message he is trying to convey. </p>

            David Icke has been exposing this sick shit for decades! Ives read his book The Perception Deception and he goes in to detail about this shit, how all the royals participate and they have eye witnesses l, David has been telling us for years about this. He knows the truth and has been saying it on his World Wide awake Up tour, if some one is here discrediting him their obviousness shills just research what he's been talking about for over a decade
