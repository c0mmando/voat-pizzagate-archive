<p>SELLOUT David Icke calls pizzagate researchers &quot;Trolls&quot; who prevent the flow of free information through &quot;abuse&quot;, yet mentions nothing about emails, instagram photos or the media blackout

<p>he spends an entire 50 minute video calling the pizzagate researchers &quot;trolls&quot; who are suppressing the flow of information</p>

<p>FALSE</p>
<p>If you actually watch the video in it\'s entirety you will find that he supports many of the findings researchers have made in recent times and wishes people investigating pizzagate &quot;good luck&quot;. Watch the end of the video: (<a href="https://youtu.be/KP4z4hF7cTY?t=45m26s">https://youtu.be/KP4z4hF7cTY?t=45m26s)</a>) </p>
<p>He does spend the first 10 minutes highlighting the amount of abuse that is directed at people who question certain \'evidence\' which is being dug up, some of which has been debunked btw. I actually agree with what he is saying and the message he is trying to convey. </p>
<p>Abusing people who are challenging your opinion will never convince them that you are right and goes against what we are fighting for: Censorship.</p>
<p>If anything, by spreading hate and abuse you are working for the people who are trying to cover this up as it gives them ammunition to censor content by for example removing comments from articles or videos which would otherwise allow people to discuss the content in a critical way.</p>
<p>It\'s pretty clear in the responses to the post above that people have not watched the whole video and have taken the posters comments as FACT. This is a really dangerous precedent.</p>

            David Icke has been exposing this sick shit for decades! Ives read his book The Perception Deception and he goes in to detail about this shit, how all the royals participate and they have eye witnesses l, David has been telling us for years about this. He knows the truth and has been saying it on his World Wide awake Up tour, if some one is here discrediting him their obviousness shills just research what he's been talking about for over a decade
