<p>State Policy Trends 2018: With Roe v. Wade in Jeopardy, States Continued to Add New Abortion Restrictions</p>
<p>Over the course of 2018, 15 states adopted 27 new restrictions on abortion and family planning (see chart); 23 of these seek to restrict abortion and the remaining four are aimed at family planning providers. This marks the lowest number of new abortion restrictions enacted in at least a decade.</p>
<p>Although the new restrictions span a wide range of issue areas, bans on some abortions and new reporting requirements for abortion providers are two that showcase the ways states appear to be laying the groundwork for future litigation that would restrict abortion or abolish it entirely.</p>
<p>Iowa’s ban is the most extreme antiabortion measure adopted this year; it would ban abortion at six weeks after the patient’s last menstrual period (LMP), based on the presence of a fetal heartbeat. </p>
<p>Like a similar measure adopted by North Dakota in 2013, enforcement of the law was immediately blocked pending judicial review. Also this year, Louisiana and Mississippi adopted measures banning abortion at 15 weeks LMP. </p>
<p>The Mississippi measure was challenged and in November, a federal district court struck down the ban. </p>
<p>In an unusual approach to drafting legislation, the Louisiana law was written to go into effect only if the Mississippi law was implemented.</p>
<p>Forty-three states have laws in effect that ban abortion at 20 weeks LMP or later, but none of the measures seeking to ban abortion earlier in pregnancy are in effect</p>
<p>Both Kentucky and Ohio enacted measures to ban the most commonly used method of abortion in the second trimester—standard dilation and evacuation. The Kentucky ban was immediately blocked by legal action, the Ohio law is scheduled to take effect in March 2019. Mississippi and West Virginia have similar laws in effect, while comparable laws in six other states (Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas) have been blocked (see Bans on Specific Abortion Methods Used After the First Trimester). As noted above, the case in Alabama has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>
<p>About half the states have long-standing requirements that abortion providers report to state agencies when complications occur (see Abortion Reporting Requirements). In 2018, three states (Arizona, Idaho and Indiana) enacted laws that go well beyond traditional reporting requirements. These laws greatly expand the scope of what is considered an abortion complication to include issues such as subsequent psychological or emotional problems, complications in subsequent pregnancies and later development of breast cancer. These provisions, which are not rooted in scientific evidence, appear to be part of a concerted effort by abortion opponents to build an evidence base to support their contention that abortion is dangerous. </p>
<p>Massachusetts repealed two long-standing abortion restrictions: the state’s pre-Roe abortion ban and a law requiring abortions after 13 weeks LMP to be performed in a hospital.
Washington enacted a comprehensive reproductive health coverage law that requires private insurance coverage of abortion services in plans that also cover maternity care, with the same level of cost sharing as for maternity services.
Louisiana adopted two measures: One exempts medication abortion from the requirements for the disposal of fetal tissue resulting from an abortion, and the other makes coercing someone into having an abortion a crime.
Unfortunately, California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a measure that would have required provision of medication abortion services on public college and university campuses.</p>

            Alyssa is a Hollywood has-been. She isn't good enough to land a roll filmed in anything being filmed in Georgia so she attacks it. Why? She is an attention whore. I fully expect to read one day she deep throats a 9mm and blows the single brain cell she has in her head out on the wall. Her husband has dealings with Harvey Weinstein any way. I guess all the knob jobs she gave Harvey didn't pay off so that's why she is so bitter.

            If one agrees life begins at conception,does one also agree birth control pills are chemical abortions?
Interrupting/preventing anything within the designed reproductive process is a little g god.
Said acts would then be defined as sin correct? There is no big sin,little sin.Sin is sin in God's eyes correct?

             Read Leviticus

            <p>
             Also Matt. 12:32 "32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come"
            </p>
            <p>
             All sin carries the ultimate penalty of an eternity in hell, because all sin is a transgression of the law, but God laid out different physical punishments for different sins (e.g. compare the punishments for theft and adultery) indicating that some are more serious than others.

              Only religion teachs that twisted interpretation.
Sin is Sin and God has not changed position on it,most sin you account for here on earth whether you like it or not.
ALL SIN IS DEATH! watered down theologies don't teach it like the word preach's it.
Find where Jesus said,Away from me,I never knew you. Then read the entire context of it, helps to also study it out.
It will teach you not to make comments like you just did.

               I literally gave you Biblical justification for my stance. I don't know how you think my stance is "watered down" considering I did say that...
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                All sin carries the ultimate penalty of an eternity in hell, because all sin is a transgression of the law
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               ...and I also showed that one does (as you also said) account for one's sins on earth...which is why I pointed you to Leviticus.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's try again. GO READ LEVITICUS and tell me what the penalty for homosexual acts is, and what the penalty for theft is, compare the two, and tell me which is the worse.
              </p>
              <p>
               Frankly, YOU are the one with a watered-down doctrine; the "all sin is sin and all sin is equally bad" docteine leads to "all sin is equally bad, so it doesn't matter what sin I commit; it's all the same!"
              </p>
              <p>
               The Bible itself does not bear out your stance.

              Same thing fuels abortion,sex without consequences,its not about a woman's rights.
Just because she is a female doesnt give her a right to murder another human.
How can a woman carrying a male child say that it is her body when all life has a different DNA.
Pills, condoms,IUD or any other device or drug for preventing pregnancy is the same murder as abortion.
People one day will not have excuses to play, only accountability to stand for.

                   My issue with contraception is that it clouds the truth. Sex is supposed to say "I'm giving my whole self to you." But contraception adds "...except for my power to father a child" or "...except for my fertile ability to mother." That's without any reference to God at all. When you add men and women being made in image of the Creator, it
                   <em>
                    really
                   </em>
                   subverts the meaning of sexual union.

SEX is a man word not found in the Bible because man has corrupted procreation and pleasure as a joined hetro couple.

Contraception is man "attempting" to choose which round hits the target while he attempts sex without consequences (lust).
