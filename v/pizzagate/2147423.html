</p>
<p>This is PizzaGate because it\'s a review of head witch HRC\'s book, and I would appreciate help with analysis of the PG reference.  
</p>
<p>I\'ve been watching this funny libertarian YouTube channel called &quot;ReasonTV,&quot; and he did a video called &quot;We Read Hillary\'s Book so You Don\'t Have To.&quot;  
</p>
<p>While I found it fairly truthful and clever, I wrote a comment about PizzaGate (and the fact HRC helped a pedo get 2 months for raping a 12 year old girl over 30 years ago), then rewatched some of the video and noticed a strange pizza reference that just flew by me the first time.  I swear everything is subliminal programming.  
</p>
<p>I couldn\'t understand him at first, but I heard, &quot;C\'mon (Ron Ham?), even Dominoes owned up to their terrible pizza.  Don\'t be the Papa John\'s of politicians.&quot;  
</p>
<p>I finally figured out he probably means &quot;Rodham,&quot; for Hillary Rodham, but perhaps it actually is a food reference, (or maybe it has backmasking?).  I don\'t know, but he says it weird.  
</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.  The reference starts at 0:54. </p>
<p>[<a href="https://youtu.be/vXMfJhB-S4c">https://youtu.be/vXMfJhB-S4c</a>]</p>
<p>I don\'t believe in coincidences, so I don\'t think it\'s random that he uses a pizza reference in an analysis of HRC\'s book.   
</p>
<p>I thought the channel was thought provoking, but with 256K subscribers, maybe you really do have to sell your soul and let &quot;corporate&quot; insert their sick programming.  
</p>
<p>I bet most people don\'t even notice how they participate in the system.  They probably think it\'s a stupid line to add into the video, but hey, it\'s just a pizza reference, whatever, sure I\'ll add that stupid thing to my project for extra money.  Like product placement.. </p>
<p>I also had a thought that &quot;Dominoes&quot; and &quot;Papa John\'s&quot; might be code words, possibly for trafficking rings or like warring factions of trafficking rings?  
</p>
<p>When he said Dominoes &quot;owned up to their terrible pizza,&quot; it almost sounded like a diss to someone\'s PG ring to me.  Just an idea.  
</p>
<p>Thanks for any thoughts and feedback.</p>
<p>ETA:  
</p>
<p>At 4:11, there\'s a Hillary Book called &quot;It Takes a Village&quot; with children on the cover.  Those children are probably PG victims, and we should use facial recognition or something to try to identify them.  
</p>
<p>The cover of the book has a city that almost looks like twin towers with one smaller?  Does anyone recognize the architecture on the building on the right?  I see Monsanto spraying in the upper left and maybe more spraying on the right?  The road with a school bus almost looks like a Christian fish symbol?  See anything else?</p>',

            You dumbfuck.  Of course the attacked always claim persecution.  A child will cry when YOU reprimand HIM to get sympathy.  YOU FUCKING IGNORE THAT SHIT.

            If your position is we must lie about who's to blame because women won't go for it, THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO LIE BUT TO TAKE AWAY WOMENS SAY IN THE MATTER.
           </p>

            Your position is that it's not Jews, it's their identical twins.  Fucking STUPID.

            Then in the US they achieve such a level of integration and influence in education and media that the natives cannot contemplate an ETHNIC conspiracy, especially since Jews pass as "white".  This is the situation we are now in, and why naive women making decisions is a huge obstacle.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why ALL THEY DO, OPENLY AND PROUDLY, is destroy what holds the white majority together: its codes of behavior and natural racial solidarity.

            You don't even have to bring religion into it. (Israel couldnt give a shit if you are an atheist Jew or not.)

            I will.  They have high average IQs.  Their propaganda skills are second to none.  I even give them the benefit of the doubt that they do this as a GROUP SURVIVAL STRATEGY rather than evil.

            I can't believe that is the entire basis of your pushing this garbage theory.  And I don't.  And you keep dodging easy question, every single one posed. Which makes you a kikeshill faggot, period.  Everything you just said is so retarded :

            Jesus, you are beyond hope.  So all the times in the past where the Jews AS A GROUP -- their natural modus vivendi -- were cast out due to sacrificing gentile children, not only were the authorities mistaken or cruel to do so, but the result was NO DECREASE in missing children.  That's what you're arguing, and it's preposterous.  Shouldnt I as the part-Jew be looking for bullshit excuses? Wtf is wrong with you people?

            Because he's a spineless piece of shit?  The real question is why a 22-YO FAT JEWESS would save a cum-stained dress.

            We have long established that they use Egyptian and Hellenic mythology.  That doesn't make it any less of a Kabbalist Jewish cult.

            You don't need to understand the motivation behind a crime to even execute the culprit.

           <p>
            So you agree about the effects and the cause, but can't stomach the corrective measures, hoping to whittle the number down to the dozens no doubt. Exactly what I accuse y'all of.

            That would be nice filler for a book-length work, perhaps.  We all know the as abve so below backwards thing.  It is very uninteresting.

            By going further than Jews you make a huge mistake and render your contributions completely worthless.  This isn't amateur historian sub.  We deal with the HERE AND NOW.

           <p>
            Christians were wary of Jews until TEN MINUTES AGO -- completely in line with their control of media and immigration to the US beginning last century.  Not that I took your post very seriously; I'm not sure how much is a joke, like the "it" stuff.  Looking for proof in human language, which are in a constant state of flux, is the dumbest folly one could make -- that's partly what makes the Kabbalist readings of their texts ridiculous imo.

            Shills or not libertarianism is a ticket to NOWHERE -- it's a Jewish trick to split the right-wing movement.

            ALL conservative/libertarian Jews push mass immigration and try to tell you that ten million Africans could come and would assimilate and embrace the Constitution etc etc.

            TOTAL BULLSHIT and they know it.

            The last red pill to take is that PG is just a symptom of their control, not the purpose for it, and that those of European stock are being replaced in an intentional genocide.  That is the fight of our time and the only line drawn is that between those who understand and those who don't.
