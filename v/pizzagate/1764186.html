            Superb research!
           </p>
           <p>
            From the link on the Fourth Sex (the Chapman brothers' coauthored book found in the Michael Jackson paraphernalia) -
           </p>
           <p>
            "On the fourth page of the report — the first page of the leaked document, which is missing the report’s first three pages — the Sheriff’s Department says it found a copy of The Fourth Sex: Adolescent Extremes  among Jackson’s possessions. The book includes work by the artists Jake and Dino Chapman, Vanessa Beecroft, Raymond Pettibon, Mike Kelley, Elizabeth Peyton, Karen Kilimnik, Charles Ray, Takashi Murakami, Larry Clark, Rineke Dijkstra, Paul McCarthy, Richard Prince, Gilbert &amp; George, Gavin Turk, and Richard Billingham. According to the report, the art and pornographic material found on Jackson’s property displayed a mix of sexual orientations and types."

            This ^ is JEWISH philosophy, BTW.

            Huge Upvoat for you. For new researchers that are unaware "modern art" was created by CIA who was created by something even more sinister we have yet to get to. "Brut Art" or victim or therapeutic art is what Is seen in the Podesta home are not "art" but actual victim portrayals of SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is shocking to most because these are not images that come to ones mind unless seen or experienced. They should be shocking.
           </p>
           <p>
            For these "artists" like Chapman to be supported by HRC &amp; ilk then want to help refugees. Red Flag.

             Thanks, Jem777.  I had been sitting on this info since January. In truth I am pretty cautious when it comes to making claims against people, unlike what Armyseer says.  His shilling is a great indicator for leads though!

             It is possible that Jake Chapman gave to a legitimate group in order to clean up his image. Still, anything Jake Chapman gives money to that involves children should be on the radar, in my opinion.
