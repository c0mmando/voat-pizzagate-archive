The Attorney General stands by; the President is awakened ready to go on television; because it is a written and unwritten law that &quot;foreign terrorists&quot; on the soil of the United States should they dare commit a crime; should they dare to contemplate a kidnapping or the murder of an innocent child or American citizen or any visitor to the United States; that unleashes the full might and power of the United States of America, no matter what it takes or how long it takes.</p>
<p>This was a child of a Lockheed Martin executive of a $18 billion a year firm with Pentagon and top secret clearance across the world. </p>
<p>With this huge multi-million dollar security apparatus that exists for that day that any member of a family of a corporate executive; any member, wife, child of corporate executive\'s family should be kidnapped; they go into overdrive. That\'s when they earn their money and itâ€™s when they face the CEO\'s in Denver, and that\'s where they say &quot;here\'s where Lockheed Martin stands: your children can or cannot go to school; your wives can or cannot go to the market&quot;. An entire protocol unfolds. The interface between the head of Lockheed Martin Security and the FBI is elaborate and its interlocking and its complete.
So the two units, in the Boulder Area, are trained to react to an act of terrorism, like kidnapping, are Lockheed Martin Security on one hand and the FBI on the other. Now, NOBODY FROM EITHER TWO OF THESE UNITS CAME NEAR THAT CRIME SCENE and the question is as in the case of Sherlock Holme\'s dog that didn\'t bark. What you\'re looking at here is SOMETHING THAT IS SO IRREGULAR; SO IMPOSSIBLE, because remember, the SOG, the seat of government operates in this regard.</p>
<p>When a note announces &quot;terrorism&quot; it is the magic word in the United States for both law enforcement and budgetary considerations. So that if you say you didn\'t believe that note nor believe there were foreign terrorists, then you are dealing with a madman who is signing himself or herself as foreign terrorist and intends to get some &quot;fat cats&quot;. So what difference does it make whether these are foreign terrorists or a madman pretending to be foreign terrorists? You still have the most alarming situation. In the FBI bureaucracy this called &quot;a special&quot;.</p>
<p>For the Director of the FBI in Washington, D.C. to restrain and stand down his own agents in the field; both the local office in Boulder and the bigger one in Denver or Lockheed Martin and their agents, without going to the crime scene, and being able to reassure their CEO\'s in Denver that they can stand down; their children can go to the park; their wives can go to the bridge club;----for these assurances to be made on which careers and budgets and lifetimes depend, there can only be one answer. They had to know, not only were there no foreign terrorists, but they had to know BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT that what happened neither affected the security of the United States of America or the security and profits of Lockheed Martin. That this was a domestic personal aberational crime of some kind or in any case a crime which, though located inside a home, may have repercussions outside in terms of circles of people who would not want investigations going on about child pornography, child abuse, or child sexuality.
I\'ve summed up for you what a year of research has led me to.&quot;</p>

<p>Little JonBenet bore all the hallmarks of ritual abuse. This is what Stephen Singular had to say about the case:</p>
<p>&quot;I had gone online and looked at pictures of little girls, five and six-year-olds, the same age as JonBenet, who were being used for child pornography purposes. They were being tied up by their hands and ankles and being sexually abused, or laid out on tables or hung from ceilings. They were being treated violently, and ropes, scarves, and belts were used to tie them up. These photographic situations looked very similar to the conditions surrounding the death of JonBenet, who was strangled to death with a piece of nylon rope&quot;</p>
<p>Also note the similarities with the \'art\' for which Podesta has a penchant--where little girls are hung from ceilings with ropes.
<a href="http://www.crime-research.org/interviews/484/">http://www.crime-research.org/interviews/484/</a></p>
<p>Nancy Krebs came forward. She was proven to have family links to John Ramsey\'s best friends.  She gave police statements that she had suffered the same kind of abuse that JonBenet had suffered. Nancy had been passed around to be raped by grown men, some of them influential and powerful.  JonBenet was found dead just after Christmas.  Nancy Krebs had said that was one of the favoured times of the rapists, as bruises would heal before school started.  Nancy also said that the head was one of the places where the children would be hit, because the bruises would not be seen under the hair.   Nancy said that these grown men would tie a scarf, tie or rope around the victim\'s neck. The victim would be strangled until they started to choke and moan from lack of air.  This, in the perpetrators\' minds, would resemble orgasm.  It\'s call sexual asphyxiation.   Nancy\'s life was threatened several times.</p>

            Abel Danger on You Tube has theory that Jon Benet's father was working on IT for the Clinton blackmail spying system.  That the father was going to be a whistleblower and his daughter killed to force him to stop talking.  That would explain why it seemed the mother Patsy wrote the ransom note.  It isn't a proof but an interesting hypothesis. The father did work in IT.

            I recently met a woman from boulder.  She revealed her daughter had dated a few billionaires and knew firsthand that jon benet was a ritual sex abuse death, after I brought up pizzagate.  We then had a falling out, I had pressed her for more details asking her about Nancy Krebs, but she wouldn't say anymore.
