<p>WASHINGTON - Don\'t tell Malia and Sasha, but President Obama visits Disney World on Thursday. The White House says it\'s pure business as he\'ll deliver a speech on plans to boost the economy by promoting tourism and travel in the United States.</p>
<p>The White House says Mr. Obama will &quot;unveil a strategy&quot; as part of his &quot;We Can\'t Wait&quot; series of Executive Branch actions he can take without Congressional approval.</p>

Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is an American lawyer and writer. She is married to the 44th and former President of the United States, Barack Obama, and is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. </p>
<p>She appeared in the Jessie episode &quot;From the White House to Our House&quot;, Nashville, and in the Doc McStuffins episode &quot;Doc McStuffins Goes to Washington&quot;. She was mentioned in the MECH-X4 episode Versus Traeger. </p>
<p>SO We have plenty of proof that the Obamas AND MIchelle have connections to Disney and that Michelle has definite connections to ABC-TV
as well.</p>
<p>I am not submitting  this post to get involved in the back and forth about Roseanne and the Now Infamous VJ Tweet.  I am hoping to get to the bottom of whether MICHELLE Obama has the power to cancel the TV Show of someone that Tweets about a close confidant and friend of the Obamas.</p>
<p>IMO, this sets a Very Dangerous Precedent.</p>',

               Yeah, I am sick of hearing about all of them.  Selling their own down the river.  Disgusting beyond words.  But people make so much about it when Blacks and Hispanics sell their own when Whites are doing the same forever too.  Yeah, so the truth is there are people that will sell their own Mother in every race. There are no words or names bad enough for them.

            If she did get show cancelled, makes Malia's Weinstein internship that much creepier. 
So Michelle has credibility and power in Hollywood  but chose donations to Hillary's campaign instead of having Harvey Rapenstein "cancelled"

             MaliaObs internship with Weino Creepo was VERY WEIRD TIMING. I can't work it out. Of all the times for that fat fuck to be called on his grossness, it happened right at the end of her job experience.
Something v v weird about that.

               hell yes. Doesnt EVERYTHING make sense now?
              </p>
              <p>
               Isn't EVERYTHING starting to fall into place? Just a little, LOL.  ALSO huge coicidence that Rosie goes down just as Weiny is getting arraigned in NY. Was she the first name he gave in return for shaving few years off his future sentencing?  Wonder what those Roseanne kids (Sara Gilbert etc) had to deal with growing up on set. Kinda same timeline as Sparkles being on set of Married With....as a young kiddiewink too, right?

               Only reason he's not had a "heart attack" so far is because he probly has little black book with his attorney of pedowood names and incidents if anything happens to him, as collateral.  LOL

                thats what puzzles me

               <p>
                he is connected no doubt
               </p>
               <p>
                and am sure he has insurance
               </p>
               <p>
                so whats really going on?
               </p>
               <p>
                Paltrow worked with him, Pitt was upset with him, and what does she do?
               </p>
               <p>
                she steals a script from Wyonna Ryder, her good friend, knowing who she has to go through for Shakespear movie,  many pics of her and weinstein, she gets Oscar,
               </p>
               <p>
                She joins board of Robin Hood, which Weinstein on board
               </p>
               <p>
                then she comes out Me Too
               </p>
               <p>
                Ashley Judd?  SMH  her acting and how she got movies are questionable, besides, did you hear her speach at womans march?
               </p>
               <p>
                she comes out Me Too, next thing you know, she has a part in  a TV show
               </p>
               <p>
                I still wonder about that movement, and why Weinstein?
               </p>
               <p>
                most of hollywood producers guilty
               </p>
               <p>
                not saying he not guilty, but
               </p>
               <p>
                why him?

                 Paltrow daddy, TV Director Bruce Paltrow gave me pedo vibes. Died young. Another one who took shit to the grave either him.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I really really think he tried to mess with Malia. His takedown was a few weeks after her internship ended. Daddy O called the goon squad, and bye, kaput Weiny + half of Pedowood. TOO MUCH of a coincidence, timing wise, for it not to be. Or as massive distraction to the REAL pedowood perps.

                 Agree. It's all contrived for some reason. Not saying he isn't guilty, but they are ALL guilty. So why him and why now?

            Nothing shocks me any more. I had never been big into politics or tv, but somehow I feel raised to have been on a path to be Red pilled. Despite my grandparents being deep into Masonry, we're talking my GPA was a Striker, Grandma OES and Worthy Matron. I cannot say how lucky I am to avoid tv, and get my 'news' from here. My SO was talking to me years ago about the NSA and it went in one ear and out the other. Now I question everything and don't know what to make of things when the tabloids have more truth than MSM. Here is to digging and hopefully contributing worthwhile content.

             You sure are lucky!  Many have not been and have been dragged into it too.  I was always very inquisitive and wanted to know the reason for everything.  Drove my parents nuts.  Can't have been too bad they are still alive at 90 &amp; 91!   I still watch my local news and I always know the big stories the night before here on voat!  I like to see what they are lying about.  Stay grounded.  And keep on voat.  We are the best truth tellers around.  All must be sourced.

                who needs cable when you have local news! Obviously depends where you live. Sounds like for most of us, local news is 100% better than cable, LOL :)

                 A friend came over and said what are you watching and I said The Nanny (only sitcom I watch)  and she said I have cable and I don't gt it.  I said you don't need cable for news, watch the local news.  What she said?  So really I can't believe it for the price of cable you don't even get all the other channels.  What A Bleeping Rip Off.   I have seen some amazing things on local news.

               What do you think of this   I think there is something to dig in here.  Geffen.  Manuel Lin Miranda etc.  I hate to uncover DVD but if he is part of it so be it.  Remember the Blind about his brother Jerry?  Implying he raped his daughter.  Family abuse?
Miranda I believe is caught up in all of it.  His mother is involved somehow and he has been doing ads for vaccines.

                 DVD is in his 90s and he is married to I think a woman around 40.  Hmm.  He can't marry a minor so ...............just thinking. Lin Miranda had the really Big Broadway Hit, Hamilton.  There are rumors he may be gay but he and his wife just had a baby son.  God these people.    Yes,  Twink-le Twink-le  Little Stars.

             TY. These people are using their power to decide what we see.  OK, this is a TV Program but what about the News.  We know they have that kind of power and the need to Be Called Out On It.

                well look at Harvey Weiney after coming on to Malia (which is no doubt what happened.) He got worse than simple bullet to the chest.

                 There must have been something Really Big to get them that ticked off and now since we know what kind of power MO has with Disney and ABC, well I think it sure is possible that he did something Really Big.  To Malia.  After all she must have been in the vicinity of HW at some point.  Yes, I am convinced.

             Typical troll. Throw around insults but nothing of substance to back up what they say. Yawn

             Tying her/him to ABC is not a joke.  It does not matter all the other psyop garbage.  This should not be in the power of any of the Obamas.  Since TV is also connected to our journalism stations, it is a form of Freedom of Speech.  This is not a joke.  You are entitled to your opinion.  It is not meant as a Fluff Post.

              he just stated his opinion, so best to ignore if you don't agree as there is no other message apart from that feel related to this posting, so why even this comment is here when its related to entire sub, also if something is a joke, I guess he is having fun or what is he doing here?
