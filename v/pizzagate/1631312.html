<p>Clauses 12 and 45 are the real standouts! (From the Pizzagate.Wiki: Remember, these claims were all made in a legal complaint by Jared Paul Stern, under penalty of perjury. No such perjury charges were ever brought, and both FBI and US Attorney\'s Office investigations against Jared Paul Stern would be dropped, as discussed in the complaint itself)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>12 - During the past few years, Defendant Burkle, a powerful, politically connected billionaire who socializes with celebrities and carries on sexual liaisons with fashion models, some of whom are under the age of consent, became increasingly upset at what he perceived as unflattering coverage in the New York Post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>45 - By manufacturing the scandal aimed at incriminating Mr. Stern, Defendants Burkle, [Frank] Renzi, [Mike] Sitrick, and the Clintons hoped to divert and intimidate journalists who might attempt to report on their illegal activity or publish embarrassing revelations of Burkle and Bill Clinton\'s sexual misconduct, including Clinton\'s extramarital affairs facilitated by Burkle, and sexual activity with minors, and even more importantly dissuade negative coverage of the numerous scandals that have been attributed and which will undoubtedly be uncovered about Hillary Clinton as she runs for the presidency in 2008.</p>

<p>And also we heard alleged former Epstein alleged friend Ron Burkle is Danny A\'s backer on every club he opens and Burkle does that to harvest pretty young things then flies them to L.A. and allegedly sells them to Epstein and alleged movie-producer Steve &quot;Bing Laden&quot; Bing and it is this cabal of partying hedonists that has prevented the piece from running!</p>

            Christianity  is the religion with blatant pedophilia and child abuse getting covered up at the highest levels. I've actually never heard one story about this happening at a mosque. But those catholic priests....

            My blood was boiling the other night, and if i mischarectarized  you I do apologize. I am not a huge fan of David seamen but I consider him harmless and I know I could not do what he does. The fake news labels, the attacks on investigators reputations, the effort to keep the conversation focused on rumor and innuendo rather than just clearing the air and dealing with the facts alleged in the pizzagate investigations it's is so transparent and manipulative! there is so much corruption to be looked into, who cares if David seamen needs to earn a living, the Clinton foundation is the real problem. I just could not stand by and lurk this time. I wish I could help more aside from the ocassional upvoat, and there are real threats to these reporters and investigators some have even died. These pedofiles are the most evil scumbags that need to be wiped out and exterminated. I have been labeled a shill as well before, it happens they are wolfs in sheeps clothing sometimes the wrong people get labeled.  At least you know I would speak up defend you if they come attacking :) it's not much but it's all I can do from time to time!

            I worked in Hollywood and there was always this big rumor that Joe Jackson was arrested for molesting his children... instead of putting him in jail, he prostituted his own children to Hollywood... they gave Joe Jackson a steady stream of whores while they raped his own children... Michael was DEFINITELY the victim of abuse and it would not surprise me if victims in turn become abusers... Pretty much every celebrity is "bred" into this... Madonna and Angelina Jolie are both cousins to Hillary Clinton etc... Another OBVIOUS victim of child sexual abuse is Nancy Pelosi... her wide eyes have seen things our minds cannot comprehend. I saw her once in California, she was so fucking nervous constantly looking like someone was out to get her. Perma-fear on her face. The politicians use actors/models/singers/dancers as their personal picking grounds... Remember the video of the first President Bush going to the set of Desperate Housewives and caught on video groping Terri Hatcher?

             Bush Sr. looks like a jerk. He knows he can get away with it.  I don't think she was expecting his groping.

            The Wiki is growing very nicely and we need more content like this, presented very well and connects a lot of different puzzle pieces.

            The shills that were on here the other day were all making a coordinated effort to trash David seamens reputation. This was the night the police cars were parked in front of his house. IIit seemed very coordinated and scripted. This posting makes it clear that they use this technique to try to discredit journalists rather than address the the facts. Great posting! Upvoat.

             Even in the Epstein case, with Nadia Marcinkova, you see the abused become the abusers. Really sad stuff.

            Appears he and the Clintons had a falling out as he backed Kasich in the run for POTUS.
