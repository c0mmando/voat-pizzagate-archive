<p>I met this guy and had been keeping in touch with text regarding a business matter. He said he had to go because his girlfriend was sick and he sent me this pic. Upon close inspection it shows a woman bound and gagged and a plastic sheet under her.</p>

            Youre getting trolled. If you reverse image search hard enough youll find its from some porno. If it was real it the image wouldnt be used on 2 million results

            someone did something like this recently, and sent it to their friend or mom or something, and police showed to find it was a sick joke- from what i recall those shots were inside the bathtub, but not positive .... someone should be able to find this and put this to rest....not funny

            Why don't you just text him and ask what the pic is all about?  Doing business with a complete stranger?  Ask him who he is first, contact details, business references, that sort of thing.  Find some pretext to phone him, ask if he's on linkedin etc - He possibly sent the pic by mistake and doesn't even realize he sent it to you.

            Yeah, a poor taste at humor on that guys part. You did what you thought was right. I don't know if you are still in contact with him, but I wouldn't doubt LE has already contacted him.
They always seem to cause the most unnecessary amount of grief. They can be covert for everything else, but when you are leary about calling in the first place.😏

            Well, I won't look for it for you, but the best place for you to find information about the image is 4chan.org/b/. That is almost certainly where the image came from. Your acquaintance's comments sound similar to common troll comments. Users on the site often share disturbing images such as this among each other. Most of these cellphone pictures do not have a permanent presence on the internet, but rather have a transient presence as different users who have saved the image from 4chan repost it to the site occasionally. Each thread is temporary, so no permanent public record of most of the images on /b/ is available for reverse image search. You will probably have to post the image to /b/ and ask if anyone knows anything about it, or lurk and see if it pops up on any threads which look topical.
