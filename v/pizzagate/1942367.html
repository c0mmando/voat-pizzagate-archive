<p>I met this guy and had been keeping in touch with text regarding a business matter. He said he had to go because his girlfriend was sick and he sent me this pic. Upon close inspection it shows a woman bound and gagged and a plastic sheet under her.</p>
<p>So I called the FBI Human Trafficking Division, waited close to half an hour to file my report. When I filed the report, they did not even want to see the image [I guess having low level report takers must get expensive when you have to murder them for seeing shit they are not supposed to see?].</p>
<p>A few days later someone called me back and said their analysts had reviewed my information and that they would like me to file a local report with my police department. [Even though I had explained to them the guy was not local to me and I did not know what city he was in]</p>
<p>I followed their instructions and waited over an hour and a half to file a report with my local police. Within hours they determined it was &quot;a poor attempt at a joke&quot; and that the guy had sent me a photo he got from the Internet. I didn\'t ask for or receive any details of that claim or how they verified it &quot;over the phone&quot;.</p>
<p>I still have an unsettled feeling about this, so I did a reverse image search on Google and I have so far been unable to locate the photo on the internet. Google is doing something weird, however, and showing me a ton of results with a thumbnail of the image I uploaded, mostly videos. But when I look through the videos I am not seeing this girl or this situation.</p>
<p>You guys have gotten very good at this sort of thing, so maybe you could review? I would be &quot;happy&quot; if this could be confirmed that the image was already on the Internet and the girl is OK or at least this has already been investigated.</p>
<p>I don\'t find the humor in the &quot;joke&quot; - but hey, i\'m not a fucking Sociopath.</p>',

            Youre getting trolled. If you reverse image search hard enough youll find its from some porno. If it was real it the image wouldnt be used on 2 million results

            someone did something like this recently, and sent it to their friend or mom or something, and police showed to find it was a sick joke- from what i recall those shots were inside the bathtub, but not positive .... someone should be able to find this and put this to rest....not funny

            Why don't you just text him and ask what the pic is all about?  Doing business with a complete stranger?  Ask him who he is first, contact details, business references, that sort of thing.  Find some pretext to phone him, ask if he's on linkedin etc - He possibly sent the pic by mistake and doesn't even realize he sent it to you.

            Yeah, a poor taste at humor on that guys part. You did what you thought was right. I don't know if you are still in contact with him, but I wouldn't doubt LE has already contacted him.
They always seem to cause the most unnecessary amount of grief. They can be covert for everything else, but when you are leary about calling in the first place.😏

            Well, I won't look for it for you, but the best place for you to find information about the image is 4chan.org/b/. That is almost certainly where the image came from. Your acquaintance's comments sound similar to common troll comments. Users on the site often share disturbing images such as this among each other. Most of these cellphone pictures do not have a permanent presence on the internet, but rather have a transient presence as different users who have saved the image from 4chan repost it to the site occasionally. Each thread is temporary, so no permanent public record of most of the images on /b/ is available for reverse image search. You will probably have to post the image to /b/ and ask if anyone knows anything about it, or lurk and see if it pops up on any threads which look topical.

              Back in the day, yes. I haven't paid much attention to /b/ itself since my college days. The other, what would they be called, communities? The other subsections of 4chan have more consistently entertaining content.
