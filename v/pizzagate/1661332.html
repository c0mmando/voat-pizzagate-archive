            Satanic jew filth named Freud are trying to set up this family, and a few of their jew shills are here on this thread. Never hesitate to smash the skull of a jew pedo maggot. Their religion teaches them it's OK to rape small children.

            The Pedostas and the Freuds who are the people that killed Madeleine are going after her parents, and using their homosexual pedo jew satanist "news" outlets like CNN to do it. I really hope these pedo scum the Pedostas and the Freuds, are shot in the head by vigilantes soon. Anyone at talmudic mafia homosexual pedo CNN is also fair game.

            Probably she was being pimped out and the PedoÂ´s got rougher...or Podesta liked the look of her and decided to keep her.

            They rented their daughter for sex parties then they either sold her to the Podestas or they were shocked to see that she was taken without their permission. Either way the parents belong in prison. They should have been arrested 10 years ago when it happened and kept in prison until they decided to tell the truth. The only legal action should be mom and dad finally getting arrested. They know exactly who took Maddy and what happened to her. I hope they burn in hell.

            Unfortunately here in Britain they've done all they can to supress the findings of the police. 
The McCanns did not join in the search for Madeleine that first night she was missing. They left the sliding door to the apartment unlocked, even though they were not using it to enter the house. Kate later recalls that she was worried that someone had tried breaking in the night before yet leaves the door unlocked. She tells the police that the shutters have been forced open as the point of entry, yet police find no evidence of forced entry, and only one set of prints on the shutters. Kate McCanns.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there is the smell of cadaver in the apartment and on Kate McCanns clothes, on Madeleine's toy and pyjamas and in their rental car. Blood in the car and apartment. The complete lack of physical evidence of anyone having broke in or been in the apartment other than the McCanns. Witnesses possibly seeing Gerry carrying a child toward the sea. The initial lies of Kate to the police and the fact she refused to answer their questions. The changing story of their friends of what happened that night. Their complete lack of emotion in appeals for her return. 
Madeleine died in the apartment, accidentally or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think it's about time people stop linking the Podesta brothers to Madeleine as that identikit is of the same person and looks a lot like Gerry McCann. The only 'proof' that the Podesta brothers are connected, unless anyone can find anything else, is from FBIanon. They are supposed friends of a well known pedo that lived in the area, ex-MP Clement Freud, and were using his house at the time of the abduction. However I can not find any more information except for what FBIanon has said. The emails did start the day after the 'abduction' but that could be a coincidence.

             When the podestas provide an alibi they will be discounted until then they have remained silent probably in anticipation of having anything they say used against them, it's called the Miranda rights in the us. Their silence is one of the most telling clues to their guilt. The misdirection of the fake news label is as well. They are clearly avoiding a frank discussion. That is NOT typical of someone who has nothing to hide.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the most common tactics of a defense attorney is to provide an alternate perpetrator in order to create reasonable doubt. Just as you are trying to put the entire blame on the McCanns based on a cadaver dog, and their silence during the investigation. The next tactic that a defense attorney will use is to eliminate evidence from the case in order to create reasonable doubt.  Just as Hillary clinton when defending the child rapist had the DNA discredited by an expert. And then laughed about it on record.
            </p>
            <p>
             The cadaver dog indicates a dead body. It could be madekines or it could be someone else was used in a ritual murder, that is not far fetched when you consider the network they all associate with. They also have a ritual called a changeling ritual which involves
Kid napping. You jump from cadaver dog to requesting the forum stop looking into podesta. The mcanns seem complicit and so do the podestas. I will say that the podestas which have spent millions trying to clear their name through a shilling campaign. I really hope that is not what you are doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unless the podestas can conclusively explain artwork and email codes, the unbelievable number of friendships with other pedofiles, the artwork on display, the death of so many key opponents, AND provide an alibi they currently remain the main suspects. if the parents are guilty  throw them in the list but it iS NOT one or the other....you cannot eliminate evidence just to fit your theory. Your argument needs to be evidence based.

              I never said stop looking into Podesta. Typical of some of you on this forum who misrepresent suggestions when it doesn't make the Podestas out to be involved in every crime imaginable.

             <p>
              I am 100% convinced the Podestas are pedos and possibly cannibals. Nowhere do I say that he's not. I'm saying that the evidence in the McCann case points to her death in the apartment. There is no evidence  but the word of FBIanon to suggest the Podestas are even friends with Clement Freud, the pedo who lived in the area. Focus on what we know and stop unnecessarily accusing them of crimes that there is no evidence they are involved in. The identikit photos of the McCann 'abductor' is used in a lot of people's summary of the case against the Podestas and it makes the rest of it look ridiculous. Just as calling it pizzagate when it's more than one pizza place.

              And don't call me a shill when you can't even read my post properly.

               I apologize if you thought I called you a shill. I assure you I did not, believe me I am not above saying that directly.  I will say I hope you were not shilling for the podestas. Trust me I have no patience lately for shills. Now I will paste you own words as to why I thought you said to stop looking into podesta:
              </p>
              <p>
               "I also think it's about time people stop linking the Podesta brothers to Madeleine as that identikit is of the same person and looks a lot like Gerry McCann. The only 'proof' that the Podesta brothers are connected, unless anyone can find anything else, is from FBIanon. They are supposed friends of a well known pedo that lived in the area, ex-MP Clement Freud, and were using his house at the time of the abduction. However I can not find any more information except for what FBIanon has said. The emails did start the day after the 'abduction' but that could be a coincidence."
              </p>
              <p>
               The theory that it is one person is faulty. It is two different witnesses that each saw an individual. This might reflect a separate time frame that each one saw, or it might reflect a different line of sight. This is not known. So we cannot speculate. The evidence is a corpse in the apt and the trunk. The EFIT that matches the two brothers who do not bear a resemblance to each other maybe gerry McCann. The parents were uncooperative and remain suspects. The friendship with clement freud remains questionable and needs explanation. It also connects all of them. Now podestas have not provided an alibi. Instead they have remained silent. You or I do not have access to customs so we cannot verify nor exclude the podestas. Unless they provide an alibi they remain prime suspects. They have been placed at the scene by two witnesses. That the witnesses say they saw one person may be accurate one brother might have been looking out or starting the car while the other carried the baby. Was she alive ? Speculation. Were the parents involved? Very likely!
So far the facts tell me the podestas are avoiding this and are desperate to create misdirection, including putting the full blame on the mcann's. Typical when a group of criminals get caught. The police need to do their job and the podestas need an alibi. Plain and simple. They refuse to provide one. Please explain that to me. It's premature to eliminate a lead based on speculation.  There remains over those two brothers a giant question mark and a ton of incriminating circumstantial evidence....and worse right now they are laughing because they know that they got away with it. And they will do it again and again!

                I've been collating my research into one post for release tomorrow. I've looked into your claims and I actually now can't exonerate the Podestas either. I found another link beside Fbi anon that links the Podestas to Freud and also the accusations of sexual abuse by the McCanns friends.
               </p>
               <p>
                I never considered the idea that Madeleine could have died in the room after been abused or was taken by the Podestas at the behest of the McCanns which would explain the cadaver smell and blood in the car they rented weeks later. They'd gotten the body back.

             According to the police investigation, she died in the apartment and the abduction was staged. 
She either died accidentally, possibly hitting her head after waking up when the parents weren't there, or Gerry killed her, unable to take all her crying. In home video and interviews he likes to bring up his need for quiet. They drugged their kids to make them sleep, and when asked to describe Madeleine he likes to mention how loud she was. Very rarely do the parents describe their child negatively when they are missing.

               I've been looking into that as well. It was either the mother or son. Both cases have no proof of anyone else being at the scene, evidence of staging and abnormal emotive reactions from the parents.

              <p>
               The accusations were brought by a couple of friends that spent their holidays with part of the group in the summer of 2005 â themselves also English doctors. Twelve days after the British girl disappeared, Katherina and Arul could no longer keep the secret that had bothered them for two years and went to the police to make a statement. They revealed two conversations between
               <strong>
                Dave and Gerry
               </strong>
               , during which both revealed suspicious behaviour and indiciated sex with minors.
              </p>

             <p>
              ...
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The first one happened on a night when Gerry and Dave were talking about Maddie. Katherina does not know what they were saying but she remembers that Dave sucked on his fingers, pushing them into the mouth and pulling them out again, while his other hand traced a circle around the nipple, with a circular movement over the clothes. âThat was done in a provocative mannerâ, recalls Katherina, who says that it stuck to her memory.
Days later, the scene repeated itself. The doctor saw Dave making the same gestures again, while he talked about his own daughter. Scared, Katherina said nothing about the incident. But she took special caution, asking her husband never to let the doctor come close to the bathroom when her daughter was having a bath.

             Yea, most likely they rented her out to some sickos for the night. The sickos ended up killing her.

             There's a "statement analysis" documentary where a pro scrutinizes all of their statements and in the end it really does suggest this.

              Can you post a link to that. I've only seen the analysis done by Peter Hyatt. He doesn't rule out that Madeleine could have been sexually assaulted but he only analysed the one interview, and never came to the conclusion she had been 'rented out'.
However that could explain why they left the sliding door to the apartment unlocked even though Kate McCann later said she was worried someone had tried breaking in the night before, and also explain why she said 'They've taken her', rather than say 'She's missing'.

               That's the one I'm referring to. In the end of the documentary, the clues escalate and start to suggest sexual assault. As you said, he says he can't rule it out and that's based purely on the statements, but the interviewer also presents evidence that one of the adults in the parents circle asked if Madeleine was trained to do a certain obscene, likely sexual thing...
