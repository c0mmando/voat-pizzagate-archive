<p>&quot;Bleeding Edge is a novel by American author Thomas Pynchon, published by Penguin Press on September 17, 2013.The novel is a detective story, with its major themes being the September 11 attacks in New York City and the transformation of the world by the Internet.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_Edge">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_Edge</a></p>

            Politics and Prose is probably the best well known bookstore in DC. It's been around for quite awhile and it's a hangout for wonky washingtonians.
