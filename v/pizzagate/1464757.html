<p>&quot;Bleeding Edge is a novel by American author Thomas Pynchon, published by Penguin Press on September 17, 2013.The novel is a detective story, with its major themes being the September 11 attacks in New York City and the transformation of the world by the Internet.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_Edge">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_Edge</a></p>
<p>&quot;Pynchon’s latest novel, Bleeding Edge, does for 9/11 what Gravity’s Rainbow did for World War II: It suggestively depicts a mysterious, corrosive evil that is rotting the very fabric of our epistemology and even ontology, masquerading as a historical event that divides time into a before (bad enough) and an after (a whole lot worse, if it even exists at all).&quot; <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/12/01/pynchons-bleeding-edge-the-great-american-911-truth-novel/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/12/01/pynchons-bleeding-edge-the-great-american-911-truth-novel/</a></p>',

            Politics and Prose is probably the best well known bookstore in DC. It's been around for quite awhile and it's a hangout for wonky washingtonians.
