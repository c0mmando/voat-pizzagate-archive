            Yeah, this is a weird post and the comments are unusual too. If you are in danger leave. Don't wait. Or else don't ask.  Then, why are there so many off topic comments ? Which seems to be happening about important stuff in New Zealand and Australia? Maybe take the fact your post is full of new New Zealand and Australia whole town is satanic comments as a sign from the internet and leave. The court won't go looking for you. That's expensive.

            Personally I'd get the police report, find their names/address and steal their trash. But I don't have any children. Or throw away any left over bleach and ammonia into your trash bag before tying it off.

            If you're story is true, I am so sorry for you. Contact an attorney asap, continue to record everything, keep a journal of everything that happens and hide it, talk to your kids, and leave if you can.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, because of the recent upswing in LARPs and ARGs, I find it slightly suspect that you've been investigating with us since the beginning and your account is only 20 days old.

             Imo, the age of the OPs account ( its 20 something hours old, not 20 days) doesn't make what they say any less likely to be real. If this person is afraid for the safety of their family, and suspects backlash related to their pizzagate research, it would make zero sense -and be quite reckless - to use their true username to make this thread.

              First of all, yes you're right it was 20 hours not 20 days like I said. Thanks for the correction.
             </p>
             <p>
              Second, if the story is true, the person clearly needs help. Many people gave him/her great advice, better than I could, except for the need of keeping and hiding a written physical journal, which I think is imperative.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said, it's in my nature to question. I didn't discount or dismiss the story, but I will question the validity. Some people make a living from making researchers run in circles chasing a story that is fake, some people just do it for the fun of it.

               I agree, everyone did give much better advice than I could've as well. And I am also one to question everything, my only point was the OPs account age having little bearing on the validity of their claim. Not sure if it came off that way, but I wasn't trying to attack you - I just noticed a few people making similar comments about the age of the account and didn't bother to reply to each one :)

                The reason the 20hrs is of concern, is because of the larpers and ARGs. The people playing these games make up a story and see how many people they can get to fall for it. If this person is playing a game, as many have, the first indication is always the age of the account.

            Did you audio record or video? You should get a few of those nanny cams. Place them where it would be really hard to find. That way, if they come in to talk to you, or even on your porch, you can have it record video too. You should also get some outside cams so you can see who's going thru your trash.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you pretty sure it's because you've been investigating pizzagate? Or, could it be an ex, a neighbor, or someone who is just out to ruin your life? Do you know of any enemies? If that's possible, that's even more reason to think that you should set up some cams around there.

            Okay. Pardon me if this isn't the sort of advice you were looking for, but this is a scenario I was kind of expecting to arise, and I do have some thoughts. First, I am assuming that you post on Voat under some other name, and created HelpMePlease specifically for this purpose, so as not to tie your past research to your present problem.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              If the agency really is called DCS (Department of Child Services), then I think you're likely living in one of just a few states. (I won't post their names here, no point making things easy for trolls.) State by state, the names vary enormously and few are called DCS. Washington DC is not one, neither is Virginia.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              If local authorities are coming after you, then you've likely done something that poses a threat to them
              <strong>
               in that locality
              </strong>
              . It seems less likely to me that (for example) you turned up something about the Pegasus Museum and that James Alefantis has the sort of pull to get a distant state DCS after you.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This leads to my first question: How did they figure out it was you? Do you know, or have any theories? This is key to fighting back. The most alarming scenario would be that someone in your state's pedo network who wanted you stopped could read whatever you posted here, and trace your IP from Voat. That would mean that everyone on Voat is vulnerable to similar doxxing and harassment. But that's unlikely for a number of reasons. (For one thing, we'd have seen doxxing and harassment much sooner and aimed at many more people.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It sounds like whatever it is that you found, it's not conclusive yet. You don't have enough to get someone thrown into jail, but you MIGHT have enough if you keep going. If it really was conclusive, they wouldn't be wasting time with the dead animals, or going through your trash. I don't mean to be morbid; this is actually a good thing, because what really destroys these guys is usually the attempt at a cover-up. So my first piece of advice is: Build up your paper trail like crazy. Get lawyers to write letters on your behalf. Get documents notarized. As other people urged, make sure there are copies of all videos or emails or phone calls.
              <strong>
               And make sure THEY know that you're doing that.
              </strong>
              Make them understand that you won't be an easy target, that it will cost them time, money, and exposure to come after you. Whatever you think started this, get it on the record as well.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              You have to make your own cost-benefit assessment here, but my advice would be to limit your future PG/pedogate research, to retire from the scene -- but only after you've established that you're going to be a hard target. Try and turn your situation into a permanent standoff. It seems likely that these guys read about your investigation into their local thing here on Voat, and they used that plus other clues to find you. So once you've built up a strong paper trail and can prove that any DCS action against you is shady, maybe stop talking about or researching that topic. Use Voat as insurance. If any further trouble comes your way, the rest of us will be witnesses and things will only get worse for whoever it is.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            That part is admittedly the most tricky, so let me explain my reasoning. There's rarely any way for us, as citizen investigators, to force these local pedos fully into the open. They have too many tools. What we can do is force them to awkwardly cover up, again and again. We couldn't make the DC police investigate the child porn that was on Comet Pizza's server, and we couldn't make either the DC police or the FBI do anything about James Alefantis threatening to murder Ryan and his family. But we did get those things onto the record, making it very, very hard for them to take any further action.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you've accomplished something similar here, and if so, my congratulations for being a badass investigator. But now it's time to hunker down and survive.
           </p>

             Dude that is a bomb ass comment right there. Really excellent advice, a much needed ray of light shines upon the whole movement. We are going to get these motherfuckers. First its gonna be uneasy for us, then awkward for them, quickly leading to painful for everyone. End is brutal. Sequel is magnificent.

             This is by far the best advice.  I was thinking about you last night trying to come up with a game plan.  Thanks to SoberSecondThought it's already accomplished.  I also agree with backing off.  DCS is an entity you don't want to screw with.  They comprise a completely amoral mindset with the focus on profit.  We can thank the clinton's for the cash for grabbing kids fed handout.
            </p>
            <p>
             If there is someone you trust you might want to hand over any research in progress/or not.  Depends on if someone will come back at you in retaliation.  The most important thing is to protect your children.  The foster system is full of pedos which of course is no surprise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Busting into your house with police/if the police are compliant in your area with pedos (don't know) then long range goal would be to relocate.  If the police are 'clean' then keep an atty close at hand and know all your rights.  Busting into the house w/o a warrant is illegal of course but if the local police are fine with that and denying you calling your atty then the area you are living offers no protection (for any crime) and relocating to a safe place for your children to grow up should be a top priority.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many state budgets are dependent on fed monies that come from child snatching.  To have children in this day and age one must consider all aspects and pick a place that is less likely to see children as cash cows.  Children with certain medical conditions are worth the most (for research).
            </p>
            <p>
             Please be safe~

            sell your house and move asap, or move and sell your house later. just get the fuck out of that county or state if you can. Don't wait, and get insurance until you are gone.

            Make a kill switch. Make some type of video or audio testimony that they are after you. Give your name in this audio. Send that video to relatives or someone you trust. If you die, have those people release the video to this sub. Let the enemy know you have a kill switch then they can't kill you! God Bless

            Attention Posters!
Please do not publicly post names of people who you think might help. I suggest OP seeks help through places like CASA or a woman's shelter for abused women. However, if the "authorities" are the ones harassing you, then Becareful who you tell your story to. Many times there is many many cohorts!
Publicly posting other's names could put them &amp; their families in danger also.

            I say get the hell out too.  Also,  I think it depends ds o. The state you're in, but unless both parties are aware of the recording it can't be used in court.

            do you know anyone trusted in the local police department, maybe they can provide some extra eyes. But if not trusted id advise against. More security cameras couldn't hurt. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING especially if you foresee having to defend yourself in courts. Set a deadman switch if you have any "aces" in your back pocket in terms of investigation materials. Also save an offline copy of your work, maybe get a copy to someone else to hold onto. Another piece of advice, especially if you cant leave is keep a good flow of company coming and going at your house; friends, family, neighbors, this may keep the harassment down and can serve to be good for your morale in a tough situation like this. Last thought, maybe higher a private investigator to track those that may be tracking you, could expertly corroborate your story.

            I can't tell you about all the awful things I feel under my heart right now. I can't keep doing this, it's killing me inside. Can you get eyes on this.

            On November 8, 2016 the election occurred. Secretary of State John Kerry was missing but secretly in Antartica. Why? On a day where he would be third in line of succession to the USA would he be in Antartica off the record?
Donal Trump won the Presidency. Secretary

             Kerry
            </strong>

            <strong>
             Christchurch, New Zealand.

             Very interesting info about the under eye bags but what I'm wondering is how do we know that that's what causes it?  And what causes it precisely?? Like how does sodomy abuse show up as under eye bags?? I'm being dead serious and sincere with my question so I'm hoping someone can answer it.

             I would not be surprised if the the whole town was under satanic abuse, but maybe just the area at least. On the website right off the eyeball and bones and then the menu has Carnivores and way at the bottom on the left side it says 333 For the kids pizza and the Satan's Little Helper I only took a peek at but Whoa.  This is Very Sketchy and Suspect this whole org. I have to go to a meeting but will look at this again later.

              This is not off topic and is one of the saddest things I have seen. It is all about normalizing, which we have been studying.  Satan's Little Helper is a play on Santa's Little Helper, The Elf. How adorable, How cute. Not.

              Ten guesses.  There are people that do not want us pointing this out to other people.  You can guess who they are.  This is all disgusting and the sodomy contributes to the dark baggy eye but I believe the sleep deprivation and losing who you are and your soul.....it all ads up.  So very very sad.  The saddest ones are the children.

             On November 8, 2016 the election occurred. Secretary of State John Kerry was missing but secretly in Antartica. Why? On a day where he would be third in line of succession to the USA would he be in Antartica off the record?
            </p>
            <p>
             Donal Trump won the Presidency. Secretary Kerry flew directly to Christchurch, New Zealand. On that very night a massive 7.0 + earthquake strike

               1) Annoyed I can't find the youtube video now!  It was a video of White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest holding a press briefing for the media about John Kerry visit to Wellington New Zealand.  The press were asking questions and it was so obvious that he, Josh Earnest, was trying to make up a reply as he went along.  It was an uncomfortable Q&amp;A when he was trying to say why John Kerry was visiting NZ &amp; Antarctica.  2) New Zealands Prime Minister resigned because of 'family issues' however, have you seen what his daughter is up too?  Guess these were the 'family issues' it was just after this visit.  I reckoned that Kerry went over to try cover something up because Clingon did not get the Presidency and things had to be covered up QUICKLY, since he seemed so friendly with Obama.  He so quickly resigned almost on the spot!  His daughter Cherry - has PIZZAGATE written all over these pictures of her! (13.30mins but before is interesting too) - Pedogate - Decoding #PizzaGate #PedoGate (Part 6) (John Key) (New Zealand) (Kim Dotcom) -
