            Nice, have a pedophile come to your house to deliver Meals on Wheels to elderly shut ins. He's been removed from ministry in 1985 yet he's cleared to come into contact with dependent adults. I can't find where he's even a registered sex offender.

            The Catholic Church has twice the rate of sexual abuse as Protestant churches.  They should look at all of their policies in light of this.  While they focus on globalist politics their church is going to hell.

            Thank you for your post and for the suggestion, I was just thinking about something along those lines when looking at orphanages and women's clinics, both which could be considered subgroups of the adoption group actually.  Refugee category encompasses international sex slave/forced prostitution.

            Since any Tom dick or harry can open up a church and call it a " non profit" get funding , and teaching material  from the government , who by the way knows nothing about the true God, it's no wonder they have been so successful in their deception. They are satans master workers !
