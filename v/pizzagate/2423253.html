<p>This is the kind of thing smart people can see by looking a little bit deep but I think it IS CODED so it\'s a bit lurky and murky. As im just a note taker.</p>
<p>this concept. Im fully convinced of however and think you don\'t need to take my word just monitor that situation,. Since you can\'t actually be effective by tweeting because they ( the owners) have that squashed for so many.</p>
<p>First, I DIDNT LINK TO this voat post bc it\'s archived but it\'s: Found PEDO SYMBOLS in the movie &quot;Daddys Home&quot; starring Will Ferrell who we know was at the cannibal dinner!! Feedback please??</p>
<p>It only had three upvotes. It was observant post , talked about the movie DADDYS HOME full of pedo symbols and a CHARITY CALLED</p>
<p>Courage Hearts</p>
<p>Back to TWITTER</p>
<p>Now trending today on Twitter is a bunch of different things as Usual like Wednesday wisdom and id rather walk over Legos... For whatever reason.. Legos= kids Walking on them = pain Legos also being brightly colored</p>
<p>Im finding they go together as</p>
<p>it\'s Also trending in Google that Will Ferrel said Democrats like Bush and war more now., something like that, Ferrel specifically said &quot;Dick Cheney\'s Heart is made of Legos...&quot; Ok <a href="https://ibb.co/eOMV5x">https://ibb.co/eOMV5x</a> Heart transplants Heart progress</p>
<p>btw question which one had the hunting accident?</p>
<p>Now what\'s Also trending on Twitter , is DICKS SPORTING GOODS and that purports to be about guns and the NRA.</p>
<p>I say read what you want to read. Keeping in mind. Dicks sporting goods sounds like HUNTING.</p>
<p>Associate words DICK = penis Dick = dick cheney</p>
<p>Pizza Hut = pizzagate, all of it from the CHILDREN TO THE blood drinking to the harvesting of organs TO the real MONEY</p>

<p>That was earlier. This Theory Twitter Trends are Message to different factions as Q tweets are messages to patriots .</p>
<p>I think it ( this ccommunications ) does move fast and you would have to be current to be in the info war/battle so to speak, Maybe this is part of why the heavy censorship</p>
<p>To prevent real Answering even just real commenting on the current trend which is the current message .</p>
<p>But like the alphabet has only 26 letters, these current Twitter trends have to have a cap of surreality, after that they seem fake to everyone.</p>
<p>This bothered me before because Twitter is sancuary to activist pedos who other voat posters say are avressive in going after happens children, thru Twitter, I believe things like Winnie the Pooh day hashes are used to the pedos afvantage. Not to mention Winnie the POOH Symbolism.</p>
<p>Things you would never pick up on till JAMES ALEFANTIS was exposed in turn exposing alot of the bad going on in the world .</p>
<p>This post idea hit me as Yesterday was trending on twiitter, Pancakeday which I didn\'t think of</p>
<p>I hadn\'t really gotten solid on this perspective yet</p>
<p>till getting a follower that made my skin crawl.</p>
<p>All the recent follows I\'ve gotten seem so fake that I check every one, cause it\'s inorganic compared to how it used to be.</p>
<p>This idea occurred to me yesterday but has been irking me since the bannings and shadow bannings.</p>

<p>And they are recruiting. Because this thing called @ Jill Freeman 111 engaged me by following me. Imagine who takes up this offer? How many? What are they doing? Who is that child?</p>
<p>This ONE PHOTO from the whole page of that Jill Twitter account IS NSFW, but it\'s just a screenshot and safe to open NOW THE WRITTEN LNKS ON THIS PAGE ARE BLOCKED OUT.</p>

            Yeah that last link is def NSFW!   Be warned.  But I get your drift.  I noticed yesterday too about Dick's upping the age for buying guns.   Just to let people know Wallmart is also upping the age for gun purchases.  We know that Hillary sat on the board for quite some time.
