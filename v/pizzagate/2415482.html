            Abel Danger (AD) has linked Hillary Clinton's alleged development of a Federal Bridge Certification Authority snuff-film archive to an 8(a)-company visa service apparently launched in 1994 by Serco to abduct children and staff sensitive compartmented information facilities (SCIFs) for a Podesta pedophile ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could this be the Bridge Q talks about?

              how bout this one?

              Serco‘s apparent use of the US Patent and Trademark Office to equip government leaders and senior bureaucrats (SES) with Crown rights to trade in snuff-film devices in a global conspiracy allegedly discovered by the late British intelligence agent Gareth Williams
             </p>
             <p>
              McConnell believes that Serco had Mr. Williams “snuffed” after he discovered sexual deviants associated with Hillary Clinton had used the Navy’s patented onion router (Tor) and Demon face recognition software to set up death-pool junkets on the federal bridge certification authority and take bets on the CAI Private Equity Group’s production of the “first live-broadcast mass snuff film in human history” on 9/11.
             </p>
             <p>
              McConnell believes that Williams discovered Serco had equipped Clinton donors and former DCAA auditor Stephen Paddock with access to CAI SABOTor* junket rooms on the 25th floor of the Salomon Brothers Building (WTC7) so they could destroy evidence of the 9/11 snuff-film production.
             </p>
             <p>
              SABOTor* junkets – Virtual war rooms in the Salomon Brothers Building which allegedly allowed junkets to bet on times of death and body counts associated with a combination of patented digital-fires insulation / incendiary devices from Alcan, Boeing and Otis (UTC), activated by 8(a)** mentor-protégé companies over the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet and/or the U.S. Navy’s onion router (Tor) networks.

            LTG Flynn likely had a big part of Abel Danger which was a program run out of the DIA in the late 90s.  There is strong evidence to indicate that the task teams picked up commo which indicates that the 9/11 hijackers were CIA assets:

            Flynn saw it first hand.  He knows the secrets.  God protect him.

             sorry if i missed it though, but where did you learn that Flynn was 'likely' a part of Able Danger?  i'm having difficulty pinning down exactly where he was stationed prior to being promoted to the assistant  director of national intelligence in Sept, '11.  i did see though that he was at one time the 'commander of the 111th Military Intelligence Brigade at the Army’s Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, Arizona', but can't figure out when or for how long.

              It would have been prior to about 2009 when Custer took over there.  Good luck nailing down dates.  Understand how small the MI community is - INSCOM which oversees all direct mil intel activities (including all special operations of which Flynn has been involved in, including being D/INTEL for JSOC).  The DIA rolls up to the USD/INTEL but both work closely together as well as with NSA.mil.  These are the white hats.
             </p>
             <p>
              As far as "where did you learn that Flynn was 'likely' a part of Able Danger"...I'll let you ponder that ; )

               re: Flynn/AD, still pondering... i'm assuming you put the pieces together based on something you heard/read from McConnell/AD.

               also, any idea if there are any links between the current Abel Danger group and the original Able Danger intel team?

            "that being said, i've seen some sporadic whispers around the web of Able Danger being 'disinfo'"
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, this is the conclusion I came to after watching him over several years. He was originally a 9/11 Truther. He has more recently adopted pizzagate. What I found is that he rambles. He never gives to a clearly presented backgrounder on "sister Marcy" with documentation. He mostly makes unfounded claims or repeats known info and begins to sound a little crazy. Good qualities for "disinfo". Only believe what can be verified.

            His writing is really very good.  Not sensationalized at all.  I take him seriously and believe what he says about his sister.  I have seen a picture of her and she is attractive, but I just can't see WTH she sees in Hillary.  The thought makes me sick.

              The Vatican and the Zionists are playing a game of pretend over there in Israel right now too. Israel is appropriating some taxes on Jerusalem and the Catholic churches are pretending to bitch about it. Rumor is that the Vatican ultimately holds the land deed to some of that disputed ground over there. I'm not sure what the terms are but there is some chicanery afoot.

               I was not aware of that.  Yes, nothing is what it seems with those people.  I really hope that military intelligence has them under surveillance.  It would be amazing to be privy to that information.
