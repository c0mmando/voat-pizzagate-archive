            This is a long read but worth it.  I can't determine who authored it. That would be helpful for future reference and I agree with sensitive that a brief description by the OP of the similarities would have been helpful and might have stimulated more attention to this article. We are a great group of researchers here but I've noticed that the more academically oriented material gets less attention.

             PL &amp; Sensitive's comments have gotten me wondering whether it would be good to talk to the Mods about whether a Title Tag could be set up, like AA: (Academic Article) or HR: (Heavy Reading) so that people who don't like dense articles could avoid them, and people who are looking for the real meat could find those types of articles with a simple search, and avoid wasting their time on the mental candy floss.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any thoughts on whether this might be a good (or bad) idea?

             Hi PL,
            </p>
            <p>
             The article was authored by James Robinson. I could find one other article by him on the Crimes of Empire website:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://crimesofempire.com/author/jamesrobertson648/">
              https://crimesofempire.com/author/jamesrobertson648/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             It personally doesn't bother me if the big articles with complex trains of thought and huge numbers of references don't attract a mass of people.
            </p>
            <p>
             The people with the right mental chops will be able to dissect it, map the themes in their mind, take the information they need, and move on to use that information in new ways.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the opposite of the meme-bytes that get everybody buzzing around, essentially having water-cooler conversations about mental candy floss.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't get me wrong. I'm 100% for free speech, and would never want to shut down the hoi-poloi who are running around like chickens with their heads cut off clucking about Seth Rich / Wikileaks / Wiener's Laptop / Kim Dotcom Tweets
            </p>
            <p>
             OTOH, there's a place for people who are willing to read dense material, think about it, and make deductions. Sometimes it's better for there to be quiet in the library.
            </p>
            <p>
             Glad you found the article helpful. I did, massively, especially those videos he linked. That in itself raises the question of why it's so hard to find Caradori's victim interviews. I would recommend that people use Firefox's YouTube Download Tool to save copies to your hard drive. You never know when valuable materials like that will 404.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good on ya mate. Keep up the good work,
RR
