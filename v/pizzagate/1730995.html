            They sell another product called "GoTo Assist"  The logo for it is a triangle with a slight swirl inside of it.  It's not blatant but it seems like a big coincidence.

             Interesting. I think the logo in the video of my post is way beyond coincidental as it is not at all material to the final product. I think it serves to send the message that pedos can safely use the platform without concern of being reported.

            The image  (16 sec. mark) has more to my eye than one boy love triangle. (The do call it love.) The two spirals below serve the same function.  The pizza shaped triangle is relating to the red imagery.  Use your imagination.  This red part, is a mayan related image pedo's have children being groomed redraw with paint.  I haven't found the carving or image yet, but can remember it being used that way on me.

               You need to do a search on Voat. The search is not great. I will sometimes do a search on an outside engine (google, duckduckgo) on the keywords or phrases that I can recall. That is the best we can do, and I have found it frustrating. I wish the site was categorized and indexed.

                Wow, thanks for writing back.  You make sense, it's so very rare.  I don't know if I can link to your writings, but would if I could.  And now I can find my search item.  Outside search is OK with me. Voat search didn't work.  The testimony on "I'm a survivor of Satanic Ritual Abuse" was powerful stuff from probably a street person.  It was up less than a day with maybe 90 comments, two mine.  Voat is walking on thin ice better than the other sites, yet their doing Gods work.  A good search function might get them in hotter water that melts their thin ice.

                My take on things: There is such a thing as Trial by Public Opinion.  There will be no in federal court trials soon, I believe its been successfully suppressed in MSM.  That Public Opinion Trial, so feared by Public Persons, is happening right here, The Peoples Court of Public Opinion is in session NOW and has been 24/7 for 4+ months.

                 Happy to help. I was disappointed to see that the post (
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1750949">
                  https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1750949)
                 </a>
                 ), which included many moving comments by others who had similar experiences to share, was deleted due to lack of verification. I think it is absurd that this was not allowed to stay posted as it was very powerful and could help red pill people. If people did not deem it worthwhile or credible, it would self filter from lack of support. I don't know if the mods are sometimes compromised or if they just don't understand this...and the idea of demanding verification from a survivor is analogous to the LSM claiming that this whole platform is based on fake news since we lack a smoking gun or the investigative powers of law enforcement.

                 The suppression is real. I have documented the recent effort on Twitter to censor #missingdcgirls here:

                 I also have a longer document of the denials without substantiation that all should review if they are under the delusion that pizzagate has been investigated and debunked:

                  My actual memories include some that is criminal for still living persons, people I never would wish on anyone.  Details could get me ensnared again.

                   We are working to fight this, and it is much bigger than we thought. I am hoping that, as awareness continues to grow, we can not only have the voices heard and truth exposed but also take down these sickos. The policies that caused the thread to be taken down make no sense. Over time, I expect a better platform to evolve (with category tagging and more reasonable rules). Seeing all of this makes me want to do that.

            First time poster, long lurking in pizzagate.  Your find looks real to me, I have a good sniffer for this sort of thing, experience.  Can personally confirm that triangle and heart and pizza were symbolically used by them on me, way back in the fifties.  Cathy got it right, read it all there, for me it's mostly unspeakable what they did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also want to say GOToMeeting is a favorite of mine in engineering work.  Tech Support for higher end programs is all about.  Tech using that program can fix your software hangup in seconds working on your screen compared to days swapping files. Sharing - sending blueprints online is a big concern for small business or should be, data doesn't get more sensitive than those specs.  Online privacy is a genuine concern for many legitimate circumstances.  It should be a civil right.   I also reflect that most internet usage has been porn related from the beginning. So forums offering any sharing in private will be sought out.  Yuck, what a mess, every good tool has two sides.
           </p>
           <p>
            I''m guessing that GoToMeeting will hear of this soon and remove it.  They better act quick, engineers never like embarrassment.  YES pedo-caca is everywhere, and not just symbolically.  The triangles were triggers for me, started remembering lots more stuff.  Bill Cosby and the BLUE PILLS were the first.
           </p>
           <p>
            BIG TIP: For all your PTSD, 
Please write it down, the event, beginning middle and end.  Just try it, pretty please,?  Write it down, Set it aside one month, and watch the pain fade.  Do it with each memory as they hit you and they will slowly loose power over you.  It's not fast enough using shrinks for help and cost too much.  Speaking your trauma out loud before writing it down will only re traumatize yourself and your listener as well.  Write it out, wear a watch and use Gods herb .  Keep safe. Your survival is a victory.

             Thanks for the post. This pedo thing is not personal for me, thankfully, but I am sickened that others do this and had no awareness until this story broke about how widespread this is and the extent of evil that these sick people will do.

              We, the survivors, may begin crawling out of the woodwork, if you all keep expanding this new space of acceptance.  Bless you all.  Traumatic CSA causes a profound lose of memory for decades.  The worse it was and the duration involved, the harder it is in the remembering and the longer the amnesia.  Thus the pro's in MK-ULTRA were the roughest.  In my case the memory lose, was roughly 40 years.  I believe scar tissue surrounds these memories as protection for day to day survival.  It seemingly begins to dissolve as we grow older and much strangeness is discovered, down many a rabbit hole we go.

            Speculation:
It is becoming more and more clear that the boy lover logo is chosen because of its wide spread use (police badges) and the context of where the logo is found is critical.  It is designed to appear innocuous so that people who obsess over finding the logo can be easily discredited because the logo is everywhere.  Why did the logo become the boy lover logo? is it possible the girl lover logo was chosen because it was found on a popular brand of icecream? finding these logos by itself is completely meaningless and has caused many a red herring, also, there is going to likely be more wide-spread innocuous use in order to further separate the logos from their illicit meaning

             There is no good reason for the use of the triangle within the actual commercial. It is unrelated to the product that they produce. It seems deliberate, and the idea of GoToMeeting as a facilitator for communication makes a lot of sense.

            Blue triangle pedo symbol is featured in the lower-left section (of the six collaborators) from the 15 to 20 second mark in the video. Just stop the screen at any point in that range (say at 16 seconds), and it is clear...and the triangle has nothing to do with the final product that they produce.

            It makes me wonder if certain services have a certain "pedo loyalty," meaning that should pedophiles use their service for their shenanigans, the company will have their back somehow or another.

            I am going to throw some bones into this thread and leave it at that:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <a href="https://aragonresearch.com/logmein-acquires-citrix-gotomeeting-for-1-8-billion/">
              GotoMeeting was acquired by LogMeIn
             </a>
             (previously owned by Citrix) for $1.8 billion in July 2016.
            </li>
            <li>
             LogMeIn is in the business of allowing computers to create
             <a href="https://www.vpn.net/">
              Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
             </a>
             which means you can have hundreds or thousands of computers around the world connected in the same way they would be connected in a basement room - a private
             <em>
              virtual
             </em>
             LAN
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              While this is a new marketing video by GotoMeeting published in February 2017, it doesn't mean the videos of people painting have anything to do with GotoMeeting. Video design companies use
              <strong>
               stock video
              </strong>
              in the same way that graphic design companies use
              <strong>
               stock photography
              </strong>
              . So what we should be looking into is:
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              <strong>
               <em>
                What company/individual filmed these painting videos?
               </em>
              </strong>
              That is the real lead.

             Final bullet is a good point as a lead. I agree that it makes me think that GTM could be an enabling technology.

            I didn't see the pedo symbol but it does seem like just the kind of tool that is tailor made for the pedos. I can't find mention of any safeguards they might have against illicit users.

             Exactly.  We need to get rid of GoToMeeting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also how do they traffick children?  Cars?  Planes?  Boat?  Tailor made for the pedos.  We must get of rid of them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also what do they do once the children are trafficking?  They keep them in buildings.  Think about it.  A four walled structure with a roof is tailor made for keeping prying eyes away.  We must demolish all buildings NOW!

              Oh okay I see it. A business that is tailor fit for catering to cp trading and possibly live streaming abuse and other things just so happens to have that pedo symbol in their advertising. Good chance it's not accidental.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do we know when that commercial was running? If recently, after all the exposure of the symbols, the company would be taking a big risk putting in red flags like that.

             I did not know about that, but the video I linked is more blatant (5 seconds of exposure). I think it is a serious lead since GoToMeeting can be a useful platform for file sharing, planning/meeting, and other ways for these pedos to connect. It is so blatant that I think it has to be deliberate, so we should pursue for connections. If nothing else, the good guys among the FBI on voat might use this as a lead to pursue for digging.

            . This post must have hit a nerve to spur two trolls to create accounts and post within minutes of my posting about GoToMeeting.

             YEP. 
The shills are crapping all over this board. My guess is false flag event or arkancide is being planned. Afterwards, news pedos will 'find' this board and blame for some violent act. Hope members and mods will thwart the scum.

              Yes. We have been very good at patrolling and calling out CTR/ShareBlue when they spout their hatred or try to incite violence. It is obviously done to plant false evidence that this community shares their views so that the LSM can try to point toward their fake breadcrumbs.

            Wow, just hiding in plain sight. So many don't know those symbols and it's literally everywhere. I saw something with toys having those symbols on them that will identify them for trafficking. This is sick.

            They advertise on radio programs by jewish satanists like Michael Savage. They provide live video links that could be and probably are used by jew pedos to get off on terrorizing and killing small children. Bullets in the skulls of every "jew" on this planet solves this problem, and about 1000 others. Think globally, act locally.

             A member for 40 minutes to shill against Jews, painting those who oppose sick pedos as neo Nazis. It looks like CTR is truly exposed as a Nazi organization filled with hatred and bigots...as well as supportive of pedophile sickness.

             The 7 churches in Asia in Revelations aren't Jewish. Gentles as well as Jews are involved in Pedogate. The synagogue of Satan is the Christian so called churches, has nothing to do with fake Jews but has everything to do with fake Christians.

              You are responding to a hate-filled CTR troll. They make these posts to distract and to somehow try to paint those opposed to pedo evil as the hate-filled bigots that are the CTR army, paid for by David Brock and his former lover JA.

                Yep. It is some of the best proof (investment in CTR and censorship) how real this topic is. You have never seen anything like this in terms of trying to block a conspiracy. They even coined the phrase "fake news" with a plan for censorship as soon as the pizzagate/pedogate discoveries happened from Wikileaks. Good post about this:
