They employ dozens and dozens of self-respecting, intelligent, accomplished, publicity-shy people.  Some must be good guys and some of those must be trustees, officers and senior employees who are fiduciaries and legally accountable to ask and know the answers to questions we would ask if we could.  How can we motivate them to do just that?</p>
<p>Three such questions would concern Tamera Luzzatto\'s famous email [<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736</a>] gathering DC insiders at the family farm in the fall of 2015.  First question: &quot;Tamera, what exactly did you mean when you offered your step-grandchildren ages 7, 9 and 11 for the &quot;further entertainment&quot; of grownups in your heated swimming pool?&quot; Second, &quot;Wasn\'t that a work-related email that you sent from your official Pew email address at 9:26 on a working Thursday morning?&quot;  And third, &quot;Did the Trusts pay or remiburse the costs of the event?&quot;</p>
<p>Note that The Pew Charitable Trusts is a public charity, exempt from income tax under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code.  See Pew\'s IRS Form 990 for the fiscal year ended 6/30/14, the latest available, at [<a href="https://pp-990.s3.amazonaws.com/2015_05_EO/56-2307147_990_201406.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAI7C6X5GT42DHYZIA%2F20170411%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20170411T221503Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=1800&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8160d78c32223a02a8dfcfe4de7d330590b165f6c037915cb81c7ba6d7cb2edd">https://pp-990.s3.amazonaws.com/2015_05_EO/56-2307147_990_201406.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAI7C6X5GT42DHYZIA%2F20170411%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20170411T221503Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=1800&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8160d78c32223a02a8dfcfe4de7d330590b165f6c037915cb81c7ba6d7cb2edd</a>].</p>
<p>As a public charity, The Trusts can and does spend and receive many millions of dollars every year lobbying and pitching policy and giving and getting government grants, all under the direction of Senior Vice President for government relations Tamera Luzzatto.  No amateur, she is among the most influential and connected people anywhere, with a Muckety Score of 89 [<a href="http://www.muckety.com/Tamera-Luzzatto/8720.muckety">http://www.muckety.com/Tamera-Luzzatto/8720.muckety</a>] that compares to Tiger Woods at 90 and is not all that far below both John Podesta and Donald Trump at 99. According to Part VII of that same Form 990, she earned about $300K for fiscal 2013.</p>
<p>I\'d wager that Pew, like most substantial organizations, pays or reimburses the entertainment and similar expenses that its senior officers incur in connection with their work. Like those, say, for gathering and entertaining influential folks at the family farm. If so, LUZZATTO\'S POOL PARTIES AND KIDDIE ENTERTAINMENTS ARE FINANCED BY U.S. TAXPAYERS to the extent that The Trusts\' donors deduct their contributions to reduce otherwise taxable income.  
</p>
<p>Recalling that Al Capone fell for tax violations established by a paper trail, don\'t underestimate the potential benefit of adding IRS to the roster of authorities that could investigate what can reasonably be suspected to be immoral and possibly criminal use of tax-favored funds and tax-exempt status.  That would not be lost on the trustees, managers and senior employees of the Trusts and Glenmede who are accountable (and vulnerable) for misuse and misreporting of funds under their supervision. </p>
<p>As per that same Form 990, eight of the the Trusts\' trustees are still named Pew. And the Pews still appear to control Glenmede Trust Co, which is the sole trustee of the private Pew family trusts of which The Pew Charitable Trusts is the sole beneficiary. Glenmede is responsible for about $5 billion of Pew family assets and many billions more of assets owned by others who might also want to learn the answers to these questions or know why they haven\'t been asked. . .</p>

            Nice post. Interesting angle.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the reimbursement, there is no evidence to suggest that happened. I didn't get the impression from the email that s/he was throwing the party, only supplying entertainment. I would think your first question is the most pertinent. While excessive personal emails are usually frowned upon, personal exchanges aren't illegal, nor disallowed in most circumstances, but, and it's a big but, if there were something illegal going on, yup, then the Pew Charitable. Trusts are pulled right in the middle of this. Both the planning and commission of a crime would be something that they would be liable for if they didn't act in a reasonable way to determine what was meant by the email. Since the words seem to indicate possible illegal behavior, it would be their responsibility to investigate using due diligence to uncover the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, this is my opinion and conjecture, but I've seen employees at other institutions called out for less. The other problem is that because of who s/he is, there is no chance of this being investigated, and if not investigated, Pew Charitable Trusts really doesn't have to do anything. That's the sad truth. The website Evie's Crib was another huge red flag that, as far as I know, was never looked into by either his/her employer or the authorities. Evidently, a grandfather/mother can put up a site where money is exchanged for raw and uncut time with his/her grandchild. Very disturbing.. That again could reflect on one's employer IF they: (1) knew about such  situation; (2) did not investigate; and (3) failed to act and hold an employee accountable for such an enterprise. For instance, there was an incident I remember involving a friend. She worked at a very large corporation and an anonymous tip came in that a senior officer was involved in CP. The company followed up and found traces of it being true through a thorough examination of the emails. Because of this, they passed on the anonymous call and evidence to the police, and the man was arrested because the tip was true. But this is interesting.

            Many of the largest oil and financial trusts all seem to have their hands in art galleries, which is why I've always underlined the importance of the money disappearing in the art auctions. Not only is it financially sound but logistically as well. You could run a pedophile network and use the art transportation as cover. This in turn underlies the importance of what Alefantis does--serves as a liaison between TPTB and government officials, politicos, journalists, and of course, a cohort of vampiric elite like the Folgers heir, the Atlantic Media chief and cannibal-pedo power players types like Tony Podesta and Dennis Hastert.
           </p>
           <p>
            Check which foundations are meeting Luzzatto, Alefantis, Marina Abramovic, Jeff Koons. I tend to find a lot of success searching for galas with full attendance lists, especially if they're in a secluded area.

            Alex Jones red pilled me on this one. All the Clinton people at the event were gonna rape the little children in the pool. Alex Jones is famous and has a gravely voice so he can't be full of shit.

            You down for some more detective work. I think I've discovered the actual meaning behind "Pizza Party" but i need a second opinion. You won't have to travel far, just an Event's FB Page from 2 years ago. I can post the link now if you want.
