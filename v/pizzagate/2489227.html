Archived D.C. Spider Web: Chapter Two - MACCOBY FAMILY</p>
<p>This was what was said in reference today: &quot;Max Maccoby is a lawyer at Butzel Long, specializing in such cases as product liability, breach of contract, malpractice and false claims.</p>
<p>Max Maccoby represented James Alefantis and ex-partner David Brock in the bizarre blackmail lawsuit.</p>
<p>This shows a personal connection between Alefantis and all three Maccoby siblings, as well a personal connection between David Brock and both Izette Folger and Max Maccoby.</p>
<p>Max Maccoby is also on the board of Directors for Friends of the Orphans.</p>
<p>Friend of the Orphans has since changed its name to Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH), which is Spanish for Our Little Brothers and Sisters. (It also goes by Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs (NPFS), which is the French translation.)</p>
<p>NPH is a network of orphanages in Latin America and the Carribean.</p>
<p>It currently houses of 3,700 children in nine countries:</p>
<p>Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru, with Haiti and the Dominican Republic of particular significance. More on Friends of the Orphans below.</p>
<p>There are some claims that Butzel Long, and the surrounds of its building have some child-sex insinuations. The dissolution of sli.mg make this more difficult to investigate.</p>
<p>I spent a whole day archiving this 5 part article showing the connections from families to funds to children. Max Maccoby and his family is shown here along with links to proof.&quot; ~anon</p>
<p>There is a link to all of these orphanages in the Caribbean and Central and South America. This is relevant to pizzagate because it involves elites who are linked to child sex trafficking.</p>',

            Did you happen to notice that at that Media Matters Party at Transformer also were Al Franken  and  Barney Franks with David Brock?!  Wow! I can't believe I even noticed, too early.  If that place ever gets tagged for Money Laundering, they are all in Hot Water.
