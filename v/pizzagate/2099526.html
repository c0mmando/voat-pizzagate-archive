<p>I transcribed five minutes of a Kevin Shipp interview (<a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4335/36138662793_532083bd04_h.jpg">bio</a>) where he makes a good simplistic summary of Pedogate.   I think he is doing what he\'s told, but the CIA must know they\'ll lose eventually so maybe they want to come out looking innocent even though we know they\'re not innocent at the top, maybe the leaders will try to blame rogue factions.

<p>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/FjknH9ZlN8U">&quot;Former CIA Kevin Shipp...Satanic Pedophilia Exposed...&quot;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>@5:15:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Host:</strong>  [...] the question from me to you is <strong>how, first of all, do you define Satanic rituals with children, and then, when did you become exposed to what\'s going on with the sacrifice in our country?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Shipp:</strong>  Well yeah they call it satanic ritual abuse or SRA.  My first exposure, I was a federal law enforcement officer, and so we had a lot of training on some of the heinous crimes that were out there.  And now most law enforcement departments have special units on this.  But there was a lot of satanic ritual activity out there.  </p>
<p>And <strong>Satanism is all about mind control, controlling the thoughts and actions of others.  And the chief way that they do that is by molesting children when they\'re younger,</strong> and then once they are permanently injured, they\'ll get multiple personality disorders and things like that, and <strong>once they\'re permanently injured they can use them for their movement through the rest of their lives.  The international pedophilia ring is doing exactly that and so that\'s why.</strong></p>
<p>We started seeing this in law enforcement and I started following it ever since.  <strong>It is happening, there\'s no question that it\'s real.</strong>  And most people can\'t get their minds around this.  It is so disgusting, it is so dark, it is so evil, that most people don\'t even want to think about this, talk about this, or address it, but we have to say 8,000 children a year are disappearing in the United, not the United States, I think it\'s 2,000 a day now, children are disappearing.   115 of those 2,000 are abductions with absolutely no evidence at all of where the child went -- stranger abductions.  So kids are disappearing by the thousands.  <strong>And of course the pedophilia network, child trafficking, and Satanism, that is their central goal, is to get kids when they\'re young.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So people need to face this.</strong>  This could be their little kid.  This could be their neighbor\'s little kid.   This could be a relative\'s little kid.  <strong>As unpleasant as this is, Americans need to come out and not only face this, but they need to start fighting it.</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>@7:35:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Host:</strong>  [...] what you just said is what they call trauma based mind control, I mean they actually split the brain of the child to where their psyche is fractioned out, and then they start programming them, literally programming them, with information, like the &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a good example of what they have done.  Have you seen any of those specific types of programming going on, or have you heard some stories?  What\'s your experience with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Shipp:</strong>  Well I mean, it goes, you can go back to programs, CIA programs like MK Ultra, which, that was disbanded allegedly in 1973 and they were doing experiments sexually with sexual abuse and mind control and drugs and torture and all kinds of other things to control people.  </p>
<p>Supposedly that was disbanded in 1973 and as usual the documents were destroyed so Congress couldn\'t see exactly what was going on.  <strong>And, it\'s, on the part of the government, is that sort of activity going on today?  I didn\'t see any of that in my tour of the CIA but you have to understand that just because I didn\'t see it doesn\'t mean that it\'s not going on.  The CIA is a very compartmented place.  Would the government do that sort of thing?  Well they\'ve got, there are precedents, they\'ve got a history of doing that sort of thing with MK Ultra.</strong> </p>
<p>In my experience today in seeing that sort of ritual mind control and abuse, when I went to the Polygraph Institute, the Defense Academy for Credibility Assessment, we had intensive study on the relationship between the psychology and physiology, the body and the mind.  <strong>And we were taught that, especially between the ages of one to six or one to eight, that\'s the period when a human\'s mind is in its stage of development.  And if that infant, young child is molested or abused during that period of life, that twists their mind, literally injures their brain and their brain chemicals for the rest of their life.</strong>  And they usually deal with counseling for decades after that.</p>
<p><strong>Well, Satanic cults know this.  Pedophiles rings, of which there are international ones connected to Washington, DC, they know this.   So that\'s why, one of the reasons they target young children is once they can do this and once they, not only sexually abuse them, but they brutally torture them and in some cases they kill these kids.  That\'s how bad it is.  But in cases of mind control, and Satanic ritual abuse, they will turn these kids into young prostitutes, they will turn them into ritualists themselves, and they\'ll send them out to pimp out other young kids to come into the cult because during that young age if they\'ve been sexually abused or molested or tortured in some cases, they, they\'re marked mentally for life.  And that\'s why they attack that age group.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely not all victims &quot;are marked mentally for life,&quot; nor &quot;permanently injured [and] they can use them for their movement through the rest of their lives,&quot; but I don\'t think he meant every victim.</p>',

            Yes, I agree that circumcision is outdated and unnecessary. It serves no purpose and is painful and often risky for the baby.  I just can't agree that it's satanic ritual abuse.

           <p>
            While the Violence/Rituals being carried out by these human beings is very REAL ....
           </p>
           <p>
            "Satan" is the invention of organized patriarchal religion which underpins Elite patriarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Old World Religions which came thousands and thousands of years before these male-supremacist/all male god
religions had NO Satan, Devil nor Hell.  These were the inventions of Elite Patriarchy to frighten and control members 
of these religions.  And, as we look at the history of "Judaism" and "Christianity" they certainly did control the minds
of members, but they also controlled their sex lives, procreation and in fact they usually controlled the societies they
were part of.  And they brought tremendous violence to those whom they considered their enemies . . . . .
Nature,  Jews, Women, Homosexuals, "Pagans/Native people" and Africans.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of those hatreds and means of labeling others as "inferior" provided many ways to claim the assets of those groups, in fact to invade their lands and steal them.  It was also the means of de-powering females/Mothers who lost control over their children and the ability to protect them from torture and sexual abuse.
However, the VIOLENCE carried out by these very human believers in Satan and violent ritual are REAL and their violence is REAL.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             And, when we look at Abu Graib and the torturing of victims there, we see this torture combined with sexual abuse.
And the involvement of the CIA.  Imo, this was practice for the future, but very much based in their past knowledge of what torture and sexual abuse can do to the human mind.

            About 90% or more of those prisoners had been simply rounded up with no basis at all for their arrests.

            I'm sure that you know that many victims of sexual assault do not remember it until many years later.
The ability of the Mind to split may serve as a protection for the child where there is long term sexual abuse,
or where the child's spirit cannot cope with the memories of the sexual abuse.
Later, when the child is older, they begin to have "flash backs" and they now begin to try to deal with these events in adulthood.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the case of MKULTRA -- and what they did there will probably forever echo across our nation and the world even if it is now technically over -- it seems that some of the children in these programs did live into adulthood because of CIA's NEED to use them over and again.  Some of them were programmed with "Photographic Memory."
            <br/>
            However, I've also read that at about the age of 30 the mind begins to struggle to pull all of its parts together and this begins to also happen with "flash backs" of memories.  When that begins to happen, I've read that it becomes very dangerous for these victims as they are sometimes murdered.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you've read anything about the recovery stages of victims or the psychiatrists who have worked with them, you know it also became very dangerous for the psychiatrists who began to see that these weren't rare or unique events but that there was a program in operation for abusing these victims.

             Actually in one of the Shipp videos posted a week or so ago, he did talk about shutting the CIA down. Part of the problem I think, is that they are  so above the law there is no way to touch them. If CIA run businesses generate money, then even Congress shutting off their source of income isn't going to matter, and they have access to all the blackmail info on the judiciary, so who is really going to do anything?

              The CIA was founded using ex-Nazis under Operation Paperclip and many of the 200,000 ex-Nazis were also funneled into the FBI and other government agencies.  Many at lower levels, like John Stockwell -- and I presume Kevin Shipp -- recognized the evils of the CIA and left to become whistle-blowers.
             </p>
             <p>
              And how many of our members of Congress are CIA?
             </p>
             <p>
              JFK wanted to shut the CIA down and that was more than 50 years ago so you can imagine how
much more powerful they are right now. In fact, they now have an air force -- drones!
             </p>
             <p>
              These people are murderers and will use every way and means that the Mafia has ever used -
and possibly beyond that.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not arguing against the need to unite or the need for revolution -- now.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I do think that we have to begin thinking about how to de-power Elite patriarchy
which in fact was created by Our Founders and put in control here.... so we're not so
much "taking back" our country as claiming what is rightfully the people's country ..
and the native people's country.

               you raise really important issues. Its time that these "intelligence community" agencies start justifying their existence and showing transparent accounting. Creating false enemies and provoking wars just doesn't cut it anymore.

            omg, people need to stop calling things like wisdom teeth removal and circumcision are part of SRA (satanic ritual abuse). The abuse has to be systemic and done in the name of satan--neither of which applies to wisdom tooth removal by a dentist and circumcision by a doctor.  Does that mean that every hysterectomy, every root canal surgery, every removal of a tonsil is SRA?  Of course not.

            <p>
             there is no "has to" about torture.  Every Mother and every human being is capable of seeing a religious ritual like Circumcision is a lie -- and Torture -- and it's still a lie when it is based in the fakery of the child's health.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Foreskin IS A SEXUAL ORGAN.  And removing it, especially without any anesthesia is torture.
            </p>
            <p>
             Neither is a newborn capable of consenting to circumcision as one might expect an older child to consent to the removal of wisdom teeth giving them trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, as you look on the bright side, let me remind you that Rabbi's are NOT "doctors."
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact, our entire system of medicine based in "cures" which never come and 
invasive surgery needs to be challenged on a daily basis.  Not that circumcision
has anything to do with "medicine."
            </p>
            <p>
             If we are awake and aware as citizens of this country trying to protect one another
and our children, then we can look at ABU GRAIB and understand that our 
government/CIA used that opportunity to practice TORTURE on basically innocent 
people who were simply rounded up with no cause for suspicion -- and which they likely 
think will come in handy in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
             No dictatorship can exist without control by torture.
And the rise of fascism here certainly points in that direction.

             I agree that it's a big stretch.   but I do feel terrible for circumcising sons sometimes - even more so now that I'm learning about childrens' brains and pain etc.

             hysterectomies and root canals aren't elective (well some hysterectomies are but that's not done on a child without consent or understanding). But I see what you're saying.  I have 3 pediatricians in my family and they aren't satanic and truly believe that circumcision with anesthesia is a good way to prevent potential traumatic infections later in life.  They don't push them one way or the other, but they do them weekly -  all VERY Christian.

              Suggesting that someone is "Christian" isn't very helpful when we understand the history of "Christianity" --
its Papal Edicts which advocated "enslavement or killing" of native peoples here they equated with being
worthy of being fed to dogs.  Or the Papal Edicts which advocated the "enslavement or killing" of Africans
enslaved here.  Or Our Founders saving and supporting the system of Slavery here which guaranteed 
the Civil War which even further benefitted Elites by splitting the nation into two camps of hatred which
still echo today.
             </p>
             <p>
              Our Congress is something like 80% "Christian" and male and I haven't seen much good coming from them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Medicine in this country is pretty much just following what you're taught with little challenge.
And there is a good deal of long standing challenge to circumcision which exists and which is being ignored
by our doctors.

              Satan and the Devil are fiction - so is Hell.  They were created by Elite Patriarchy in order to frighten members of organized patriarchal religion which underpins Elite Patriarchy.
              <br/>
              The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy and to create the "one all male god."
These are male-supremacist religions which aren't worthy of support by anyone.

                However it is difficult to suggest that you are here to "save the children" when you show
such support for Organized patriarchal religions which are majorly involved in sexually
abusing children.
                <br/>
                Do you really have an open mind about these male-supremacist religions?

                It's even harder if you tend to be a "night person" (like me) who likes to stay up
late and check into what is happening around the world.  :)

                 I condemn the Vatican for their pedophelia, but believe their raping of children is done in Satan's name.  Not God's.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have the official catechism of Catholicism and all of the teachings are pure.  The Vatican has been infiltrated by Satan but so far no doctrine has been changed (this bad Pope has said nothing infallible). People don't understand the infallible thing.  It's only when doctrine is changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Jesus is all good.  Satan is all bad.  You can literally see that Satan is behind all this pedophelia.  I can even literally SEE abd feel Satan's presence in some people and places.  I have been able to since I was a 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So yes I do want to save the children from these evil predators.  Evil is real.  Just because someone calls themselves a Christian doesn't make them so.  The pedophile priests are evil and as far away from Christ as one can be as are these pedo politicians

                  So the very people who invented "Satan" have a neat alibi when they sexually abuse children.  "The Devil Made me do it."

                  And those who think they need "middle men" to reach their god continue to support those who are
being directed by "Satan" .... ?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also recall that Organized Patriarchal Religion didn't only create "demons" but also the concept of
"a one all omnipotent all male god."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  PLUS, there was a long and early -- and DEADLY -- battle with agnostics over the question of 
whether the Jewish man (Jesus) who arose in the Jewish population -- and who was in fact 
a Rabbi -- was to be considered "Divine and a "God" or whether he was merely human.
                  <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/markdroberts/series/was-Jesus-Divine/">

                  As for "doctrine" and "infallibility" .....
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Doctrine was changed by the beloved Pope John XXIII in Vatican II where he re-created 
the church as a democracy and instructed the people to use their own conscience and 
free thought and free will to decide for themselves whether or not to use contraceptives.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of course, Vatican II also challenges all of their teachings:  on Jews, on Women, on Homosexuals ...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And, on the licenses called "Manifest Destiny" and "Man's Dominion Over Nature" which they granted to
Elite Patriarchy to permit the exploitation of Nature and Animal-life and even other human beings 
according to various myths of "inferiority."
                  <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/markdroberts/series/was-Jesus-Divine/">
                   http://www.patheos.com/blogs/markdroberts/series/was-Jesus-Divine/
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  After Vatican II, there was a right wing coup within the Vatican and two succeeding Popes who 
were also ready to confirm the right of members to freedom of conscience even in regard to 
birth control, died early and questionable deaths.
                  <br/>
                  The fascists controlling the RCC had come out from the shadows.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Again, there is no confirmation for any "god" and neither is there any confirmation that a 
philosopher cakked "Jesus" even existed at that time or ever arose.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>

                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  So YOU are kind of like a "Satan"-verifier?  And do you also claim "infallibility" for your verifications?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  (And, btw, Papal "infallibility" was also invented by a Pope in 1864 or so....
After the French closed down the Vatican's Jewish Ghettoes proclaiming "All are equal" and 
then the Italians closed down their remaining Jewish Ghettoes in Italy and moved the RCC
back into the one square mile which it now occupies.
The Papal States were free of "Jewish Ghettoes" until Hitler reestablished them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Pope then went into hiding/isolation and when he re-emerged some long time later about 1864, he announced
the theory of Papal "infallibility."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Church then also re-entered another long period of anti-Jewish propaganda which continued
on for another 100 years and which was circulated widely by the Church through its periodicals,
journals and news outlets.

                   I'm saying simply that I believe Catholicism is good and holy and pure.  There are bad evil men that "belong" to this religion.  Yes I believe Satan is real.  No Satan doesn't make them do it.  They CHOOSE their evil ways and many practice evil horrors FOR Satan/in his name as they worship him.

               I have a friend who's son had recurrent infections beneath his foreskin.  It's not just the run of the mill type of infection.  These infections lead to the inability to urinate and can cause permanent damage.  It's extremely painful.  She said he'd howl all night.  At 2 she had him circumcised and she said it was horrible - way worse than it was when her other son was circumcised as a newborn with anesthesia.
              </p>
              <p>
               I knew I'd get grief for saying they're Christian.  They are good people. Two are my siblings.  My point was that are not performing satanic ritual abuse when they circumcise infants.
              </p>
              <p>
               I disagree with your assumption that Satan and Hell don't exist.  How one can study pedogate and not be SURE of Satan's existence baffles me!

               I also disagree with your assumptions on Christianity.  Christ is all that is good.

                Infections occur in eyes, ears, gums, skin -- everywhere on the body
when something goes wrong.  In general -- not in one isolated cases -- it is insane
to have a policy like male circumcision which actually is based in Jewish religious ritual --
which would be the equivalent of nipping off other parts of the body because of there 
being the possibility of infection.
               </p>
               <p>
                Meanwhile, males for how long now? .... have been deprived of their foreskin which is
a sexual organ.  It provides a good deal of the pleasure of intercourse for males and females.
               </p>
               <p>
                Once someone wears the label of "Christianity" it seems an automatic that they can claim to be 
"good" people.  I'm sure I could also tell you that my siblings are "good" people.  What would it
mean to you.  What should it mean to you?  Again, we have the example of our Congress which 
I've rarely seen anything "good" coming from.

                What you are suggesting is that it takes a "Satan" or a "Devil" to make people do criminal things.
That's untrue whether you are talking about Elites stealing from the public, or whether you are 
talking about Elites and their thugs carrying out kidnappings and sexual abuse of children.
               </p>
               <p>
                We also need to stop this brainwashing of young children by these organized patriarchal religions
as it seems to be very hard to recover from it.
               </p>

               <p>
                There is no evidence for any "god" nor any "Christ."
And it is evidence that is required, not your word in support of the idea.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again, male circumcision -- just like female circumcision FGM -- needs to be considered
a criminal activity.

            I think it is simply stunning that we as a nation of citizens who in the majority thinks these acts are abhorrent much less criminal and would crowd into a courtroom at the trial of some defendant accused of satanically ritually abusing a child. Then we have whistleblowers who are risking their lives to tell us that our own government has been doing this since WW11 and even when found out in the 70's destroyed all records allegedly under the Church committee.
           </p>
           <p>
            But as we know these programs never stopped. Each and everyday little children are placed into these trauma based mind control programs where they are visiously raped and traumatized, sensory debrived, tortured etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing that stands in the middle of us rescuing those children are the corrupt evil bastards working in Washington DC. And I know that military and white hat FBI agents, DOJ agents, uncortupted police will join us. These corrupt bastards have no power when it comes to the people. They have violated our constitutional rights. We are righteous in the need to organize, step up and take our country back from these criminals. There are 1000's of whistleblowers out here who can fill their positions immediately who are highly trained law enforcement, ex-intelligence who blew the whistle, etc that could smoothly take over. We have integrity and honor though that is why we left several years ago because morally you cannot watch such gross miscarriage of justice happen and turn a blind eye. So you speak and lose everything and are hunted for your silence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say all of us silenced witnesses take a stand together. Overwell them with truth. Hold a press conference. Throw the criminals out and let the heros who have been silenced for speaking truth and trying to protect children take back their positions and help turn this country around. Let Comey, McCabe, Debbie Wasserman, Gregrory Meeks, Andre Carson,,Deuth, the DOJ attorney's who are obstructing justice like Machando, Steve Wasserman, Channing Phillipd and of course HRC, Bill, CHERYL Mills, Huma Abedin, Anthony Weinergate, the rest of them be given notices they are the target now....suspend them all for Nationsl Security pending investigations.

             Amen! Alleluia!!!  Why isn't this happening?  I'm worried there's more bad than good in the FBI and CIA now.  Otherwise, this would have been dealt with and fully exposed by now.  They know the people are behind them, so there must not be enough good ones??

            <p>
             How can we coordinate this? Should we petition the White House?? We've done that already though, right?  I've signed so many petitions to the White House for this abd that - that I can't remember.  The latest one was the "lack of public interest" in Hillary.... my ass!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Sign everyone if you haven't.  38,000 signed, but we need 100,000 by the 28th.  REMEMBER:

                The signs are too many to organize of just free speech rallies; how can we get guys like William Binney (NSA whistleblower with incredible credentials) CIA (Whisteblowers) FBI Whisteblowers, there are ATF (whistleblowers) NASA( whistleblowers) I could go on,
               </p>
               <p>
                We need to organize a free speech conference that allows these whistleblowers to speak in one concert. I would pay for that. I would partipate. It would be non violent and attempting to shut down their speak should be arrested whether it is an terrorist movement.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just tell the American people the truth so we cab stop this evil and rebuild with moral clarity that is subject to scrutiny not by congress whimps who are getting side deals and being paid off by foreign governments but by fresh congress interestesed in the USA
               </p>
               <p>
                This would be nice but at this pace   it is necessary to take actuon for the safety if the country imo

                 the other shipp video post he talks extensively about the whistleblower retaliation, it seems that we need a constitutional amendment to outlaw civil and employment contracts that strip constitutional rights. It should be illegal for a corporation or agency to  invoke more power than the gov itself.

            I hate that he said the stuff about demonically possessed people and talked about aliens and David Ike and the like.  I think it will scare off normies who might otherwise have listened to him.  That said, I have heard of occultist people in the entertainment business obsessed with the concept of channeling spirits/demons so it probably isn't intentionally insane like "child trafficking on Mars" Robert Steele.

             Me too.  I almost didn't post the transcribed excerpt because of that.  But I don't know what other people can see "in the unseen" that I can't.

            I wonder if one of the reasons why circumcision is so widespread in the U.S is because of the huge trauma it causes to the baby which ends up altering his brain affecting reasoning, perception and perspective in a negative manner. 
This does remind me of trauma based mind control which is what was included in MKultra. 
Another interesting thing to add is, through out history were children who have been found ritually murdered by fanatic jews, they always found the children circumcised.  So this evil act have been part of ritual satanic sacrifices for a very long time and here we are having accepted it as the norm.

             YES!!!!
And more parents should be rethinking this religious ritual which does such harm to male babies.
The foreskin is a sexual organ.  The child is very certainly harmed by the violence/torture of circumcision.
And I've also wondered if it isn't a way to show the child that its parents -- especially its Mother -- cannot
protect him or will not protect him?
            </p>
            <p>
             This violence against male babies hides behind suggestions of medical well-being for the child which are simply lies.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need more challenge to this harm being done to male babies.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd also suggest that vaccines also be challenged as they seem also to bring us nothing but death of children
and new diseases being suffered by our children.  Here again, vaccines do more harm to male children on the whole.
That's because females have more glutathione circulating throughout their body which also protects the brain.
This is an essential clue to Autism and harm being done by vaccines.

             This is also done with female mutilation as well.  Imagine either one.  It is terrible and what a horrible effect this must have on the children when they find out the truth and that their parents allowed it to happen.  The Ultimate Loss of Trust in Your Parents.

             I found out by the nurse that the doctor who was filling in for my OB who circumcised my third son when he was a day old did not use ANY anesthesia - not even numbing cream!!!  I reported him.  I even wondered if I could sue him.  The nurse was furious.  I felt like I had failed to protect my baby.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before he took him, I told him to be sure to use anesthesia - I was on the fence about circumcisuon - and he didn't!  He told me Abraham told us to circumcise and that he'd rock and sing to my baby afterwards.  But he didn't use anesthesia even though I told him to.  I asked the nurse why and she said he forgot to order it and didn't want to wait 20 minutes for the cream!
            </p>
            <p>
             My son is almost 2 now and is perfectly normal, but I still get sick to stomach and feel like a failure when I think of this.  He's with me all day everyday though and is a very happy smart loving boy.  Thank God!

              Very much can identify with the way that you feel.
              <br/>
              Unfortunately, I left my husband to research new challenges to circumcision (he's circumcised) and that was a huge mistake.  No male who is circumcised wants to admit that he is "missing" something and that harm was done to him.
But it also very much disturbs me because I think the male baby immediately knows that his natural protector -- his Mother -- did not protect him.

              Why did you circumcise your son in the first place? Because the Jew doctor told you so? Will you cut your daughter's labia off too? You are a sick person.

              Wisdom tooth removal increases the risk of heart disease later in life. Not sure if anyone knows why. Could be due to elevated levels of the stress hormone Cortisol or inflammation pathways.

             It's also because they use the foreskins in make up. Women literally spread men's dicks on their faces. That should be a new anti feminist meme.

            Operation Midnight Climax. Also talks about Cameron using kids, taping high officials having sex w/them so he could black mail them to continue funds for his research. I'm sure this was successful for him to get what he wanted because we know this still goes on today re: blackmail.

             The One True God is going to wreak his retribution on your worthless soul.  He will banish you to an eternity of pain and sorrow.  You that sully his name and wrongly condemn his beauty will face his wrath.

              And by the way, religion is from a Latin word which means: to tie back or thwart from progress. I have yet to find a modern religion that hasn't been infiltrated by satanists. So go back to school, stone caster.

             i went to protestant church when i was a kid and accepted Jesus as the real savior and all. but i wasn't RAPED &amp; tortured and i wasn't threatened with death if i tried to leave the church. eventually i left and only occasionally go to church when i'm in the mood and it's a non-denominational church. lovely services &amp; they helped me out when i was having a crisis about 10 yrs ago.
