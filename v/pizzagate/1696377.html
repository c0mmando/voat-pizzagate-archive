  'formattedContent' => '<p>I\'m a genealogist with almost 40 years of experience. I did a tree for the Podesta brothers. I found their mother\'s obit (Mary Kokoris 1918-2007) which only mentions John and Tony Podesta. From that I would assume that they don\'t have any siblings. Tony was born in 1943 and John in 1949, so neither appear in a public census. The 1950 census won\'t be public until 2022.</p>
<p>John and Tony\'s father, John Anthony David Podesta (1910-1980) first appears in the 1910 census with his parents Antonio Podesta (b 1872 Italy - d 1949 Chicago) and Mary Frances Gazzolo (b abt 1879 Genoa, Italy - d 1956 Chicago). The census was taken in April and John was born in January of that year, so he was just a few months old. John appears with his parents and siblings in two more census (1920 and 1930). In 1940 he appears living in his sister Della\'s household, with her husband Mitchell J Slove. In that census, Della was 38. In both that census and the 1930 census she and her husband aren\'t enumerated with any children, so it\'s likely that they didn\'t have any.</p>
<p>In the 1910 census, Antonio and Civele Mary Frances Podesta have two other children besides John (who was the youngest) and Della. These were Marie and Rose.</p>
<p>In the 1920 census Marie no longer appears. An Illinois index of deaths and stillbirths show that Maria, dau of Tony and Civelle Podesta had died in Mar of 1918. In addition to Della, Rose and John, two more children appear: Lawrence age 7 and Raymond age 2.</p>
<p>The 1930 census show only John, Raymond and Lawrence still living at home. Another daughter, also called Maria was born on 9 Jul 1920, but she died the same day or was stillborn.</p>
<p>In the 1930 census, Rose appears with her husband, Al Lisiandrella and their two children, Katherine age 5 and Michael age 3. I was unable to find this family in the 1940 census, but further research shows the husband to actually be Joseph Lisiandrello (b 1904 Italy - d 1964 Chicago) and the two children to be Katherine Adele Lisiandrello (1926-1976) and Michael Anthony Lisandrello 1926-1999). These two would be first cousins to John and Tony Podesta.</p>
<p>Lawrence Podesta (1912-1982 both in Chicago) married Della M. Mecca or Meccia (b1927 in Chicago) I was unable to locate any more information for these two. Incidentally Lawrence and his brother Raymond both appear in their parents household in the 1940 census.</p>
<p>Raymond Edward Podesta was born in Chicago in 1918. He died in Newark, Licking Co., Ohio on Christmas Eve 1996. I was unable to find any further information about him, regarding a marriage or children. He enlisted in the Army 19 Jun 1941 and was listed as single, without dependents. He finished his military service in 1943.</p>
<p>So, I was unable to find a link between Don Podesta and John and Tony Podesta. That doesn\'t mean it\'s not there, just that it\'s beyond my ability to investigate from home.</p>
<p>If anyone wanted to look further, they could look for obituaries for Raymond or Lawrence Podesta and see if any children were mentioned there. Also, a trip to the Cook County, Illinois courthouse or Licking Co., Ohio courthouse might turn up some additional info.</p>
<p>I would start by looking up their death certificates. Often the informant is a child of the deceased. (Lawrence died 12 Aug 1982).</p>
<p>For Lawrence, who married Della in Cook Co., Illinois on 21 Apr 1954, looking for children named Podesta born starting 6 mos or so and continuing on for 10 to 15 years forward might turn up something, if these records are open to the public. Doubtful because Cook Co. is such a metropolitan area.</p>
<p>There\'s a marriage for a Raymond S Podesta (not E for Edward, but that may be a transcription error) can be found in the Cook Co., Illinois marriage index. This person married a Mildred Grek on 26 Feb 1944. The marriage license number is D86FBC5F-C173-46F1-A982-C42400080632.</p>
<p>I just found an obit for Della Meccia, wife of Lawrence Podesta and John and Tony Podesta\'s aunt by marriage. Apparently Della and Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Podesta only had 2 children, both girls. They\'re named as Della Podesta wife of the late Dan Cunningham and Angela Podesta, wife of Dan Sepke. Della and Angela are John and Tony Podesta\'s first cousins. Here\'s a link to the obit: <a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?pid=181196252">http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?pid=181196252</a></p>
<p>I think I found Raymond E. Podesta\'s family although the link is a little tenuous. I found a Raymond Podesta who is living in Newark, Ohio. He is related to a Mildred (remember Mildred Grek?) and a Kristi and Michael Podesta. Well Kristi is Kristi Kaufman Podesta, wife to Ray Podesta, and mid 60s insurance agent living in Ohio. His brother, Michael C. Podesta, age 74, lives in VA and is married to Bette, age 79. They have 2 sons: Joshua age 42 and Alfred age 44.</p>
<p>So, unless Don Podesta is related to John Podesta further back than a 1st cousin or 1st cousin 1x removed, there doesn\'t appear to be a link.</p>
<p>I\'m new to VOAT so keep that in mind but if I can I\'m happy to show the census or any of the other records as a jpg. I\'ve made my tree hidden and private but can send anyone who wants to see it an invite. Keep in mind that you have to have a subscription to ancestry to see all of the records attached to the tree, but anyone can get a free, two week subscription.</p>',

            So the brother, Alex Podesta, (what I've heard over and over) is supposedly an artist. Would it show if he was adopted? He's weird like the Podesta brothers if this is him. He loves adults dressed as bunnies

             If this is a brother, why wasn't he mentioned in his mother's obit? Chicago has a very good birth index that I can check later to make sure but I wonder if he is their brother.

              I looked thru voat. I found this...

             <p>
              So, according to this thread, this is the right guy but we don't know if it's his brother. It was floating on Twitter that it's a brother. So I don't know how he's related.

              I'm not sure. I've heard from people here and Twitter about another brother. I know that they said he's an artist. I think his name is Alex but not sure on that one. This particular Facebook may not be the one right Alex. We need to try to find out.

             IDK but we have a restaurant named i Fratelli and it is awesome. I looked it up and that word means brothers in Italian. Wondering if this Brian Podesta thing is for real.

              Someone above posted about Brian Podesta. She had more than I was able to find, but it lined up with my initial research. Apparently his family is originally from Minnesota.

            Great post, OP!  I see you did not take your husband's advice and researched and posted anyway.  I will tell you that some of us are driven to expose these horrible people.  Precaution is good though.  Looking forward to more postings. Too bad, Brian Podesta didn't flush out of this search.

             I saw the Honeybee's youtube video on this and that's what prompted me to do my tree. I totally thought they'd be connected, after seeing that pic of Brian and his brother and parents with Bill Clinton and the WH. The name Podesta means mayor or someone in a leading capacity, so, all Podestas aren't necessarily related. But, if Brian Podesta's family goes back to Genoa too, the family probably is related, but way back. But this doesn't really mean anything. Most people don't know their family beyond grandparents and first cousins.

            I'm working on a word doc, right now, that will make things more clear, with documentation attached. I probably won't be finished with this until Tues. or maybe late Monday.

             I could try. What makes a tree for him harder, is his age. Believe it or not, from 1940 back is a piece of cake for this country. So I might find lots for his grandparents, but maybe not his parents. Also, Greek ancestry is hard because much of their records were destroyed. That only applies to stuff that happened in Greece though. If his family lived in the US, no problem.

            I can try the screen shot but you won't be able to tell it from the standard tree, as what you want to know is cousin type relationships. I'm not saying that Brian Podesta is not related. I'm saying he's not closely related (nephew or 1st cousin, 1st cousin 1x removed). Here's why: John Podesta has only one sibling (Tony) and he doesn't have kids, so no nieces or nephews. Because of the same surname thing (Podesta) common sense says to look at John Podesta's father's side, since that's where we find that surname. It's certainly possible, but not super likely, that a sister to John Podesta's mother also married a Podesta, which would then give us Podesta cousins from the maternal side, but again, not likely. So, I found all of the siblings for John Podesta's father and traced their children and didn't find a Don, Brian or PJ Podesta.  It's possible that one of John Podesta's father's uncle's lineage traces down to Don Podesta and his family, but then you have to ask yourself the liklihood that he and John Podesta would be close, being that they would be 2nd cousins and Brian Podesta would be John Podesta's 2nd cousin 1x removed.

                No. They go by their adopted name. I wasn't going to post anything about them because they seem to be innocent, but their parents are a little sketchy. I'm going to post a thread since I just found an article about the mom, Tony's ex-wife being a state dept. employee. I won't post the kids (well, they are clearly adults) names, but they can be found easily by searching.

                 husband adopted Tony's 3 kids when they divorced.  One was quoted as being 31 in 2014.

             I'm not so sure doxxing people who may or may not be involved in anything is a great idea. You posted all these Podesta and Alefantis names and addresses and phone numbers. That could very easily blow up.

              If government agencies such as the FBI actually did their job this would never happen.  But guess what...pizzagate happened and is still happening.

             I can't take a screen shot but I'll make a descendant list and post it on here a little later. I don't have snap my screen on my computer and my husband (who has it) doesn't want me fooling with any of this.

               Assuming you are using a Windows pc

2) open a program such as Paint
3) place the cursor into a blank new document
4) press CTRL + "v" and it will paste the screen capture
5) you can then Crop the section you wish to save
6) upper left tab of Paint or whatever program is "save file" option
7) save under ".jpg" type and give it a name

                    Windows has the ability to remove this information built in, which is really handy. All you need to do is select a photo or group of photos in Windows Explorer, right-click on them, and hit Properties. Under the Details tab, you'll find a link (near the bottom of the window) that says "Remove Properties and Personal Information". Click that, and hit OK in the window that comes up. You'll notice that you'll have a copy of each photo in that same folder. The copied photos will be the one with clean data, which are safe to share with your friends on Twitter, Facebook, or other places on the web.

            Hi - thanks so much for that.  There was an article that said J&amp;T's mom "adopted 25 people" but then said nothing else about them &amp; no one can find anything about them.  Sorry if you were already aware of this:

             I really think the adopted 25 people is just saying she was close to them, had them over for holidays, etc. I can't access adoption records but common sense tells me if these were truly adopted children, they would have been mentioned by name in her obituary.
