<p>Here\'s a blog about his involvement in interfering with child abuse investigations: <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/cometothestable/apps/blog/">http://www.freewebs.com/cometothestable/apps/blog/</a>

<blockquote>
<p>But as the nuns began to address the abuse crisis Kurtz and Vann Johnston launched a campaign of calumny and slander to discredit the sisters and close the monastery.

<p><strong>Cardinal Justin Rigali</strong> : <a href="http://imgur.com/a/odgXy">http://imgur.com/a/odgXy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>5. Cardinal Justin Rigali, former Archbishop of Philadelphia.</strong> The level of abuse experienced by children in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia under Rigali’s predecessor, the late Anthony Bevilacqua, is epic. As described by the National Catholic Reporter’s Tom Roberts: “Bevilacqua oversaw priests who were involved in nothing short of sexual torture of youngsters.”</p>
<p>As Robert Huber of Philadelphia magazine recounted: “Instead of being reported to the DA’s office, pedophile priests were moved -- sometimes repeatedly, from parish to parish to parish. Abusive priests kept right on abusing children.”</p>
<p>Rigali’s claim to fame is that he did nothing to stop it.</p>

<p><strong>Cardinal Burke</strong>: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/yRDQo">http://imgur.com/a/yRDQo</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapnetwork.org/vatican_cardinal_burke_to_be_ousted_by_pope_abuse_victims_respond">Vatican- Cardinal Burke to be ousted by Pope? Abuse victims respond</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In what a noted Vatican journalist calls a “decapitation,” and “a move without precedent,” Cardinal Raymond Burke – who had a very sorry tenure running the St. Louis archdiocese (2003-2008), “is on the verge of being demoted” from head of the church\'s highest court to a “purely honorary role” and an “ecclesiastically very modest title” at “the behest of Pope Francis.”</p>
<p>While in St. Louis, Burke was often reckless, deceptive and callous regarding predator priests, vulnerable kids and wounded victims. He expanded the troubling practice of importing sexually troubled priests from across the US, letting some of them work in local parishes and letting others stay in church facilities that are secretive and careless about public safety.</p>

<p>The spiral cozier seems to have quite a history and I think can be traced right back to the <strong>sickle of Osiris</strong> or the <strong>sickle of Saturn</strong>.  <a href="http://www.markbeast.org/mark-beast-paganism.html">http://www.markbeast.org/mark-beast-paganism.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serpent crosiers were commonly carried by bishops and high Catholic Church officials in the Middle Ages. They claim that the crosier represents the shepherd’s crook, but it can be traced to the divining staff or augur of Pontifex Maximus of ancient Rome who inherited it from the priests of Babylon. It is unrealistic to assume that shepherds of nomadic existence would use wooden rods with handles like the one shown or anything like it. Common sense would have them use something straight and not entangle themselves with when having to fight off wild animals. Thinking about plays representing the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, it is absolutely disgusting to see shepherds hold staffs other than straight wooden rods.</p>

            Who ever said this doesn't know anything about shepherds.  You want a curve at the top of a crook, because that it was what you use to hold or control a sheep.  They still use them today.

            I personally believe the spiral is based on
            <a href="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emat6680/parveen/fib_nature.htm">
             The Golden Ratio

            As for surpression of history and information, I have read many times that the Vatican has vaults full of the stuff and that was the original purpose of the sphinx. Hopefully with the beauty of the internet this is something one day we can use to share. I think it is the energies and vibrations they care about surpressing the most.

            In Greece tourist locations they seem to sell jewelry with this symbol on almost every block. I think they call it an infinity spiral or something. I'm pretty sure they also sold jewelry very similar to the triangle pedo symbol.

            I agree the Polaris connection could be deeper. Because of the word Tolerance being related to the heart progress search as far as pizzagate. Because I found the spiral used by gay and or pedophiles alot as regular, a symbol of tolerance and i did a post on heart progress tolerance as far as those three words as a search and the macabre side of heart transplant medicine pops up i think its related puzzagate and such, but im pointi g out the spiral probably theorized well before our grandfathers were alive, A preplanned symbol of mind contro leaning toward tolerance of the anti natural. Maybe begotton or begat (hee hee biblical) by the tree of life which has the symbolic spiral branch in depictions used by gay rights and sexual Tolerance activists all this is picture from the Church of the Tree of Life ovwr

            At its most generic, the spiral is a focus of force and so can be a kind of portal.  In cults which overtly or covertly worship Saturn, the Black Sun, the Rose, power and immortality are thought to be gained via sodomy and sacrifice of children.  Grotesque and repulsive as it is, the anus is the portal for the sacrifice.  It is confusing because not every symbolic use of a spiral refers to sacrifice, but may refer to natural forces like the wind or water.

              This is our only time to strike back at them.  Before we couldnt see enough of the picture to see the patterns.  Now before they take every last bit of our freedom we are communicating to each other the reality we all live in.  But we must win now or forever be lost.  Soon they will rewrite our genetic code to make us serfs with no desire for freedom.  A flesh robot.  While they implant their personalities onto computers in the vain desire to live forever.

            The spiral is the symbol of hypnotism. Pedophiles use hypnosis to abuse the child victims. Because of this pedophilia is symbolized by a spiral.

               Imagine it this way.  They are united in evil.  They realize the simple fact that you dont have to control everyone all you have to  do is get your evil minions to the top of all the important institutions.  So an organisation that looks into child trafficking is a prime target for infiltration.  So is law enforcement.  I would imagine most of the top leaders in the worlds law enforcement agencies are tainted.

               I certainly think Polaris is suspect.  That's why I started the pizzagateTNT subverse - to research the technological companies that claim to be fighting child trafficking and abuse.  Why do you think the problem continues to explode globally when we have all this sophisticated technology?

                Yes, we have suspected some of those, but thanks for adding those new ones. The good thing about knowing we are being lied to, is that we  know it.
