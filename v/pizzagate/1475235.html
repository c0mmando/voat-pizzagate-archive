             You know that Aaron Schwartz built this thing. This isn't a normal website. It's highly vulnerable to democratic unrest. If enough people are dissatisfied we could just bankrupt the company. It's totally within our hands, through sabotage. We could get spez and censorship removed no problem. This depends on the userbase, but I think the_donald would already be enough to make the site unusable. They'd lose clicks like crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
             A part of me wants to see that. Democracy in action can be a beautiful thing. And I like the thought of Aaron's genius revealing itself to the current owners/abusers.

             I think this is already the prelude to an assassination.(not that they haven't tried already) I hope we have a higher power involved here because if this goes down it will get real ugly.

              Assassination is nothing, can't kill thousands of people one at a time without raising suspicions.  Attempts at massive destabilization events, the only hope would be to drown the story in actual chaos.  Create a smokescreen and then they might try their luck at hunting again.  And all this is to say nothing of the what will transpire if the truth of government wide corruption gets out, people will be out for blood, likely including some foreign states looking to get even.  If your neighbor can't be trusted to look at information by the media critically, how do you think they will respond to calls for action by their "heros" even if acting as rogues.  They don't need to manufacture fear, only weaponize it.

            I got suspended from Reddit yesterday for allegedly engaging in "vote brigading."
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone had posted a link to a pizzagate post which was all angry with people investigating it and talking about the recent incident. I read the post, saw a comment I thought was funny, and up voted it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then later I got the suspension. Apparently that was "vote brigading" somehow because the person was linking over to the post on another subreddit in order to drive
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            traffic over there. I don't recall what the person who posted the link on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            said in their post about it but I don't remember anything about trying to get people to take any kind of action. I had no idea I was doing anything wrong, and wasn't trying to "vote brigade."
           </p>
           <p>
            I replied to the suspension asking for more details but they have replied as of yet.

             It's the Podesta network calling in all the favors. Every part of the ring. Total war. If they loose, they go to the gallows. They understand that.

              I have been saying this in real life to my one friend who is also a believer. Gave me chills to see you type this. I am STAUNCHLY against the death penalty, but in this case, when it is leaders like this doing something so corrupt and heinous examples need to be made and we must all NEVER forget what happens to these kinds of depraved  people

               True. This isn't even a political thing for me, this shit is as spiritual as it gets. We're fighting fucking devils.

                I always make this point. Whether you are an atheist, agnostic, Hindu, Catholic what ever, these people believe what there doing works. The Clintons, Podestas and Soros of the world wouldn't worship Satan for funsies. When people play Bohemian Grove rituals off as a joke it makes me nuts. They honestly and genuinely maybe killing and raping our kids in praise of Satan FOR A REASON. I fear what that reason is.
