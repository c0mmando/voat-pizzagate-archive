            Is this an avenue a web developer could possibly confirm or debunk as a possibility?  Does anyone have any suggestions for possible key combos or dead end site branches to test them on?   I was thinking IIV something similar.   I'm guessing if one exists it would be something open and upfront  like moloch, ba'al, pizza etc.   I think this might be something.  Open to both suggestions and thoughts on why it's unlikely. These individuals make a point of being public about what they're doing and I honestly believe their the type of people that would grant open access to anyone able or lucky enough to stumble onto them.

             If you're asking if it's possible, the answer is yes, it's possible. Seems like something the FBI could brute force their way into, though. And if it's as simple as the konamicodesites.com, then you can just view source in the browser and see the list of websites without entering the konami code at all. A website selling "Cheese Pizza" would probably be more sophisticated than that.
