<p>Investigative Journalist Jen Moore was found dead in a suburban Washington D.C. hotel room Monday, according to police and shocked and distraught friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>Moore died of an apparent seizure. Police are closely investigating the cause of death after former FBI Agent Robyn Gritz, a friend of Moore’s, made inquiries with homicide detectives Monday afternoon in Prince Georges County, Maryland. Preliminary reports from police said the death was not the result of suicide.</p>
<p>Moore’s body was found by employees at the Country Inn &amp; Suites by Radisson, Washington, D.C. East – in Capitol Heights, Maryland. The investigation is ongoing. An autopsy had not been scheduled as of late Monday.</p>
<p>Moore, an advocate who investigated abused and trafficked children, had been in the process of investigating allegations by a 26-year-old man that — as a young boy — he was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and pimped out at private sex parties attended by other D.C. elites.</p>
<p>In fact, just four weeks before her death, Moore filed details of the alleged victim’s claims with the Department of Homeland Security, detailing the allegations against Clinton. Moore contacted Homeland Security beginning on July 6th through July 9th, records show. A week later, she contacted the FBI with identical details about the victim and the shocking allegations against Clinton.</p>
<p>FBI sources report no case has been opened on the evidence supplied by Moore. Homeland Security officials could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Moore had approached True Pundit’s Thomas Paine in June with the allegations against Clinton. Paine conducted a series of face-to-face interviews with Moore and the alleged victim in various locales. By July, the victim agreed to tell his story to Paine. But Moore and the traumatized victim wanted to contact Homeland Security and the FBI first to see if they would open a criminal case against Clinton prior to publicizing the claims.</p>
<p>“Jen thought that with a criminal probe, federal agents could use the victim possibly to dangle in front of Clinton to see if he made a mistake or tried to pay him off,” Paine said. “She was worried about the safety of the victim and was working to find him safe harbor until this story broke.</p>
<p>Now she is the one who turned up dead.”</p>
<p>Paine and True Pundit were vetting the details provided by the victim. Paine said the allegations were “credible” and the victim’s testimony and details were beyond convincing.</p>
<p>Paine said Moore accepted the risks with the story and understood things could get very ugly very fast. Per conversations with True Pundit’s Paine:</p>
<p>“She was worried about the victim because he was the first to break the ice,” Paine said. “There were others waiting to tell their stories but he was the catalyst.</p>
<p>Did she think she could be harmed? Absolutely. This woman was fearless. Absolute warrior. A former cop. I don’t think she was afraid of anyone or anything.”</p>
<p>According to interviews, the victim, in this case, claimed he was sexually assaulted by Clinton on a yacht in New England and knows the identities of several other child victims who were subjected to identical abuses. The victim also confirmed he witnessed other children and people being physically abused and possibly worse on numerous “boat parties.” These parties were attended by elite members of D.C. political class, according to Moore and the victim.</p>
<p>Moore supplied these details to federal agents and documented the interactions with a number of alleged victims. Within a month, she is dead.</p>
<p>In the exchange below, Moore discusses an extended stay with the alleged Clinton victim after his interview with Paine. During the interview, the victim sporadically vomited and shivered as he recalled details of his alleged abuse, Paine said.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thomas Paine says he was working with Jen on something HUGE! He said he is releasing it starting Tuesday in the A.M. everyone needs to make sure he is protected because he just announced that publicly.

I believe it was Thomas Paine yesterday who tweeted that what was being investigated was two abusers of Isaac Kappy. I had the link and tried to share it on Voat all day yesterday while it was down.

            This is tremendously sad news, not only as she was doing some amazing work, but also as her epilepsy got her.  I am epileptic, too, and know how the stress can cause seizures to hit.  (Ironically, due to some major stress in my life currently, I had two seizures this past week.  Fortunately, my husband was with me, and I'm almost back to normal.)  Sincerely, I hope this was not induced some how, and missed by the autopsy people.  :(

            Its a real warning to everyone if you have info don't bother going to authorities just dump in on the web and lower the chances of anyone whacking you - and if they do well it just draws attention to the case. If Trump was doing his job properly these deaths would have ceased by now. But as it stands its the community that takes the brunt of it while believing that Trump has their back - wake up he doesn't !!

            This shit sucks. We can't play the game if the other side keep eating the pieces. 
Thank you mods for scraping down the walls. When in pig heaven you don't make waves in the mud.

            Imagine the trauma and PTSD those kids suffer from.  The people who do these things to children are those screaming on their death beds because the demons come to drag them to hell.

            The Clinton's have proved time and time again they can get away with murder. I wonder why the seth rich murder was botched, must not have been the normal guy they use.

            Just an aside, since Vindicator said there isn't any evidence that Jem777 is Jenny - George said to find TaskForce on Patreon to search up Jem. I don't remember where he said that. I tried, and couldn't find her on Patreon. I regret that I didn't, I would have loved to support her in life.

             Yes, but we're all born with natural intuition and a god given ability to use discernment. It's not hard to know and understand the term scientists use, yet don't even follow, that there is no random pattern in a coincidence. These are happening in random patterns and that is no coincidence. People who call out these "unspeakable dregs" as Mr. Breitbart had done, he ended up dead, as have these others. What is causing all of these Hollywood movie stars to suddenly off themselves in a time when the world is changing. People don't just randomly off themselves. You may say "I can't believe they did that." How did I not see the signs? I have had three friends kill themselves, one being a girlfriend, and the signs were there we just didn't realize it until after the fact. What signs did Jen Moore show that she could possibly die of a seizure? The signs we have seen is that people were actually trying to kill her. That's the evidence. We have no evidence showing she was sick or had some illness. Our evidence is that people were trying to kill her. Let that sink in.

             </p>
             <p>
              So far the folks who have talked about this are people who knew her
             </p>
             <p>
              Webb
Robin the ex FBI
True Pundit

              Basically all of them were colleagues of her.    Ordinary deaths don't make the news unless you live in real small town.

                 If there has been no autopsy, how does anyone know if she had a brain aneurism or a seizure or whatever else is being claimed?

                 Also, I've seen no proof that Jem777 and Jen Moore actually were the same person. I know zero about Jen Moore. Everything I personally saw from Jem777 on Voat does not fit with the wholesome image people seem to have of her. In my dealings with her, she was disingenuous, evasive, made numerous unsourced claims, was combative when asked to abide by community rules, refused to do so, expected special treatment, and constantly claimed she was being victimized.

             I’m sorry. I was suspicious of her and stayed in touch with her on Twitter privately as well. I’ve saved things. I saved Voat conversations before in case I ever needed them. I’ve had them in the cloud.

             Thanks for the heads up, but I wont amend anything. I don't believe what we're being told is the truth. I don't believe this Jem/Mej user is who people are saying they were and I don't believe this user has or ever had voats best interests in mind or any community within voat for that matter. I
             <em>
              do
             </em>
             believe this user had control - or was part of a team that had/has control of this army of bots that's been spamming voat for a long time. I also believe this Mej/Jem user is a part of a much larger disinformation campaign that's been raging for well over a year and this campaign has done irreparable damage to the Pizzagate community so much so that I honestly believe they were wholly successful in spreading their disinformation to the degree that much of what the pizzagate community believes as complete fact is actually manufactured specifically to mislead and in many cases completely made up.

              If the accolades about Jenny Moore are  NOT warranted as

             <p>
              far as accurate reporting, I feel a person should question True Pundit also.

                They've been right about some stuff. But I have noticed ever heavier monetization of their site, and a clickbaity approach. I only know of one confirmed instance of them spreading disinfo, and that was when they shared that LeMonde article interviewing the Saudi princess who claimed PG was happening. The LeMonde article shared was fake. LeMonde confirmed they never published it. When I notified TruePundit, they did not publish a retraction. I don't know if they took it off their site.

                 It has been my understanding that they didn't take it off their site, even when you alerted them at the time that it was fake; they even pushed it via their Twitter.

                  Someone needs to do a deep dive and look into what other verifiable disinfo they've published. I haven't followed them much recently, but up until summer hit, I saw their stuff daily on my Twitter feed and didn't see much that was questionable. Definitely needs looking into.

                 Thomas Paine of True Pundit claims the following in his twitter bio.  These are almost all certainly lies.  If they were true, you would be able to identify the person.  The Polk Awards don't even name Nominees.  They announce the winners of the Award and that's it.

                 Of course, my introduction to True Pundit was when he claimed that the NYPD seized Anthony Weiner's laptop and the FBI took it away from there.  Disproved by Federal Warrent and by the IG report.  I believe True Pundit to be an active participant in that hoax.

                  Wow, good info. Thanks. It is starting to look like most of the people who trend or end up promoted in some way are blatant propagandists. I'm so sick of propaganda I barely even bother getting into these stories unless they are independently verifiable.

                 News of Jen supposed death stirred me up about
Andrew Breitbart, Michael Collins Piper and  Max Spiers
deaths because appeared to be similar death circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Those deaths hit me hard.

                  If you or anyone else has time to make a post examining Jem777's conduct here on Voat, and explore what may be going on here, it would be very valuable. I realize that will make you a target. But it needs to be done. We are in the midst of a bullshit hurricane at the moment and it appears to be sweeping just about everyone up. I am having trouble keeping up.

                    That does seem to be the consensus. What I am wondering is if shills were taking advantage of her real life reputation to LARP as her with the Voat accounts.

                     I was wondering the same thing vindicator. There is something really not right here and things don't add up! On top of that, we are being bombarded with trolls and accounts that have been inactive for some time trying to shame everyone and get us to run with emotion instead of digging for the facts and using logic!

                   Interesting, Vin. Apart from the stuff we know about Jem777, as I said - I have never heard
                   <em>
                    any
                   </em>
                   allegations about BC being into male children. And now they suddenly have a bunch of male survivors? I don't buy it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Not that I could not see BC raping a male child 'for a change' - maybe he did - but I don't buy the story in this Jem777 context.

                    If you or anyone else has time to make a post examining Jem777's conduct here on Voat, and explore what may be going on here, it would be very valuable. I realize that will make you a target. But it needs to be done. We are in the midst of a bullshit hurricane at the moment and it appears to be sweeping just about everyone up.

                   can do it, if she has the time? She's the one here who interacted the most with Jem777, IIRC.

                    Cathy O'Brien stated that Bill Clinton and Hillary are both bisexual, Bill more on the homo side and Hillary more into girls. Obviously this would include boys, hence Pizzagate and pedo island.

               Thanks for the heads up, but I wont amend anything. I don't believe what we're being told is the truth. I don't believe this Jem/Mej user is who people are saying they were and I don't believe this user has or ever had voats best interests in mind or any community within voat for that matter.

               You and many others here on Voat are dead wrong about JEM.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why are all of the mods and their crews piling on with such hate and disinformation about a Voat user who was just murdered?

               We know JEM in real life.

              </p>
              <p>
               She is a great person who truly cares about others, particularly victims and children.
              </p>
              <p>
               JEM is MEJ, and is Jen Moore in real life. We Are Sure.
              </p>
              <p>
               She was threatened by Are We Sure and many others here on Voat.
              </p>
              <p>
               She was assaulted in real life and could barely walk.
              </p>
              <p>
               She partnered with George Webb Sweigart because he was one of the few people close to the Truth with a following on YouTube.
              </p>
              <p>
               George Sweigart is so far ahead of anyone else except for Q, Thomas Paine, and a very small group of other investigators.
              </p>
              <p>
               None of them see eye to eye, and none of them are revealing the real Truth. They are all holding back something.
              </p>
              <p>
               She wanted to sway him to reveal the real Truth and join the Good side. She kept trying until her very last day.
              </p>
              <p>
               George Webb Sweigart is not a Trustworthy person like JEM.
              </p>
              <p>
               George is associated with many bad people including known con artists and liars. George plays all sides.
              </p>
              <p>
               He was her friend however and she is really dead. She was murdered. This is not a hoax.
              </p>
              <p>
               Both George and JEM were very close to different angles of the Truth. Neither knew everything, but only one of them was Trustworthy.
              </p>
              <p>
               George did not commit murder yet is not wholly innocent. George knows much more than he is telling.
              </p>
              <p>
               JEM believes in the real Jesus Christ. JEM knows about the secret societies and partnerships involved.
              </p>
              <p>
               JEM was correct about a lot of her research, and was subsequently attacked on Voat for that as many others have been.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyone that gets close to the Truth is attacked on Voat from all sides by evil doers and tricksters.
              </p>
              <p>
               JEM left Voat to stop fighting with fools, agents, shills and fakes, and took her research to the street.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
               This is much deeper and darker than anyone realizes.
              </p>
              <p>
               That much Q is right about. Q knows much more.
              </p>
              <p>
               JEM was murdered for knowing The Truth and she is not the first nor the last.
              </p>
              <p>
               She was a victim. She met with other victims and was a fearless investigator.
              </p>
              <p>
               So many of you are here to purposely attack real victims and real whistleblowers.
              </p>
              <p>
               So many of you are misinformed about JEM, or are Evil and corrupt and spreading false information.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look back to her research. She was getting too close. We Are Sure.
              </p>
              <p>
               JEM knows The Truth.

                I had suspicions way before Jem left Voat. I talked to her a lot. I would take screenshots of our conversations. We remained “friends” by staying in touch thru private messages on Twitter. I kept those screenshots too. Why? Because I knew she was disinfo and I wanted to keep track of her. I’ve caught her in many lies. She always wanted to feel important. She would exaggerate everything.
               </p>
               <p>
                You don’t find it suspect that she stood up for George Webb from the very beginning? She knew him ALL ALONG. She leaves California, and right away I find out that she’s staying with George Webb. She spent every day of her life traveling with George Webb. A stranger? Bullshit.
               </p>
               <p>
                Look back at comments. She was very protective of him. Who do you think is letting George Webb survive? He researches and calls out all the bad characters in Washington, on LIVE video. He would have been silence long ago. He was allowed to continue. He’s even said he was Mossad. He had a drinking problem and would say things and then regret it.
               </p>
               <p>
                I’ve caught them in a lies because she would tell me one story that I knew was bullshit, not knowing that George Webb was going to talk about it on video. That made me confront her. I don’t want to put myself in danger by saying too much either.
               </p>
               <p>
                I’ve been debating for a couple of days on whether I should share some of this. I don’t want to disrespect the dead. But I can promise you, YOU ARE WRONG. If this is Sara, I’ve got things she’s said about you too and what her agenda was in regards to you. I’ve often wondered if you worked together SARA.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have tons of info on “Sara” because she was my stalker with tons of accounts here, on Twitter, youtube, and more. I have a long list of that too. I kept screenshots from our conversations when it was happening. I set out to investigate them both. I blocked her several times. Jem told me that Sarah was the smartest researcher here. Sara is many of the names on that shill list! Jem and Sarah talked EVERY DAY. After Jem found out that I was getting really suspicious, she told me that Sara is dangerous and to not talk to her anymore.

                Before you go run your mouth with some new account, acting like you know everything, you better know your facts. You say us mods can’t be trusted. I can back my words up. Can you? You say us mods can’t be trusted because

                banned her. I wasn’t even a mod at the time and I KNEW she was giving disinfo. Vindicator was doing his job.
               </p>
               <p>
                We aren’t shady. Users who get mad need someone to blame. Some NEW profile making a post glorifying Jem, tried to make people distrust the mods, and even Voat, with NOTHING TO BACK UP THEIR CLAIMS, is very suspect to me.

                 As someone who had many disagreements with Jem777 (mostly re GW and her lack of evidence or dubious sources), I agree with your assessment of the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 She seemed to be in control of an online "army" for want of a better word and they harassed people. This same 'army' posted positive comments on the "American Hero's" Youtube channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Imho, the combination of alcohol and pain killers contributed to her paranoia and possibly her ultimate death. Spending all that time with GW no doubt contributed to her paranoia and fed her conspiratorial fantasies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't believe she has any credible evidence although I do think in her mind she was doing the right thing, whatever that may be...

                  She wasn’t the one that was drinking and on pain killers. She tried to avoid pills. She would have a drink but the alcoholic was George. I have gathered a bunch of screenshots and have been organizing them. It would open people’s eyes. I have been struggling on what I should do because I don’t want to disrespect the dead. But, people shouldn’t make her a martyr and trust everything she has said,

                   She always argued that those who opposed her and GW were "on the wrong side of history."  I think Voat/pizzagate contributors need to know the truth.

                 Thanks for giving your perspective, srayzie. A few links supporting it would probably be good.

                 tried to help her get her post in order and she refused. This was the very last problem post, but there were several of them, and she refused accept the submission requirements. Instead, she recruited various different users to try to get her reinstated.

                 he? she? was faithful to do the job.  Actually I have viewed this

                 subverse since 12-2016 and have felt that

                 when David Seaman and others spoke.  She helped me through it and I think

                  Thanks for the kind words, Plan. I remember that shitstorm. Largely organic, though that wasn't clear at the time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don't think it was a manipulated one like this one we're in now, though. Do you suppose it has anything to do with the fact that Q is posting the Podesta Art swimming pool pics as we speak? Nah...that's just a coincidence.

                   Thank  You for your comment.  That was manipulated only by a few voaters I think.
I felt uncomfortable with the people that were guilt tripping and pressing me to go.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So many sincere pizzagaters  back then.

                  <p>
                   As of this Jen matter.  I follow Q. He wrote the previews are over so this is a heavy week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think adversary is trying TO DISTRACT us this week.  Q writes (last week) next  week
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   and Jen is found dead over the weekend.  I do not think the Podesta matter solely kicked this off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   oh no  when will  the murders stop?
Thinking about prior fatalities  etc.
Researched nothing but Jen death for two and 1/2 days.  Pretty much

                  <p>

                    I've got business related house guests -- and had to explain why I was stuck on this computer all day. Blessing in disguise, because now three IT execs have been redpilled about Q and pizzagate. I read them aloud some of the stuff from the board and explained what was going on. They were amazed. Seeing disinfo in action is VERY convincing. Funny how things work out. :-)

                     Now you are threatening others who know her in real life.

                      Who said I was hiding anything?  Your kind are teetering on the edge of a cliff, and you don't even see it.  If things don't get much better, very quickly, you'll find out exactly what I mean.

                      I wish I had.  I didn't know this person, but I can see the evidence of her being a disinfo shill.  She deserves all the bad things that happened to her.

                      Because, if she did know the truth, she tried to hide it from others.

                I think we're being Corsi-ed here.

                You're making a lot of claims but presenting no evidence of them at all, while hiding behind a one-day-old account. You really think this is going to fly on Voat?
               </p>
               <p>
                Are you trying to whip up emotional folks here to sow distrust? Or are you trying to play 3D chess and make Voaters who see through that crap doubt the people you are claiming you support?

                    well, if theres no obituary, no official record, its 'ALLEGED' murder/attempted murder
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    ONCE we have fully established in fact that she is dead and was murdered, THEN we can entertain your line of reasoning

                    what makes me suspicious is your refusal to engage in fully establishing Jem's death, and persisting with this community wide flame-thrower attack

                     Well said MolochHunter. All many of us want is some documentation of what happened instead of relying on 3rd hand information from some questionable sources. Once we get the information we can assess and make a decision. We could just run off emotion but facts are what matter. There's nothing wrong or evil for wanting facts.

              <p>
               is  she  had presented evidence to at least

            It sounds to me like her mistake was approaching the FBI where a mole was alerted to her info.

            I became aware of this yesterday, knew nothing of Jenny, but I figured retweeting some of her stuff might help.
Within 20 mins, Twit locked my account with no option to unlock.  I have 250 followers.

            90% chance her info is 100% legit.

             PS:  Our field agent offered the actor "Jenny" help on several occasions, this is all documented.  He obviously denied our help because his entire story was a fabrication.  He was never in any danger because he is a special agent with Mossad and I am within my jurisdiction to make this statement considering the grave deviations from decency made by the agency themselves.

             Hello,
            </p>
            <p>
             I am Special Agent Rouse with the Las Vegas FBI.  "Jenny" is in fact George Webb.  So for the sake of yourselves, I suggest you put a stop to this tom foolery pretty quickly before you land yourself in some trouble with the Federal Government.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Jenny" is a fabrication, hence why no main stream news outlets have covered this obviously staged hoax.  We're getting pretty tired of having to clean up after you boys, so maybe you could just cool it and let us get on with our jobs.  Since we have the sanctity of public trust to ensure.  Don't get me started on the academics within this group who have made absolute fools of themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cut it out guys.

              The pattern of main stream news covering/not covering something has become a contra-indicator of validity.  Everyone is aware that it is now used primarily for propaganda.  Your appeal to that as an 'evidence' of a hoax demonstrates either willful deception or ignorance.
             </p>
             <p>
              What is your goal in threatening people who are looking into this?

                 no reason to disrespect, if it is a LARPer than good for them. I still feel like honor and dignity comes from respect without presupposition, following actions and proclamations are worth scrutiny with good intention

                  i don't honor or respect total liars who want to come here to manipulate and play games for some weird reason. If you are seriously not certain if this is a larper and weren't able to figure that out within their first 5 words then I have some serious concerns.

            min 21s   →  ~ 46min   Dr. Giordano states:  "Nanoparticulate matter … high CNS-aggregation material that is essentially invisible to the naked eye…these are then inhaled through the nasal mucosa or absorbed through the oral mucosa - they have high CNS affinity, they clump in the brain or in the vasculature and the create a hemorrhagic diathesis …in other words a clot predisposition in the brain.  What I've done …is created a stroke agent…"    (that is difficult to detect.)"

            Wouldn’t be amazing if Jen’s death takes the Clintons to prison because this story blows up all over the Internet.  Her death would not be in vain.   Jen loved helping the victims. This was her passion. She knew the risks involved as we had discussed them.  We both said we were willing to die to move our country into the light and out of the reach of the Cabal. Jen was willing to give her life to take these bastards down.  She will not be forgotten.

              Is there any confirm from medical examiners.. PG County (where I’ve lived) I’m assuming would conduct in Balto. Do we know case officers in PG Detectives handling it? Important questions to run down.

            Thank you so very much for everything you did Jem777. I had no idea who you were in life but I remember you on here. I will be watching all of your videos in your honor and hope maybe we on Voat can work through what you uncovered. The Clinton Coven is evil to the very core and we know they have their own Navy Seal mk ultra assassins to take care of people anywhere in the world at any given time. Why they chose you means you were doing extraordinary work and well onto the right path. You are what we need more of in this world. May you Rest In Peace and may those involved in your death feel the wrath of karma like never before...

              JEM is a Patriot.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seth Rich may someday prove to be the Patriot that JEM is, however there are many unanswered questions about Seth Rich including if he ever actually died or was a co-conspirator. Seth Rich's family ties seem to suggest the latter, much like Donald Trump. To assume that Seth Rich was a Patriot, one must also assume that both Julian Assange and Donald Trump are Good people, and that Donald was selected to Drain the Swamp. Neither Seth Rich nor Donald Trump are Trustworthy, nor are Julian Assange and Wikileaks.
             </p>
             <p>
              JEM and George Webb Sweigart did not see eye to eye on everything, and their differences escalated over time.
             </p>
             <p>
              JEM is Trustworthy. George is not.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               NeonRevolt also suspiciously removed a comment about JEM recently when his site went down for an extended period of time.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              No other prominent YouTuber covering Pizzagate or the Great Awakening has yet proven to be Trustworthy.
             </p>
             <p>
              They all have been given the same opportunity as JEM. They have all Failed. It is not a short list.
             </p>
             <p>
              JEM knew about the real Agenda.
             </p>
             <p>
              JEM knew The Truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              RIP JEM.

            If she was looking into the Clintons, then this was another Clinton Body Count. Probably ordered by either the Clintons or Aquelino.

            Former FBI Agent Robin Gritz was a fellow whistleblower who was wrongfully dismissed by Andrew McCabe  after 16 years working counterterrorism.  She said that upon learning of McCabes dismissal that she along with another dozen agents were  quite happy to hear the news.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully she can assist in verifying Jen Moores research and formal complaints regarding childtrafficking and the Clintons.

            The oppositiion might have gone too far this time. George Webb is claiming he was responsible for getting the hotel clerk to.open Jens room. He better have an  explanation as to how Ms. Gritz did the same.

            There is an assassination unit that works for the DNC. Their activities have been proven time and again. Frankly, some arenas are best left to those who understand how to survive the workings of deep shadows and it is not independent journalists.

            Oh my
This is so sad. This is why the Clintons and their canal must be brought not only to heel but to be tried and put to death to rid the earth from their evil. Jem wouldn’t stop and paid the price, but I for one will not stop and many others as well will not stop trying to get the truth out. This is a silent war but a war nonetheless and the kids must be saved from these sick people. The damage that the mass murderers known as Clinton’s makes hitler look like a schoolboy. 
Jem was one of the top contributors here she will be missed. May the Lord Bless her.

              Where one dies, another two step in her place. We have the hive mentality. Like swatting bees as Alefantis said in an interview. This will just make more people determine to root out this evil. We can hear them breathing and are coming for them.

               As noted by this indi reporter (Jennie Rodriguez-Moore/San Joaquin Blogs? confirm) who appeared to be a LEO watch dog, the garden-variety diddlers are easy to nab, even the dark web dudes are getting locked up; its the institutionalized organized pathology, or Pedocracy where Chan\Voat crowdsourcing won't be enough IMHO. MSM has a lock on cover-up until its hand is forced. Fast trials: death sentence would be too kind.
               <br/>
               I didn't see any info on JM in WTOP then over to NBC Washington, Interestingly enough, there's a post about a 1000 affected kids in the hands of the church: Grand Jury Report Released on Child Sex Abuse in Pennsylvania Roman Catholic Dioceses. So, where's the news item for JM other than some what's published in alternative media? Any hits on local news ANONs?

             upset me knowing her valor and who she was. So many times I wanted to shut down Jem777 naysayers with the truth about who she was. I didn't in respect for her anonymity, I hope now people will can reevaluate their positions.

              is not ban happy. He gave her many warnings. It’s not right to make him the bad guy now because she passed away. The mods are always the one to blame. Of course Jem did nothing wrong right? People don’t know the whole situation so you shouldn’t make judgements.

              I concur ! Why is there a thread dedicated to Jem777 and all her alleged bot accounts posted as a sticky here ? Have you seen that and what is it all about ? She only had 2 names that we all knew of .

              I didnt catch the whole thing so my opinion aint the most qualified, but it seemed to me Jem777, undoubtedly well intentioned, just went off the rails with the stress and danger of what she was doing, and was fragmenting here on voat.

              didnt ban her without repeated warning and recommending she take some time out to cool her heels, and i saw the posts where she wasnt observing submission rules
             </p>
             <p>
              was Vindicator vindicated in banning her? Who's to say definitively.  But it wasnt without some level of merit

               Perhaps this is a good time for reevaluation. What if we appreciated people for their intentions and the good that they do? When you are in the trenches like Jem777 was, perhaps she would go off the rails at times. It would be unrealistic to think that she did not know her life was in danger with the political climate the way it is? Re. Trump, I often think of the freemason law of reversals which seems to be very important to them. i.e. Obomba smiled at his wife, made great speeches and held his children's hands often in public. Trump ignores his wife and children in public...can't make a speech and the pedophiles and rapists being exposed are  unprecedented in American history. Doesn't this come under draining the swamp ? The number of lawmakers who are resigning? To me.......it is reversals.

               I agree with your assessment. I just think it would be respectable to un ban her original account for good merit.

              I don’t know how they came up with Jem777 being a bot ? She has been here since the beginning and I think this is all a set up . Several of us have conversed with her over the past 2 years . She was real and was very passionate about children as we all are .

                I, for one, would like to know the answer to this question, too. I've seen no evidence, and my experience with the Jem account does not jive with what people are saying.

                 Oh gosh.  Which link?  I'll fix it if I am able to.  If it was one of those long archive.org addresses that needs to be copied and pasted into a browser bar, perhaps the entire address was not copied?  That has happened to me.

                    just to add to my reply to you:

                   <p>
                    I just now noticed you had asked me not only who made that list, but did I make it?

                   <p>
                    No, I had nothing to do with it.  I simply read it when it was a sticky recently at the top of Pizzagate.

                     I don’t know how they came up with Jem777 being a bot ? She has been here since the beginning and I think this is all a set up . Several of us have conversed with her over the past 2 years . She was real and was very passionate about children as we all are .

                     I just came across something that may explain why Jenny Moore/Jem777 allegedly had so many Voat accounts - she seemed to claim she didn't know about them, I don't know -- this is all so sad:

                    The thread was posted by someone named Camulos, in politics according to the link, but he/she indicated (near the top) that the actual author of the list was brandon816.  And of course I am not either of those people, I only have this account.  Does that answer your question?

               was saying Jem777 was associated with spam bot accounts, and would write as a person through Jem777.  I think.  I do not understand how these things work.

                v/pizzagate

              <p>
               I wasted a ton of time earlier on in Pizzagate fact checking some Jem777 comments, as I fact check almost everything in general, only to find those Jem777 comments were not based in any fact but sounded eloquent.
               <strong>
                Nothing earth shattering,
               </strong>
               just, as an example, so and so owns a house on such and such island and they do human sacrifice - no sources.  Or, leading someone else's thread's comments based on misidentification of a person in the OP as someone else who has the same name - but doing so very compellingly.  Eventually, when I found zero of Jem's comments I fact checked turned out to be true in any way, I refused to read any comments by Jem777.  I'm sorry, I really don't care if most on here love Jem777, that's fine with me!  I'm not spending any more time thinking about that account.  I'm just confused over why people identify Jenny Moore with Jem777?  Do you or does anyone else know why that is?  Thanks!

             I am finding that some are saying that GW had something to do with her death. I never followed him so don't know much, but do know that some accused him of being with Mossad.  IF that is true, well I suppose it is possible.  But that's a Big IF.  I also have read a couple comments dissing her because she posted some of GW's info.  There are many following Q and GW and others, I am not going to dis those people because of their choices.  These are very strange times in our history and many lies are being told.  It is hard to know what the truth is and who is telling it.  I watched the video last night of GW telling of her cause of death, and wondered how he knew so early in the game.  That should make us wonder. SMDH.

               She was taken in by GW for a short while.  Plenty on here Idolize him.  The longer she was with him the less she trusted him.  I am tired of posting things on Robin Young's twitter.  I am doing the research and knowing Jem as I did on here and from proof presented by many on twitter, being Young and Sawyer.  That is what I based my decisions on. Amen.

                I don't understand why anyone would trust GW. Especially after making the fake call to the FBI. But wasn't that partly on a Q message? I seem to recall all these people posting about all these ships moving in because they were going to arrest HRC and then use the military to enforce martial law? That Q post seems to have slipped many Q fans memories also. If only ONE thing he posts about comes true, I'll publicly apologize for trashing him, but GW? No, he's a clown. Makes me doubt people when they believe in someone that is that obviously a fraud.

                 GW is disinfo  I agree. Too many are ready to believe that someone on a White Horse can ride in and save us.  We are Our Saviors.  WE must do the work.   We cannot keep believing in others.  Only US and Jesus Christ are the Saviors.  We must pray for his help and work hard to beat down the rapists and those who are doing the Devil's Work.

                  And support those who are helping. It means supporting our POTUS who has willingly put himself in the middle of a war. I've never seen a president take this kind of abuse, and some were not that popular, but this? This is unprecedented. It also means supporting Assange. He is not "Our Savior" on the level of Our God, but he is a savior in terms of letting us know WTH was going on. I can't thank him enough for that. Even with all the rancor, I'd rather have read those emails and learned what those people were like. I would have never dreamed they were absolute scum. Never. Not without those emails.

               You should read the comments in the Sticky about Jem/Jenny.  They have Taken Her Down with Flimsy Evidence and it was horrible.  Shameful really.  These are our own people taking down One of Us.  It was hateful.

              I find it horrible that anyone would try to implicate George Webb in Jenny's death. Him and Jenny worked together for over a year and he would not have had anything to do with killing her.  He went looking for Jenny because he hadn't heard from her and that's how he found out she was dead.

               Are you aware she was posting on the chans how she felt he was using her to her to get to her research for free? She said she was done with him! And that was 3 days before her death. Seems like a good motive.

               Well, I never followed him I did my own research, as many others here did. The fact that he sent someone else to check on her stands out and I am sorry but his first report of her death, just didn't cut it for me.  That's just my personal opinion.  I don't know whether he personally had anything to do with her death, and we really don't know  that she really is dead, but he has been connected to Mossad and possibly with the CIA.  These may all be untruths to you for you are one of his followers, all I am saying at this point, as usual we don't have much to go on.  His announcing her cause of death just hours later, is very very strange indeed.

                 Imo, he should have gone himself if he was that worried about her.  He wanted us to think he was crying, I watched his video.  If he was so very moved and so connected to her, then why didn't he go himself?  I believe they were not as close as he implies.  I don't know what is behind that, but there is proof that I have posted that she was not that close to him.  She found out she had read him wrong.  Whatever that means.

               Seemed maybe.  But not sincerely.  There were no tears.  They put the camera on the other guy because he didn't want us to see his face.  I don't trust him.  I have been on the fence about him, and this just sealed it.  He also had word about her cause of death.  According to him Jem was still alive yesterday morning.  So, he had that info by last night?  Only someone well connected to whoever took her out would know that.  Way too early.  I am sorry, at first I thought the same as you, but the cause of death thing was just too much.

                Actually, there were tears. My gut reaction was that he was acting...that he purposefully produced those tears for the camera. Just my gut...but who knows. Watch the first 2 and a half minutes.

                 Yeah, wow is right.  I think she was on and off about Webb.  There are many possibilities here.  But no one knows for sure which answer is correct.  She could have found him out and was thinking of exposing him or since she was under the Witness Protection Program, possibly they asked her to feed them info on him.  She is either in hiding or someone killed her.  Like I said, too many answers.  And I bet here are more.

              I'm shocked she was hanging with him and went with him. As intelligent as she was I just can't believe she couldn't see he is probably truly mossad and highjacked much of pizzagate.  I do believe her death indicates their preferred method.

               I don't know if he had anything to do with it, but it's like getting into bed with AJ. Why? If you're doing legitimate work, stay legitimate and don't get involved with the fringe.

               Somehow I think there is more to this than we know.  I don't trust GW and I do trust her.  She was way too honest and smart to get taken in by him.  Something just doesn't add up.  Was she working on something with the White Hats?  Working on exposing GW?  Either she is being protected or someone took her out.

             I’ve just done a repeat post on this as I didn’t see this submission. Had no idea this was Jem777. Didn’t she have to change her handle and back off a while ago because of threats?

              <p>
               No.  She changed her handle because she was banned.   When she came back, she let everyon know it was her.  She did not try even to hide it.  JEM came back as MEJ.
              </p>

               She was banned because she kept violating posting rules is the reason that was given.

                  You could easily prove your innocence by giving what I've been asking for, an hour by hour account of your whereabouts between 5 pm 8/12/2018 - 5 am 8/14/2018.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You keep ducking us in that regard.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Guess that shows yes indeed you WERE involved in her death. Only the guilty have something to hide. Looks like you're very guilty.

                 <p>
                  Due to those images, nobody trusting you, and your silence during the day of her death, a significant chunk of people here now think you were involved in her death.

                  A claim you could easily disprove by giving an hour by hour account of your whereabouts from 5 pm 8/12/2018-5 am 8/14/2018 (local time zone).

                 <p>
                  If you are truly innocent in her murder, you better fucking explain. Right now!

                  Your silence regarding those whereabouts is quite telling.

                   He's going through it for the following reasons:

                     That image of a decapited corpse he sent to Jem along with those map coordinates. He better explain his motive for that.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     He was eerily silent all day at the date of Jem's murder.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     He CONSTANTLY refuses to answer when questioned.

                  </ol>
                  <p>
                   All he has to do is truthfully make an account of his where abouts during the time of the murder. Yet he won't do it. This is making more and more suspiscious.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There's an old saying that "only the guilty have something to hide".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   His suspicious behaviour makes me SINCERELY believe AWS had something to do with that murder. He could easily disprove it by coming clean, then I stop permanetely. But he doesn't. Defamation is about INTENTIONAL falsehood.

                    You could EASILY shake all suspiscion off of you regarding Jem's death by simply coming clean with that account. Yet you don't.

                    Come clean and all suspiscion goes away. Its that simple.

                    You don't capitulate to the demands of shills. You put them in the hot seat and throw endless hate at them. Make them feel like the unwelcome vermin they are.

                    He could easily prove his innocence right now. He's been silent.

                    He probably doesn't regret sending Jem that image of the decapitated corpse in the Arch of Hysteria pose, because it was INTENDED as a threat (ie AWS is a liar).

                     I get where your coming from , it’s hard to follow along in that thread so a new one focused solely on these questions would be good IMO . Not  caving into AWS demands , just think it would be more powerful with its own thread .

                 Thanks for the video.  I am reading this post through my tears.  I am finally coming to the realization that she is gone (but not ever forgotten).  We have lost a True Patriot  here is another video from 5 days ago.  She explains why she is at the Manefort Trial and how it all connects to Child Trafficking through a coup by Obama and HRC of Ukraine.

                   Odd to me too.  I have always been on the fence about him, especially since I didn't follow him, except for a few vids.  Too busy.  But now I am have thoughts.  One thing, is what you just mentioned and how quick he came up with the cause of death and the no tears report.  He should be seriously researched.

                    I followed his Awan videos in the very beginning, but always with a critical eye . He started saying pizzagate was a distraction etc , I knew he was off . He also said people would be getting paid 1k dollars per tweet for exposing this eventually.. 😂  so alarms went off then too . Everyone needs a human savior it seems and it’s hard not to fall into the trap. Even ones who say they are woke follow you tubers who they depend on for accurate info , without doing the work themselves .

                     That's what got us into this mess. We believed without verifying.  We just trusted them blindly because we didn't believe humans could be that evil and vile to their own.  Animals are kinder to their own and to others. I am glad to know that she did not trust her completely, good to know.  He acts like she did, and she did not.  He also seems like they were much more involved than they were.  He should be so lucky.  Maybe she was using him to get info to help with her investigating.  And he found out.  I said maybe, so shills don't bug me.
