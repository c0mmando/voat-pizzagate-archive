<p>If you don\'t know who Michelle Martens is, she actively sought out men to sexually abuse her 9 year old daughter, VICTORIA. She found a man and started dating him. A month later, the sad excuse for a mother became sexually aroused while Fabien Gonzales and his cousin raped VICTORIA. They then strangled and dismembered her. Michelle and Fabien then had sex. VICTORIA\'s body was found the day after her 10th birthday. </p>

<p>Her name was VICTORIA and we need to stand up for her and other children who are being and have been sexually abused. October is not really that far away, but it\'s far enough away to get people involved and create solid educational materials to distribute. </p>
<p>We need to focus on attending child rape/murder trials and spreading awareness in front of courthouses where people who will be receptive to our message and join in the fight. Please add any other upcoming trials, and create your own threads to bring more awareness to this effort. Be sure to mention that these demonstrations are peaceful and educational. </p>
<p>We also need to be present for the trials of those who have sexually assaulted animals. We know these sickos know no bounds and begin with animals who, like children, need us to speak up for them. </p>

            Thanks for spreading this, another sweet, innocent victim. There is no one but us to stand for the children.  Please come together for the sake of our future.  Each child violated will likely grow to be an abuser.
