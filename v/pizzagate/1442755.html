<p>Take for example this interview of James Alefantis by NPR: <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/11/27/503489400/fake-news-surge-pins-d-c-pizzeria-as-home-to-child-trafficking">http://www.npr.org/2016/11/27/503489400/fake-news-surge-pins-d-c-pizzeria-as-home-to-child-trafficking</a></p>
<p>In this interview, James Alefantis made numerous false statements and those were never challenged by the host, Linda Wertheimer. For instance James Alefantis said <em>&quot;there was a worldwide conspiracy theory [...] that\'s sort of an insanely complicated, made-up, fictional lie-based story. This was a coordinated political attack.&quot;</em></p>
<p>We all know that PizzaGate started with very real materials (emails, photos, FBI reports etc.) which aren\'t made-up in any way. Also, James Alefantis mentions a coordinated political attack. I wish he could have expand on this. Who this attack is being coordinate by? For which political purpose?</p>
<p>We cannot let this type of fake news unreported!!! I created this thread to discuss strategies on how handle fake news regarding PizzaGate.</p>
<p>As a starting point below are two suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use this thread to document (by sharing the URL) every fake news on PizzaGate.</li>
<li>Let internet users know that these sites are untrustworthy because they report fake news. You can simply do so by leaving a negative rating through the WOT plugin ( <a href="https://www.mywot.com/">https://www.mywot.com/</a> )</li>
</ol>
<p>Let\'s show MSM that we won\'t tolerate them pollute the PizzaGate debate by publishing fake news!</p>',

            You can get these guys working for you by debunking their fake news and using SEO techniques to hijack their search space.
           </p>
           <p>
            First step is to go through their main claims, identify logical fallacies and refute the false claims with solid links from credible sources.
Next step is to make a title that uses the original article's keywords. It's a good idea to use these terms in your main article as well.
Next step is to spread links to your page on the relevant forums.
If you've picked your keywords well the search engines will return your article when readers use search terms that match the original article.
