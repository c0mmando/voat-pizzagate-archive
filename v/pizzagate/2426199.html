            Usefull idiot? You or him? You really think he can't figure this out? Dawkins is a fraud, a cabalist. If not. he is dense. and idiot, special K. Dawkins is no idiot. Instead, he is a scumbag, hiding behnd legitimacy like the rest of them.

            This guy is a sick freak! Mild pedophilia is "ok"? I know people who were victims of his described "mild pedophilia" and it has caused them lasting harm including PTSD, anxiety, and low self esteem.

            Anyone who has read Cathy O Brien's TRANCE-FORMATION OF AMERICA knows that lasting harm can and does result.  I have spent my entire adult life trying to help just one victim, who will never forget and never truly be "normal".  People like this are colossally ignorant or deliberately complicit.

            Here's something mild pedophilia is: pedophilia. Again, as with the whole Milo Y. kerfuffle, I will support that Dawkins owns his own life experience and can talk about it as he wishes. But he is diminishing the gravity of pedophilia for EVERYONE just because he doesn't feel his own experience of it was problematic in the long run. THIS IS IRRESPONSIBLE and that is compounded by his visibility as an opinion leader.

            Mild peadophilia is similar to mild death. It doesn’t do everyone lasting harm. They say some people welcome it.

            The question I would ask him is has he, other than his teacher diddling with him, at any other time had any paedophilia contact on him or by him.   He leaves the question hanging, is he defending his own behaviour?

             It's best to realize that even the best humans have a bit of monster in them and never idolize anyone. I assume you're an atheist, so you reject the Bible, but it warns us about idols and false gods. Worship that which is good and holy and perfect in truth; you'll never go wrong. "ALL have sinned and come short of the glory of God". I'm speaking to myself as well. I have my hero worship too.

                 Oh, wow. So, you've still got some sand in your eyes from being asleep. It gets a little bit better, but not much. I woke up in 2004 when I was at a flea market and approached a book dealer who handed me Bill Cooper's Behold a Pale Horse and said I'd like it. Never met the dude before, and wish I could shake his hand now. Been a wild trip ever since.

                  I always knew the " powers that be " were corrupt , but had no idea how deep it all went. I also knew that " Religion " for the most part , was a racket . After 911 I started to wake up , but I never even imagined just how bad it really was . I stopped going to church because of the hypocrisy. One of my best friends proved that to me . She was a Sunday school teacher on sundays , after a night out drinking and slutting around the night before ! It made no sense to me as a young adult . Then when I decide to leave a certain church and tell the pastor that he was not preaching Gods word , but his own idealologies , he then told me " child the Bible wasn't meant for us to understand " ! That was enough for me to go running fast !

                   I felt the same way for a while about Christianity.  So many Christians don't even know what Jesus actually preached and certainly can't be bothered to practice any of it.  However, my mother said something to me which changed my mind about God (though not about organized religion).  She told me not to let the hypocrites keep me from God.  Just because there are those who call themselves Christians yet do not live as Christians -- you shouldn't let that turn you away from the message of Christ.  My parents weren't really religious.  My dad is more of an atheist (agnostic on his better days, I guess, lol), so we never went to church.  I don't need church to have a relationship with God, though, and I don't need a pastor or priest to interpret God's word for me.  I don't really have mainstream Christian beliefs.  I'm a red-letter Christian type myself (though that term has now been co-opted by white nationalists/neo-Nazis in an effort to deter people from Christ's message, I think).  I follow only the teaching of Christ.  No old testament for me.  You don't have to accept someone else's definition of faith.  You can find your own path.  I personally think that there are many paths that lead to the truth and it doesn't really matter which one you take as long as you eventually end up at the right destination.

                   I hear you, my friend! Everything's a lie and perception is everything. I knew in 4th grade that the church was mainly concerned with money. My family moved to a new state when I was half way through 4th grade, and the church of the Sunday school I attended confirmed at the end of the 4th grade, yet when we moved and joined a new church's Sunday school, they didn't confirm you until the end of the 11th grade! I was so upset. By the time I got to 11th grade, I was already questioning everything, got confirmed to make my parents happy, and never went back to church again.

                    When 911 happened , I was so angry! To think that someone might have the power to prevent human suffering but was not prepared to use it just boggled my mind ! I believe in a creator now , and the truth about who he really is has set me free , just like it says At John 8:32
and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. And I didn't learn that at church , I learned it sitting in my living room studying the Bible with a friend .

                     Absolutely! I believe there is a creator, but I don't believe in going to church. I feel much more spiritually in-tune when in nature and far away from mechanical, man-made sounds.

                       hope you don't mind me chipping in.  I grew up not going to church, then when I was 19 my boss, who I thought was great, died at the age of 42, he had 2 little girls, a lovely wife and a nice job and home.  I had just got married, so basically everything I was hoping for. It shook me, I thought what on earth is 'life' all about, if you get what you want and you die before you enjoy it?  This made me think 'beyond this life'.  (My mom was a prayer kind of woman who loved Jesus, but not a church goer, she did not like Catholicism as she saw them as hypocrites, this I assume is because my dad was a great Catholic when she married him, however, soon after he become an aggressive alcoholic wife beater).  Anyhooo... I decided to ask God what life was about.  My life took an immediate turn of events, I was transferred within the Bank where I worked to another department because of my bosses death.  It was into the Accounts Dept to work next to 3 lovely Christian Accountants.  I thought them quite weird because they used their lunch break to sit in the staff room and quietly pray and discuss the bible.  I used to ask hundreds of questions, why dont you drink alcohol etc., the usual.  After months of my questions I was asked if I wanted to go to the Salvation Army, one of the churches my now friend Ian went too.  He was leaving the Bank to go and become a Pastor in the SA, I could not believe he would give up such a good job to go and work for next to nothing, for God. haha  Anyway, this is getting too long, I went to the SA and gave my life to Jesus, years after I went to the Baptist Church and got Baptised in water....years later something still missing....I went to an Elim Church and received the Baptism in the Holy Spirit....that was 30 years ago and I have never looked back.  I love my life since becoming a Christian, I see things, especially motivations of other in a way most dont. I have not had alcohol since I was 19, always worked in schools colleges, voluntary work in Sunday Schools and Churches -  I would say, I am not religious, as I see religion as rules made by man, but I am definitly in a relationship with God and I do not have to go via any Priest etc., He has made Himself available to me when I asked him.  There are 100s of ways He has answered me and 100s of ways He has provided for me. I would not be the same person today without Him. - That was long winded but if you got this far thank you for reading.  :)  We are aware even more these days that evil exists, but lets not forget, we can draw strength and wisdom from God, if we care to ask.

            I appreciate the critical thinking and science love in these comments. Great post. Keep an eye on Dawks. Don’t let materialists browbeat you with their mindless followers and popularity. Keep your researching up and think for yourselves.

            I like how he advocated material universe and mainstream science while saying that his grasp of quantum mechanics is abysmal! A prisoner of thought of his owm making. A joke! (Am an Engineer, and I come from a family of prominent scientist and I put Dawking in Degrasse Tyson category - frauds propped up by the pedo/satanic/ globalists. 
Before one disses something he would be adviced to do some reaarch. Religion such as Christianity, New Testament (whether you interpret it literally or see it as an allegory - my view) is a necessary element in our culture and primary function of which serves as a moral compass, safeguarding us from the very abominations that has come to be known as PG! Dawkins is a traitor to human morality and to humanity in general. That useful idiot is oblivious to the fact that Darwin was sponsored by the Luciferians with the aim of denigrating humam to a mere evolved ape, divorced from God (again, literal or allegorical - all the same) thus legitimizing all his actions including such abomination as pedophilia as mere animal instinct. I really do wish to have my chance to debate with that fool and take him apart. 
I digress but, I must state Darwin's theory is not a scientific theory, for though it explains how species evolve it cannot predict!! And a scientific theory whether it's Newtonian Mechanics or Quantum Mechanics, or General Relativity - as mind boggling as the concepts may seem, they all predict! Now take a peculiar specie such as Leopard Cheetah (fastest land animal on earth, covers 100m in 5.95s!!!) It's DNA is so precise that you can graft a fur from one Leopard onto another and it will not be rejected! You cannot transplant human hair onto another - it will be rejected. Hence the ongoing quest to cure male pattern boldness. The conclusion is that the only specie that Cheetah could have evolved from is - Leopard Cheetah. I digressed but my point being that even though I do not believe in a creation (or the creator) I have qualms about denouncing idiocy such as Darwinian Evolution and its shill proponents such as Richard Dawking. He has served his pedo/satanic masters very well and subsequently he got rewarded.

             Better not fall for disinformation in regards to Hitler. The man closed the freemason lodges and occult societies in Germany, and most importantly, removed the synagogue of satan, that is, organized talmudic "jewry", from positions of power. Not a very good "Luciferian globalist" now was he? Also he was not funded by them. That is another myth that never dies.

             Hitler's thoughts on what you call "Luciferian globalism", which is nothing but talmudic judaism, masonry being but one branch of the beast:
            </p>
            <p>
             "My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was his fight against the Jewish poison. Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice. And as a man I have the duty to see to it that human society does not suffer the same catastrophic collapse as did the civilization of the ancient world some two thousand years ago—a civilization which was driven to its ruin through this same Jewish people." -in a speech in 1922

             Anyway, as for Dawkins, he is without a doubt a freemason as are all the puppets that promote science fiction. Look into whatever "father of modern science" and they are almost without an exception freemasons. This is particularly true when it comes to religious doctrines that seek to discredit the existence of God as we know him from the Bible. Religious doctrines such as Evolution, Big Bang etc., all invented by masons. For example, Darwin came from a line of prominent masons.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Dawkins is no doubt a child rapist. Being such comes with the territory of being a high-level puppet, it would seem. I would expect as much from him even if he hadn't uttered that disgusting statement of his. That only further enforces it, though.

              As I said, the ruling elite rule us along the fault lines. Christianity of today is world's apart from the gnostic Christian sect. Bottom line is, whether one believes in Literal Jesus or an allegory is all the same to me.

               Himmler was the one in the Nazi government that was very deeply involved in occult stuff. He sent researchers to Tibet. Hitler was able to gain access to High Society via the Thule Society, whose members were interested in Theosophy. They supported him when he was beginning to appear as a public speaker.

               The 'Vril Society' (spelling?) on the other hand, never existed imo. There are lots of myths and false info on the internet, and also in popular books, about Nazis and the occult.

             Biology and anthropology are fascinatingly complex. Just to replicate DNA, an organic molecule has to zip along the DNA strand at the speed of a train (in relative terms) covering the entire chromosome very quickly (which for our species has about as much data as the internet), It reads the DNA in front of it, collect the huge and complex proteins (and correctly fold them), carefully unzip the helix, arrange the proteins in the way that they were read, re-zip the helix, and lastly check for errors (flagging a protein alert if one is found). All of these happen in a barely understood way, because all that is detectable is the result, which happens very frequently (in the digestive system it happens in seconds). Materialist say that this molecular robot, a replication ribosome, happened by chance, Google it and select images. There are no good ones. It’s too small. The best argument they have is that we are too dumb to understand and that we should trust them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because of this complexity, self proclaimed ‘experts’ can step in and hypnotize the masses. The say “trust us, we know” and “ it is probably to hard for you to understand”. This works great for atheists, especially those WHO DON’T WANT God to exist (regardless of whether He does or not).

             I believe that viruses are the apparatus for changes in species. Check out the mimivirus. I wonder if a virus like this could be responsible for directing species to change. Then the question becomes “Who controls the virus?”. No transitional forms. Tons of inaccuracies. Tons of hoaxes. I teach that evolution is a respectable theory, because I have to, but I haven’t believed for decades. I used to believe in evolution. By the time I completed my studies in anthropology, I was completely red pilled. The odds against are astronomical, and all of its best points are cherry picked evidences, refuted hokum, or retracted BS. Blind faith, virtue signaling, cognitive dissonance and elitism keep it popular.

                 That speaks to your ability to reason. Its a shame that most refuse to feed their mind and farm their thinking respinsibilities out to others. Have you ever considered the mimivirus? I subscribe to the old school virology thinking: it doesnt eat/grow/repeoduce/etc... So it doesnt classify as a living thing. Viruses infiltrate and insert DNA instructions into cells of living things. The cells use thise instructions to do all of the virus' hard work. Check out a virus that has DNA for eyes, gills, photosynthesis, and abilities unkown from several species:
                </p>

                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 The popular explanation against the theory that I put here is based on a special theory of evolution for viruses. This theory has some very weak points: assumes evolution, then applies it to viruses w/o any evidence. Popular scientists dont want to consider the obvious; that mimivirus inserts instructions into cells that cause them to change and do things as a new 'species'. "Viral Selection" is a compelling theory, despite its censorship. Enjoy!

                This isn't far fetched, the facial features of young Hawking appear nothing like current Hawking. Either way, he's definitely a mouth piece for spreading propaganda.

                I think you are right, but even if he didn't die, I honestly don't think that he is actually speaking to us through that computerized voice.  Someone is -- but I don't think it is him.  It does seem likely to me that they have found a look alike who can't communicate and are using him to distribute propaganda because no one will really dare to harshly debate or criticize a "genius" in his condition.

                 Whatever's going on, it's definitely strange. All I know is that they're going to have to let him go eventually, whoever he is. They'll probably announce that he's dying, but they've successfully uploaded his consciousness into a computer, which will be put into another body. Hawking will then be immortal, and he will forever be a prisoner of the puppetmasters.

              I was lucky enough to know it was BS since I was a kid, just glad to see some others seeing it. I have to admit that it felt like I was the only member of my group sometimes.

                 I think Elon Musk is transgender, too.  People think I'm crazy when I say this.  (Who knows?  Maybe I am, lol.)  But I've thought that from the moment I first saw a photo of him.  Not that every man has to be super masculine, but he does seem to be very, very feminine (but not effeminate).

            I'm evil loves Pedophilia because it permanently poisons adults soul and converting it to evils toy.  But often the victim later experiences such sexual dysfunction that they either become sexual predators themselves or live a life devoid of pleasure that drives them crazy.

             It destroys innocence and purity, devils number 1 goal!  There is a reason Jesus said that it would be better for these evil perpetrators who harm children, to have a millstone tied around their necks and thrown into the sea.  Their judgement is coming, none of them will get away, even if they pass from this life. Matt18:6 - to atheists, it will happen whether you believe it or not!   It has been shouted from the rooftops for years here but people are only now beginning to listen -

              I don't like religion, have a scientific mind but can't conceive of their not being a higher intelligence that created it all. Not some man floating in the cloud but an intelligence. Nothing appears just randomly, especially something so intricate like a human being. We can say it's a result of natural selection but we can't explain how natural selection came about.

               I could label the intelligence as  higher, but   not healthier and not to be confused with wisdom. 
The world seems more like an intelligence wielded by a mad scientist. 
I can't wrap my head around an intelligence that produces decay and suffering without adequate instruction or reasoning.   Innumerable groups, or people, all claiming to have the truth have never yet pointed humanity to highest healthiness.  People are left wandering lost, and often lead to their inner core destroyed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whatever intelligence this is at its core produces, and enjoys or ignores its creation of a very poor model of a  bds&amp;m club with no safe-word and no instruction manual.
              </p>
              <p>
               Instead I see teen and adults  bodies  overrun with sexual hormones that consume them and they don't know what to do with it.  The physical and mental  survival instinct to stay in this and to keep this death system propagated is huge.
               <br/>
               Then enters millions of beliefs to keep it upheld and in place.
              </p>
              <p>
               I see nothing wise about any of this.

                I do. You've taken a materialist view but I do understand your viewpoint as I've questioned everything before. The world is a mess. The best way I can explain it is that intelligence had to move to matter (which isn't really matter but energy but I'm simplifying), to experience life through matter, through us. This intelligence loves us but for us to really love back, we needed to have free will and have consciousness...otherwise that love isn't real. It's like 'love' from a robot. We are eternal beings so death isn't really what we think death is
               </p>
               <p>
                When I was disillusioned, I said I was an atheist, God couldn't do such a thing as put us on this rock and leave us with these greedy monsters ruling us,killing each other, sometimes in the name of religion. It was a very bleak, cold dark time in my life. Things changed dramatically when I overcame these thoughts, I was then gifted with abilities, I will not disclose here. I know there is a creator but unfortunately I can't show you that but that creator loves you more than you've ever been loved by anyone.  I'm not here to convince you either as that's impossible but that's my experience.

              There are different types of atheists, just as there are different types of Christians, Muslims, Jews, etc.  If someone is an atheist just because they need to see proof of something before they can believe in it, I respect that.  Atheists like Dawkins, however, are atheist simply because they wish to destroy religion.  That is a very different type of atheist.  They don't mind people having blind faith in something -- they just want that blind faith to be science, not God.  Many of this type of atheists actually worship science in the same way that religious people worship a god or gods.  Their "holy books" are scientific tomes.  Their saints and priests (who cannot be questioned but should be followed blindly) are scientists.  They are pushing a religion themselves.  I am a fan of science (although I am probably not smart enough to understand a lot of it when it gets beyond the basics -- I don't have a low IQ, but I am certainly no genius), but I despise "Scientism".

               Since I was concieved I guess. I "assumed" I was Christian, but my family isn't very religious. My dad is somewhat "spiritual", but pretty secular and my mom says she is agnostic. I assumed they where Christians until I became an adult though because we didn't discuss religion much.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've been pretty free to choose my own belief.
              </p>
              <p>
               If I HAD to choose I'd probably be Christian, because most Christians are moderate, but just with muslim extremism, Christian extremism is pretty bad.

            He's an atheist.  People who don't believe in God tend to think they can do whatever they want.

             I wouldn't say that is true of all atheists (some people just have a hard time accepting something that they cannot see or perceive themselves), but the big selling point for atheism is this idea that morality is not absolute.  They like to think that the laws of morality are arbitrary and mere superstition, but the fact of the matter is that society cannot function without morals and ethics.  Science itself is amoral.  That is what makes it possible to do such marvelous things as find cures for diseases using science while simultaneously doing such horrible things (such as scientific testing on unwitting human subjects, creating biological weapons and weapons of mass destruction).    Science used for a moral purpose is exceedingly good.  Science with no morals is exceedingly bad.  That is why you cannot divorce science and religion (which posits that morality is absolute and not subject to the whims of popular culture), though people like Dawkins would certainly argue that you can.

              "What if human meat is grown? Could we overcome our taboo against cannibalism? An interesting test case for consequentialist morality versus “yuck reaction” absolutism."...Dawkins is a pop scientist.  He's here to promote a trans-humanist agenda.  Probably paid well to spout ego-centric horseshit.

             That doesn't mean he is a pedophile. This board has to come up with an appropriate term for the people we talk about here. They don't have an appreciation for children, sexual or otherwise. They want to control and use babies as they see fit and see children as less than human. It's not a "phile" situation or a "phobe" situation, it's something else. I call them Krampus monsters these days but we need a word for these people. They are not exactly pedophiles, their activities are so much wider in scope and philosophy and they collaborate. Also, nobody wants to use the word pedophile because the media has been successful in erasing this "bad guy" by avoiding the topic altogether. People think pedos are super rare and they work alone... not true.

              Don't care. He deserves to be shamed just as if he was one. Precision and classification, let that be sime "scientists" (ha) goal. I'm not about that. I'm about these people being thrown into the proverbial trash heap. Good day.

             Exactly, the ONLY people who defend pedophiles are other pedophiles.  The very fact that he doesn't think that this "mild" pedophilia had any lasting harm is actually proof that it did.  If he has any inclination that touching children isn't "that bad" -- he has been harmed by it as it has made him tolerant of pedophilia.

             You don't have to be raped as a child for that to be traumatic.  Just look at the #MeToo movement.  Many of those Hollywood actresses were ADULT women who were sexually active (so they knew what sex was and weren't opposed to it in a consensual context) -- but they put into a position where they were vulnerable and felt like they couldn't say no and were too afraid to speak out about what happened to them.  If ADULT women can be traumatized by something like this, then a child can be traumatized by "mild" pedophilia.  In fact, it is even harder for children because they don't have the life experience or emotional maturity to be able to even process what happened to them or to understand that they were victims.  They tend to internalize their shame and blame themselves for what happened.

            "Mr. Dawkins seems to think that because a crime was committed a long time ago we should judge it in a different way," Watt continued. "But we know that the victims of sexual abuse suffer the same effects whether it was 50 years ago or yesterday."   This really gave me Great Comfort. At last a person with some feeling and sense.

              I agree, but sometimes it is good to see people suffering here on earth.  The innocent have a right to peace on earth. A lifetime of suffering at the hands of the guilty.

               We here on earth have a duty to fight evil, even if we are forever rolling a boulder up a hill like Sisyphus, only to watch it fall back down. We are sinners as well, so that is our curse until our deaths. Shrugging our shoulders about it is unthinkable, which is why we are all here.

             Those who rise to the top of these institutions are psychopaths.  That is the problem with nearly every form of government.  Many different types of government could work if it were not for the fact that those who most want power are psychopaths and they are the very ones who should not be given any access to power at all.  As most of us are not psychopaths, it is hard for us to wrap our heads around the fact that the success of those at the top is due entirely to a lack of conscience and a willing to violate any and all moral or social laws for their own benefit.

              You nailed it.  My eyes were opened by Andrew Lobaczewski's POLITICAL PONEROLOGY.  We live in the reality he proposed during the Nazis occupation of Poland.

              Nailed it. Good people don't seek power at all. I do wish people would snap out of this delusion that just because they wouldn't do something themselves, it doesn't mean someone else might. The most common response I got (before a large portion of the country woke up) was that 9/11 couldn't be an "inside job" because our leaders wouldn't do that to their own country. They simply cannot believe someone would do that, regardless of evidence.

            I recall he also said that a paedophile priest raping a child does not do as much harm to the child as does teaching them to believe in God.  Absolute fucking degenerate!

             He is a useful idiot for the Globalist agenda. I read his books, listen to his 'debates' and my final verdict was - a lost soul. His ignorance is startling! Little does he realize that radical atheism is a cult onto itself, no different from
Scientology.

              Pretty much.  I don't think that Dawkins is a genuine pedophile but I think that he has such a gargantuan ego that he thinks since he was groped as a child and it caused him no lasting harm that therefore it causes no one harm.  He could easily talk about the evolution of neuroplasticity and how being molested at a young age can warp your sexuality, in keeping with his evolutionary views.  But he would rather go against religion on issues and rant about his intellectual superiority than actually think about them.

              I wholeheartedly agree. His main shtick is proselytizing for that cult. Still agree: he doesn’t realize it tho.

               excellent, so true.  These people are all oblivious GreenDell144, or as the Bible puts it 'blind leading the blind' - they no longer have the natural instinct to protect the children from abuse.  He sounds like a paedophile who say the children 'enjoy' the abuse. Ross Kemp ends interview with paedophile who claims 'some kids enjoy it' -

             What a sick piece of shit damn. Just like the Political and Entertainment industries in Hollywood and D.C., This is them trying to play the "I'm a scientist, so I'm right" bullshit and normalize pedophilia. The Kinsey institute and many of these colleges and laboratories are pushing this.  Fucking degenerate is right.
