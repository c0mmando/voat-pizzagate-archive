<p>Thank you for the email. I need your service privately i dont want to deal within wyzant .I want my daughter (Patricia) for the tutorial.She is of 18 yrs and friendly , she is gentle and beautiful and ready to learn and i want you to  teach her [STATISTICS], she lives with her father in Philippine and i want her to come to the states and spend her holiday with me so that she can learn more about [STATISTICS] very well as that is where she needs extra tutoring because i do not want her to be behind her mates. i hope you will be able to take care of her and tutor her well ,I have made contacts with my husband and Daughter concerning the arrangements of the tutoring and it\'s okay by them.
You will be teaching her 3 times in a week , 2 hours a day which will be 6 hours a week, I intend to commit you by paying you for the first week of your service before the arrival to secure the date so I can be absolutely sure of having your care for Patricia, to enable things go perfectly without disappointment. [ 3 times in a week , 2 hours a day What is the total cost for a week ? ]  I want you to know that she will arrive in the states by March 29th. So i want you to tell me the days you will be available during the week also the time , i will know your full schedule for the 6 hours in a week okay , also let me know the best library around you that will be comfortable to meet you, so that i can contact the caregiver that i have employed to cater for her and watch after her and the caregiver can be bring her there, i want her to study more about what she needs to know while she is in the states and she speaks a little bit of English but not too perfect....smiles.... so you will be patient to explain and teach her. We lived in [  California  ] for 5 years and i gave birth to her before my husband took her along to Philippine ,so i believe she can speak a little bit . About the time you will be teaching her, i don\'t know if weekends will be convenient for you , FRI , SAT, AND SUN ? Just asking any way , if its okay by you , Then you can email me back with time schedule for the 3 days, remember 2 hours a day. ( BUT SHE WILL BE IN THE STATES FOR 2 MONTHS WHICH I WILL BE SENDING YOU YOUR PAYMENT WEEKLY)</p>
<p>Plz check your email address time to time for more update thanks and God bless you .</p>

            This is a pretty traditional Craigslist scam. It
            <em>
             could
            </em>
            be trafficking but more likely it's a money thing. Message him back and see if he wants to send you a check for more than it's worth and wire you the change. That's usually the follow up message.

             That's why I waiting a few hours of texting to post this e-mail. The brackets make it look automated and spammy. But you're right, there is always the potential for me just to be off my rocker and reading into it wrongly.
