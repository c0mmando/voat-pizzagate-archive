<p>All in one day, an anonymous patriot within the FBI used the official FBIRecordsVault Twitter to make a series of tweets that could only be described as highly unusual. The FBIRecordsVault rarely Tweets at all, and for 17 tweets to come through just after midnight all at once perked many peoples\' attention. Why did he do it? Why were the initial tweets linked to Donald Trump\'s father and uncle? Why all of the operation manuals? What follows is the message hidden within those tweets...
It is a fucking timeline of events</p>
<p>1) Trump\'s dad vetted by FBI Director in the 1960\'s
2) Trump\'s uncle was old-school FBI (Tesla)
3) The FBI became compromised/infiltrated via wet criminality - get people involved in your crimes so they can\'t expose you (Ethics Code)
4) What an investigation should look like (Manual)
5) What the Clinton investigation looked like (4 pages!?)
6) What the Petraus investigation looked like (bazillion pages)</p>
<p>The above 3 prove corruption within FBI, and Federal Government as a Whole, has been 100% accomplished by ~2014</p>
<p>7) May 2015 Baltimore - Beginning of Soros funded attempted FEDERALIZATION of police. This is an attempt to usurp States rights by the Federal Govt./Soros. </p>
<p>Basically, this is the LAST ELECTION, LAST CHANCE - Trump has been pushing this for a long time now.</p>
<p>8) Donald J. Trump made honoraria FBI asset - he was RECRUITED by patriots within the FBI to do what he\'s doing. His uncle was well respected. They knew his dad. He\'s clean. They needed him. That\'s from the FBI Honoraria tweet. Here\'s some Alex Jones insider info. Trump has been many steps ahead of the game this entire time, like a prophet. Connect the dots. Dr. Steve Pieczenik is the direct link from Intelligence Agencies to Trump, he has been advising Trump for decades.</p>
<p>9 ) How operations run by FBI but outside of FBI look (Trump campaign - Trump has been getting insider info all along - the Tweeted document shows it\'s legal to give him classified info in this case) - </p>

<p>10) Stay-Behind Agents - activation of patriots embedded in enemy occupied territory within other agencies of Federal Govt. to help. Secret Service. NSA. Etc. <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637207601225729">https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637207601225729</a>
11) Social Networking - /pol/ , <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">r/the_donald</a> conscripted to help BY FBI ANON, confirmed by EXACT 11AM TIME OF TWEET - Social Networking and Viral news is the only reason any of this has even been possible.
12) Physical fitness program - this was the Hillary health leaks, accomplished by above FBI operation/conscripted parties
13) FOIA - this was the Wikileaks, same as above (I previously proved Wikileaks was leaked by US AGENTS because NO CLASSIFIED MATERIALS were leaked - our boys are by the fucking BOOK)
14) FBI Seal - this is the FBI coming into the open about all of the above, via this tweeting and Dr. Pieczenik - We are part of a legitimate FBI by-the-book Operation against DOMESTIC enemies.
15) FBI now conscripting all of us (students) to help with the following:
16) Find AND EXPOSE the smoking gun...
17) ...In the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>Everyone says \'smoking gun\' so much. Let me be as clear as I can: A smoking gun is something NOBODY can argue or deny, and will take down the WHOLE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION
So far, NOTHING meets that criteria. NOT Foreign contributions. Pay to play. Corruption. Collusion. Above the law. All proven. None of it matters.</p>
<p>Only ONE THING will take them down for sure: 
Connect the PEDOPHILE RING to the CLINTON FOUNDATION.</p>
<p>THAT IS THE SMOKING GUN.
Dr. Steve P also steering my fellow autists in this direction:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q</a></p>
<p>NOBODY In power will INVESTIGATE THIS because THEY\'RE ALL Implicated because THAT\'S HOW THEY COMPROMISE THEM SO EFFECTIVELY - THEY put people IN CHARGE who PARTAKE - REMEMBER DENNY HASTERT - JEFFREY ESPSTEIN - If CAUGHT they do VERY LITTLE TIME</p>
<p>There is a world-wide Pedo-Ring connected to the CLINTON FOUNDATION, that just so happens to also be taking over the USA for good.
FIND IT AND YOU FOUND A SMOKING GUN.
WHAT WE CAN DO</p>
<p>The reason why #DraftOurDaughters was working so well was because it was based in truth and it plucked heart strings. But the fact is, it is a future truth. Children are at this very moment being abused by the people who run our country, and most of the rest of the nations of the world. It is so very hard to expose this because people don\'t want to believe it, and don\'t want to believe it\'s possible.
IF WE EXPOSE THE RING TO A CRITICAL MASS OF PEOPLE THEY WILL FALL</p>
<p>STEP 1: Find Simple To Present Evidence, Accompanied by STRONG VISUALS (Not necessarily directly related)
STEP 2: MEME Warfare it to FRONT PAGE of ALL THE INTERNET</p>
<p>Centipedes: It is clear that there are brave men and women within our intelligence and law enforcement agencies who want to expose this. So why aren\'t they?
They are not allowed to do so. Their hands are tied. If they try, they will be burned.
They have the info, they have the leads, they have the means to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
So WHAT DO THEY NEED?
They need smoke cover</p>
<p>Think about it. They couldn\'t even be doing what they\'re doing right now if it weren\'t for Donald J. Trump and his campaign exposing even the lighter issues, such as pay-to-play and other corruption. When something is brought to light, forced into the mainstream, that enables our PATRIOT ACTORS to ACT, because in darkness their bosses have power over them.</p>
<p>The pedophile ring is the HARDEST thing to bring to light because people DON\'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT.
But THAT IS OUR JOB.</p>
<p>Meme Magic can #SAVEOURCHILDREN by exposing it to millions.
Meme Magic can #BRINGDOWNTHERING by bringing this thing into the public light.</p>
<p>Once it\'s public, THEN our boys can act.
It\'s an honor to serve with you. It\'s time to save our children. It\'s time to save the world.</p>
<p>Weaponized Meme Magic is the Key.
If you are in the party that can MAKE KILLSHOT MEMES WITH THE INFO, </p>
<p>As soon as I see anyone producing memes that will be effective enough to #BRINGDOWNTHERING and #SAVEOURCHILDREN,</p>
<p>There is enough out there to start bringing it to the public now, it\'s all about presentation. The Franklin Coverup implicates the Bush family as well as Barney Frank - Here are the Court Files. Denny Hastert is well known. Jeffery Epstein is out there
This is very much about presentation and making it viral so that FBI and others can ACT</p>
<p>Memes - As We Speak #BringDownTheRing is happening on Twitter.</p>

<p>TLDR; Operation Smoke Screen
Our sole modis operandi right now is to make sure that millions of people become aware that there is a pedo-ring running our government and most of the world - that way our badass patriots within intelligence / law enforcement will have smoke-cover to take care of business.
Pedes, the FBI and other heros HAVE the evidence, they need an excuse to GET IT OUT without getting fucking killed. 
When did the Podesta leaks come? 
AFTER WE PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON CORRUPTION. SPOTLIGHT FIRST, THEN IT\'S SAFE TO LEAK.

           TLDR; Operation Smoke Screen
Our sole modis operandi right now is to make sure that millions of people become aware that there is a pedo-ring running our government and most of the world - that way our badass patriots within intelligence / law enforcement will have smoke-cover to take care of business.
Pedes, the FBI and other heros HAVE the evidence, they need an excuse to GET IT OUT without getting fucking killed. 
When did the Podesta leaks come? 
AFTER WE PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON CORRUPTION. SPOTLIGHT FIRST, THEN IT'S SAFE TO LEAK.

            "Once it's public"
           </p>
           <p>
            The Pedophilia shit is constantly squashed. It's impossible to make it public because the MSM and the Comet Ping Pong Psy-Op have branded us as crazy. I've been here 9 MONTHS trying to raise awareness. Nothing is working.
           </p>
           <p>
            "THEN our boys can act."
           </p>
           <p>
            Clearly "our boys" are a bunch of fucking cowards because they have done virtually nothing since this story broke. "Our boys" need to go on testosterone replacement therapy because I've never see more fucking pathetic beta males as the fucking coward foot soldiers in the FBI and Military. If they had any balls they would have brought this thing down years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only hope right now is Trump taking the bull by the horns and saying enough's enough. What the Deep State has done is way past High Treason. Trump could stop it in a New York minute by going on T.V. and saying 9/11 was an inside job by the Deep State. They're trying to frame me right now and I need the American Publics help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anything short of that at this point is meaningless to be honest. I think Trump will try to do the right thing but let's face it the guy's a fucking blow-hard. He's got about a month left in which to act. After that it's game over unfortunately.

              The only group of boys I have any faith in at this point are the Navy Seals. The Deep State has killed a lot of their Seal brothers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Extortion 17 is enough to get every Seal worth his salt to go down to DC and unleash Divine Justice. That would do it. A million American Alpha Males would gladly follow them.

              I don't know what God has in store for the mother fuckers inside the Deep State. All I know is God has a twisted and depraved sense of humor. Don't ask me how I know that. All I can say is I never raped or killed anyone but my grievous chastisements were so bad I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy. ....And I'm not joking. Hell is real and I have the day passes to prove it.

               The Seals are basically programmable instruments that have little to no discretion when it comes to following orders.  They may do good or ill.  The instrument is viable, but you have to look at who is using the instrument and to what end.

                I wouldn't confuse integrity with stupidity. Yes the Seal's follow orders, that's what they do. But what happens when they discover the people giving the orders are criminals?

                I'm 100% convinced of what they'll do. They're all insane when it comes to taking out a target. That's gotten them in a lot of trouble in the past but it's a trait they can't shake. A leopard can't change their spots. The Seals right now are about to become the new

                If Trump doesn't do anything that's exactly what will happen. In fact I think your underestimation is shared by a lot of people in the Deep State. They're confusing silence on the part of some in the military as an inability to connect the dots. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The crimes are so fucking horrible doing nothing isn't an option. Blood could start flowing a lot quicker than people think.

                 What I'm implying is that if they are still all-human which I don't believe they are anymore, then they won't be very soon.  Programmable Instruments is not a metaphor.

                 Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work suggested that the United States’ enemies are working on ways to develop super soldiers reminiscent of Captain America. “Now our adversaries, quite frankly, are pursuing enhanced human operations, and it scares the crap out of us, really,” Work said, according to FTAlphaville. “We’re going to have to have a big, big decision on whether or not we are comfortable with going that way.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 He didn’t elaborate on what he meant by “enhanced human operations,” but the phrase refers to any sort of biologically altered soldier with capabilities superior to a normal person."

                   "One project – called the Systems-Based Neurotechnology for Emerging Therapies (SUBNETS) – aims to “reduce the burden and severity” of post traumatic stress. What might that look like? According to a 2013 story from The Atlantic, a pilot could take a pill to induce short-term memory loss after a particularly traumatic mission.

                   But what if forgetting things is the problem? Another DARPA program, the Restoring Active Memory (RAM) initiative, is researching an implantable microchip that would allow soldiers who experience brain trauma to regain the ability to form new memories.

                    The only reason Goldblatt could discuss those programs was that they had been declassified after 10 years. The current state of U.S. military biological engineering – sometimes called transhumanism – is hidden from public view.

                    That's what DARPA does, they research all this outlandish stuff most of it is complete bunk. In the 50s they thought soldiers would wear jet packs and every American would have their own personal helicopter by the year 2000. It didn't happen. It's all hype put there to sell magazines or web ad revenue.

                   Disagree.  we already know the brain is fairly easily programmable with alters and assassiin profiles that the other personalities can be unaware of.  Soldiers both endure and mete out the types of traumas that can allow this programming.   Deep state technology is far beyond what is leaked to the peon masses.  They already have units near the battlefield that "fix" the wounded in ways incomprehensible in even the recent past.   A huge number of soldiers are surviving battlefield trauma and injuries physicaly with greater brain trauma than ever known in history.  these soldiers are sitting ducks for "Mother Military".  Under controlled circumstances, knowing they have an elite force trained, there is no way a technocratic war focused ruling elite are going to risk insurrection from them.   They go in human and are either used and discarded or become programmable and controlled, starting with "need to know" conditioning.   War is historicaly a driver of great leaps in technology and if you heard this this year, that means the program started 10 years ago at least.

                   Before you airily dismiss this, spend some reading time looking into some of this.  It is interesting and perilous reading.  I am not trying to take a source of hope from you, I want to be realistic.

                    I have. I've been following this story for years. I even spent 2 weeks in Marine Corp OCS after college before I figured out I couldn't kill anyone unless I respected the President who told me to do it.

                     A soldier does not need to be bionic to be mind controlled. Soldiers are de facto partialy mind controlled anyway.  There is plenty of opportunity to make a programmable and fully controlled killer at any time out of a soldier, and for you to deny that reality is simply naive.  I am actually a bit surprised at you "Dark Math".   I disagree that this is so far in the future. he military and the Deep State are far more advanced with tech than is ever even remotely disclosed to the public.

                      I know. I went through 2 weeks of that mind control in 1994. The end result was a fully programmed killer that can be activated on a moments notice to kill any human being on planet Earth. Here's what it looks like:

                        I don't understand your point. The U.S. military trains obedient killers. That's a given. I think you're talking about "super soldiers" which I take to mean giving a soldier extra strength or some other super human ability. As far as creating obedient killing that's been done already.

                         Do not think of elite soldiers today or in the near or far future as normal humans that you can count on to have human reactions - or be able to command their own memories enough for the fine work of pulling off insurrection.  They are under threat from a myriad of control tools and are already much more than we realize, merely programmable instruments, unlike in many ways the soldiers of the last century.
