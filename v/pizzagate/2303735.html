            Don't forget about the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) also. It has worked with the communist dictatorship in China to enforce the “one-child” policy from the beginning—complete with forced abortions, involuntary sterilization, kidnapping of “illegal” children, and other brutal tactics. As Steven Mosher says, "
            <strong>
             Four hundred million
            </strong>
            Chinese children are missing because of this policy.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2010, the Vice-Minister of the communist dictatorship’s “National Population and Family Planning Commission” thanked UNFPA for “its constant support to China’s population and family planning undertakings during the past thirty years and more.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Not coincidentally, Planned Parenthood has a huge lobby at the United Nations to encourage the use of it's 'Comprehensive Sexuality Education' materials. The early sexualization of children through CSE can create life-long paying customers for businesses such as Planned Parenthood.

             Wake up to the reality that the GOP is lying to you -- 
The GOP APPROVED LEGISLATION to allow fetal tissues to be used in research.
And they also approved costs to be assessed covering the costs of storing and 
transporting the fetal tissue.  PP has done NOTHING that hasn't been approved 
by the GOP.

             What this is really all about is the right wing effort to re-enslave females
to childbearing for cheap labor.  To limit the ability of females to educate
themselves and their children.  To keep Elite patriarchy going.
And, especially in the South, this is about racism.

            Travino told the foundation that she felt troubled by the number of appointments they scheduled with girls as young as 12 for contraception and abortion referrals. She said they also saw a lot of young women who had STDs and multiple sex partners. It became apparent to her that Planned Parenthood was focused on the numbers, not its patients’ well-being.  She also said they are led to lead a promiscuous lifestyle.  BOY have I been Red Pilled about Planned Parenthood.  I have never sent them any money, but I have signed petitions before Waking Up.  Never Again.

              We had someone in our family circle chose birth instead of abortion.  It was not an easy choice for her, but the family banded together and that child is now 12 yrs. old.  She is a delight to all that love her and is so loved by all her class and friends.  Not all in the family were receptive to the mother getting pregnant without marriage, but we have helped this person and a few others did too.  Now everyone sees the choice was the right thing to do.  She Is One Beautiful Child.

             Carmen --
            </p>
            <p>
             Just to sum up what I am saying here ...
Was just reading a report that there are 55 million abortions every year worldwide --
and 25 million of those are done illegally.
The number of abortions never changes -- the only thing that changes is how many
females will die having illegal abortions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Re this article ...
What are the changes that this woman was planted by "pro-life" organization?
Would you rather this this 12 year old girl be forced to have a child?
In some countries (where patients come to the US for abortions), a girl who becomes 
pregnant outside of marriage can be murdered for that "sin."

             And why in the heck would it be this woman's business if PP is helping young women who
have STD's?  Would she prefer that these young girls remain untreated?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is Texas ... what are the odds that they're also prevent sex education in their schools?
            </p>
            <p>
             This woman is very busy judging others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, the lies told by Jamie McIntyre about "fetal" tissue are still circulating, mainly
because the right wing supporters remain so uneducated as to the truth -- which is that
the GOP voted for fetal tissue donations, including charges to cover costs of preserving 
and storing and transporting the material.  This is all done with GOP's blessings.
But the right wing will lie about anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was watching a movie the other evening --
             <em>
              Jacksonville
             </em>
             which was made in 2016 
in Mississippi where the right wing was trying to shut down the very last abortion clinic
in Jacksonville.  You get a good look at the "pro-life" people and their organizations
which do nothing to help young -- using AA girls there -- get birth control/contraceptives.
These tell them all kinds of lies about even contraceptives and other forms of birth control.
One of the girls they were "helping" was 24 and already had four children ... ages 1,2,3,4.
She was again pregnant -- seemed to be only a few weeks as the girl herself described the
embryo as the size of "a worm."  They actually do sonograms -- and asked her if she would
like a copy of the picture with "MOM" on it.
No where is it more obvious that the "pro-life" right wing movement is centered in re-enslaving
females to childbearing and supplying cheap labor, especially in these AA communities.
            </p>
            <p>
             The young girl has her fifth child.  At his point she is even further reduced from the life
she had with four children where she seems to have worked only one job -- and where
she was also involved in an education program for future employment in the health field.
            </p>
            <p>
             NOW, she is trying to work two jobs and take care of 5 very young children.
At this point, the young girls means are so limited that the household is short on food.
There is now a threat that her children will be taken away from her.
            </p>
            <p>
             The white woman who is running the organizations is challenged as to whether this 
young girl will get pregnant again.  And she observes that she "probably will."
But there is still only a lack of sex education and/or information about birth control.
            </p>
            <p>
             As the documentary closes, the young is pregnant again -- with twins.

             <p>
              I’ve worked in pregnancy centers, and have met women who are the victims of Planned Parenthood’s deceptive ways,
We offer women choices other than abortion,  We don’t judge them.  We empower them to think about their inherent value and to avoid relationships with deadbeat men who want sex, but could care less about the  welfare of woman.  We met a woman who was  pregnant  four months after having abortion,  Her partner insisted she abort second time,  HE HAD INSISTED HIS PREVIOUS WIFE ABORT HER TWO babies.  In all he’s had 4 of his children aborted.
              <br/>
              This woman, after we spent time  speaking with her realized what a creep this man is. And once we offered support in the form of child supplies, diaper, food, education, decided to keep her baby.  And she realized she Was worth it! 
By the way, you are ignorant of the facts,  Abortion does increase breast cancer, and increases the risk of  subsequent,tubal pregnancies, because of the instruments  used to extract the baby can puncture and scar the uterus.  Here’s a link for you.   Documentary by a woman who is pro abortion.  She has the facts and stats about increased cancer in post abortive women,

               4 warn --
              </p>
              <p>
               You're providing free sonograms to try to convince poor and uneducated women --
and females intimidated by male-supremacist "Christianity" -- that what they are
shown on a sonogram is more important than their own lives and responsibilities,
 their own existence.  And that's BS.
              </p>
              <p>
               No one who supports the murder of clinic personnel and clinic doctors can call
themselves "pro-life" -- in fact you are always downgrading the life of the pregnant female
as subordinate to an embryo.  And there are always more existing lives involved - other 
children and their mother's ability to care for them and to provide for their educations and 
well-being.  Neither should those existing children be tossed aside as subordinate to an
embryo.
              </p>
              <p>
               You aren't changing anyone's mind about abortion, except increasing support for CHOICE.
Americans support CHOICE by more than 50% -- and the numbers are even higher when
Catholic Latinos are considered.  Overall, Americans support reproductive freedom by very
high percentages.  Catholic women have just as many abortions as any other women and 
the religious (democratic) left supports reproductive freedom and CHOICE.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is there any chance that your bias against Planned Parenthood causes you to suggest 
that those seeking abortions at PP are "victims"?
               <strong>
                You're not offering women "choices" --
NOT even birth control -- not even sex education.
               </strong>
               You are depending upon poor women
not having the education to understand the lies you are telling them.
              </p>
              <p>
               YOU are also trying to take the place of mental health professionals and that 
can only lead to these women making more poorly informed decisions about
their lives.  Certainly you are NOT advising them to consider their own interests,
or even the interests of their already EXISTING children.
Your goal is to push these women into going through with the pregnancy no 
matter how negatively it may effect their own lives.
              </p>
              <p>
               The right wing anti-abortion movement doesn't support these women, their
other children nor their families.   One or two packages of bits of clothing and 
a few diapers doesn't do it.  Further, the GOP which condemns abortion has 
NO problem in sending our sons off to war and slaughter for the profit of the few,
while attacking the vulnerable at every turn --
               <strong>
                whether the 20% of our children
in the US living in poverty,
               </strong>
               or seniors, or invalids.  Every day we see the GOP 
increasing their attacks on the most vulnerable in our society.
And that includes not only US children, but children all over the world they are murdering/
bombing.
              </p>
              <p>
               You also need to
               <strong>
                STOP the lies about abortion causing breast cancer
               </strong>
               What do you think happens when women suffer spontaneous abortions?
And spontaneous abortions are uncountable ... they occur often in real life.
These spontaneous abortions occur even without the knowledge of the female
knowing that she was pregnant -- and they occur later in pregnancies as miscarriages.
This is the wisdom of the woman's body and the woman's system acting to protect 
her life and her health.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or maybe you think women and their doctors should just ignore Ectopic pregnancies until 
the Fallopian Tube bursts open?

               Again, the
               <strong>
                GOP voted for fetal tissue to be used in research
               </strong>
               <strong>
                They also voted for costs to be covered
               </strong>
               -- that is cost of preserving the
tissue, costs of transporting the tissues.  None of this is done without
either without the agreement of the pregnant female.  Those who looked
at the costs being assessed by PP say they likely didn't even cover their costs.

              <p>
               The movie "Jacksonville" made in 2016 also shows this exploitation of poor women in
Mississippi by clinics run by the right wing to STOP abortions rather to try to help these
women.  They have only one goal -- STOP abortions -- and could NOT care less about
these women or their existing children.
You're in the service of right wing male-supremacists and you'll eventually wake up
to that reality.

              <p>
               "Christianity" is also one of the major tools of "white male-supremacists" ...
and long has been from the earliest days here when it was used to "enslave or kill"
native people here to steal their land -- and to enslave Africans here.

              Thank you for this summary. Planned Parenthood and other clinics may not be perfect, but it is true that they are oftentimes the only resource for a young girl to get personal, private help. It's not right to take away a young girls (or boys) access to health care for any reason.

             One day you'll wake up to find that the demons are who they have always been --
i.e., the right wing/fascists who are lying to you.

             It is also nonsense to think that only females support the right to abortion.
Families support this right.  Religious organizations support this right.
Not too many men want children they can't afford to care for or to educate.
