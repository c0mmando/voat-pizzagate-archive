            different cranium dimensions and differences in facial structure plus the fact one of those sketches looks like a skinny man and the other looks like a chubby-cheeked fat guy, there is no way any rational person can say that is a depiction of the same man. Just pause that video and click back and forth on the two sketches and Stevie Wonder could see these differences.

            since everyone is saying the police said they're the same person, and that's the basis on which snopes "debunked" this, I think the word "believe" is key. they said they BELIEVE it's the same person which is not the same thing as 100% certainty

            (sigh) rule 1 - this is related

            rule 3 - this article is about the mccann kidnappings
