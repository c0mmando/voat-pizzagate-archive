            If Jeff Sessions is a yardstick to judge how President Trump like his lawmen, then the new guy for the FBI is going to be pretty tough.

             Yeh. The jokes on them now!  They made their bed.  They should have let Bernie win. It's still hard to believe they convinced people to vote for Hillary.  She's wretched with and without pedo stuff.  She's just awful

             I've heard that too.  What the heck is Trump thinking keeping these slimy lawbreaking obstructionists around?  He should have cleaned house and drained the damn swamp in month one.
            </p>
            <p>
             He must be more tolerant that people make him out to be.  I think he's somewhat of a softy compared to what I had believed him to be.  He's warm and fuzzy.  Come on Mr. Trump, time to let heads roll!

             Comey must be scared to death.  I would be.  Holy smokes, I hope the good FBI people get the truth out so we can get justice.  Sean Hannity and  guests were apoplectic about the need for justice.  Attorney Jay Sekulow, whom I admire tremendously,  said what I've wanted for years:  "Empanel a Grand Jury and just follow the law."

            Trump should make Sheriff Clarke as the new Director and finally take down the elite pedo ring, just uproot it, scorched earth!!! Filth of the earth. Comey is one pedo-looking twisted freak. I bet he attended pizza parties.

            THIS is what I was hoping to hear --- (from link)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Upon news of Comey’s removal, Julian Assange tweeted that a source within the FBI had informed him that the Bureau would begin leaking documents from the investigation. He urged the FBI to release documents in full to prevent any misrepresentations by the press. On the heels of Assange’s announcement, an additional source claimed that the Deputy Attorney General will now oversee a new Clinton probe following Comey’s dismissal, and would do so in close proximity to acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe for lack of trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             If confirmed, the reports indicate that Comey’s firing represents a renewed focus on information pertaining to the investigation into Hillary Clinton, after the previous one was criticized by both supporters and detractors of the Former Secretary of State and Senator, both of whom painted the investigation as being either politically motivated or hampered by alleged attempts to cover up evidence of wrongdoing.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Though Podesta doesn't seem too happy with Comey at the moment, it seems that Comey has so far protected Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, NYPD keeps threatening to release the Weiner/Clinton info but that hasn't happened so far.

              Don't know, but they do have a 50 year investment in the pedophile/prostitute/trafficking issue with
three very high level investigations having been stopped by higher up's.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meanwhile, today's info re Comey asking for more funds to investigate Russia/Trump was probably the real trigger
for the firing.
             </p>
             <p>
              IOW's, it's about getting Comey off of Trump's back and protecting Trump.

                There is no "left" -- and wherever you're getting your "news" you might begin to rethink that.
We haven't had a liberal in office since they killed JFK.
Both of national parties are owned by Koch Bros./John Birch Society and other large corporations.
The point of creating a non-existent left is to keep the nation divided as it has been since the Civil War.

                 One thing you can be sure of is voting for a democrat or establishment republican is voting for the following agenda:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let the jailed criminals out.  Let illegal criminals in. Condemn law enforcement.  Let men in girls bathrooms.  Persecute Christians.  Embrace the religion of ISIS. Don't care for Veterans.  Pervert the children.  Kill the unborn.  Accept barbarity in the name of Islam.  Burn and stomp the American flag while rioting.  Protect sanctuary cities.  Cuddle the lazy.  Make everyone dependent.  Encourage hate crimes.  Destroy property.  That's the liberal way!

                  We seem to agree that our entire system is corrupt --
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  However, over the last decades we have seen our prison system expand enormously with privatization -- and so too the 
number of prisoners and the cruelty and brutality within the system.  How has society benefited from those changes?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We should also remember that not all sentences are life sentences and that almost half a million prisoners are 
paroled each year and re-enter society.  And that our prison system does not provide any concept of rehabilitation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The US has killed more than a million Muslims in our wars of aggression so I don't see how that equates to 
"persecution" of Christians.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  ISIS and other terrorist organizations are being created by our own US government.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I do agree with you in regard to Veterans, but we also have to understand that we have a dishonest government
involved in illegal wars of aggression with little regard for the mental or physical health of our soldiers.
There was an interesting program on PBS last week about the drone program and how the killings are impacting
soldiers involved with the program and how those serious issues/problems are being ignored by our military/
government.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'd also mention that our Constitution and Bill of Rights have been largely destroyed and replaced
by fascist instruments like the Patriot Act.  The right to freedom of assembly and protest has largely
disappeared as protest is disrupted over and again by Gestapo techniques by government and 
agents provocateurs.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Again, we haven't had liberals in government since the coup on JFK.  We have two corporate-fascist parties and
rigged elections.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Each woman who has an abortion makes that individual choice for herself.
Most abortions are done in the first 12 weeks of conception.
Late terms abortions are wanted pregnancies where something goes wrong and the pregnancy is
doing serious harm to the life of the mother.  They are RARE -- about 1 in every county of the US
each year.

                 By left I mean the one world order which includes many republicans as we can clearly see with graham, Ryan, McCain and Bush.  this one world order has convinced half of the nation that Pres Trump is sooooo terrible.  Did Pres Trump put server in basement, break laptops, break blackberries, bleachbit, forward emails to Muslim brotherhood princess, start a war in Syria, fund and arm Syrian Rebels and isis, abandon Americans in Benghazi, accept millions from Muslim donations, steal all the funds from Haiti, donate to the head investigator's wife's campaign while under investigation, and sell uranium to Russia?  No.  Hillary Clinton did that.  Russia did not steal the election from Hillary.  Hillary stole it from Bernie though, but no one cares.  She's above the law.  But Flynn can't have a phone call with an ambassador without the zombies of this one world order and their media crying collusion stole the election blah blah blah.  That's the left I'm talking about.  The people that are wrong.  The people that aren't right.

                  The NWO is a continuation of NAZI/Hitler aspirations.  Do you really think Hitler was a liberal ???????
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  No -- Trump has convinced the public that he is terrible.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And, of course, Hillary is guilty of all you've said -- but she is not a liberal.  She is a corporate-fascist.
Again-- both parties have been bought out by Koch Bros./John Birch Society and other large corporations
and they are NOT liberals any more than our MIC is liberal.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  True -- the Dem Party stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders who would have been president had he
gotten the nomination.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You are confused about the left and the right.  JFK was a liberal.  FDR was a liberal.
Liberals support National Health Care, Social Security, Medicare for All.
An educated society.  Medical system based in prevention rather than profit.
Government for the people rather than for elites/wealthy/corporations.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We must be talking about two different Rothstein's -- the one I'm talking about is retired Detective from NYPD.

                   I said Rosenstein not rothhstein.  In general with all that is going now there is the right and the left.  You know what I mean.  I'm not confused.  Trump is more a traditional democrat than a conservative, but he's not one world order.  He is not following sal alinsky's playbook.  So he's labeled right.  The sal alinsky one world order globalists that want open borders, Muslims, free abortions, sexualized children, populations addicted to drugs, wars, violent rioting etc are labeled as left.  What's confused by msny but not by me is the estab repubs are in this globalist one works order group.  McCain, Graham, Bushs, Ryan, etc.  and the CIA is too. You're confused about the agenda of the democrats.  What they say is for the good of the people - government healthcare etc - is not.  It's all to own us and control us like 1984.

                    Trump is an Elite ... which has always meant right wing and of course the GOP is also right wing as the original corporate/business party.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Denial of Global Warming is right wing . . . the actual meaning of "conservative" is to protect nature, not to subject it to fracking and exploitation.

                    Saul Alinsky was a community organizer out of Chicago who preached NON-VIOLENCE which is a liberal concept.
Alinsky was not a New World Order supporter and I doubt that by the time he died in 1971, that that Nazi expression had resurfaced.

                    Capitalism is a system intended to move the wealth and natural resources of other nations from the many to the few.
And it has done that successfully all over the world.  Unregulated capitalism is merely organized crime.

                   <p>
                    The Democrats and the GOP are owned by the Koch Bros. and that has been true for many decades now.
The Koch Family is the John Birch Society which has been trying to overturn democracy in the US for more than 100 years now.
And, of course, other large corporations also own both parties.

                   <p>
                    MSM is CIA and corporate controlled -- 
See:  Operation Mockingbird drafted two years before the end of WWII in order to put control of our "free press" under the CIA.
Operation Paperclip (200,000 former Nazis brought into the US and into hot spots around the world) and used to found the CIA,
funneled into the FBI and other government agencies.
Operation Gladio to ensure that liberal officials/government would not rise in nation's where US had influence and control after WWII.
In fact, the US actually resurrected the Mafia in Italy to ensure that liberals would be kept out of office.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    MSM is right wing as is the CIA and Soros.

                    Nixon (right-winger) overturned the Bretton Woods System/Accords which controlled the movement of capital.

                    And, I'd point out that "Muslims" weren't an issue at the time of even Alinsky's death, nor were Americans even allowed
to have abortions by the time of his death.

The left is now KNOWN as Obama and Clinton supporters, Hollywood, ANTIFA, planned parenthood, open borders, free healthcare, free everything funded by those that work, socialism, anything goes sanctuary cities, legalized drugs.

                      The only way the right wing can rise is by violence and stolen elections -- 
that is the MO of the right wing, whether they are calling themselves "Democrats" or "Repugs"  --
or anything else that might suggest to you that they are liberals.
                      <br/>
                      There are no liberals representing us in government today and there haven't been any since the days of JFK
and Sen. Frank Church hearings.  Both parties are owned by Koch Bros./John Birch Society and other large corporations.

                      Note what is happening here at Berkeley -- a peaceful protest until agents provocateur come onto the scene.
Again - it is the right wing (see:  Hitler and his practices) which operate in secret violence.

                      Obama and Clinton are of the right wing -- they are corporate-fascists.
The Dem Party long ago was turned over to corporations and Elites.
Elites certainly are NOT the left -- nor is capitalism from the LEFT - these are systems intended
to move the wealth of the nation and its natural resources into the hands of the few.

                      Planned parenthood is about birth control, which I presume you don't like.
And abortion, as well, which seems obvious you don't like.
Planned parenthood is about women making their own decisions whether or not to have children.

                      And you oppose National Health Care which we would all PAY for .... ???
                      <br/>
                      Because you think its "free" or because you'd rather live in a nation with a lot of sick people who
can't get health care?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And maybe you'd rather live in a nation also where most of the people are uneducated?

                      The public seeks to legalize Marijuana/Cannabis everywhere -- which isn't even as dangerous as alcohol which is legal.

                     <p>
                      The right remains fascist in its current dealings -- 
true "conservatives" protect the environment, protect animal-life -- and that's not what Trump is about.

                     <p>
                      You're also evidently frightened of democratic socialism -- do you know that there was a real socialist party
which Hitler took over (NAZI party) and which he turned upside down to create a fascist party against
women's rights, against national health care, against labor and labor unions?

                     <p>
                      Every other nation stabilizes immigration by "fast checks" of Social Security numbers -- 
something which wealthy/Elites do not want to have done here in US because they want use
of cheap illegal labor.

usually immigrants.

                     <p>
                      Your main purpose here seems to be trying to excuse and alibi for Trump while the
vast majority of Americans want him impeached.
Though I'm not sure what they suggest after that as Pence is insanely right wing and a religious
fanatic to boot.
Both parties are totally corrupted and criminal.

                      PS:  Also try to actually read Operation Mockingbird which was being written two years before the
end of WWII to undermine and dismantle our "free press."

                       You are impossible.  Blaming antifa on the right is ridiculous.  I don't care where soros originated.  He is funding black lives matter, Antifa, media matters, shareblue etc.  these are all run by democrats.  What is happening NOW is relevant.  Establishment and democrats want to end America.  It's quite obvious.  Again, where they originated doesn't matter.  There are two "winnable" candidates on the ballot - a dem and a Repub.

                       Pouts is not part of the establishment or the dems.  He's an outsider which is why they hate him so much.  He hasn't participated in their sick acts.  They can't cotrol him with video of vile acts as blackmail.  So left or right - Repub or dem- he's neither really.  He's an outsider. Hence all the hate from both "sides"

                       As for the people in America, the general population of regular civilians, there is a true left and a true right.  The left supported Obama and Hillary and the right supports Mr. Trump.

                       I do not support funding planned parenthood with tax dollars.  I pay for my 6 children with my own hard earned money.  So why should I have to pay for irresponsible women's abortions and or birth control?!  It's ludicrous and infuriating.

                       Potus wants to return illegal immigrants, so he obviously doesn't support cheap illegal labor.  An American at the same job makes the same amount as an immigrant.  So don't start with that ridiculous argument

                        <p>
                         The New Order (German: Neuordnung) or the New Order of Europe (German: Neuordnung Europas) was the political order which Nazi Germany wanted to impose on the conquered areas under its dominion. The establishment of the New Order had already begun long before the start of World War II, but was publicly proclaimed by Adolf Hitler in 1941:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The year 1941 will be, I am convinced, the historical year of a great European New Order.[1]

                        <p>
                         Among other things, it entailed the creation of a pan-German racial state structured according to Nazi ideology to ensure the supremacy of an Aryan-Nordic master race, massive territorial expansion into Eastern Europe through its colonization with German settlers, the physical annihilation of the Jews and others considered to be "unworthy of life", and the extermination, expulsion, or enslavement of most of the Slavic peoples and others regarded as "racially inferior".[2] Nazi Germany’s desire for aggressive territorial expansionism was one of the most important causes of World War II.

                         Historians are still divided as to its ultimate goals, some believing that it was to be limited to Nazi German domination of Europe, while others maintain that it was a springboard for eventual world conquest and the establishment of a world government under German control.[3]

                        All Americans should be concerned about Human and Civil rights and the
deaths of so many "black" Americans at the hands of our police officers in shootings.
Anyone who supports democracy and justice should be supporting those rights.

                        Media Matters is an alleged liberal website by a guy named
                        <strong>
                         David Brock who was James Alefantis' old boyfriend -- !!!

                        PLUS, David Brock when he was admittedly on the right-wing side was very involved in
the smearing of Prof. Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas sexual harassment hearings.
Those hearings were a disgrace, but it was Dem Joe Biden who allowed Clarence Thomas
to survive the hearings because he did NOT permit the dozen and more females witnesses
who were willing to testify against Thomas to be heard.  And he closed the hearings at 4am.
Biden had given his word to the Hill legal team that those witnesses would be heard.
They were not.  Some of them had worked with Thomas as the EEOC.  Some were speech
writers at the EEOC.
Later, Sen. Paul Simon said "Had the Congress known what these witnesses had to say" that
the Congress would NOT have put Thomas on the Supreme Court.

                        Besides being James Alefanti's ex-love, he also tried to smear Prof. Anita Hill with his writings at the time
trying to suggest that she was "a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty."
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Sen. Paul Simon later said that had the Congress actually had the truth about Thomas that he would
not have reached the Supreme Court ... had the other witnesses been heard.

They are corporate-fascists funded by the Koch Bros. -- same as the Republican Party!!

                        Trump is ELITE -- and that certainly makes him part of the Establishment -- and wasn't that just Trump
cutting taxes on Elites by another 2/3rds????  What is it that you read to have you so confused???
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Trump is no "outsiders" as he's as much riding the gravy train of government as any other Elites.
Wasn't that Trump spending $20 million every weekend to get to his "vacation" home in Florida?
That doesn't make him "Elite" I guess in your mind.  (!!!!!)

                        No -- This is a LIBERAL nation -- and the population supports National Health Care, Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Americans are against WAR by 84% -- even higher internationally -- and against the MIC.
The population supports public education - NOT charter schools which are unaccountable to citizens but citizens pay for them.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        This is why the right-wing has to control all of our media.
                        <br/>
                        Any bit of truth which may reach the public is like a stone hitting a mirror -- it shatters their lies and myths.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The only people on the right in the US are the KKK and other racists - "white supremacists" who supported Trump.

                       <p>
                        True, many of the supporters who voted for Obama were liberals who believed that he was a liberal.
Immediately after the election it became clear that the was just another corporate-fascist and most liberals
did not vote a second time for Obama.  The voters who have stuck with Obama are those willing to 
support a Dem Party which has turned to corporate-fascism.  Sometimes because they fear the GOP even more.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Liberals immediately turned away from Obama and are unwilling to vote again for a Democrat -- perhaps excluding Bernie Sanders.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You have 6 children and you're supporting Trump?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And you're against those children having the choice of reproductive freedom?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And, btw, that all works as long as you have a job.  Elites are dedicated to ending employment of the masses.
And will take us all the way to starvation and warfare.  Again, both parties are now right wing.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And that you see women as "irresponsible" if they need an abortion doesn't speak well for your experiences with women.
Nature puts all her trust in women as the caretakers of children.
Nature is also "pro-choice" as she provided many ways via plants (which are our natural drugs) to end conception,
to create infertility whenever a female wished, and to provide birth control.
Most of those plants were destroyed by males during the Witch Hunts - the war on women which continues even today.

                       <p>
                        So you're willing to have people around you sick and dying because of illness when they have no health insurance.
Btw, health insurance isn't health care -- it's insurance which usually doesn't work and which is immensely expensive in most cases.
We need real National Health Care which understands the value of prevention and the need for a healthy society.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You also don't seem to be aware that US health care ranks 37th among nations -- 
and Cuba has a higher ranking than the US does !!!! ????

                        WEALTHY/ELITES once came to the US for very expensive care and exotic treatments.
Understand that Canada and its National Health Care system outranks US health care.

                            And, if you've actually paid attention to the information about child abusers, especially
that information given by survivors of MKULTRA, then you know that beyond Hillary and Podesta,
Biden and Obama, that just as many from the GOP are involved -- from GHWB to W Bush, from
Sen. Byrd to Rep. Dennis Hastert.  Former Pres. Gerald Ford is mentioned. 
Former Pres. Richard Nixon.

              I forgot about that. There was a lot of stuff that assange and FBI anon etc never got around to.  I think Comey was in the way.  FBI anon and hli after the election said that potus, assange, and other good guys were regrouping trying to figure out the best way and time to inform the public

               FBIAnon said he didn't think Trump would win. Julian Assange didn't think so, either.

              <p>
               FBIAnon also said, if I recall correctly, that deep state goodguys were worried what they would leak could cause a civil war and bring down the government, and that the preference was to try to clean house internally without disclosing the full horror.

                FBI anon and many of his fellow agents hoped Trump would win.  He said they were doing everything they could to see to that because they knew of hillary's horrors and were disgusted they were being swept under the rug.
               </p>
               <p>
                Assange said he didn't think they'd "let" Trump win.  They didn't cast enough illegal votes in Hilary's favor to snag a victory.  They had NO idea how many supported Pres Trump

                Yea theres that whole thing again re: lets just try and improve things internally and keep the public in the dark as usual because we wana maintain the status quo which also happens to be a pretty corrupt shit storm of a situation.. Basically to avoid a messy Revolution well try for a quiet cleaning up which I reckon fucking sucks big time!
This strategy has gotten us nowhere in the past.. Look at Nixon.. And all the others.. They don't even get any jail time.. Just step down off the stage and disappear.. 
There has to be action!
There has to be Revolution!
 It has to get messy!
 Screw this namby pamby BS!
