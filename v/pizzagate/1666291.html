            "Is it even realistic for 2 pizza shops to generate a gross $5 million in a period of a year?"
I worked at a pizza place in Nashville. They're revenue was typically $10mil+ a year. So definitely possible for two pizza shops to do. They would need to be BUSY though. The place I worked at was one of Nashvilles busiest restaurants. It was stuck in a place between two college and lots of housing which helped a lot.

            Lets see how this adds up: 100 pizzas a day x $10 a pizza = $1000 per day gross revenue * 365 * 3 restaurants = GITDAFUKOOUTTAHEEEYA

            I just posted this video little bit ago. its translation of a Greek article discussing this issue, and how Mr. Katsiantonis has ties with the NGO called Smile Of The Child. Connections also with HRC. There's some weird connection also with a company involved in possible stem cell research? or transplants? Im not sure because she doesn't translate the whole thing. Maybe someone knows Greek and can translate the rest of the article.

            I wish I understood more about the business tax laws but it seems highly unlikely that any restaurant outside a national chain could generate that much money.  Very suspicious and you raise good points.  I disbelieve this article.  It's "fake news".

            this seems like an extreme action for simply owing money, and it says they are looking at the documents for criminal activity expected to take months. He is probably going to be charged with something. My bet is that they (NSA) got info on him from phone or text intel and then local cops conveniently use the tax irregularity to "find" evidence of crimes they already know about. probably bribery or something.

            Tax evasion was how they finally put Capone behind bars. A lot of this PG shit is run like a RICO case if half of what's been uncovered is true. Everything is run via proxies, the suspects have a lot of money and power. The added problem which is something Capone didn't have the power to do is affect legislature and public opinion which the current suspects often do.

            The most likely scenario to catching them with cases is likely going to be stuff like this. You get someone in jail and heads start rolling in related cases and they will start to believe everyone else is snitching on them and cooperate for reduced sentences.

            If Trump just released a video of Podesta and HRC eating a babies arm tomorrow the speculation would be deafening and people would be protesting. If there's 50+ people sitting in jail on cases from CP to tax evasion to human trafficking people are going to start drawing the same conclusions we have which is "something is going on here".

            We have taken the fact that there is smoke to extrapolate that there is fire but we haven't found the fire yet. What we need now is a bunch of little sparks and it will begin to feed itself.

            I will never underestimate the power of the press after the WMD witch hunt in 2001 which led to the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. We need to make sure when things happen we can provide fully sourced breakdowns for them so shit is irrefutable and we can influence people who weren't interested in looking into it.

            It seems like 150-200% of the volume you'd expect from typical small to medium pizza joints. But if they do a lot of beer or are larger, it could be about right.

            The pizza places are bars too. And its very possible for two pizza places (i think it was 3 though) to generate $1M. Especially if they sell booz too.

            Im nearly 100% sure this is just a tax issue and nothing to do with pedos. Im from the area.

             It would be much more suspicious if we found a sketchy Instagram for the pizzashops with references to Satanism, the occult, or child abuse.

              Others have tied this guy to Alefantis in other posts on here and twitter, but I'm not sure how reliable these sources are.  I see any lead as worthy of investigating, but I am not claiming he is guilty of anything either.  This is close to home for me so I want it fully looked at.

             I didn't consider that they were bars, but youre right that would certainly add to the total.  I'm from the area as well and have been to all of these places for pizza, but never stuck around for drinks because they simply aren't that type of place(I guess Tommy Ks could be, but it is super dingy)
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason I said 2 places is because he only owns 2 of the three pizza places which were searched.  Zoey's is owned by someone else, but they are also included in the search warrants so  something is going on there as well.  He wouldn't owe any taxes for business done at Zoey's, so my estimate is for Tommy Ks and Grand Slam 2.  That means those two places grossed $5 million($2.5 million/shop) in a year based on the articles stats. I still find that hard to believe, but more realistic with the bar portion in play.

              Can you go back and do a recon and get an idea of the interior square footage and compare that to a birds eye view of the building to see if there could be back rooms? Were there any funky photos/ wall art or logos that were suspect?
