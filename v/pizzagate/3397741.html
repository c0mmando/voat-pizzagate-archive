<p>The sting that netted this woman was in july 2018 so we may have covered her before, but this sounds like it could be NXIVM related </p>

<p>&quot;A Colombian Instagram model moonlighted as an international underage sex trafficking madame who recruited vulnerable girls to service celebrity clients, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The high-profile trial for Liliana del Carmen Campos Puello is now underway in Cartagena, where prosecutors say she headquartered the child prostitution ring along with 17 others, The Times of London reported.</p>
<p>Authorities arrested the accused in a July 2018 sting known as “Operation Vesta.”</p>
<p>Among the horrors the child sex slaves were allegedly forced to endure, were tattoo brandings by their “owners” and sex parties on luxury yachts and hotels.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old buxom brunette, nicknamed “La Madame,” reportedly recruited up to 400 girls, many from poor backgrounds, to service glamorous clients, including celebrities and politicians.</p>
<p>On social media, she flaunted the fruits of her labor.&quot;</p>',

            Israelis arrested in Colombia on suspicion of sex trafficking -
            <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5423075,00.html">

            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Suspects reportedly scouted local schools, recruiting underage girls as sex workers for drug-fueled parties, attended largely by Israeli businessmen and discharged IDF soldiers. The illegal sex business was marketed as 'tour packages.'
            </p>
            <p>
             ...“The investigation into the sexual exploitation of girls was started the day Israeli national Shay Azran was murdered in Medellin, which was ordered by another Israeli over a property dispute,” the Colombian prosecutor's office said.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             The prosecutor's office also claimed the person who put out a hit on Azran was an Israeli businessman—
             <strong>
              Assi Ben-Mosh
             </strong>
             —who was extradited back to Israel in November 2017 following suspected drug and tax offenses, as well as soliciting minors for prostitution.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Ben-Mosh also reportedly turned Hotel Benjamin in Taganga, which he owned, into a drug and prostitution den.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             This led the investigators to believe that Ben-Mosh was the one overseeing the sex trafficking network, and the purpose of his visits to the Latin American country was to receive reports from his colleagues—Itay Senyor and
             <strong>
              Mor Zohar
             </strong>
             —regarding the business's operations.

            She is connected to A. Moshe, an Israeli who was head of the operation and still has child sex trafficking operations going on in other Southern American countries like Brazil.
           </p>
           <p>
            He started as a drug trafficker decades ago, and then specialized in sex trafficking, providing girls for Israelis who came to Colombia. He was allowed to leave the country without charges, so imo he is probably Mossad.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think that there is a NXIVM connection, branding trafficking victims is common among pimps and traffickers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I vaguely seem to remember that Moshe was arrested in Portugal some months ago, but not sure whether they charged him.

             It's definitely connected to the whole CIA/Clinton/John of God/Virgin Islands trafficking network.  See my comment.

             Her last name is Puello? I wonder if she is related to Jorge Puello, the "Jewish" "lawyer" conman for Laura Silsby in Haiti who was later busted along with his wife for human trafficking? He's the guy who went on Greta Van Sustren's show and said Silsby got the orphans from Friends of the Orphans (Nuestros Pequenos Hermanos), the organization that Alefantis' pal Maccoby sits on the board of in DC.
