<p>I know people are obviously busy with the Epstein suicide story, but I wanted to bring something up that could be of importance. I just noticed today that my two previous articles (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2043070">here</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2043879">here</a>) about Greta Van Susteren and her Fox News interview of accused Haitian child trafficker, Laura Silsby, appear to have been scrubbed from Google Search results. Please read these two article for the full context, but basically I go into detail about Greta\'s extremely suspect personal past history, when back in the late 80s/early 90s she played a significant role as a then-relatively unknown DC attorney, in helping cover up significant aspects of the &quot;Franklin Scandal&quot;-related child sex trafficking scandal that hit DC and Omaha, NE in the 80s. In Part 2 of the articles, I question the extreme suspiciousness of the fact that Greta, in partnership with Franklin Graham (the son of deceased televangelist Billy Graham), is currently running an orphanage for Haitian Children in Haiti. The orphanage is called the &quot;Greta Home and Academy&quot; and is located in Leogane, Haiti. The orphanage is part of the larger &quot;Samaritan\'s Purse&quot; Christian Evangelical organization run by Franklin Graham. I should say again that Australian ritual abuse survivor Fiona Barnett, has repeatedly accused Franklin\'s father Billy Graham of raping her when she was an underage child.</p>
<p><strong>Today, when I Googled the terms &quot;Greta Van Susteren Jorge Puello,&quot; Greta Jorge Puello,&quot; &quot;Greta Van Susteren Laura Silsby,&quot; and &quot;Greta Laura Silsby,&quot; I was not able to find ANY links to my <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2043070">previous two Voat articles.</a> I really really apologize for this as an investigator, but I didn\'t take any screenshots of my google results for these search terms (which I know I should have).  However, I can honestly say, I have googled these exact terms a number of times over the previous (close to) 2 years since  these Van Susteren articles have been posted to Voat. My articles have consistently been in the top #1-#4 Google search results, up until literally about a week ago, when I last remember searching for some of these terms.</strong> I apologize I don\'t have the time right now to do a more detailed search results history for my articles, but if anyone has time to do a little bit of that kind of research, it would definitely be greatly appreciated. In addition, when I specifically added the word &quot;Voat&quot; to these searches (ie Greta Van Susteren Jorge Puello Voat), I STILL did not find any links to my articles, unless they got super super buried in the search results. </p>
<p>And  another thing: I\'m sure plenty of people already know, but PLEASE do screenshots and archive photos of Google search results for any of your posted Voat articles. Don\'t know when they might get scrubbed.</p>
<p>Finally, Im sure people are asking the obvious question: what potential or documented connections are there between Van Susteren and now-deceased Jeffrey Epstein? <strong>When I looked through the copy of Epstein\'s little black book I downloaded, I honestly didn\'t see Van Susteren\'s name in it anywhere.</strong> However, if anyone else has been able to unearth any connections, would definitely be appreciated if you shared.</p>

            They're definitely hiding search results. I was looking for a particular 9/11 video the other day - one that's a really fast talking "to believe the official narrative of 9/11 you gotta believe blah blah blah".  Couldn't find it. Then I was looking for the Michelle/Michael dancing on Ellen and that one seems buried too. Dirty bastards!

Also, and even better, please read Henry Vinson's book "DC Madam," co-written with Nick Bryant, and Nick Bryant's "Franklin Scandal," for a much fuller picture of Van Susteren's involvement in the "Franklin Scandal" coverup

            Connection Between Bill Clinton And Child Trafficker Laura Silsby

             https://www.captainsjournal.com/2017/01/25/connection-between-bill-clinton-and-child-trafficker-laura-silsby/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Molly Hightower and Erin Kloos' brother, Ryan, died in the collapse of a 7 story Haitian orphanage building. If I remember right the children had already been removed . I don't have my links anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            I read most of Molly's online journal back then and she and Erin were waiting for Bill Clinton to show up a few months prior to the earthquake He didn't show up. I think Molly and Erin were genuine in the desire to help people. But their story connects some dots including Jorge Puello.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is evidence that Bill Clinton, who is famous for boarding the Lolita Express 26 times, is connected with Friends of the Orphans. No information is available regarding Bill Clinton’s visit to Haiti between November-December, while his last documented visit was during October. This points to the theory that Bill Clinton has personal connections with someone within Friends of the Orphans. To top it off, it was scheduled a few days prior to Thanksgivings, and a month prior to Laura Silsby’s initial visit to Haiti. Private matters?
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            This may explain why there was no investigation done into the orphanage in question, nor any statements made by a representative of the orphanage, and also why Laura Silsby was let off so easily. After all, as a reputable orphanage, wouldn’t you want to clear any misunderstandings? Because the spotlight was shone at Laura Silsby, the surrounding suspicions were buried. It was a Freudian slip by Jorge Puello, wanted child-trafficker who had represented Silsby as a lawyer in a Fox News interview, that revealed this connection."

             This is utterly and completely false.  Many, many bits of this story were completely misreported including by voat user redberries who captain's journal relies on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here are two facts to understand.
            </p>
            <h1 id="md-the-building-that-collapsed-was-not-an-orphanage">
             The building that collapsed was NOT AN ORPHANAGE
            </h1>
            <p>
             and
            </p>
            <h1 id="md-silsby-did-not-get-her-kids-from-this-organization.--she-had-nothing-do-with-it.-they-had-nothing-to-do-with-her">
             Silsby did not get her kids from this organization.  She had nothing do with it. They had nothing to do with her
            </h1>
            <p>
             In short, the pizzagate community got this entirely wrong.  So if Silsby didn't get her kids from this orgnaization, how did they get connected?

             Jorge Puello was lying
            </h1>
            <p>
             Some backstory to understand first
            </p>
            <h2 id="md-friends-of-the-orphans-did-not-run-orphanages-in-haiti.">
             Friends of the Orphans did not run orphanages in Haiti.
            </h2>
            <p>
             Friends of the Orphans was a US based fund raising group.  They just raised money.  They didn't run anything.  The organization that they raised money for was called Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos (Our Little Brothers.) They run orphanages in several countries including Haiti.  In Haiti NPH was known as Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs or NPFS (Our Little Brothers and Sisters) because they don't speak Spanish in Haiti but French.  Friends of the Orphans was later renamed to NPH USA to make the relationship clearer.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that Puello references an US organization is a gigantic signal that Puello was lying in this interview.  Why is this a signal?  Because, remember Puello was a con man and he was lying during this entire episode.  He didn't represent Silsby as a lawyer, because he was not a lawyer. He was lying.   So he couldn't actually represent them  because in addition to not being a lawyer, he didn't speak French.  The Baptists were actually represented by French-speaking Haitian Laywers and Puello seemed to be involved with some grift.  He got into a fight with the Haitian lawyer about the money the families of the Baptists put up for legal fees.  It's not even clear if Puello ever was allowed to go to the jail and speak to Silsby.  What he did was find out the churches they were involved with and called the relatives in the US and claim he could help them.  He was dealing with some of the families, but giving that he was not a lawyer and, of course, not allowed to practice law in Haiti, it's unclear if he actually spoke to the Baptists in jail or if he just told reporters he did.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because talking about the Friends of the Orphans seems like something he would get from web searching US and English speaking media, not first hand on the ground.  Why do I say this? Because the organization was known as NPFS to locals and the orphanage was know as St. Helene.  And guess what St. Helene did not collapse.  It was in Kenescoff which is up in the mountains about 5,000 feet up. They didn't see the catastrophic damage they saw at sea level.  So these sentences are false.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Molly Hightower and Erin Kloos' brother, Ryan, died in the collapse of a 7 story Haitian orphanage building. If I remember right the children had already been removed .
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             NPFS did have a building that collapsed. The building that collapsed was the Father Watson Center.  It was not an orphanage.  It was mainly an office building and there was a school for disabled children nearby on that complex which was an old hospital camus.  That was in the Petitionville section of Port Au Prince and not near the NPFS orphanage in Kenescoff.

             Silsby didn't get her kids from that organization anyway.
            </h1>
            <p>
             We know EXACTLY where Silsby got her kids and it doesn't match at all what con man Jorge Puello said.  The AP tracked where Silsby got everyone of the 33 children and she did not get them from towns associated with NPH/NPSF.  13 were from Citron and 20 were from Callabas. None were orphans.  She approached an orphanage, but was turned away and she went directly to the villagers themselves. She basically convinced their parents she would give them a better life in the Dominican Republic. She working with a pastor she met, Jean Sainvil who was part of something called Haiti Sharing Jesus Ministry
            </p>
            <p>
             This is from the AP report in 2010
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A reporter's visit Saturday to the rubble-strewn Citron slum, where 13 of the children lived, led to their parents, all of whom said they turned their youngsters over to the missionary group voluntarily in hopes of getting them to safety. Similar explanations were given by parents in the mountain town of Callabas, outside Port-au-Prince, who told the AP on Feb. 3 that desperation and blind faith led them to hand over 20 children to the Baptist group.

             Also, very very important point: the Captain's Journal article makes the argument, that the fact that Jorge Puello referred to the collapsed orphanage as "Friends of the Orphans," could not be a random mistake of his:
            </p>
            <p>
             "To clarify for any skeptics who believe this could have been a coincidence or a lie from Jorge Puello. Aside from the fact that there are around 760 orphanages in Haiti, the reason this cannot be a fabrication is because the name of the orphanage which Jorge Puello used was its English variant, “Friends of the Orphans”, which Puello could not have known unless he was told. This is because the orphanage is known in Haiti as Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs, which translates to “Our Little Brothers and Sisters”, and not “Friends of the Orphans”. The staff call it NPFS, and not even the signs outside of the building writes “Friends of the Orphans”. It’s simply not plausible."

             Thanks for this, I actually didn't know about this particular potential connection between Bill Clinton himself and Friends of the Orphans. And you are definitely right, in the Greta interview, Puello clearly did refer specifically to "Friends of the Orphans" as the orphanage that collapsed in the earthquake.

              If I remember right, there was a discrepancy in the number of orphans in Molly's journal. There are pictures of this collapsed orphanage and the buildings around it. Did these girls accidentally find out things that the powers-that-be wanted kept secret.

             Also if I remember right, the buildings around this one were still standing. I believe this one collapsed after the initial earthquake, but I can't find my old links. I always had my suspicions about  their deaths.
