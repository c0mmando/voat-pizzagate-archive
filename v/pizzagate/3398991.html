           <p>
            Do any of these things mean anything to you?  HAARP,

            A kid that testified that the president of the united states (idk which one) raped him, and that warren buffet raped him. Basically if your a billionaire all these things they do are basically like the rolls royce of debauchery. They buy yachts, they buy rolls royces, they have private planes, and then they molest children in these parties that is run by elites. Thats their version of sexual experiences thats the rolls royce of sex.

            With the Death / Suicide / Arkancide / Escape of Epstein being as momentous an event as the assassination of JFK, affecting who knows how many of the world's elites, moguls, royals and super-multi-billionaires we would expect the involvement of the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Illuminati and Masons, who like to leave symbols in plain sight to taunt the peasantry. In the case of JFK the 3rd Degree of Freemasonry tells the legend of three “unworthy craftsman”—Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum—who murdered Hiram Abiff, the architect of Solomon’s Temple. Similarly, three tramps were arrested in Dealey Plaza, then afterwards released. One of the tramps was later identified as E. Howard Hunt. So if the two sleeping guards represent two of the three "unworthy craftsmen" who is the third? -- Another interesting piece at medium (.) com/@HeapingHelping (/) who-are-the-royal-order-of-jesters-55ffe6f6acea -- "Who Are The Royal Order of Jesters? Uncovering a Police-Driven, International Sex Trafficking Ring that Actually Happened."

            In an interview, Gates talked about his family, in particular - his dad. He told the interviewer that his father was a eugenicist, and that for many years his dad was the head of Planned Parenthood . When Bill Gates divulged this information, it was clear that he felt proud of his father for his work.

            And Wilbur Ross of Rothschild INC bankruptcy department is Trumps Commerce Secretary. Rothschild saved Trump from bankruptcy over his Taj Majal hotel. Trump is also connecte to Rockefeller through his controling interest in Resort International. It is a CIA/Mossad/Mob front backed by Rothschild and Rockefeller. He is also a Templar/Jesuit Freemason. Yet this sub and most the subverted alt media sells him as fighting these forces. He works for them. He is part of their society and is pushing all aspects of agenda 21 including forced vaccines, Palantir program, 5G. The entire government is subverted. They all work for the owners of the Federal Reserve and the IRS. All intel agencies are Freemasons and intel agencies all are corporations and subsidiaries of SIS (British sevret Intelligence Service) SIS was set up by the Bank of England(Rothschild cartel). Trump is theirs. Trump vs the deep state is a psyop to keep you frm acting by thinking people in high places are fighting for you. The connections are undeniable.

                First bit that really stands out for me is : the "Blue Brain Project” of EPFL. I've come to understand that the colour BLUE in projects is code for Israel.  And sure enough:

                I also had a lightbulb moment.  One of the main reasons why the Israelis are often far ahead of other countries in the tech and science fields is because of the vast blackmailing system that they set up through people like Wexner and Epstein.

              Trust the Truth......Why do you just ask questions when you evidently are sitting on a pile of information.....some of which is local and most people do not have access.  Why do you follow Q's format when everybody following it is aware Trump is very involved? Why does reddit allow their Major League Baseball  streams to show porn advertisement...when young boys are part of the viewers who 's families might  be irate if they knew? Just threw that last one in because it really is kinda' fun. ...maybe not for the reader though.
