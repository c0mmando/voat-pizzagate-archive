<p>This chapter will debunk a hole</p>
<p>in the case (making the case stronger by tossing the red herrings), dig deeper into Rocky Road, IDing a new suspect and providing a potential “howdunnit” to the Rocky Road incident.</p>

<p><a href="https://findadeath.com/heather-orourke/">https://findadeath.com/heather-orourke/</a> Apparently, that giardia infection came from drinking water from a campsite. Likely in December 1986. Given how close she lived to outdoors environmemts, this is actually quite logical. This debunks the Giardia lead as a red herring. Note that the infection WAS used as part of the cover up. However, her having bowel obstruction incidents all her life IS relevant, as shown below from the account of a doctor I found. </p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/8vdu.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/8vdu.jpg</a> Part 1 of the account. Note the references to scar tissue and how no one investigated the possibility of sexual abuse. </p>

<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/8uwx.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/8uwx.jpg</a> Got a tip off from a certain account <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> mentioned once. The account retweeted a tweet of the Mr. Culkin interview about Heather being skinned. It suspects Dick Vane as the man being refered to....with the caveat that both he and Chris Colombus work as the same team of people.</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3402826">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3402826</a> Since the Bronfmans have Mossad ties, this indirectly applies to Spielberg too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/hollywood-liberal-gun-nuts/">http://www.unz.com/isteve/hollywood-liberal-gun-nuts/</a> Ah, the left’s stance of “guns for me but not for thee”.

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System</a> This is the studio that produced Rocky Road. Ties to Adult Swim Cartoon Network, and CNN, all of them being flagged by us in the past.</p>
<p>This paragraph is purely deduction. All those guys came into the studio knowing Heather was going to be there on 11/7/1986. That is only possble if someone at TBS tipped the pedos off in advance. I suspect it is either one of the producers of Rocky Road or an executive at TBS.</p>

CNN pushed the official narrative. Given CNN’s ties to the company involved in the Rocky Road incident, we officially have a motive for them to be involved in the cover up.</p>
<p>Lastly, some more memes. </p>

<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           Apparently, that giardia infection came from drinking water from a campsite. Likely in December 1986. Given how close she lived to outdoors environmemts, this is actually quite logical. This debunks the Giardia lead as a red herring. Note that the infection WAS used as part of the cover up. However, her having bowel obstruction incidents all her life IS relevant, as shown below from the account of a doctor I found.

           mentioned once. The account retweeted a tweet of the Mr. Culkin interview about Heather being skinned. It suspects Dick Vane as the man being refered to....with the caveat that both he and Chris Colombus work as the same team of people.

           Dick Vane was the executive producer of Home Alone 2. Meaning he could easily have been one of the 3 men who caused the fatal incident.

           Richard Vane is another one of Spielberg’s regular associates along with Frank Marshall. For the record, so is Chris Colombus. The Spielberg Pedo Ring being “the team” refered to above.

           Since the Bronfmans have Mossad ties, this indirectly applies to Spielberg too.

           Ah, the left’s stance of “guns for me but not for thee”. Turns out Spielberg has quite a collection of guns and knows how to use them. This will be important to know later.

           This is the studio that produced Rocky Road. Ties to Adult Swim Cartoon Network, and CNN, all of them being flagged by us in the past.
          </p>
          <p>
           This paragraph is purely deduction. All those guys came into the studio knowing Heather was going to be there on 11/7/1986. That is only possble if someone at TBS tipped the pedos off in advance. I suspect it is either one of the producers of Rocky Road or an executive at TBS.

           Jamie Dlux vid about Heather. CNN pushed the official narrative. Given CNN’s ties to the company involved in the Rocky Road incident, we officially have a motive for them to be involved in the cover up.

           CNN helped cover up the truth about Heather.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

              OK I'm  getting   updated  on  Hampstead,
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not typically  religious but  I had to  stop and pray to the  Gods for  protection and strength reading this;
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't  know  about  other  people  but i really  feel these events as I  read them,  its  looking  into the  souls  of psychopathsl.
             </p>
             <p>
              My feelings after  reading  the  article  is-surely there  are "squads" of devoted  men who  pursue these  monsters  and  eradicate  them? I'm  not talking  about  military (hell-Michael Aquino is a fucking  officer! And the  heads  of  most big  city police departments  are co-conspirators) This is  something  I  have  never run  across, but  I'm sure certain  men  who  have  the resources  and  intel  must  be searching  for these  monsters, heroes no  one  will  ever  hear  about probably

               You missed a few posts in the past years, maybe. That is OK. Let us not get into reptilian spacey people talk. They have been doing that, from what some are saying.  What are the red shoes about? I Know, but you do not. That raises a red flag for me. You are a shill.

                 I like your work, but it is hard for me to comprehend how you missed that from Darknight. I spend less time here than anyone else, I would imagine(job). I can truthfully see me missing something like that, but not you. Skin of children would obviously have to be veneered/glued onto a stronger leather like pigskin, and be done by a compromised specialist. I have also heard of the rumors before I was on the internet. Before I even heard of the rumors, I was working at a house on Long Boat Key where a fashion designer who made shoes needed a very small hidden basement. He had shoes all over the house, RED displayed prominently, and most were petite woman's, like little girls. Sorry if you are offended, but I have an attacky personality. Nothing different in real life. I am Convinced that Sir Richard Branson is David Icke in prosthetics and makeup, and spread the entire reptilian conspiracy.That is what triggered me. I am not such a bad guy. I want to believe in other people. At least you are not a coward who down votes without a comment. Keep it real.
