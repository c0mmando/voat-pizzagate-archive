<p>Looks like meat is back on the menu.  Can\'t wait for all the happenings and salt....and also hoping the audio/video of HRC\'s 2:30 AM concession call is as epic as it is in my imagination.  Would it be too much to ask that video of HRC assaulting Podesta surfaces?</p>
<p>FTA: &quot;Early last week, two days apart, I received information from both a State Department and an FBI employee that their immediate supervisors were packing their personal items at work in anticipation of being transferred, or more likely fired from their position for their “Deep State” affiliations which ran in opposition to the Trump administration. I was also led to believe, by these two informants that Trump was preparing to go after the first layer of the Deep State within various federal agencies.</p>
<p>The blockbuster tip came when I was told that Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner would likely be turning state’s evidence on child-sex-trafficking charges for information that was found by the FBI on their personal computers on a file named “life insurance”. Three days after I received the report, I published the following podcast, which was published two full days prior to the revelation of the most recent coverup by Comey, with regard to these emails, which led to the firing of the FBI Director. As it turns out this tip was very accurate in regard to the nature of the emails possessed by Abedin and her husband the former Congressman, Anthony Weiner.&quot;</p>',
