            Who's saying they didn't change their sign? There are archived pictures of their website that can be compared to the website now. As for physical signs on their building, that'll likely take a little more time to change. And I appreciate your effort to contribute, but I doubt your phone call will be of much help mainly because it can already be shown that they changed their symbol, and a verbal confirmation by them isn't really necessary.
