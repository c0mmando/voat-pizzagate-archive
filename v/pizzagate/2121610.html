            This is a restaurant? With a bedroom in it? There has to be blackmail going on in this room. Can anyone from DC confirm if this bedroom is actually inside of Perrys?

            This is from an 8chan post:
           </p>
           <p>
            The ROJ headquarters is in Indiana. 5725 Liberty Crossing Dr, Indianapolis, IN 46254. Right by a residential subdivision and school for starters. These are the fucks put in place in high positions in police departments to thwart pedo investigations. Another place he brings up is casinos, which northern Indiana has. State law makes it so gaming can only be done on boats. Casinos play a part in trafficking and Indiana's casinos can travel the great lakes if need be. Don't forget to look up other ROJ locations the anon talked about, especially the DC location.

              There are a lot of well hidden trannies as daycare workers too. You don't really notice them until you start looking for it. Satanists sometimes change change gender as a tribute to the baphomet. This could also be a way to abuse kids and not raise suspicions.

              Perry's appears to be a gay sushi restaurant with an in-house drag act (Perry's Drag Bunch) performing while you eat.
I think children are in allowed in too (there's a few in these photo's)

            Looking at my county for ROJ activity,  the secrecy is a reality so it's hard to find anything.  BUT obituaries are very telling of associations and companies the dead member of ROJ was involved in and their siblings. Also abourt following the catds.  Marin county which comes in 3rd from suadi Arabia and DC in child trafficking also has one card room.  PETE'S 881 CLUB, in San Rafael. If following the cards, means following the casinos then...PETES 881 club is s very discrete location.

            The economy can be moved to be fixed; if Trump reinstates mix use zoning to reallow home business and citizens demand it in unity vs fight over statues and other absurd issues puahed via agendas.
America was founded on home business. Building a infrastructure of home businss and communities/transport that can connect with ease and withstand disasters is key; and would be a new paradigm of infrastructure that would boost the economy. So many types of emergng business would boom and create jobs and mentor training. NADAQ would take a hit and could then be restructured to push ot the players our economy is dependant on ; yet dependancy not needed. The multi corporate medical establishment can be changed and needs to. Solar/wind/other, advancd public transport rails,  vertical gardening/agricultural, drone delivery, medicall modalities, pharmaceutical and resarch, architecture and development, and more. In fact, thse are where the solutions reside to prevent poverty/infectious disease outbusts/ disaster full destruction; yet what the old players want to come in and take over in their controls and shady agendas. The microloan with cell is one of the many jobs of dark elite versus people demanding their own home stores and feasible infrastructures. Lemonade stands are not allowed in most counties now. Poor areas had small business rights taken and dependent on factory jobs to sex clubs. BLM and black local government tok the rights away; as do govt home loans (rural and veteran also) on a FEDERAL BASIS. ( See the application front page directions: No home business operations. SBA is a joke, must be in biz many years and have credit/collateral/profits. As Harvey and Irma show, electric grid dependance and stopping entire communities from functioning is easy and areas of plight can be easily pushed to the next step of third world poverty. Too stop Pgate, the connected infrastructures and poverty are key. So what if theur old economies fall. The questions are how to plan ahead and implement economies that work for all, prevent monopolizing, build infrastructures of access, efficiency, withstand all types of natural and manmade disasters. Part of agenda is create fear and dependance. Small business, home based are easy solutions of non dependance. Basic economics s to be consumer plus producer, not just consumer.

             Just the fact that its accepted and tolerated that local and up politicians run on costly campaigns and backers/corporate lobby needs to stop, and the same players with no real citizen inclusion. No legit politician that works to run infrastructures and goals to keep communities safe, thriving and eal comunut inclusion, peole a resoyrces via skills and ideas will ever happen with positions filled by what money and status buys. Oout with old, in with new, using what works of old, such as home business.

            He/she says to look at where procurement takes place, and look to who is involved in the logistics.  NGOs are involved in the logistics, and are there close to where the children are procured.  That's why Soros funds all these NGOs.

            I have an issue with his telling ordinary people to start going out investigating live and finding out who is blackmailing.  This is hard to do when you don't know exactly what or whom you're looking for.

            He says that many, many people on the inside know EXACTLY what's going on. Well, why don't THEY anonymously share what they know.

            It appears that Trump is surrounded by these people.  They've cornered him, and he's got nowhere to go, except if he can make the US economy do well.   I hope God is with him.

              Sure that is one part of it. But trump would not be able to fix the economy without that happening. It is in too bad state. And i think it's not completely on purpose so, simple human greed plays a major role in this.

             It actually makes a ton of sense for Bernie to be clean. If Bernie were NOT clean, how do you explain him being allowed to run against Hillary for so long? The more I think about it, the more it makes sense that both Bernie and Trump are clean because if they weren't they would never have been allowed to go as far as they did.

              No way, Bernie's wife is a crook! Bernie was needed to get Trump voters. Once Bernie stepped a side, it was assumed his supporters would go to HillPedo. However, Wikileaks happened and fucked HillPedo by pissing off Bernie's supporters. Bernie was blackmailed, which means he is not clean!

               Bernies wife is potentially guilty of some minor-by-comparison financial crime which I assume would have come out during the primaries if they actually had it.
              </p>
              <p>
               It also makes no sense that Bernie would have been "used to get Trump voters". Bernies campaign was highly damaging to Hillary and caused her to lose votes that she would otherwise have had. The Sanders wing stayed home on election day because he was cheated so badly and obviously.
              </p>
              <p>
               If Bernie IS blackmailed, what's your evidence? There is evidence to the contrary in the form of a very long and divisive presidential campaign that would not have been allowed to continue imo had he been blackmailed.

                 This logic is backwards. If the DNC had dirt on Bernie they wouldn't have allowed him to run against the anointed one at all. The fact that he was able to run like he did is strong evidence that he is relatively clean, at least by Washingtons standards. The same is true of Trump.

            Reminder of 2012 story implicating FL Congressman Bilirakis, Royal Jesters and underage prostitutes…

           <p>
            As Eyewitness News first exclusively reported, Congressman Gus Bilirakis gave campaign funds to a group called the "Royal Order of Jesters" Tampa Chapter for dues and an event registration.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a sworn federal document, the FBI says the Jesters parties or "books of the play" generally include prostitutes who perform commercial sex acts on members.

            FBI determined to be human traffickers numbering approximately 22,000. The FBI in Buffalo uncovered this formerly secret group of human traffickers, organized and calling themselves the Royal Order of Jesters (aka “The Jesters”).

            I found this email from 2005 alluding to sex acts and the ROJ. There are more links at the bottom. Its was pretty high up in my google search so probably nothing earth shattering but it has a few names to maybe track down.

            Subject: Shriners: Royal Order of Jesters 
Date: Tue, 19 Apr 2005
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Jester Symbol Please post this anonymously! Please do not include my email address in your posting of this message. Masons and Shriners are pissed off about this email in Texas.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most Worshipful Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Texas, Right Worshipful Grand Officers, and Brethren:
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m a Shriner in Texas. I have been a Shriner for many, many years.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am also a Jester in the Royal Order of Jesters within the Shrine. I have not attended Blue Lodge in ages. I am going to leave my name anonymous for various reasons. I am married to a wonderful woman (the 2nd one in my life thanks to the Shriners) and I have children who have moved on to lives of their own. However, what I am about to portray to you could endanger my life and the life of my family.
            </p>
            <p>
             While in the shrine I was very active. Taking my family with me on the weekends to events was a very exciting time in my life, and the life of my family. I was approached in the Shrine and was told that I was a good Shriner and that I was invited to join a secret society within the Shrine–The Royal Order of Jesters. This "secret society" was started back in the late teens of the 20th century. The motto was "Mirth is King" and was devoted to not brooding over sorrows, but to forget them as far as possible. This meant home life as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             My brothers, I am a sinner. I have sinned against my family. I have sinned against myself. I have sinned against God.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jester Symbol During the initiation of new Jesters I was offered the opportunity by another fellow brother to sleep with a whore, even though I had a wife and kids waiting for me to come home. I was not strong at the time and I violated every oath I had ever taken with my wife. This did not stop at initiation. These were a constant occurrence at our Jester functions and they are a common occurrence today. The initiation practices have not changed as well. Prostitutes were offered/made available at our functions and often brothers would have sex in front of other brothers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oral sex competitions between brothers were considered “fun” activities to build a strong brotherhood bond between members of the Royal Order of Jesters. Potentates and Chaplains, Attorneys and Judges, Past Masters and brothers all participating or watching with open eyes, but closed minds. I often felt ashamed of what I was doing, but the pleasure outweighed the guilt. I had fallen within a deep hole and my cable-tow had been severed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sex, illegal gambling and Alcohol were and are the preferred order of business to ease the "pain" of brother masons. Prostitutes are available at Jester functions for the brothers to have their way with.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am currently active in the Shriners and the Jesters. I am ashamed of what I have become and what the Shriners have become. I have seen threat after threat made against Masonic brothers who have not agreed or have spoken against the activities of our club. These activities are in every Royal Order of Jester’s club in the USA, and beyond our borders. You would be surprised if you knew who was Jester from your local blue lodges–outstanding, moral men–at least by their outwardly appearance. Our Most Worshipful Grand Chaplain of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Texas is a member of the Royal Order of Jesters, along with the Deputy Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Texas!!! I’m calling you out brothers. It is time for us to raise the bar of Masonry in Texas, even at the expense of our fraternity. Our Most Worshipful Grand Master Elmer Murphy of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Texas always talks about the character of a Master Mason and now he has the opportunity to present his true Masonic character when dealing with this issue given how close he is in relation to current active members in the Royal Order of Jesters.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Jesters pride themselves in having control of all leadership positions at all of the Shrine Temples in the US and Canada as well as the Imperial Shrine leadership. Also, they have risen through the ranks in every body of Masonry including the Scottish Rite, York Rite, Rosicrucians, Red Cross of Constantine, Eastern Star and the Demolay Organizations. There have been numerous past masters of the Grand Lodge of Texas who have been Jesters, including our most recent Grand Master Boyd Patterson, Reese Harrison Jr., and Michael Nanny. Find out who these other Masons are brothers within your local lodges and hold them accountable for their actions. I have invoked the cry of a Masonic brother in need of help!

            When this Anon said "keep digging on Racine", I decided to look into it because a recent comment on an earlier thread here about Racine sparked my interest. In my first few hours, I've found a few interesting tidbits:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             1) There are a few major "Clusters" where there are multiple sex offenders living very closely together, sometimes next door to eachother (except there's 4 or 5 houses in a row with sex offenders)
            </li>
            <li>
             2) Each cluster that fits my brief description above tends to either be by a Park (Roosevelt Park, West Park, etc).
            </li>
            <li>
             3) Elementary schools tend to be near these clusters (Wisconsin Lutheran Middle School, Racine KinderCare, Red Apple Elementary school, Jane Elementary School, Stephen Bull Elementary, and Racine Early Education)
            </li>
            <li>
             4) In one cluster at 1400 washingtone ave in Racine, I was returning results for either an Herb Shop as being at that location, or something called Genesis Behavioral Health Services. There are at least 4 Genesis Behavioral Health Services locations within a few miles of eachother in Racine.
            </li>
            <li>
             5) There is a childcare loophole in the state of Wisconsin that is absolutely fascinating and could be extremely relevant: it was possible for some time (maybe it still is) to receive money from the government by opening up a childcare center but enrolling your own children and employees children. So, people would open up childcare centers with their friends and only enroll their children yet receive benefits and bill the government (I believe that's roughly how it works.) However, look into the scandals involving some of these places. Probably lots of neglect, shitty living environments, etc. I read one story about a childcare center (run out of a womans home, too) that was shut down because one of the children she cared for was found wandering the streets alone.

            In every city where politicians routinely overnight, there is usually one or two hotels where they mainly go. For example, in Denver there's the Brown Palace where many out of town politicians stay. Assuming that these are the most likely places where such filming takes place, if someone can get access to that video-- perhaps some basic hacking of their computer system, a friend works there, etc. then this might be the easiest, safest, and best method for getting the proof needed to bring these pedos crashing down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Uploading the video footage anonymously is also a challenge. YouTube can't be trusted, and I've heard the same is true of VidMe.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I know of individuals who have hacked into local TV programming... What an awful, bitter pill that would be for those who are asleep to waken to during their evening news sit downs. And it would get the entire country talking.

              Everyone who lives in a town that has hotels where politicians stay will know which hotels those are. It'll be up to the locals to get hold of that footage anyway as they'll need their own sources/connections to get access and be located geographically close to those hotels. Also, by naming them here it serves to put those hotels and the brownstone operatives on notice.

            Ambassador Harriman dead from cerebral hemorrhage
February 5, 1997
Web posted at: 10:21 a.m. EST (1521 GMT)
           </p>
           <p>
            PARIS (CNN) -- U.S. Ambassador to France Pamela Harriman died Wednesday two days after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage, an aide said. She had been in intensive care at the American Hospital in Neuilly, a Paris suburb, since Monday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Harriman, who would have turned 77 next month, did not have a history of health problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was appointed to the post in May 1993, and had been planning to leave the ambassadorship by mid-year.
           </p>
           <p>
            She leaves behind a wealth of people who either admired her charisma or belittled her accomplishments, both in her ambassadorship and in her life.
           </p>
           <p>
            The United States praised her diplomatic skills in handling disputes over trade, Bosnia, NATO, the Middle East, Africa and CIA spying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the French, meanwhile, looked upon her as a lightweight, more form than substance, fluent in French but not in international policy; hostess of the most lavish parties the embassy has seen, but unable to comment on U.S. policy in Bosnia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nonetheless, in 1996 France made her a Commander of the Legion of Honor's Order of Arts and Letters, the country's highest cultural award. Harriman said the award made her feel "very humble, and very proud."
Affairs with the rich and powerful
           </p>
           <p>
            Harriman's life was equally scrutinized for her many liaisons. Her second husband once called her "the greatest courtesan of the 20th century," the Irish Times reported. "She loved men, and men loved her, and she knew how to please men," said Garry Clifford, the Washington bureau chief of People Magazine.
Harriman.Churchill
           </p>
           <p>
            Born Pamela Digby, her first of three marriages was to Randolph Churchill, a journalist and son of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, during World War II. Later, she would tell stories about sleeping in a double-decker bunk in a bomb shelter while pregnant with Randolph's child -- "One Churchill above me, another inside," she said. movie icon (1.4 MB/40 sec. QuickTime movie)
           </p>
           <p>
            Although she got along well with her husband's father, the Digby-Churchill union would not last. Randolph, a hard drinker, philandered throughout the marriage; Pamela also dallied with a number of men -- millionaire American diplomat Averell Harriman, Italian billionaire Gianni Agnelli, and journalist Edward Murrow, to name a few.
           </p>
           <p>
            Churchill and wife divorced at the end of the war, five years after they wed.
           </p>
           <p>
            After another succession of affairs with millionaires who paid for her lavish lifestyle and an elegant Paris apartment, she next married famed Broadway producer Leland Hayward ("Gypsy" and "The Sound of Music"). Their marriage lasted until his death in 1971, when she found she had almost no money left.
A late entry into politics
           </p>
           <p>
            Six months after Hayward's death, she married Averell Harriman, then almost 80 years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her newest husband, a former New York governor and ambassador to Britain and the Soviet Union, got his bride interested in politics and the Democratic party, which during the Reagan years had lost its drive and its direction. She hosted dinner parties to mend her husband's party, with grace and skill.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Almost anybody who was asked was going to come to one of the gatherings at her spectacular house," said political analyst Norman Ornstein. "She had an ability to attract people around her, and a willingness to try to be a catalyst for the Democratic party."
           </p>
           <p>
            She spoke at the 1984 convention, supported the Michael Dukakis campaign and Al Gore's 1992 presidential campaign, then worked hard raising money -- $12 million -- for young governor Bill Clinton when he won the party's nomination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her reward for her constant support was the ambassadorship to France. According to former State Department official Richard Holbrooke, she was a natural for the post.
           </p>
           <p>
            "She spoke the language, she knew the country, she knew its leadership. She was one of the best ambassadors that ever served the United States," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not many women could have journeyed so far -- from the English countryside to diplomat in Paris -- with a formal education that ended at the age of 16.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, says historian Michael Beschloss, "She was very graceful, and graceful in a lot of different worlds," a woman just as able to move through Winston Churchill's world during a world war as to maneuver through diplomatic life in Paris.

              This guy outs FBIanon as Steve P, when he says he is on Alex Jones all the time, then he disses Alex Jones.

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This guy says not to get involved in politics if you are clean.

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This guy says that Bernie Sanders is THE ONLY clean, black-mail free Senator.  Says Bernie is not corrupt, just stupid.  No one asked him about his wife.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              this guy says to hack, videotape, and do whatever, to find local political peds.
              <br/>
              That would be a sure way of giving the swamp a way to scream 'fake news is dangerous" if you can't really prove anything.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            What he says about Trump having to fix the economy before he can clean the swamp makes a lot of sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish somebody would have asked him about the apparent increase in the number of pedophiles being arrested, too.  Isn't that all low level pedos.  Is that Trump's doing or is the swamp just clearing out the weak links or whatever fits their plans?

            This is worth a read all the way thru...he is 100% right and up to us.  Billiken (with occult links I am sure..) is a bird and is also the mascot of the St. Louis University sports team..so there may be University ties.  Royal Order of Jesters has come up before and certainly FIRE there..great job

            Well, those threads really indicate where the reality is. The things that go on behind closed doors and the political mechanizations are not easily disabled but can be exposed. The individual that get exposed usually end up having crossed someone. Generally, to get the reality exposed, folks have to investigate and get proof, not just identify connecting lines.

            one thing that is bugging me about this guy is he keeps saying Bernie Sanders is clean and can be trusted... Well NO he can't, no. 1: he lied to the people and knew his whole campaign was a LARP to help Hillary win. 2: his wife is a crook. 3. He took money and is still trying to help bring in socialism. 4.

             Just a theory: Bernie started out as a mole to get Hillary in... once he was on the campaign trail, he saw that he was gaining momentum.... imagine what it must have been like to see the huge crowds at rally's and the kids really dug him on social media....
So he starts to maybe suggest that he could legitimately win, and they wouldn't have to do all this rigging and murdering...
Well that was not acceptable to the witch queen, or her minions.
Cut to the exposure of the rigging fraud in the primaries, and the very real threat he was to the entitled demon, Clinton...
By the time he "lost" the nomination he was neutered with threats against his life, his wife and her crime spree, a punch in the face the night before the convention; some blackmail about just about anything imaginable,( I suspect he covered up trafficking, at the very least), and an offer of a nice retirement lake mansion.... (  what else would an elderly socialist do?lol...)
Mostly I think he got a little too big for his britches and they took him out to the wood shed.

             He did say Bernie's life was threaten and they offer him a house. Said he was crying night of convention. Anon also said Ol' won all the primaries. Hillary sucked worse than I thought! I remember seeing a photo of Bern with a cut under his eye.  Red and swollen. Don't know correlation to time of primaries/convention.

              Anon was saying "Anglophiles" which is to mean white guys who like blacks. There was also implying aAsians, but not for certain. There was a lot being thrown out there at once to digest.

               Anglophile is anybody who loves England or Britian, or anything Anglosaxon.  It has NOTHING to do with blacks, Asians or any other race.

             interestingly, hawaii may be a storage location for cias best drugs/chemicals. i'm curious as to why hawaii has been so vocal about trump, many celeb purchases of houses and property, and either ohana or waikii used to have a huge tranny population and was popular for sex changes like in thailand.

              I think they just keep changing their name to remain hidden.  Exposure is what these societies need.  They are secret because they want to cause chaos and remain hidden.

            It's up to the people of the united states. You need to do a lot more than just vote every 4 years.

            The government gains power when the average person is dependent, ignorant, and lacks self-control. The government loses power when the average person is self-sufficient, aware, and in control of his own behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to take down the monster that the US Government has become, you need to start replacing the functions of the US government from the ground up. Decentralize and unplug. Create the communities you want to see.

            It's important to remember this man, Tory Smith and his convictions about Pence having raped little boys.  Smith is now dead 1 year later.  The passion and anger in which he conveys his beliefs about Pence are genuine.  I wonder if there are any friends or family members of Smith that would have deeper insights into his last days.

             I found Tori before he died and watched all his videos . I believe in my heart that he was telling the truth . There are also some other youtubers out there that have made follow up videos on TS. One woman I remember was really fighting for him.

             I've always believed Smith was legit. And from day one Pence has given me the creeps. He SCREAMS pedo to me. I also think he's a closet case which means he probably has a longggggg history of gay encounters as well as pedo shit. That means he might be vulnerable to investigators like us IF we could get someone to talk on the record. Unless someone is on their death bed, it would be hard to find someone willing to talk, but it can't be ruled out. And you make a good point-- maybe someone who knew Smith has more info that even Smith didn't release.

             I personally know someone who has stopped posting on voat and talking about what they know due to being followed and scared for their life. So even those who have stopped posting and were not killed, realize they are in danger.

             Where do we start digging, and CPP server
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Q - Ok, again, where do we start digging? HTG (Human Traficking General) is an ongoing thread some anons are working on and Pizzagate was a dead end as far as bringing down pedo rings. Do you think the info is in the email leaks?
           </p>
           <p>
            A - Pizzagate was a dead end? They hacked the server and found all kinds of incriminating info. Probably could have blown it open with some real world sleuthing, like literally every high level anon has said. If you're outside DC, just start looking into the influential people in your town or state. Does your senator rape kids? How would you find out?
           </p>
           <p>
            A - HTG would do better to figure out the rings, surveil them, and work backwards to the logistics.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q - hmm red flag here.. the "hacked server" at comet was a disinfo op as well as the 'pizza menu' that was "found".  theres plenty of other damning info from the CPP debacle, but everyone with influence appears to be compromised or afraid.
           </p>
           <p>
            A - The hacked server was definitely not disinfo.

             We have reason to believe that he is not a fake, and while he may not be a power player, he knows enough and is taking risks to shine the light on the Truth about Racine being a key hub, model and "Root" to the entire system of Global Criminal Corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
             U.S. Senate Anon likely knows more about Racine, Wisconsin and its ties to the global networks involved. He can also likely confirm that everything we have posted is true. He is correct about CFR's role in global policy, and the Royal Order of Jesters being central to blackmail rings. Knights of Pythias is another similar group. All of these have deep ties to Racine along with Freemasons and Scottish Rite in Racine and Milwaukee. It all leads to Pilgrims Society, Majority 12, Committee of 300 and Council of 13. The chain of command is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons (Racine, WI).
            </p>
            <p>
             If he were following a controlled script, he would not be telling people to dig into Racine, Wisconsin. He knows at least some of what we know - there is no path to draining the swamp without the will of the people forcing it to happen, and there will never be justice in our broken and corrupt system. The only way to change our path toward Global Enslavement under the ultimate deception of Sustainability (SATAN'S ABILITY) and the Mark of the Beast through AI and Community Policing is to Save the World with the real Truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine, Wisconsin is the "Root", weak link, and model for them that must be exposed and used against them to Save the world from Global Enslavement.

               It is possible. We cannot be certain that they are not related or exactly who they claim to be, and their posts do focus on the Royal Order of Jesters more than most, however they both know that Racine, Wisconsin is not disinformation or a distraction and would not point to investigating it further if they were fully controlled. Whether they are who they claim to be, or whether they are related to other anons or insiders is less important than verifying the content they contribute and direction they provide.
              </p>
              <p>
               We do believe that U.S. Senate Anon's intentions are sincere, and he provided more details than others in some areas, but we do have some questions and concerns. We do not believe their gonzo detective approach to catch Royal Order of Jester or Knights of Pythias pedos is the best idea or could ever work to take down the entire system unless he has the tape that RDS claimed of the president raping and murdering a young girl named Mary. That would change things, but we will never find out if that exists or not, and RDS only provides limited bits of information mixed with lies.
              </p>
              <p>
               We agree that Trump is surrounded by swamp creatures, and is powerless to fully drain the swamp. We do not agree that he intends to actually drain the swamp. Trump is a deal maker with mafia and freemason ties. He will do that he does best, make deals. He is supporting bad deals such as Foxconn in Racine County, and won't ever hold everyone accountable unless he is forced to.
              </p>
              <p>
               He ended on the high note, and we agree that the simplest answer is usually best - shine the light on Racine, Wisconsin and reveal the real Truth about Racine, Paul Ryan, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Clintons, Schumer, Weiner, Byrd, Hastert, and many others involved. Racine is the "Root" and hub for many secret societies and global programs including Rotary, Knights of Pythias, Pilgrims Society, Sustainability, Community Policing, Art in Embassies, Education and Day Care, Prison Labor &amp; Reform, Child &amp; Family Services, Viruses &amp; Vaccines, Foundations, Business &amp; Religious Coalitions, Sanctuary Cities, and on.
              </p>
              <p>
               Racine, Wisconsin is the domino that will work best on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

                We believe that he simply doesn't know what else to do, so he is suggesting a form of vigilante journalism to gather more shocking and indisputable proof of the Truth we already know. We already know of so many that are involved, it may not be necessary. Rather than seeing another example of our compromised politicians, we need the world to see the example of a model community that serves as the "Root" to the entire system of corruption, trafficking, harvesting and Enslavement.
               </p>
               <p>
                He is correct that there will never be justice in our broken and corrupt system, and the only way to Save the world from being Enslaved is through a shocking viral exposure of the sick and evil Truth behind the system that rules us. It is time to break Free and Save ourselves. The path is through Racine, Wisconsin. We need the world's light to shine on it. It doesn't matter who is shining the light. It will reveal the same Truth to all.

                 I don't disagree with you, but HLI has previously suggested we do VERY STUPID ILLEGAL things. FBI tactics include entrapment where they set people up to commit crimes. This is what SenateAnon/HLI is doing, he is exploiting our emotional indignation to get us to act improperly so that we can be arrested and shut down pizzagate. He could expose what he knows and get arrests made but he doesn't, and makes it sound like we could when in fact you are right FBI and cops are complicit and any dirt we illegally collect will be used against us by the same judges who are protecting pedos.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anyone who wants to take action will either end up dead or arrested. The other route would be getting oneself elected and stay unbrownstoned which he claimed was impossible and yet also said that Bernie Sanders was clean (contradiction right there) OR file lawsuits like Judicial Watch is doing.  He might have a lot of truthful inside information but he is ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUSTWORTHY.

                  He may not have the best advice, but he knows that there will never be justice in our current corrupt system without shocking the world with the real Truth of what is going on. We cannot wait for someone else to fix the system. It won't ever happen.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Rule of Law is dead. Equal Protection Under the Law is dead. We are in a state of complete tyranny at all levels. People need to understand this Truth. We have the power to change this, but we need to be united under a common Truth, and time is running out. Lawsuits and slow investigations are not going to fix anything. Viral Global Enlightenment is the only way.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We don't need to catch anyone in the act anymore. We cannot catch all of them in the act, and there are many others in line that will take their place. We have to expose the entire network and attack the "Root" of the problem. We already know more than enough of who is involved and how the system works. We need the military and other authorities to stand down and protect those of us who know the real Truth. We can expose the entire system and the real Truth. Donald Trump could expose it all right now, but he hasn't and he won't. He is too busy making deals and won't ever have the courage to do what needs to be done. Saying the system is rigged does nothing but reinforce and perpetuate the rigged system.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Racine, Wisconsin is the "Root" of all Evil and model for the real Agenda that leads to Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast. Everyone needs to know this Truth, and then we can expose how it is all connected, and the path to Saving the world before it is too late. Racine is the weak link to the entire system.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The world has heard of Racine, Wisconsin and knows who Paul Ryan is. Now is the time for them to find out the real shocking Truth, so we can be Saved before we are all Enslaved.

             I don't believe that part. Saying that FBI Anon is on Infowars all the time would be throwing him under the bus. Why would he do that if they are on the same side?

               Oh that would be a trip. I didn't think of that. I could see him doing something like that! He's the one that was brave enough to go on Infowars and say there was a coup against Trump before the election!

               If it is, why would this other anon throw Steve under the bus? They would be on the same team.

                Idk... I'm with you in wondering why this anon outed him. Maybe Steve thought it was time.. or it's a red herring to take the heat off the real FBI anon? Hmm...

                  I'm with you. Thinking that possibly he wanted it out in the right circles only, or yes, red herring intentional dissinfo. There's got to be some in there.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I think the narrative about him working for a senator who is compromised / being blackmailed due to having an illegitimate baby to a black prostitute is probably also a red herring. Otherwise he'd be too easily identified.

                     I don't think Steve P is FBI Anon. First, FBI Anon had access to the Vince Foster stuff in FBI archive, and posted it. Steve has been out of federal service for years, and was never FBI anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I can believe that FBI Anon reached out to Steve P to use him to pass information along. I also believe that FBI Anon reached out to Sy Hersh about the Seth Rich case. But the tone of FBI Anon's posts is very different from Steve P's. Steve P says all kinds of things that are clearly just based on his own contacts or worldview. He is at most an occasional contact for FBI Anon.

                 Oh donkey. Don't make me think about what a big strong ALPHA MALE George Webb is. You know how he just DRIVES WOMEN CRAZY! Especially me. It makes me want to run my fingers thru his full head of hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Awww I'm sorry. I hope I didn't make you jealous again. You hate when I talk about big strong REAL men. Even though your a scrawny little ugly bitch doesn't mean there isn't SOMEONE out there for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No need to be jealous all the time 💋

                   It doesn't matter if they are acting does it? Does that change how sexy they are? Their voices are so deep. They are so smart. I'm a woman! Remember you said women are weak? Well George Webb is the type that is just irresistible! Sorry if that hurts your feelings. If you go to the bar, maybe you can find someone drunk enough that would bend you over like a bitch. It's worth a shot.

                    You notice how the kike pedophiles of the DNC always have Leo Dicaprio or some actor shill cor them? 100% of that effort is for YOU -- naive impressionable creatures with zero agency.  You are a pawn and a slut, and you know it.  You also dont take PG seriously in the least, and it shows.  In fact i have never seen you or carmencita cast doubt on A SINGLE THING, LOL

                      Thats because you so are old and haggard you queef dust.  Not that thats what makes you so repellent: its how slow you are.  Youre exactly like girls i have dumped: they dont understand jokes and read fiction and sleep all day, and watch Netflix for HOURS.  You didnt evolve to so anything mentally demanding, so its not surprising you prefer to have men explain it to you on Jewtube, where they deceive your tiny brains.

                       You know I'm not old faker. You date guys. Not girls. If you ever dated girls, I'm nothing like them because I wouldn't let you touch me. I have good taste. I don't like trash. I haven't read a fiction book since I was a teenager. Real life is a lot more interesting than anything fake. I rarely watch tv.

                          Uh clearly you MARRIED a total cuck, which is why you were so overcome by being told what your proper place is you had to PM A GUY WHOS NOT EVEN 30 LOL.  I feel sorry for him, his cunt wife trying to play Nancy Drew and scoping out dudes online, saying a dick pic would be welcome.  And youre not even drinking, right, since even imbibing a liquid is something women cant be trusted to do properly.

                             You try so hard to act like a Millenial 😂🤣😂😂😂 Of all people, DonKeyhote is the one that tells me I have no accomplishments. lol that's funny. Considering the fact that you know nothing about me, it's pretty immature of you to assume what I've accomplished. A lot more than you. That's for sure. I don't have to shill for Media Matters.

                             Why don't you act like a real man and get a real job? Let your hands get dirty. Get some sun. Build up some muscle. Stop sitting at the computer all day bitching at people. It's so obvious that you're miserable.

                              Media Matters is run by Jews, so you are agreeing with ME with that baseless accusation that you imagine makes YOU appear less of a gross, aging hippie slut.  LOL! Jews every time, bitch, and thats what i prove every day while you eat the lint from your belly button.

                               The funniest thing about you, is you say all this but admit that YOU ARE A JEW! You hate your own people? I think you're probably a Muslim. You always defend Muslims and you hate women. Do you eat bacon? 🤔

                                 Another example.... I saw pictures and videos from that feminists woman's March. Women wore vagina costumes and made absolute fools of themselves. I hate feminism. But, would I then be dumb enough to say, just because there are many feminist women out there, that all women suck? NO. Because you can't judge anybody by lumping them together in big groups. Everyone is unique. Don't say it's in our Genes. Women share genes too.

                                          You already said the Jewish argument is convincing -- when explained with a smile! What a dumb fuckin creature: rejects uncomfortable facts, acknowledges facts period only when said in babytalk tones! Unapologetic about it and even tries to play cute.  It frankly makes me sick that you can vote.

                                            I could literally watch you be "crushed" and not bat an eye.  You have a combination of rank ignorance and childish carelessness that i find incredibly annoying.  Even more than carmencita -- i guess cuz shes old as fuck i subconsciously give her a pass! What a fucking great guy i am.

Since you just throw shit at the wall and see if it sticks, there must be some process.  Whats that, your thoughts do NOT follow any logical process, and youre basically just a pain in the ass everywhere you go?

                                                    Lmao.  So Muslims are as a group and therefore i am pro-rape and hate jews (for no reason of course) and if they discovered they had some jewish relatives, theyd immediately hate them.  You sure sound like a measured, careful thinker.

            A - Full-on panic. Robert David Steele was set up to be the limited hangout if it got really bad. They would have hung the pedos, kept the more normal perverts, and told everyone it was ok.

           </p>
           <p>
            Q - What can your average anon do about pedo rings? About missing kids and so-called hotspots from /htg/ threads? All I know to do is try and keep friends and family and another anons engaged and try to explain what I think is going on with news coming out instead of letting people fall to the media narrative or to sensationalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            A - You can do more than the FBI or police, not less.

           <p>
            A - Investigate. And it has to go deeper, like getting access to computers or in-person investigations. Like O'keefe did.

             Pizzagate and Pence
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            A - His associates run pedophile rings. Indiana is the headquarters of several of these blackmail rings.
           </p>
           <p>
            A - I'm risking my life naming names on pedophile rings so that one of you guys can put a camera on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone freaked out about pizzagate. You guys backed off too soon, and stayed too geographically isolated. This goes on everywhere. You can take them down and they know it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q - But you haven't directly stated who's a pedo ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            A - Already named Mike Pence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q - Yeah, but we're still new at this overthrowing governments thing. (Not everyone here is CIA.) Any suggestions for where to expand, geographically speaking?
           </p>
           <p>
            A - Start small, then. Try to catch your mayor, or a state senator, or even a dirty cop or some political donor. These guys aren't hard to catch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q - Mike Pence - I know Mike is the kind of guy that would service a whole group of people, but one person is not a ring or organization. The closest you've come to pointing the finger at an organization blackmailing to keep pedos safe was another guy talking about the ROJ.
           </p>
           <p>
            A - ROJ controls DC police. Headquarted in (you guessed it) Indiana.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q - What have you heard or seen about Pence?
           </p>
           <p>
            A - He's the head of a pedophile ring.

             They are not mostly for young boys and girls.  Do you really think there are young boys who served in US War with Spain?  Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts are the only ones that are predominately focused on children.

               Folks... Jesters is a auxilliary order to Shriners, Shriners are auxilliary to Scottish Rite Masons. You have to be 32 degree Scottish Rite to join Shriners, but that doesn't mean Shriners control Scottish Rite.Shriners are late nineteenth century creation. They just only want people who are 32nd degree Masons. Jesters have same relationship with Shriners. Just like you have to be a member of the college to join a campus fraternity. Doesn't mean the fraternity controls the college.

               Yes. Some states still require you to be a Knight Templar (York Rite) or 32nd degree (Scottish Rite) to join the Shrine. While the Shriners do run a lot of the blackmail, the Scottish Rite is older and more important when it comes to totally controlling the United States government.

                So that means all along we have been chasing each level of puppets down but the masters are the Jesters whose masters are the brotherhood. This is the Council of 13 I believe. There is a larger Council of 300 out of Rancine that I posted a few months back that was updated to 2010. It listed the Roths, Royals, Bush, Gietner &amp; Pope. Think this was the masters right?

                 It's better to to think of Freemasonry with a wheel-and-spokes model. The Scottish Rite is the overall head in the US, and they have Sovereign Inspectors that inspect the other masonic orders.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are lots of side projects off this. Shriners are for guys that like to party, and they do a lot of blackmail. Jesters and ultimately SOBIB controls that operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You also have research lodges for masonic research. Prince Hall for black freemasons. Demolay and Rainbow for kids.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then you have a bunch of projects that Freemasons have created, but aren't technically part of Freemasonry. OTO, Scientology, Temple of Set, Process Church of the Final Judgment (Manson), B'nai B'rith, Wicca.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then you have the non-occult policy groups that run the government, also controlled by Freemasonry. CFR, Bilderberg, CNP, Tavistock, think tanks, and so on.

              Old pic. It closed in about 2006 after the owner died, Alefantis took the sign &amp; name for Comet. It became a sports shoes shop for a few years but appears to have been up for lease for the last 5/6 years judging by Google Maps dates.

              Adelson settled out of court for $75 million.

              From the article:
              <br/>
              "Steven Pearlman, an attorney who handles whistleblower cases for the Proskauer Rose LLP law firm, said the $75 million to $100 million figure in the settlement is remarkable. Pearlman said cases usually are settled for a few million dollars, even when it involves executives. When asked to comment on the size of the payoff, Pearlman said, “To call it unusual is to put it mildly.”

               Let's start with his
               <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2010/oct/22/former-sands-macau-executive/">
                contract
               </a>
               "Jacobs was hired to run Sands’ Macau gambling and hotel operations in May 2009 at an annual salary of $1.3 million plus bonuses under a three-year contract, the suit says." Total salary under the contract is $3.9 million.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyone familiar with contract law knows you're generally suing for the benefit of the contract ($3.9 million) and maybe a little extra (punitive damages) for your trouble. The US Supreme Court usually doesn't like punitive damages of more than a single digit multiplier of the regular damages. So, $39 million would be pretty extravagant for a jury award, not likely to hold up on appeal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Apocalyptic worst-case scenario for Adelson is a $39 million judgment, but he settles for $75 million. Given the allegations (Jacobs wouldn't allow prostitutes to operate in the casinos, and China accusing Adelson of running sex blackmail operations), it becomes crystal clear that this is hush money.

             If the debt pyramid can even be slightly inverted - the amount of money injected back into the 99% would be earth changing in terms of the economic impact. Any President can start pushing in this direction with the right laws/regulations/prosecutions put in place.
            </p>
            <p>
             It doesn't have to be Trump, but, he's probably the best shot we've got considering he is the first POTUS that wasn't selected/groomed/pre-ordained by the very same financial pyramid.

             Did Trump personally benefit from this very same economic scheme to reward the rich and devastate the poor? Yep.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does that mean he won't do anything about it? Hopefully not.

              What do you mean by the debt pyramid and what would it mean to invert it.     You do know that US debt is already part of the economy right?  People invest in T Bills and they then are paid back with interest.   Every debt is also a credit to somone.  There's two sides to the ledger.

               I'm referring to the global financial system that literally grows each year via compounding interest, which can never and will never be paid off - creating an infinite pool of debt, globally. The Federal Reserve is only part of it.

              <p>
               I have looked at his tax plan. In the current global market, his current plan would not help at all. Agreed. It would nearly double our deficit and as a result it will never be passed. But to say his tax plan won't work is like saying his healthcare bill won't work. No shit. Neither plan looks at the root of either issue.
              </p>
              <p>
               No healthcare plan explores the vast waste/expenditure/capital investments that are piggy-backed on the consumer's shoulders. Through subsidies and kickback programs, insurance payers foot the bill for exploratory pharmacological development and exorbitant medical expenses/salaries/lawsuits/aid programs.
              </p>
              <p>
               On the flipside, no tax plan bothers to tackle the underlying issue of the infinite debt vortex we're perpetually drilling deeper and deeper into.
              </p>
              <p>
               If we continue to play by the same rules - we've already lost. Is Trump the man to craft a plan to reverse this? Probably not.

             more like they can put or take out laws in place and give us tax cuts so that WE can grow our economy.

             We are all just asleep. We really have the power to do this ourselves and we can all be a part of the change through our own communities like he was saying. You don't get to the top without all the blackmail, so that means honest people never make it to the top.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump was the anomaly because we the people put him there, not the Deep State. For once the election really was real. He can only do so much when surrounded by vipers AND if members of his own family are being held hostage (i.e. Kushner/Ivanka. they do have kids and those are Trumps grandkids and grandparents will protect their grandkids). As much as we all want these people to be eliminated because they are pedophiles, they have been in place for hundreds of years as we have found out through our research.
            </p>
            <p>
             we cannot get to the head of the snake because the snakes are well protected, but anon is right, we can start going after the little roots of the tentacles and starve them of their "nutrients". and we can get self sufficient and starve them of their globalism. Getting into a civil war only hurts us, not them and would provide them with another source of unattended children and teens. Better to campaign starting with those around you and start red pilling. As Killary says, it takes a village but our village is not evil and kidnappers. They will all be exposed eventually.
            </p>
            <p>
             *note: I don't yet know if I trust anon but he does have some plausibility but this game is all about disinformation and leading us all astray.

              That's a truly a silly question.  No.  The economy is bigger than the president, bigger than the government.  The economic forces have their own momentum.
             </p>
             <p>
              Presidents can do thing that affect the economy, but if they were powerful enough to fix it, we would never have problems with the economy would we? We wouldn't have had a financial crisis in 2008 if we could simply fix it like you'd fix a broken TV.  Do you think Bush wanted the credit bubble to pop on his watch and the economy to roll down the cliff?

             Saied Azali seems to have used his drag queen associates to run a 2006  brownstone-ish operation at Perry's on Leonard Downie, who was then executive editor at the Washington Post.

            <p>
             The Post's editor had a R-rated encounter with a drag queen during a Post party this month—but so far the photos have stayed private.
            </p>
            <p>
             Journalists get the occasional juicy and anonymous letter. Most are titillating but not worth publishing or broadcasting.
The letter in large type about a party hosted by the Washington Post photography staff seemed to fit the second category: It mentioned in paragraph three that Post executive editor Len Downie was “the recipient of a lap dance and breasts in his face” by one of the party’s entertainers—who were drag queens!
            </p>
            <p>
             Too good to be true?
            </p>
            <p>
             A second anonymous letter said word had gone out at the Post to kill any pictures of Len’s lap dance.
            </p>
            <p>
             I started making a few calls, figuring that if such an event had taken place, photos and videos probably would be on YouTube or some other website. If it had indeed taken place.
            </p>
            <p>
             I got eye witness accounts. I wondered: Could a monthly magazine, with a lead time of several weeks, actually break a story about the Post’s top editor caught in an amusing, if not compromising, situation?
            </p>
            <p>
             Here’s the scoop:
            </p>
            <p>
             The Washington Post is not known for throwing lively parties, especially under staid executive editor Leonard Downie.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the photo department decided to bid farewell to retiring staffers, it did not intend to get racy. Photo editor Joe Elbert booked Perrys, a sushi restaurant in DC’s Adams Morgan, for a Saturday afternoon. Owner Saied Azali promised to do something special because he was friends with well-known Post photographer Lucien Perkins.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would the something special be free champagne? Special sushi? Not exactly.
            </p>
            <p>
             Azali invited male dancers dressed as women who perform at Perrys’ Sunday “drag brunches.” Len Downie made an appearance just as the queens began to mingle. According to eye witnesses, one performer sat down next to Downie and wrapped him in a big hug.
            </p>
            <p>
             Downie seemed at bit shocked, but one photographer says: “He took it in good humor at the time.”
            </p>
            <p>
             But apparently Downie was less amused by the photos and videos being shot, and he asked that they be kept private.
            </p>
            <p>
             No leaked pictures, so far, but many of those retired staffers would dearly love a picture of Downie in the embrace of a drag queen.

               Thanks--your post provided fertile ground for investigation.

              <p>
               This guy Azali does seem to be tied in pretty well with D.C. government.  He was the keynote speaker in 2014 at an event held by the Dept. of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs:

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               EDIT:  And also featured on the govt-run D.C. Business Center website:

              </p>
              <p>
               His would be a great resume for a political blackmailer, especially with the handy bedroom suite at Perry's.  EDIT:  It turns out that the bedroom isn't at Perry's.  It was a photo displayed at Perry's of a room in Saint James Hotel, Paris:

             Here is an article on Comet Liquor. I am not sure if this is still in business, so I think I might be wrong about "Comet" being a chain. Now I think it may be the business Alefantis got his sign from. Either way, this is giant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is an article I just found on Comet Liquor:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://jewishfoodexperience.com/comet-liquors-deli-brightened-neighborhood/">
              http://jewishfoodexperience.com/comet-liquors-deli-brightened-neighborhood/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you remember Comet Liquors in Adams Morgan? Located on Columbia Road between 18th and 19th Streets, it had a distinctive neon sign. Most who remember the business don’t realize it was opened by a Jewish immigrant in 1940 and continued to be Jewish-owned throughout its existence.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Oscar Gildenhorn opened Comet Liquor, the neighborhood was not yet called Adams Morgan, but the name had caught on by the time Gildenhorn’s son-in-law Howard Speisman took over management 25 years later.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sidney Drazin bought Comet in 1980. Drazin, a native Washingtonian, had served in World War II and then run a few different businesses before buying Comet.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1989, as neighborhood demographics changed, Drazin added a deli counter. Earlier in the 20th century, it was common for Jewish grocers in Washington to move into the liquor business, but now, a few decades later, a liquor man was adding food to his business. the deli offerings like white fish salad and lox with a bagel hinted at the Jewish ownership.

              Your second link, though, is actually not about the Comet sign being sold to Alefantis.  It says "James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong and collector of vintage signs," bought the

               Yeah, 2011 is too late for the Comet Ping Pong Sign which they had when they opened.

                And then my friend Eric Hirshfield, who used to own Duplex Diner, was like, “I’m going to buy the Comet sign. You’re opening a restaurant, why don’t you take it?” And I thought, I should totally have that sign, and then I’ll have a name.

              <p>
               The Comet sign used to hang next to Cashion’s in Adams Morgan, over a liquor store and deli owned by Sid and his wife Beverly Drazin. They were there for a long time, and people really loved that place and had a lot of nostalgia for it. And they were really part of the community.

             Hey, my Twitter searches have come in handy again:
             <a href="https://twitter.com/sdazali">

             He is following room11dc and CashionsEatPlce - two other locations connected to all of this, so I presume this account belongs to Saied Azali.

                Alefantis attributes his loose-limbed, casual outlook to his noncompetitive nature, a quality best exemplified by the game in Comet’s name. “I love ping-pong,” he says. “It’s not table tennis. You play to win, kind of, but you’re not trying to kill your opponent. You’re trying to have a good time.”

               This is a great lead. I think we need to Focus on the Royal Order of Jesters as well. They are the top of the Secret Societies and hide very well. We keep getting led to them repeatedly and seeing that they had headquarters in Indiana this makes sense why digging has been hard if Pence is involved.

                  Yep, but, he seemed to actually be the one leaning this towards an unethical contribution. I'm a little disturbed that so much attention was focused on a stupid $340 payment, and so little on the allegations of underage prostitution... WTF

                   I think there is a gold mine waiting in regards to Paul Ryan, Racine Wi, The Court Jesters, Pence and it connects into Dennis Hastert of course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The squeaky clean image is always a huge sign of deception. Look at Comey for example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We need to really dig into Ryan and Pence and all their buddies at the time they controlled congresss together with Hastert.

                    It is more than a gold mine. It is the key to Saving the world from Global Enslavement.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Paul Ryan is a key role player to the whole system, and there is much more to his partnership with Romney and the recent Amazon and Foxconn deals in Wisconsin. Once Paul Ryan is exposed for what he really is and what he is hiding in his District and throughout the nation, everyone will begin to open their eyes to the real Truth and the real Agenda which leads to Global Enslavement.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You are correct about Comey and Ryan's boy scout facade hiding the real Evil inside, and Paul Ryan is hiding much more than Hastert's crimes - he is the gatekeeper for the entire legislative branch. It is not only the Royal Order of Jesters, or the Knights of Pythias, or the Order of Demolay, or the Boy Scouts, or the Catholic Church, or any of the many other groups involved. It is an entire network that includes all of them and many others.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We went to Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch directly with evidence of extreme corruption, racketeering, trafficking and abuse in Racine, Wisconsin. They wanted to know more and more, until it became obvious why. Once they found out who was involved, including many corrupt politicians, foundations, corporations and secret societies, they began covering it up and targeting the witnesses instead of holding those involved accountable and enforcing the law. It was shocking and alarming, and all happened before Pizzagate and Comey's public acquittal of the Clintons. We knew before most that Comey would never uphold the law.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We went to many others along the way including Paul Ryan, Ron Johnson, Sheriff David Clarke, and all other local and state officials and agencies. We went to Sanders' campaign. We went to Trump's campaign. We went to local and national media. None of them did anything. None of them would touch Racine, Wisconsin. They are all traitors to America hiding the biggest story and secret in the world. If Trump is playing 5D chess, he is terrible at it, lost his own Queen, and is running around in constant Check. He is closely linked with everyone involved, and will never hold them accountable. The rule of law is completely dead. Only the Truth can Save us.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Paul Ryan is a Boy Scout front man covering up the worst atrocities known to man in DC, as Ashton (Chris) Kutcher does for his fellow Freemason, Mormon, Scientology, Kabbalah and OTO friends in LA. They are all tied to the same groups, serving the real elite. It is a global coalition, and Racine, Wisconsin is the common "Root" of the entire system.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The system of corruption and abuse is too big to fail, and the real Truth is too shocking, disturbing, grotesque for most people to understand. The Truth is the only way, and the best way to expose it is by showing the world how people they never thought could be involved are actually very involved. People like Paul Ryan, Jim Comey, Loretta Lynch, Ashton (Chris) Kutcher, Tom DeLonge and Blink 182, Kristin Bauer van Straten and her brother Jeff Neubauer, and Caron Butler.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    There are many, many more. They are connect to the same "Root" of Evil in Racine and Wisconsin.

                      The root and model of the secret global agenda is based in Racine, Wisconsin, and is tied to the great deception of Sustainability  (Satan's Ability) that leads to Global Enslavement, as part of UN Agenda 2030, with the Mark of the Beast enforced by AI and Community Policing.

                      It is all part of a global pyramid structure that links to Pilgrims Society, Committee of 300, Council of 13, and other groups through the direct chain of command - Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons (Racine, WI).
