<p>Uniqlo Co., Ltd.  is a Japanese casual wear designer, manufacturer and retailer.[2] The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fast Retailing Co., Ltd.[3] The company operates in Japan and several other countries. </p>
<p>In 1997, Fast Retailing adopted a set of strategies from American retailer The Gap, known as &quot;SPA&quot; (for specialty-store/retailer of private-label apparel), meaning that they would produce their own clothing and sell it exclusively.[citation needed] They engaged the retail brand consultancy, CIA, Inc. / The Brand Architect Group, to guide the company through the realization of this strategy, including consulting on merchandise, visual merchandising and display, store design and a new logo designed by Richard Seireeni and Sy Chen of The Brand Architect Group\'s Los Angeles office.[citation needed] Uniqlo had begun outsourcing their clothing manufacturing to factories in China where labour was cheap, a well-established corporate practice. </p>
<p>In January 2015, a number of labor rights violations were reported at Uniqlo suppliers in China.[66][67][68][69] Uniqlo pledged to remedy the violations ..In June 2015, Uniqlo factory workers went on strike in relation to lay-offs. ..In 2019, a number of Australian workers reported that bullying and harassment is rife, there were &quot;shouting rooms&quot;, and a toxic work culture.  ..</p>
<p>Launching on 20 January 2017 &quot;Art for All&quot; is a partnership with New York art dealer and curator, Jeffrey Deitch. The project is centered around the sale of 65 limited-edition products made by commissioned artists such as Marie Roberts, Starlee Kine and Ken Kagami.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeffrey Deitch (born 1952)[1] is an American art dealer and curator who was from 2010 until his resignation in 2013 director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). </p>

<p>So, \'Fast Retailing adopted a set of strategies from American retailer The Gap \', did they?  Let\'s take a look: GAP Inc: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_Inc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_Inc</a>. </p>

<p>Gap was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates six primary divisions: Gap (the namesake banner), Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, Hill City, and Athleta .  ..</p>
<p>In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton.  ..National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap\'s partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[55] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola. </p>
<p>..In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western Factory, a supplier in Irbid, Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[58] The government of Jordan launched an investigation into the supplier and other textile factories and announced actions to prevent future abuses.[59] Walmart, who also sources from the supplier, confirmed &quot;serious problems with working conditions&quot; at Western Factory and other Jordanian suppliers. As of May 2018, Gap had ceased their relationship with Western Factory. </p>

Propelled by a free trade agreement with the United States, apparel manufacturing is booming in Jordan, its exports to America soaring twentyfold in the last five years. </p>
<p>In recent years, Jordan has become a magnet for apparel manufacturers, helped by the privileged trade position that the United States has given it, first because of its 1994 peace accord with Israel and then because of a free trade agreement signed with Washington in 2001. Two large industrial zones outside Amman are thriving, having geared themselves to the American apparel market. They have attracted dozens of garment manufacturers, some with 200 workers, some with 2,000, that say they produce clothes for J. C. Penney, Sears, Wal-Mart, Gap and Target. ..Several Bangladeshis said there were terrible conditions at factories that made clothes for Wal-Mart and Jones Apparel, which owns brands like Gloria Vanderbilt and Jones New York. </p>

<p>According to Aya herself, (from approx. 15:50 to 16:13), as she explains how she came about to meet the young homeless children in the streets of Cairo, she says that they have a special program for these youths and that beside the basic psychological, physical and educational support that they are able to provide the children at first, there is another stage, where the children are taken to at an encampment in Nweiba. Now if you knew what Nweiba is, you would find it suspicious as hell. (even the host is surprised and repeats: Nweiba?) </p>
<p>Nuweiba lies on a large flood plain measuring about 40 km2 (15 sq mi), sandwiched between the Sinai mountains and the Gulf of Aqaba, and is located some 150 km (90 mi) north of Sharm el Sheikh, 465 km (290 mi) southeast from Cairo and 70 km (40 mi) south of the Israel–Egypt border separating Taba and Eilat. Nuweiba Port was built in 1985 on the Gulf of Aqaba, and serves as a ferry port as well, which allows for easy travel between Jordan and Egypt. </p>

Propelled by a free trade agreement with the United States, apparel manufacturing is booming in Jordan, its exports to America soaring twentyfold in the last five years.
           </p>
           <p>
            In recent years, Jordan has become a magnet for apparel manufacturers, helped by the privileged trade position that the United States has given it, first because of its 1994 peace accord with Israel and then because of a free trade agreement signed with Washington in 2001. Two large industrial zones outside Amman are thriving, having geared themselves to the American apparel market. They have attracted dozens of garment manufacturers, some with 200 workers, some with 2,000, that say they produce clothes for J. C. Penney, Sears, Wal-Mart, Gap and Target. ..Several Bangladeshis said there were terrible conditions at factories that made clothes for Wal-Mart and Jones Apparel, which owns brands like Gloria Vanderbilt and Jones New York.

            According to Aya herself, (from approx. 15:50 to 16:13), as she explains how she came about to meet the young homeless children in the streets of Cairo, she says that they have a special program for these youths and that beside the basic psychological, physical and educational support that they are able to provide the children at first, there is another stage, where the children are taken to at an encampment in Nweiba. Now if you knew what Nweiba is, you would find it suspicious as hell. (even the host is surprised and repeats: Nweiba?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Nuweiba lies on a large flood plain measuring about 40 km2 (15 sq mi), sandwiched between the Sinai mountains and the Gulf of Aqaba, and is located some 150 km (90 mi) north of Sharm el Sheikh, 465 km (290 mi) southeast from Cairo and 70 km (40 mi) south of the Israel–Egypt border separating Taba and Eilat. Nuweiba Port was built in 1985 on the Gulf of Aqaba, and serves as a ferry port as well, which allows for easy travel between Jordan and Egypt.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Queen Rania's first venture was the establishment of the Jordan River Foundation (JRF) in 1995.[13]
            </p>
            <p>
             The Jordan River Children Program (JRCP) was developed by Queen Rania to place children’s welfare above political agendas and cultural taboos.[14] This led to the launch, in 1998, of JRF’s Child Safety Program, which addresses the immediate needs of children at risk from abuse and initiated a long-term campaign to increase public awareness about violence against children...
            </p>
            <p>
             She initiated the Al-Aman Fund for the Future of Orphans in 2003,[18] and has partnered with international universities providing scholarships for Jordanian students abroad.[10] She supports INJAZ Al-Arab, which was established by Save the Children in 1999, and later on with Junior Achievement and launched as a Jordanian non-profit organization by the Queen in 2001.[19] In her capacity as Regional Ambassador of INJAZ Al-Arab, she has taught classes, and engaged in dialogue with young people in other countries; she also launched INJAZ Al-Arab's presence elsewhere in the Arab world.[20] She also chaired a discussion with entrepreneurs in celebration of INJAZ Al-Arab's 10th anniversary, showcasing alumni's success stories [21] At the 2008 World Economic Forum in Davos, she launched the "Empowering One Million Arab Youth by 2018" campaign, which was conceived by INJAZ Arabia...
            </p>
            <p>
             In November 2000, in recognition of her commitment to the cause of children and youth, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) invited Queen Rania to join its Global Leadership Initiative.[23] The Queen worked alongside other world leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, in a global movement seeking to improve the welfare of children.[24] In January 2007, Queen Rania was named UNICEF's first Eminent Advocate for Children.[25] In August 2009, Queen Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative (UNGEI).
            </p>
            <p>
             As a longtime supporter of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE),[27] Queen Rania met with children and inspirational women in South Africa, both in the cities of Johannesburg and Soweto, in March 2009.[28] Queen Rania and the women took turns reading a short story out of The Big Read to the children, in an effort to encourage literacy. ..During her April 2009 US trip, Queen Rania joined leading education advocates Congresswoman Nita Lowey and Counsellor to the Secretary of the Treasury Gene Sperling to launch "The Big Read" as part of Global Campaign for Education's global action week calling for quality basic education for all children.[32] She was also hosted by first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, during that same trip.
            </p>
            <p>
             On 20 August 2009, Queen Rania co-founded and led the launch of the "1GOAL: Education for All" campaign alongside Gary Lineker, and with the help of top international footballers at Wembley Stadium, London.[34] Queen Rania is co-founder and global co-chair of the 1GOAL campaign to rally World Cup 2010 fans together during the world’s biggest single sporting event and call on world leaders to give 75 million children out of school an education.[35] On 6 October 2009, Queen Rania was joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the UK, the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, and other heads of state, for the Global Launch of 1GOAL, which took place across six locations worldwide.[36] Queen Rania spoke of the need to turn this “tragedy into triumph” and called on political leaders to stand by their aid commitments.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2008, Queen Rania participated in YouTube's In My Name[37] campaign. She appeared alongside The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am in the video, "End Poverty – Be the Generation,"[38] which urged world leaders to keep the promises they made in 2000 at the United Nations Millennium Summit.[
            </p>
            <p>
             Queen Rania has played a significant role in reaching out to the global community to foster values of tolerance and acceptance, and increase cross-cultural dialogue. For example, regionally and internationally, Queen Rania has campaigned for a greater understanding between cultures in such high-profile forums as the Jeddah Economic Forum,[42] the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University,[43] and the
             <strong>
              Skoll Foundation[44] in the UK
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             ..When it comes to youth, in early 2002 Queen Rania joined the Board of Directors of the International Youth Foundation, based in Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States.[53] In September 2006, Queen Rania also joined the United Nations Foundation Board of Directors.[54] The UN Foundation builds and implements public-private partnerships to address the world’s most pressing problems, and broadens support for the UN through advocacy and public outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
             In September 2003, Queen Rania accepted an invitation to join the Board of Directors of the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), thus formalizing a relationship of support and advocacy which began in 2000.[56]

              <p>
               Skoll Global Threats says its mission is to confront global threats (poverty, water, nuclear, pandemics, and MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT) imperiling humanity. It was founded by EBay founder, Jeff Skoll. Skoll Global Threat's CEO, Sally Osberg, identifies "pioneers with scalable solutions to meet global challenges." A bunch of wordy non-sense. One of those pioneers is a company called Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC)
              </p>
              <p>
               And here's where it gets interesting. CCC is the largest construction firm in the Middle East. The company basically comes in and rebuilds the infrastructure in countries like Libya, Syria, Iraq, etc. CCC also has strong ties to the Clinton Foundation...
              </p>
              <p>
               t gets even more interesting. For those that have been following George Webb, he has shown how Clinton used HSBC as the bank to hide assets in after governments fall -- like Qaddafi/Libya. And what construction firm built HSBC's new headquarters in Egypt? CCC...
              </p>
              <p>
               It doesn't end there. **CCC is also heavily invested in oil and natural gas, and in pipelines like Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan" -- located in Turkey.

              <p>
               ..Anyways, there is still more... The CTO of CCC, Nafez Housseini, is also the founder of "Partners For Sustainable Development", a Palestinian NGO which "is committed to working in partnership with the poor, youth, women, recovering from natural or man-made disasters."..

             <p>
              The Clinton Foundation -- and Hewlett Foundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation -- is tied into this organization, via the "Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data." Basically, they use organizations like PSDglobal to gain data -- data on victims of disasters, under the guise of "using satellites to monitor agriculture efforts, to citizen engagement tools to understand sanitation requirements in villages in remote parts of the world"..
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               More specific to Hillary Clinton, she is at the forefront of creating Data2X. Data2X is run through the UN (shadiest of all global institutions) and is used to advance gender data, focusing on civil registration statistics via cell phone records, satellite datasets, and social media. It says, " The work is exploratory and aims to demonstrate what big data can and cannot achieve." Basically, its formed just as a reason to compile large sets of data on young women in impoverished countries -- including Haiti..
              </p>
              <p>
               So, in other words, they are claiming that the cell phone tracking, satellite datasets, etc, are being used to try and catch the human trafficking bad guys. But, what is more likely is, they are using this data collection to track down movements in populations that are being impacted by disasters, vulnerable to becoming trafficking victims. That is EXACTLY what Flowminder does -- which is part of Hillary Clinton's Data2X. Interesting that the first country noted on Flowminder's home page is Bangladesh. Do a google search on "Bangladesh huiman trafficking." One of the WORST places on the globe.

             Art in Embassies, partnering with U.S. Embassy in Amman facilitated Peter Bruun’s visit to Amman, Jordan from January 19-24, 2008. Embassy Amman also partnered with a local NGO, Queen Zein Al Sharaf Institute for Development (ZENID), which works with underprivileged communities in Amman and has affiliate centers in different parts of Jordan, to sponsor an “art camp” for Jordanian youths from January 21-24, 2008. Mr. Bruun conducted two, three-hour workshops daily for four days for groups of 20 youths aged 12-14 and 15-17. He reached a total of 40 young Jordanians, plus 10 volunteer artists and art educators.
            </p>
            <p>
             The theme of the workshops was “second chances.” Mr. Bruun introduced the art of African-American painter Aaron Douglas and had participants share an experience in life when they’ve had a “second chance” at something. ..
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Ambassador Hale hosted a reception in honor of Mr. Bruun. Eighty-one artists, gallery owners, museum directors, patrons, media, and Embassy staff attended the event.

            Been looking up some of the CIA cover addresses in the Panama Papers and they all have the same shell companies listed (out of the ones I've looked at so far).  There's also over 9000 linked addresses.  They've got links to Haiti, Israel, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Italy, China, Samoa and more.  The 9000 plus addresses are in places in the middle east like Qatar, Lebanon, Jordan, Libya etc.
