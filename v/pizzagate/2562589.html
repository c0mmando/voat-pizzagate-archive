<hr />
<p>The movie “Show Dogs” was created for children, but human and animal rights organizations alike objected to the film’s content earlier this week when it was revealed that a scene in the movie would most likely be interpreted as a pedophilia grooming scene not meant for children.</p>
<hr />
<p>The outcry spread on social media, and the film’s producers have since pulled the movie from theaters to be recut in the studio.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Responding to concerns raised by moviegoers and some specific organizations, Global Road Entertainment has decided to remove two scenes from the film ‘Show Dogs’ that some have deemed not appropriate for children,” a statement from the studio said. “The company takes these matters very seriously and remains committed to providing quality entertainment for the intended audiences based on the film’s rating.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The movie’s plot is innocent enough with “Max” (voice-over by Ludacris) a talking undercover police dog, being sent into an international dog show to help FBI Agent “Frank” (Will Arnett) recover a stolen panda. While a contestant in the show, Max is subjected to having his private parts fondled and groped by judges. That is where the grooming scene takes place and film critics noticed, most notable being Terina Maldonado, who wrote the following scathing critique:</p>
<hr />
<p><em>What could have been solely a fun movie for kids that would get my highest recommendation is damaged by a dark and disturbing message hidden, not so subtly between the fluffy dogs and glamorous parties of the show dog lifestyle. As part of any dog show, contestants are judged on their abilities and physical attributes. One part, in particular, is the inspection of the dog’s private parts.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Labeling the film “dark and disturbing,” Maldonado continued with criticisms of the film’s most controversial scenes:</p>
<p><em>Since the inspection of the private parts will happen in the finals, Frank touches Max’s private parts to get him use to it. Of course, Max doesn’t like it and snaps at Frank for him to stop. Max is then told by the former champion, who has been through the process before, that he needs to go to his “zen place” while it happens so he can get through it. More attempts are made by Frank to touch Max’s private parts, but Max is still having trouble letting it happen and keeps snapping at him.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>As children often identify with characters in a movie, it would be easy for children to see themselves as Max and picture themselves being felt up by an adult as something they “have to do” in order to win a prize.</p>
<p>The film’s criticisms caught on like wildfires with social media posts all over the Internet from parents urging others not to take their kids to see the movie over dangers of grooming desensitization.</p>

            Look for this to be the new Hollywood MO going forward.  Push as far as they think they can get away with, pull back a little when slapped but maybe not back all the way.  Repeat, repeat, repeat until people stop paying attention.  Push a little farther....

              "A decade later, Tang, 54, is seeking to reinvent himself as a Hollywood player with the same calling card that propelled his rise in finance: bridge-building between industries in the East and the West.
His 2-year-old Los Angeles film and TV firm, Tang Media Partners, with investors including Tencent and Sequoia Capital's Neil Shen, is trying to achieve an elusive goal long pursued by entertainment executives: create a film company that can both succeed in the U.S. and take advantage of the growing entertainment market in China."

"IM Global Acquired By China’s Tang Media Partners, Launching TV Joint Venture With Tencent"
"Stuart Ford’s sales-finance outfit IM Global is being majority acquired from India’s Reliance Group by Chinese media group Tang Media Partners. The news would mark the latest investment from China into the film business.
Ford’s company, a mainstay of film markets since the former Miramax exec launched it in 2007, has always had a global outlook. That approach only grew once Indian media group Reliance acquired a majority stake in the company in 2010. Tang Media Group, headed up by Donald Tang and backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent, is a relatively young company. In addition to the acquisition of the company, Tang is also partnering with Ford in a parallel transaction to launch a TV joint venture with Tencent to produce and distribute television content. The TV venture will operate under the existing IM Global TV banner."
