            It is worse than Channing Phillips. The US Attorney for Washington DC is Steven Wasserman, Debbie's brother. An attorney of record on the prosecution is Machando who is married to Jo Ann Wasserman.

            It was discovered just yesterday that Imran Awan who has been arrested trying to flee the country to Pakistan and was released on an ankle bracelet still had a seperate hidden email account and access directly into D-Andre Carson office. Carson sits in the Intelligence committee, homeland security committee, &amp; emerging threats committee. Carson has had national security representatives testify before the Senate about his involvement speaking at Mus Brotherhood events, promoting Sharia law, where those supporting Hamas are present.

            G.W.   is on the ground now working with attorney's to file motions to intervene and force these DOJ attorneys to recuse themselves. I posted days ago to call the DOJ Sessions. This hearing is Friday.

             Is Jo Ann Wasserman a sister? There are way too fucking many Wassermans!!  URghhh.

             Thanks for the info, I had read the article  (maybe ZeroHedge or Daily Caller) about the still existing email account,
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2514171665464a4b42574056560b424a53" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">

             </a>
             or something like that, which Imran was using for his real estate extortive behavior towards one of his tenants, and that he was a gamer with the Carson aide, that they hung out together.  More Urgghh.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did not know that there is a hearing tomorrow. This better not get swept under the rug. If GW can help with that, it will really go far for his credibility.

              GW is the one leading it. The daily caller, true pundit, etc get all their stories from him. They have been for months but have been to afraid to print them. He published a bunch of evidence forcing everyone's hand including text messages, emails, phone calls, etc.

               Okay, I thought it was the other way around, but will keep an open mind.  I don't watch GW videos, I don't really watch a lot of videos anyway. I find it faster to read articles in general. I did watch GW's awan videos months ago but really none since. I will be very happy if his motions to recuse are granted.

                    Yes. Hey I just found some very disturbing info on this illuminati ball. 
This is the "organizer" of Illuminati ball. This article was written in January 2017. She talks about basing the event on Rothschilds 1972 event. Also having Prodigy the rapper as her guest and his publicist confirmed. He died "allegedly of chocking" in June 2017 many people said it was illuminati killing.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The NY Times article that was written about the ball was in August 2017...two months after prodigy's death.

             He is a traitor regardless of any Israeli affiliation. He consistently fails to uphold his oath of office as an elected official to protect the Constitution which makes him seditious and guilty of multiple felonies.

            LMAO!!   Some "murder!"   NO death cert, NO autopsy report.

           <p>
            There is NO prosecution sans those docs, ergo there is NO investigation opened sans those docs.

            The JEW Seth Rich is likely sunning himself on an Israeli beach...

             please provide evidence to back up your source. Also, a lot of people who are dead, I've never seen a death certificate for, the lack of document doesn't prove anything.

             I feel the same way but to have them quietly silenced won't solve our crisis. The Constitution and the law need to be reinstated and upheld and all seditious traitors need to be tried in court and tossed forever into gitmo.
