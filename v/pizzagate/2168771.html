<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p>For the same reason it took only a few decades to go from the word “damn” in a movie causing controversy to “hardcore pornography is protected speech” (thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2063874">Jewish PG-cult lawyers</a>) or for comedy to be reduced to fart jokes by Jewish-run Hollywood, our <strong>SNACK INDUSTRY IS CONTROLLED BY PEOPLE WHO WISH TO DEBASE US AND GET RICH DOING IT.</strong></p>
<p>We all agree pizza’s immense popularity is due to an ARTIFICIAL SUPPLY marketed towards OUR (now obese) <a href="https://h2savecom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/screen-shot-2014-10-03-at-11-27-19-am.jpg">CHILDREN!</a></p>
<p>Before PG I didn\'t know of &quot;hipster&quot;, kid-friendly pizza-bars: it was either delivery or Chuck E. Cheese\'s.</p>
<p>Well, we are said to be in the “third wave of coffee” parallel to the current trends of “artisan” pizzas or &quot;craft beers.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>OK, THAT IN MIND LET\'S SEE SOME OTHER BIG BRANDS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Starbucks</strong> was founded by 3 SF Jews who learned the trade from Alfred Peet (Jew) of Peet’s Coffee, itself a huge area chain.  More famous than them is the longtime CEO/Dem consultantHoward Schultz, who is said to be planning a 2020 presidential run.  
</p>
<p>He also pledged to hire 10,000 refugees in response to the Muslim ban -- because for a minority like Jews the #1 priority is obviously OPEN BORDERS to bring the MAJORITY as close down to parity as yourself as possible, <strong>DUH!</strong> </p>
<p>100% of Pizzagate, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFG9p4lWAAQWeKZ.jpg">&quot;diversity&quot;</a> etc is to accomplish this; it’s not some “Cannibal Elite” you fucking CHILDREN! The Kabbalah and trafficking is the MEANS/PHILOSOPHY to that END!</p>
<p>Speaking of priorities, why does the U.S. embassy in Kuwait feel that their “psychological operations” duties should include mitigating an Arab boycott of Starbucks during the wholesale slaughter of Palestinians?
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09KUWAIT112_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09KUWAIT112_a.html</a></p>
<p>The introduction of Starbucks to the UK was implemented by Seattle’s Scott Svenson (finally a Gentile) -- a broker who was the first in UK with his Seattle Coffee Company in the 90s before selling it to Starbucks and working for them. </p>
<p>He\'s also a <a href="http://www.ghgplc.com/Scott%20Svenson.htm">trustee</a> at Childhaven Seattle -- where Chris Cornell had started a <a href="https://s25.postimg.org/yd5wb06hr/Screenshot_2017-09-30-07-00-34.png">“music therapy” program</a></p>
<p>Before you sentimental dupes were blubbering, <a href="https://s1.postimg.org/8q6aakj09r/Screenshot_2017-10-03-11-34-49.png">he was in Greece</a> with former Labour leader Ed Miliband’s (a Marxist Jew whose father <a href="https://s1.postimg.org/7rfppqboxr/Screenshot_2017-10-01-16-45-26.png">despised England</a>) <strong>&quot;International Rescue Committee</strong>&quot;, which exists to further the displacement of Europeans in their own homelands <strong>to the benefit of THE CHOSEN PEOPLE</strong>.</p>
<p>EVERYONE HAS LONG KNOWN THE “REFUGEES” ARE MOSTLY YOUNG <a href="https://s1.postimg.org/9rbrcc9rbz/Screenshot_2017-10-03-12-56-51.png">NON-SYRIAN MEN!</a></p>
<p><strong>DO YOU KNOW ANY AMERICANS WHO NEED SOME HELP WITH ANYTHING AT ALL, UP TO <a href="https://s1.postimg.org/9rs7ykuutb/Capture_2017-10-03-11-39-48.png">WIPING THEIR OWN ASSES? WELL, FUCK THEM</a></strong></p>
<p>If one of us says “a Jewish politician will spend disproportionate resources defending his tribe’s interests over the electorate,” GOD HELP YOU.</p>
<p>BUT CLEARLY THEY KNOW ONLY FEW GENTILES WILL EVER PERUSE <a href="https://s1.postimg.org/953irliqcv/Capture_2017-10-01-16-37-47.png">THEIR PUBLICATIONS</a>!</p>
<p>Also, I was fucking with you: both Svensons are <a href="https://youtu.be/pDjrZmhnPEo">proud Jews.</a></p>
<p>But Svenson left Starbucks because an “alarming gap in the artisan pizza market” (LOL) compelled him to start MOD Pizza, described in <a href="https://www.technomic.com/final-top-500-results-point-limited-service-segment-big-winner">this 2016 industry report:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The fast-casual pizza category vaulted into the spotlight this year with cumulative sales growth of 37%. Three of this year’s five fastest-growing chains were fast-casual pizza concepts, with Pieology Pizzeria at 67% sales growth, Blaze Pizza at 205% and <strong>MOD Pizza, the year’s fastest growing chain, at 220%</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s quick service because they have a “Chipotle-style assembly line system”, which is obviously a lot more hygienic than only two hands touching your football-sized burrito that has the calories of TWO ENTIRE MEALS you fat fucks.</p>
<p>But maybe Chipotle\'s CONSTANT POISONING OF ITS CUSTOMERS EVERY YEAR has more to do with hiring THOUSANDS OF ILLEGALS AND LITERALLY TRAFFICKING THEM INTO AND AROUND THE COUNTRY IN VANS.
(Reported by an unbelievable blond named <a href="http://www.debbieschlussel.com/55085/exclusive-chipotle-ceo-actively-recruits-harbors-transports-illegal-aliens-says-insider-us-largest-alien-smuggling-ring/">Debbie Schlussel</a>)</p>
<p>Chipotle was founded by Steve Ells, and inquiring minds online wanted to know “just how gay and Jewish” he was.

<p><strong>Caffe Nero</strong></p>
<p>Founder Gerry Ford (along with Svenson) is formerly of Apax Partners, one of the world\'s biggest private equity funds founded by a AT-CHELSEA’S-WEDDING-LEVEL CLINTONITE JEW named Alan Patricof. 
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Patricof">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Patricof</a></p>
<p>His wife Susan Patricof is both CFR AND an “overseer” of -- the aforementioned IRC.</p>
<p>Her brother is Craig Hatkoff, one of a dozen JEWISH directors of the Child Mind Institute, among them the sister of Trump\'s Treasury Secretary, Valerie Mnuchin.
<a href="http://www.muckety.com/Child-Mind-Institute/5092727.muckety">http://www.muckety.com/Child-Mind-Institute/5092727.muckety</a></p>
<p>Craig Hatkoff was a trustee of the Sesame Street Workshop while the Jew Gary Knell was president.

<p>Gary Knell was mentioned by <a href="https://voat.co/user/redditsuckz">@redditsuckz</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1905400/9369468">here</a> due to an invitation his wife Kim Larson sent to John Podesta -- to an event for Alefantis and Waters’ org Slow Food.</p>
<p>Gary Knell has also served as president of NPR (state-funded liberal propaganda) and the National Geographic Society.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised by a <a href="https://s25.postimg.org/4mnd2udf3/Screenshot_2017-09-29-14-59-11.png">quote</a> in <a href="http://chillblaine.blogspot.com/2016/12/national-geographic-peddles-jewish.html">the source blog</a></p>
<p>So how cucked are you when your community\'s young women have in 2 generations been turned into <a href="https://s1.postimg.org/1igck5xp4v/Capture_2017-10-03-12-00-27.png">OUTRAGEOUS WHORES</a> due to their <a href="https://s1.postimg.org/43xeo1ce73/Screenshot_2017-09-30-12-21-56.png">DEGENERATE ART</a> and you defend the guilty more than the honest among them do?  Really, I am asking you men here personally.</p>',

            Starbucks

           was founded by 3 SF Jews who learned the trade from Alfred Peet (Jew) of Peet’s Coffee, itself a huge area chain.  More famous than them is the longtime CEO/Dem consultantHoward Schultz, who is said to be planning a 2020 presidential run.

           Speaking of priorities, why does the U.S. embassy in Kuwait feel that their “psychological operations” duties should include mitigating an Arab boycott of Starbucks during the wholesale slaughter of Palestinians?

           It's quick service because they have a “Chipotle-style assembly line system”, which is obviously a lot more hygienic than only two hands touching your football-sized burrito that has the calories of TWO ENTIRE MEALS you fat fucks.
          </p>
          <p>
           But maybe Chipotle's CONSTANT POISONING OF ITS CUSTOMERS EVERY YEAR has more to do with hiring THOUSANDS OF ILLEGALS AND LITERALLY TRAFFICKING THEM INTO AND AROUND THE COUNTRY IN VANS.

            Caffe Nero’s wiki mentions their ART MUSEUMS and music outreach, but what's disconcerting is that the CEO’s (Gerry Ford, blood status unconfirmed) old boss at Apax, Alan Patricof, was appointed by Bush II to head the “Millennium Challenge Corporation”, another redundant aid organization which continued under Obama and today:

             “There are similar efforts in other parts of the country. The Clinton Foundation put $150,000 into creating a Haiti Coffee Academy, a project that also involves a U.S. roaster, La Colombe Torrefaction.
The academy, set up at an abandoned coffee farm, is near the southeastern border with the Dominican Republic, which buys a lot of Haiti’s production.
