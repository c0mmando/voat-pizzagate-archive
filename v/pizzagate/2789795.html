             If you would like to undertake a post on this I would be grateful.  I will do it if not, but I am really not very good at setting up posts like you are.  I think this whole connection with the Saudis and Guland and Turkey Podestas etc,  needs to be exposed. I also think greatest exposure would be in

             Thank You!  I have been aware of Gulan and his opening charter schools here, but the fact that he is considered a Mullah Terrorist and is probably setting up Muslim Teachings within the schools is frightening.  The ties to Clintons, Podestas are amazing.  Thank you again.  The video is Amazing.

            please try to post this again.  I think it is a very important post and has connections to the Clintons which qualifies it for pizzagate investigations.  I had found my comment links before you even posted and was wondering if I should post it, and was delighted to see your post.  Hope you decide to post this again under  "discuss".  Thanks.

             Ok Carmencita, if you wish collect whatever discussion on Saudi or Clintons or Cultural Center or whomever and post this again under "discuss". I have a second post in
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagateuncensored">
              v/pizzagateuncensored
             </a>
             just so the news information is archived. I noticed a lot of conspiracy involving Western politicans, Asia, islam etc I don't know what to make of the pizzagate conspiracy I first, reddit banned the subject and thought it was fake alien nonsense but seeing recent news I admit there could be some turth in it now, perhaps someone who followed the news and blogs and conspiracy can better make sense of it all

              I was on reddit during pizzagate and left it for voat because investigations were then shut down.  I am not good at posting mostly do research.  I will try to work on it and hope I get it posted. I think the fact that it ends up involving The Podesta Group is extremely important.   Gulen Turkey Saudis Clintons and The Podesta Group.  Wow. Do you think this will pass muster as far as the  Posting Rules?

            During the recent tensions between the United States and Turkey, Erdogan suggested a swap of Brunson for Fethullah Gülen, a 77-year-old Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania after moving to the United States in 1999. Gülen is the founder of the movement bearing his name, which Erdogan was seeking to purge during the wave of arrests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brunson's release is being hailed as a diplomatic victory for the Trump administration with the president Friday morning tweeting, "PASTOR BRUNSON JUST RELEASED. WILL BE HOME SOON!" President Trump has imposed sanctions and tariffs against Turkey, a U.S. ally, over the pastor's imprisonment. Trump also referred to Brunson as "a great patriot hostage" in an August tweet, in which the president also declared, "We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man, but we are cutting back on Turkey!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Following Trump's sanctions, Turkish currency, known as the lira, hit an all-time low as of August. Some have also speculated that Brunson's release is also related to Turkey's strategic interests with respect to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi who disappeared inside the Saudi consulate located in Istanbul. Turkish officials have claimed to possess audio and video proof that Khashoggi was killed.

            Over the past decade scores of charter schools have popped up all over the U.S., all sharing some common features. Most of them are high-achieving academically, they stress math and science, and one more thing: they're founded and largely run by immigrants from Turkey who are carrying out the teachings of a Turkish Islamic cleric: Fethullah Gulen.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's the spiritual leader of a growing and increasingly influential force in the Muslim world -- known as "The Gulen Movement" -- with millions upon millions of disciples who compare him to Ghandi and Martin Luther King. Gulen promotes tolerance, interfaith dialog, and above-all: he promotes education. And yet he's a mystery man -- he's never seen or heard in public -- and the more power he gains, the more questions are raised about his motives and the schools.

            Ozkok is founding board member of the Turkish Cultural Center and part of a network of businesses and non-profits affiliated with the Gulen movement, also known as Hizmet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ozkok served as national finance co-chair of the pro-Clinton Ready PAC. He gave $10,000 to the committee in 2014 and $2,700 to Clinton’s campaign last year. He is also listed on the Turkish Cultural Center’s website as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, one of the non-profit arms of the Clinton Foundation. He’s given between $25,000 and $50,000 to the Clinton charity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another link between Gulenists and the Clinton orbit was revealed in a lobbying registration disclosure filed last month with the Senate. It shows that a Gulen-aligned group called the Alliance for Shared Values hired the Clinton-connected Podesta Group to lobby Congress on its behalf. The group seeks to lobby for the “promotion of peace, tolerance and interfaith dialogue.”
           </p>
           <p>
            "promotion of peace, tolerance and interfaith dialogue"  my foot.   This is a Big Mess.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudis,  Turkey,  Charter Schools and an Imam.  Some how it always connects to the Clintons.  But this time it's The Podesta Group too.
