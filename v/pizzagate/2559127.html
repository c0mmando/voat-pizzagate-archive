<p>If we go along with the notion that the vast percentage of these crimes go unreported, it makes the perpetration of these crimes fully systemic, and a disturbing picture of the Catholic Church from top to bottom comes into view. In fact, it would be naive not to draw the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedophilia is not actually an unwanted problem within the Catholic Church, but rather a core activity that is promoted by the Holy See</li>
<li>The capacity to move up the ranks in the Catholic Church is predicated largely on a priest’s engagement in such activities or, at minimum, their willingness to keep silent or enable such activities</li>
<li>The Catholic Church is ‘Christianity’ in name only, and those at the highest levels do not follow the teachings of Jesus Christ at all, but rather the practices of an occult system like Satanism where pedophilia is promoted</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, I believe many Catholic priests–perhaps the vast majority–are doing their best to practice the teachings of Jesus Christ as they understand them, and impart those teachings to their followers. However, the fact that there has not been a major revolt on the part of Catholic priests against the rampant pedophilia within their ranks only reinforces the notion that we are dealing with a systemic problem. The fact that the bishops of an entire nation were all found to be complicit in enabling pedophilia under their purview reinforces this claim.</p>
<p>All that is left now is for us to unveil the highly guarded secret motives of the Vatican itself. A cogent explanation for the preponderance of pedophilia within the ‘sacred’ walls of churches and parishes would surely be revealed.

             I would wager that Christians are no more violent than atheists. I would also like to point out that Christians are far less promiscuous.

            <p>
             On the other side of the argument is the fact that celebrity atheists like Dawkins and such are just as scummy as the Pope &amp; co. I'd bet they're all pedos.

               Dawkins is obviously a swamp creature, but I'm sure if you keep sucking him as hard as your are he might give you mercy. Faggot.

              <p>
               If you go to the leader of any large group you will find pedos. This includes the Catholic church and it also includes your celebrity atheists you're so gay for. I bet I hate the Pope and all the faggot bishops more than you do.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you want to suck the dick of science, whatever. That's your hustle. Just know that evolution and the Big Bang Theory are two of the most baseless theories of all time and you swallow up these narratives like the brainless, spineless cunt that you are.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fucking hell, we need to start a crusade against the fags. You're first on my list.
