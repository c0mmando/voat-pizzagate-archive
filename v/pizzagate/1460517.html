            The 2003 incorporated real estate holding company
            <strong>
             <em>
              CONNEB II LLC
             </em>
            </strong>
            was created by the same
            <strong>
             <em>
              Jewish Cohen family
             </em>
            </strong>
            that already owned the Lot's at the corner of
            <strong>
             <em>
              CONnecticut Ave NW and NEBraska Ave NW (CON + NEB = CONNEB)
             </em>
            </strong>
            , and the reason for a $0 purchase price of the Lots is precisely
            <strong>
             <em>
              BECAUSE of the IRS filing
             </em>
            </strong>
            , because no purchase had occurred, thus no Capital ownership transaction had occurred, just the transfer of Titles into a corporate shell ...
            <strong>
             <em>
              the owners were the incorporators !!!

            Look into the Cohen family, as I have posted elsewhere exhaustively on this sub, so that the
            <em>
             'Saudi'
            </em>
            canard is retired ... because it is not at all helpful. The Cohen's connect up with George Soros through the
            <strong>
             <em>
              anti-Netanyahu J Street Zionist lobby
             </em>
            </strong>
            , of which David Cohen was and advisory member, though he died in 2015 and the
            <strong>
             <em>
              Title of Little Red Fox was 'sold' to Barry R. Cohen
             </em>
            </strong>
            (probable relative) in 2007 for $0, because he was obviously an heir to part of the Cohen estate which they were palming off early.

           <p>
            J Street is Soros' anti-Netanyahu outfit that wants to hand Jerusalem and Bethlehem over to United Nations International city status and carve the rest into separate Jewish and Palestinian states ... there are two very different breeds of Zionist, and Soros and the Cohen's were clearly of the ultra-left-wing 'liberal' type.

            is the key evidence proving the

             </em>

             'trust me ... it's there ... everyone knows it's true'
            </em>
            . A rash Google boolean search is not evidence of anything, and can easily be debunked by more detailed analysis such as the Cohen family linkages explained herein.

            In fact, two real-estate holding companies were created on January 15th 2003:
            <strong>
             <strong>
              CONNEB I LLC,
             </strong>
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             <strong>
              CONNEB II LLC,
             </strong>
            </strong>
            in order to consolidate but partition the properties owned by the previous lot owners, no doubt for ease of Tax filing, P&amp;L assessment, and LLC protection (most people who own multiple lots in one place will eventually consolidate their holdings into a single corporate body).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              In fact, the dead giveaway was the $0 purchase price, which proves that the original Lot Title owners were the ones who incorporated the CONNEB II LLC, because they DIDN'T have to sell Lot's they already owned to themselves ... obviously.
             </em>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            It would seem that many of the posters on Voat that talk about the property purchases don't have the faintest idea of how real estate entities and corporate shells are created and managed ... which is highly frustrating.
           </p>
           <p>
            The original owners are actually the
            <strong>
             <em>
              Jewish Cohen family (Carla and David)
             </em>
            </strong>
            who were long-time founder owner operators of the
            <strong>
             <em>
              Politics &amp; Prose
             </em>
            </strong>
            bookstore, which has always been a Democrat stronghold, and it seems that the ex-Washington Post journalist/editor couple of
            <strong>
             <em>
              Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine
             </em>
            </strong>
            must have purchased or at least become majority owners of CONNEB II LLC, because they are now referred to since 2013 as the
            <em>
             'owners'
            </em>
            of Politics &amp; Prose, though the property records indicate that it is still owned by CONNEB II LLC. This means that the WashPo duo since 2013 actually probably own the Title of Besta Pizza and Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping through CONNEB, and that Hammad and Alefantis are only owners of a Lease (CPP however is owned Freehold by Alefantis through BIG CHEESE LLC, bought for $1.8 million in 2005 ... and Alefantis must have bought the lease for Bucks later on in 2005, but NOT the Title).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              NOTE:
             </em>
            </strong>
            The dead giveaway that the heirs of the Cohen estate were/are the owners/now part-owners of CONNEB II LLC, is that the Title of Little Red Fox was sold July 13th 2007 (before Carla and David Cohen died; 2010 &amp; 2015 respectively), to one Barry R. Cohen, for $0 --
            <strong>
             <em>
              THIS IS KEY,
             </em>
            </strong>
            because Barry R. Cohen is the only purchaser on record who received a property TITLE from Carla &amp; David Cohen (CONNEB II LLC) for $0, whereas everyone else like Alefantis paid for their Freehold. Obviously Barry R. Cohen (who isn't the owner of the Lease, only the Title) of Little Red Fox, is obviously a side relation of the P&amp;P Cohen's, because they only have one son Aaron and daughter Eve ... though I suppose he could be a grandson through Aaron Cohen.

            I have no evidence but the Huma Abedin story always was fishy to me......she seems to have worked with Hillary since she was 18.   It feels like the Muslim Brotherhood GAVE her to Hillary.   Much like the two tribes cement their loyalties.  By swapping each others children to be married.   Makes you wonder what children of ours have been given to Saudia to cement our side.    I think they married her off to Anthony only after they knew what kind of pervert he was......it was good he was a pervert because he would always do what they said....I think they were planning to make him very very powerful.....first Mayor of NYC then maybe Senator and then President?    What a PR bullshit machine they would of used!  The Jew marrying a Muslim......look how great we are....and they would of continued to have a powerful person after Clintonś 8 years in the white house......or that was the plan.

             Yes, The Abedin-Weiner marriage was an arranged marriage by the Clinton mob.

             They needed someone to watch Weiner, and visa versa. Huma is 100% a spy for foreign Arab states. She is always looking over Hillary's shoulder.

            Anybody ever read "Devil in the White City" about serial killer H. H. Holmes' murder hotel? This entire street seems to have taken inspiration from it. Holmes built a full block hotel that included stores and other services, along with the main hotel to take advantage of the World's Fair influx of people.  It's construction was like that Hawaiian property with different crews being brought in for different stages, and nobody being given the complete plan. There were trap doors and huge walk in safes where he could torture and murder without a sound escaping. Huge furnace in the basement. Maze like areas with dead end traps. He too would cut up bodies and sell parts to medical schools and sell off full skeletons.
           </p>
           <p>
            At least he had the somewhat good grace to only target adults.

             a really good illustration of it

            Once this shit is all done and dusted, should see if the same artist would take on an illustration of the gruesome secrets of Comet-Pizza and connected lots.

            I don't understand how this can be accurate and where you're getting your info. The only thing I saw was a jpg that said the sales amount was blocked and showing $0 because the person hadn't joined the site.

             Scrolling the info in your link shows Big Cheese LLC and Comet Ping Pong both at that address with 16 employees combined and it also shows the building has 2 floors and heated with hot water which indicates a boiler in a basement that is isn't there according to Alifantis video.

                  Well, the interesting thing is Comet Pizza was sold for taxes. JA had an option to pay the taxes if he was outbid, but what did happen at that auction?

                    Here's the pdf. It's listed under Christopher Achilles LLC and is lot number 1986 0825 which corresponds to the address of Comet if you care to cross-reference it.

                     That's easy enough to figure out.  The list was made after taxes were in arrears as of October of 2008, but the sale wasn't held until September of 2009.  The property owner can still bring the taxes up to date in that year so they don't lose their property, though interest and penalty is usually applied.

                      I'm putting your name on my list of idiots to stay away from. Can't believe you're attempting to debunk a freakin' delinquent tax property sale! Like you were there and know what happened. To educate you, the auction goes through anyway. The original owner has first option to pay the delinquent amount so if you want to debunk something, you show me where JA paid that money. If not, STFU!

             The primary method used to avoid prosecution by diplomats is diplomatic immunity deals that no one dares to challenge. There are numerous cases of the State Dept leveraging this in connection with charges around trafficking or similar cases.

            Patented Method for creating fat free animal feed powder using perchloroethylene (drycleaning fluid)

            </a>
            The method according to the invention consists essentially of a combination of several process steps, which, of course, may be subject to certain variations. In the first step the fat-containing substance of animal origin, i. e., fish, animal carcasses and the like, is heated and treated in a suitable reaction vessel in known manner by means of steam under pressure; thereby, the bones are softened, the flesh falls apart, etc., so that a substantially homogeneous and compact mass is obtaine having a temperature of, for example, 119 C. Thereupon, liquid perchloroethylene is added to the mass, for two different purposes, and the mixture is subjected to distillation. 0n the one hand, the mass thereby becomes dehydrated as the water is distilled off with the perchloroethylene. On the other hand, the perchloroethylene penetrates into the gradually dehydrated and thus now-coherent mass, causing an efficient extraction of the fat. After a period of time, the extraction and dehydration processes are concluded, so that the liquid extract may be drawn 0E. Thereupon, the residual solid material is washed with perchloroethylene in order to remove the last remnants of fat. The next step, which is essential to the process according to the invention is now performed, namely the infusion of perchloroethylene vapors into the extracted mass. This is continued until ice the vapors escaping into the cooler have a temperature of about 119 C. The perchloroethylene is then blown off by means of steam having a temperature of about C. Surprisingly, this does not cause the mass to agglomerate or to form lumps. After the blowing-off of the perchloroethylene, a practically fatfree, dry, odorless mass is obtained having a powdery and crumbly consistency, which is readily consumed by animals as a feeding stuff."

            Could be mixed into other foods like dog food yeasted doughs animal pellets etc.

            This stuff is being found everywhere in our environment including the water supply at Camp Lejeune where many stationed men had reported reported breast cancer. The chemical is a known cause endocrine disruption etc.

             I work in a dry cleaning plant and we no longer use Perc, just petroleum. It would be interesting to know who supplies them and if they choose to still use it or can't afford to switch to the safer chemical or something.

            The SAUDI connection is really coming together this guy goes back to CLINTONS first term, could be that Clinton Foundation has been running CHILD FUCK STREET for the Saudi's since 1990's.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I really don't like to blame CLINTONS for this shit BUSH was always into boys coming to him via these tunnels, and TRUMP got rich by turning  12 year old girls into whores for the Jewish MOB ( Sheldon Adelson ) &amp; EPSTEIN
           </p>
           <p>
            I've searched the DC Data base, and here are my findings:
           </p>
           <p>
            Best Pizza is the Doing Business As Name for Uptown Pizza LLC - owner is Abdel Rahman Hammad - who has been the owner for 22 years. The registered agent is Anthony Kline of the law firm Veritas I've linked below - the address matches his address at 1925 19th St NW.
           </p>
           <p>
            therefore, this is not Kline that works for the USDOJ. I'm researching Mr Hammad to see if anything unusual comes up.

             At this point, it's not anymore the Clintons alone. The Saudi connection is cross-sectional to the entire US government. The Saudi have been helping the US gov pull the Gulf war, setup Al Qaeda and perpetrate 9/11 under Bush government, and setup ISIS under Clinton / Obama. The Bin Laden are friends and investors of the Bush family, and the Saudi government is one of the largest funders of the Clinton Foundation etc. Basically Saudi Arabia is lobbying democrats or republicans regardless so it has become a staple of US foreign policy in the middle east, and a partner in dirty personal businesses of both sides. That means we can't count on either side to step in and use what we dig up about the other side to further their political agenda as they are in the same boat and would be shooting themselves in the foot by bringing the Saudi connection to the public attention.

               I went to school with a guy whose sister is good friends with the daughter of a very wealthy guy who is very close to Sheldon. I can use my proximity to investigate this angle if you give me something to go with.

                Not sure if your friend will ever be able to get info like that about Sheldon, but it is definitely good to try.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the area he lives, Las Vegas, he is a very influential figure, had a school named after him (owned by him? Not sure), and medical clinics in his name.
               </p>
               <p>
                The info I can give is much of his money was/is generated through prostitution ring. Victims that speak out are known to be made examples of in very traumatic / extreme ways.
He has hosted pedophiles at his popular hotels The Venetian / The Palazzo.
Staff at those properties are sometimes utilized as enforcers.

            Well I found your stuff over at twitter.com even though I'm a regular here, I have been asking this question for a month, where is the DBA info and property records for the block, looks like you found it, and upon study it appear Gill is the Realtor on behalf of NEBCON Ii LLC, after on hour all over the net I finally started getting good tracks with NEB-CON LLC, that led to

            Once I headed over to Saudi Arabia you can find a lot of stuff on CON. N.E.B. Ii LLC, it appears that SAUDI BOUGHT the BLOCK a long time ago, and handed it over for Zero Dollars to Andrew Kline, ... it would be interesting if CLINTON FOUNDATION had built a recreational SEX center early on 2003, well before OBAMA election, perhaps CLINTONS were were actually running sex entertainment with SAUDIS going back even pre 911 (2001); This could be reason big bucks from Norway, and SAUDI and everywhere else.

            IMHO this is not just about CLINTONS, but its what FBIanon said all along that SAUDI was deeply involved the child sex slavery at all levels of GOV in WASH-DC.

            Lastly, what was brilliant about your post Is I never could find a VET who could incinerate corpses, but once I saw you had found a WET-CLEANER then everything fell together as a wet-cleaner has caustics and tubs that can turn a corpse to liquid and flush down the drain with no evidence VERY EASY. GOOD FIND.

             I think it goes back to Bush Sr. and they got Clinton's involved and allowed him to be a puppet as president. I believe they have never lost power by using this.

              This, 100%. Remember, Bush sr. was the director of the CIA during the Iran-Contra affair. Bill Clinton has long been accused of raising drug money out of the Mena, Arkansas airport to fund those covert operations.
             </p>
             <p>
              I personally believe it was around the time of Iran-Contra when this spiderweb of illicit activity began to take shape.

               not quite.
              </p>
              <p>
               My pseudo-namesake, Bill Casey, was CIA director from 1981-87. He was deeply involved with Operation CYCLONE (training mujahideen in Afghanistan) and Iran-Contra, CIA drug trafficking, etc. He was also a Knight of Malta, and suddenly died of a stroke right before he was slated to testify to Congress about Iran-Contra.
              </p>
              <p>
               HOWEVER, ex-CIA director George Bush was Vice President throughout that same exact period. HE was the one running the show.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look up Russ Baker's book "Family of Secrets" - he's dug up convincing evidence that George Bush has actually been an undercover CIA operative his entire adult life. GHW Bush even has a mysterious connection to Dallas and the JFK assassination.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's most likely that George Bush has been the Godfather of the Bipartisan Neo-Liberal Mafia since 1981. He and his cronies ran some of the most heinous Iran-Contra and cocaine shit behind Reagan's back. By his second term he was already slipping into Alzeimer's, so Bush was the one who managed the scandal fallout and then got himself elected President in '88 (sort of similar to Hillary, he had to outrun all his crimes, but unlike her he succeeded).
              </p>
              <p>
               George Bush then oversaw the final 2 years of the USSR's existence, and possibly committed massive financial crimes to destroy the ruble and ensure that "Socialism" died a decisive death. All the hard evidence of, say, fraudulent US Treasury notes, or FBI/ONI/Treasury Dept investigations into securities fraud, was kept in World Trade Center Towers 1, 2, and 7. Those records no longer exist. (for that rabbit hole, look up "Collateral Damage" by e.p. heidner, and Operation Hammer)
              </p>
              <p>
               For various reasons, Bush's re-election prospects in 1992 were looking dim - thus, his Mena drug-trafficking pal Bill Clinton was elevated and took his place, dutifully covering up ALL the crimes of Bush's Iran-Contra Enterprise.

              IMHO this is not just about CLINTONS, but its what FBIanon said all along that SAUDI was deeply involved the child sex slavery at all levels of GOV in WASH-DC.

             while all clues given by anyone, to try to help uncover whatever organizations that exploit children and those who can't defend themselves are wholeheartedly appreciated,    THANK YOU!

             ..but i can't help but think theres a possibility fbianon is implicated and know the end is nigh; so they try to subvert the inevitable make it look like they help so they end up looking as the good guy.
            </p>
            <p>
             where was fbianon while 80 some people were murdered for the sake of the clintons?

             My understanding is that Andrew Kline is just the attorney who handled this.
             <strong>
              Uptown Pizza, INC is the owner of Besta Pizza.
             </strong>
             "INC" means it's a corporation.  That means there are multiple shareholders.
             <strong>
              We need to try to find out who the shareholders are.
