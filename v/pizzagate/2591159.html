            I have been investigating the Chicago Mob "The Outfit".  Have read a lot.  Down and Dirty.  I found a list of members and their level.
            <br/>

           <p>
            Some of the are gone like LaPietra but if you look down there is a name of Ronald Jarrett
           </p>
           <p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            One is the 1999 Outfit killing of hit man Ronald Jarrett, who was shot outside his Bridgeport home. Jarrett, sources familiar with the FBI investigation said, was a close friend of Nick Calabrese, and the Jarrett hit was a message to Nick.
           </p>
           <p>
            HIT MAN  Ronald Jarrett.  Jarrett is not that common of a name.  Have not found a connection to Valerie as of yet.
Also this is what goes on in Chicago.  Serious Business.  From the same article:
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI is also questioning Calabrese about the Will County killings of Billy Dauber and his wife, shot as they left a courthouse. And the murders of the Spilotro brothers, and the killing of Teamster official Alan Dorfman; and the assassination of federal witness Danny Siefert in front of Siefert's 4-year-old son. And so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            No wonder they are able to operate an organ harvesting op in Chicago.

              Someone told me that Rahm is running a huge ponzi scheme in Chicago and I believe it.  He is a crackerjack at Creative Math. Children are being hidden by the thousands.   I read a while back that the Mafias are not fighting anymore but working together now.  That's even more frightening.

            This is insane that government officials have no idea how to handle child abuse claims. And the teachers also did nothing, they have the ability to call the police not just CPS. How is there no oversight of these organizations that are meant to help but don’t know what to do or how to handle these crimes. And how the fuck did these teachers with criminal and pedophile backgrounds get hired on?
           </p>
           <p>
            Any liberal reading this should take note of what happens when you live in a communist led city like Chicago. It’s not called chiraq for nothing.

            There may have been some that got confused by CPS.  In Chicago it means Chicago Public Schools and that kept some mixed up.  But people also need to know that sometimes a post can evolve as things are researched and discovered.  Really was odd that derram did not post his usual though.  Hmm.

             I knew that CPS for Chi is the public school whereas everyone else I think think it is Child Prot Servs.

             Easy mistake, no worries. Yes and Derram clearly suspiciously staying away. Maybe he feels he doesn't get paid enough to deal with the REALLY TOUGH TOPICS....

             That racist F should just pee off back to the subverse
             <strong>
              NIGGERS
             </strong>
             where he posts frequently, then has the audacity to come over here and pretend to act all civilized in a thread that is mostly about poor oppressed Black folk. Piece of shit.
Free speech n all I get it, but the likes of that thing seriously undermines our hard work when he starts spouting "kikes" and "niggers" all over the place.

               Honestly, I think a lot of that here on Voat (when it's not a deliberate attempt to soil the comment section of a thread like Donkey is so fond of) is mostly just gleeful liberty. It's like a little kid who gets his diaper taken off before a bath and runs down the hall naked to look in the mirror just because he can.

                   no they are mostly losers who are fat asses and too lazy to get a job. Like yourself. Which is why youre on here all day. 
Struck a nerve with that comment did I? you sound so defensive, like you know all about it. Now you understand why others get troubled with the racist bile you spill when some of our closest, nearest and dearest are BLACK.
And keep coming at it, retard. Like that's all you have in life to brag about. I'm happy to keep going forever, dummy. I don't know you so this is like an awesome game where I get to beat you and send you running back sniveling like a two yr old to the

                    We're known for being hard workers. try your bullshit Hollywood jew lies elsewhere. You're a black woman. Its okay. I noticed it last year when I started looking at your comments. The pattern is identifiable. You can deny all you want but secretly know that I KNOW my shit.

            Here's the info you are looking for on Obama and Rahm Emanuel being involved in the gay community together.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's circumstantial evidence, but they were both members of the gay club: Man’s Country, according to an article Wayne Madsen published in his newsletter in 2010, and republished here:

            This article expands on that:

           <p>
            Here's an amusing article:

             there is so much on ROSEMONT alone, dating back years. Hiding in plain sight. SO MANY woke folk on Youtube talking about the corruption there. Organs. Everything. THEY KNOW. Trump wanted to send in the troops. Got scared away by Rahmmm Im guessing. That story died a death. Rahmmmm has so much sh*t on Trump, makes Stormy Daniels look like kindergarten playtime....@carmencita

            <p>
             The Varkey Foundation, initially the Varkey GEMS Foundation, is a global charitable foundation focused on improving the standards of education for underprivileged children.[2] It was formed in 2010 by Indian businessman Sunny Varkey, the founder and chairman of GEMS Education, the world's largest operator of kindergarten-to-grade-12 schools.[3] The foundation's main focuses are improving global teacher capacity by training tens of thousands of teachers and principals in developing countries; providing access to education via a variety of programmes and projects; and advocating for change in, and conducting research that can help develop, education policies worldwide.[1][4]

                    pay 10 times as much when she needs one in a hurry? What was Kenneka's mom's commission from that sale...?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Oh one wonders....do your own research on this, all you folk reading this thread and not commenting. Its VERY REAL.

              Omg, I remember the story of the girl found in the freezer. That is awful about the family finding out their sons organs were removed and stuffed with newspaper. I just can't imagine how terrible that would be to lose your child and then find out his organs were stolen.

               They do these things to the poor.  They have no care for they are not like them they are of a different class to them.  It makes me so sick knowing this is going on every day all day long somewhere.  And how to stop it, I just don't know.  Spreading the news is what we are trying to do with this post.  It must STOP.  We are ALL God's Children.

                They go after all those that are disadvantaged. We see this with the poor, those affected by natural disasters, or war torn countries. They take advantage of those that are unable to fight back.
I can't believe how the black market trafficking of organs in Chicago has been swept under the rug. I hope the people of Chicago rid their city of Emmanuel. It also makes you wonder what other cities this is happening in. I hope many more voices rise up to stop this injustice.

                 Oh I think they are working hand in hand.  Yes, he has quite a business going.  The world has always been taking advantage of the poor, but now with today''s medical discoveries they are taking it to the next horrid level.  Stealing body parts so the rich can live longer and making money to boot.  I think I read that they fly them from here to Israel as well.

                If I remember correctly, I think he’s the one that has broken down and blamed himself for his moms death. That’s really strange. I didn’t know he was from here either.

                 you should follow him on twitter srayzie! You have some good influence over there. If you feel like tweeting about Emanuel/Organ trafficking/Homan Square/Kenneka Jenkins, would be awesome. You could reference this thread :) :)

                      He's not stupid.  He can't talk about it.  Who knows what they threatened him with.  Maybe doing with his child.  He sent Kim to DT to do what he can.  To free the woman.  I think he will keep trying to do the good that he can.  If he speaks out about THAT, Its Over.

              A whole page to look at.     The Black Man who gave his organs?  Or were they stolen.  It is reported that they never paid the
              <br/>
              burial fees for this man or anything else.   I will never forget the ignoring of this post.  Never.  I have all their names.  Either they are shills or someone deleted their comments as they were written.

                 I'm still not black since the last time you thought I was (5 mins ago) but youre still a trailer hick who cant spell. Look at you using ebonics cos youre desperate to be one. 
Youre doing a good job at showing everyone what uneducated pigsslop you are. hahaha, better run back to the Nigger subverse where you post so much and dribble with your fellow basement slop.

                 Oh yes.  All we did was post what was on the internet.  It's there for everyone if they look for it.  We did not raid anyone's office or drawers (oops). am waiting for voat to go down.  Maybe that is why they are avoiding us to keep it from shutting down again.  Hmm.

               Journalist Reaches From Grave To Nail Rahm EMMANUEL
              </p>
              <p>
               "Heaven has cursed us, the common people of America, with a traitor-infested central government, with a fraudulent banking system, with a mendacious press, and with a corrupt judiciary condoned by cowardly lawyers. ……
              </p>
              <p>
               We ordinary Americans, if loudmouthed ---Are we quickly approaching the time when foreign secret police on U.S. soil, with impunity, will knock at our door in the dark of night and take us away, who knows, to a world government concentration camp? And will we be the most well-informed inmates of why and how we are
              </p>
              <p>
               Most people don't know of Rahm Emanuel's frightening past. After  Clinton's election years ago,  Rahm Emanuel,  allegedly named each of the enemies of the Clinton campaign.  He is the son of an Irgun Fighter, who were classified as Terrorists by the British in Palestine .Rahm  enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 91 he moved to, Ark. to help conduct Clinton's 
presidential campaign. Raised funds reportedly by knowing secret workings of major covert operations of the American CIA. Such as: HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL and HOUSEHOLD BANK.    Rahm Emanuel latched onto a 50 million dollar portion of federal funds parked with Household.
              </p>
              <p>
               Rahm Emanuel grabbed a portion of the parked funds to jump-start Clinton's 92 campaign. Other portions of the funds were secretly transferred  to Little Rock to try to cover up an embezzlement of Madison Guaranty S &amp; L for which Bill and Hillary Clinton were subject to being prosecuted on federal bank misappropriation criminal charges. Emanuel is reportedly a double-dealer, purporting to act for the Mossad at the same time acting against. Emanuel is reportedly chief arranger of Red Chinese and other illicit funds massively flowing through the Chicago markets, disguised as soybean trading, foreign currency dealings, and such, on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercentile Exchange, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Currently Rahm plays a key role with Wasserstein &amp; Perella, New York-based alleged investment firm apparently 
fronting for various Red Chinese interests in U.S." "Foreign intelligence sources are snickering over reports that the Red Chinese claim they have clandestine audio tapes, still pictures, and YES, even undercover video, showing secret agents of the President/Commander-in-Chief receiving suitcases loaded with money, in return for the U.S. top nuclear secrets including a copy of the super-secret computer data on nuclear testing. The Chinese, so say these sources, are asserting that they BOUGHT such items, fair and square, from Clinton's emissaries. If there is a problem in this type of "routine" business transaction, say the sources quoting Chinese officials, well, "Let the Americans attend to their end of White House business ethics". " "Wow! What Americans perceive as treachery and espionage the Chinese identify as "business ethics" in a C.O.D. deal. And who are suspected of being Clinton's secret luggage receivers? Here are a few reportedly to consider: 
For a long time, RAHM EMANUEL was Clinton White House Senior Advisor and top campaign fund-raiser using apparently strong-arm tactics or even blackmail. In a PBS-outlet program, broadcast in Chicago on WTTW-TV, Channel 11, Rahm Emanuel, on-camera, showed how influential he was with Clinton that Rahm's desk was the closest to the Oval Office. Ergo he came to be known as JOSH LYMAN, the character on WEST WING. Intelligence sources contend Rahm Emanuel, in effect, is and has been the reputed Deputy Chief, for NORTH AMERICA, of Israeli Intelligence, the Mossad [The Institute]. And why do some contend that Monica Lewinsky, her parents, and others surrounding Clinton in the sex episode, dealt with a Nazi-like specialty, luring 
someone into a sex "honey pot" and that these are all reportedly Israeli intelligence assets? " "AND, the Mossad has had unholy arrangements with the Red Chinese on nuclear secrets, contradicted by the fact that the 
Red Chinese have supplied Silkworm Missiles to sworn enemies of Israel. After supposedly leaving the Clinton White House, Rahm Emanuel has become a bigshot on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which has reportedly laundered billions of dollars, for Clinton and his handlers and controllers, including Red Chinese and ethnic Chinese [Indonesia] illicit funds from dope trafficking from S.W. China into the U.S.., through Chicago, of "China White", high purity heroin. Also illicit funds from the harvesting of human body parts, on a just-when-needed 
basis from political prisoners, condemned to death when the hearts, liver, lungs, kidneys, etc., are needed by greedy U.S. hospitals. {As a producer/moderator of a public access Cable TV Show in Chicago, I am 
planning a one-hour show on this dirty, bloody business. By the way, the political prisoners are beheaded so as not to damage the body parts. Prominent doctors and hospitals are in this rotten traffic, bought and sold like parts of a car.] " "Rahm Emanuel is no stranger apparently to murder. His father reportedly was part of the assassination team in 1948, that slaughtered U.N. Official, Count Bernadotte, during the Palestine Partition controversy.

                Young, 47, also a deacon at Trinity, was found — shot in the head — by his roommate Sunday morning, Chicago Police said.

                When Young’s roommate came home about 7:30 a.m., he found the door to the apartment in the 2300 block of East 69th unlocked but closed, police said.

                Christmas presents and some jewelry were missing from the apartment, but police have not yet settled on robbery as the motive.

                  Sinclair claims it was in a second call from “Mr. Young” that he began to suspect the man had been sexually intimate with Obama. Sinclair said he drew that conclusion “by the tone of the conversation” and by its “sexual nature.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In late October 2007, Sinclair received a text message from “Mr. Young” stating Young “was intimately involved with Senator Obama and that Obama was discussing with him and his pastor how to publicly acknowledge Senator Obama’s drug use in 1999.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The text message also indicated Obama wanted to make sure Sinclair had not discussed the sexual encounters or drug use with any media at that time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At least that is what the article claims.

                      We are her almost all alone by ourselves here again.  My post on the 4 Missing Girls had over 150 comments all by a few people.  I will have to return the favor.  I always try to hit mostly all posts during the day, you know, to help people out.  I will be very choosy from now on. Taking Names.

               Yes, they do gross things.  I don't know what is worse.  The pedophilia or stealing their organs.  Both.  I struggle to find words for their macabre operations.  Horrid just does't cut it anymore.

                The law means 16- and 17-year-olds can give consent to donate their organs, but for donors below the age of 18, procurement organizations must contact a parent or guardian for approval to harvest the organs or tissue.

                My friend told me she thinks you are automatically now registered as an organ donor and you have to opt out if not wanted.  So they just do it.  I don't know if that is true, I have not looked into it.  Thank you for your links. This must be looked into.  I don't know where everyone was last night.  No one responded or commented on this post except 1 or 2.  I pinged many and only a couple answered.  This site has really been taken over.  Every day I try to get to almost every one's post to give support to all, unless shill post.  I always upvoat and try to comment.  This is what we get for trying to spread the Truth on who is Really Behind PG.  Thank You So Much for Responding!   Please read the entire post if you can.  It is filled with many links on Missing Children of Chicago and Missing Organs.  I will read the links.

                 I can't speak for others, but there were several reasons I did not respond to this thread last night.  It was just before 10:00 p.m., too late for me to research.  But at that time I did read the OP article almost to the end mistaking "CPS" for Child Protective Services, not Chicago Public Schools.  Then, the comments here were about organ harvesting, and I hadn't heard organ harvesting was involved in the tragic death of Kenneka Jenkins, so I decided to save that, and looked up organ harvesting in Chicago schools because I thought I was missing something (that's how I found the links about Jesse White...)  A mess....  But I'm going to read all those links you all posted.

                  I believe they have done this to totally confuse people.  I learned just recently that what is CPS Child Protective Services in other sates, Chicago and other counties use DCFS.  Another Smoke and Mirror Op.  Believe everything they do is carefully thought out.  Nothing is a coincidence.

                   Great catch!   Harvest always basically meant crops, animals, or things for people to eat or use.  If the situation was legitimate, "transfer" would be a better word.

                 I don’t always comment, but I read as much as possible try to upvoat every decent comment. I often save stuff. I read and upvote every post that seems legit.

                 You may not see me for a few posts, but I’m here. Mostly I find that others handle the comments reasonably well, so I only chime in a little. I just downvoat the bullies and bigots, not wasting time arguing with them.

                  Oh yes, I just dv them too they don't deserve our valuable time.  If that is all they have time to do to trash our children and us then let them know that they are wasting their time.  No one really listens to them but their own kind.  Thank You so much.

                 Yes, but think of it.  Do you think they will ever take the time to opt out?  NOpe.  Besides Black Kids will not doubt this guy.  He wears a suit and tie.  Looked up to.  Just like BO.  They have very few Role Models.

               She was here long enough to know the backstory.  You don't hear a peep from her about all the Missing Children in chi town.  No not a peep, after all the support she got from Black Women and the Church Going Ladies.  Their Missing Children and Grand Children.  No Siree.
