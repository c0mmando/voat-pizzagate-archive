<p>May 13, 2019</p>
<p>British police allegedly &quot;concealed&quot; statements in the Madeleine McCann case and impeded a line of inquiry into possible links to an international paedophile ring, according to allegations from the Portuguese detective who led the 2007 investigation.</p>
<p>Speaking in Episode 10 of Maddie, nine.com.au\'s podcast investigation into Madeleine\'s disappearance, Goncalo Amaral made a series of stunning claims in a rare interview with English-speaking media.</p>
<p>Mr Amaral detailed a potential line of inquiry he believed may have helped work out what happened to Madeleine. It involved the possibility of an international paedophile ring that may have had links to people close to, or in contact with, the McCann family, without the McCanns\' knowledge.</p>
<p>[Of course without their knowledge..../s]</p>
<p>He claimed some statements which may have been relevant to that line of inquiry had been initially withheld by British police, who at the time were working in tandem with the Portuguese.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The British authorities tried to conceal the statement and nothing was done about this statement,&quot; Mr Amaral said.</p>
<p>&quot;They were not followed up. Nobody investigated anything related to them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Amaral alleged his team of detectives had asked British police for further information about a potential person of interest but were informed they held &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; of significance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Of course … when the British police stated that they did not have any information, they already had the statements,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So, there is this issue with the British police concealing information that they already had.</p>
<p>&quot;When the statements finally arrived, they came mixed up with other papers,&quot; Mr Amaral alleged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nine.com.au contacted the Leicestershire Police about the claims but was referred to Scotland Yard\'s Operation Grange. A Scotland Yard spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>[Interesting...]</p>
<p>Further details about the explosive allegations from Mr Amaral are detailed in Episode 10 of Maddie, which charted at number 1 in the UK, Australia and New Zealand soon after its March release.</p>
<p>(see link below)</p>
<p>Last weekend nine.com.au reported how Mr Amaral said his team of detectives had been searching for a mystery apartment where they believed Madeleine\'s body could have been temporarily hidden in a freezer.</p>
<p>He said before that line of inquiry could be concluded he was removed from the case in October 2007.</p>
<p>Mr Amaral was replaced after he was quoted in a newspaper criticising British police who were on the ground in Praia da Luz.</p>
<p>Kate and Gerry McCann, both doctors from Rothley, Leicestershire, have strenuously denied they were involved in the disappearance of their daughter.</p>

            Operation Grange is a strange name if you look at the definition. Grange - definition of grange by The Free Dictionary
Search domain www.thefreedictionary.com/grangehttps://www.thefreedictionary.com/grange  2. (Historical Terms) history an outlying farmhouse in which a religious establishment or feudal lord stored crops and tithes in kind.  For those that believe, or wonder if she is still alive, Amaral could be wrong and right. One could be stored in a freezer for a bit without dying. Amoral could also be part of the cover up. We are looking from the extreme outside. Wish we could ask the Podestas.

                 I would agree this is likely, she seemed too much of a high-profile case to be mishandled like that, but what the hell do we know of their intentions? More to the point, Amaral only said it was a lead, &amp; the police intruded. To that end, I can believe.
