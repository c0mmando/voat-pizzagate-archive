<p>Another thing I remember but can\'t find right now was a YT video talking about &quot;The Ants Cult&quot; or something like that when a person over heard their neighbors baby monitor while they where trying to setup their own. Apparently they heard the neighbors systematically abusing there kids. They where reported to the police and the kids where saved but apparently one was supposedly actually an adult. Apparently that was some where in Europe though so it wasn\'t the FBI involved but just seemed to be weird and slightly similar.

<p>Anyways my point is I\'m wondering if once these kids actually escape these trafficking rings do they immediately go to cops, then the FBI takes over? Or is this some crazy coincidence? I don\'t know but the fact that multiple kids come forward and possibly tried to expose pedophile rings and immediately get fucked over seems fishy. Do you guys think they where making it up? </p>

            nothing new here. When the shit went down and my 4 year old son was threatened to be hurt if he talked to me, I was immediately harassed, followed and ALL police or Children's protection services started calling me "A crazy Actor'". Yes, police reports changed, bla bla bla . 24 years later still blacklisted and considered 'crazy' for just wanting to know what had happened to my children sand what Florence Shellen was up to in my absence. Business partner in what was Lionsgate told me to keep my mouth shut about my kids or I was dead.When i found satanic paraphernalia on my farm I didn't even bother going to the police because I knew what the outcome would be. Finally after going to 1st a library and then an occult bookstore did I realize that what I found were objects used in a black mass ceremony. NEVER got one inch of help from anyone regarding this. Just a living hell for years.

             That sucks I'm not try to push violence like some fed faggot, but that's the kind of thing that makes you want to go on a killing spree. It's also why I don't judge murderers unless I'm 100% of the conditions that made them do what they did myself. Makes you wonder how many people in prison where actually just good guys going after bad guys.
