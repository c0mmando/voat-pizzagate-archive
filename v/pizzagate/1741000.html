<p>If you search instagram for photos of Clyde\'s Washington, you stumble across <a href="http://imgur.com/P7eOetJ">this pic</a> of someone who went there and felt the need to express, that he has seen somenthing but not spoken out … Very spooky. This guy seems to promote watches and cars on his channel. The one he wear at Clyde\'s has a skull on it. 
The comments are the triple-six-handsign and the tongue-out-smiley.</p>
<p>Tom Meyer, is the President of Clyde\'s. I feel, his instagram might go black, when we start to search him openly. Therefore <a href="http://archive.is/QHs2V">I archived it here</a>. You can see, Tom likes to paint scary pictures. This, for example, is his piece &quot;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BP2miGvjbCR/?taken-by=thomasmeyerclydes">A walk through D.C</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>And he seems to be known for liking creepy stuff. As you can see <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/lIMFqzoFuo/?taken-by=clydes_restaurant">in this picture on Clyde\'s Instagram</a>. Or <a href="http://archive.is/9BQ22">archieved here</a>. </p>
<p>The comments are making fun about Tom Meyer has had to be there. In the picture you see a king cake. I am not from the US, so I don\'t know if this is a usual thing to celebrate for you, but even if it was, it is a pagan celebration. It comes from the old Saturnalia and was the time where animals and children were sacrificed to Saturn. Somehow, today many people think, it would honour Jesus, but that is just not the case. So, Mardi Gras is a pagan fest and connected to sacrificing children. I don\'t think it is a good thing to stuff a baby into a cake for this day … very much refers to a sacrifice, doesn\'t it?</p>
<p>This picture has not been taking in Washington. It\'s from their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/xg6URsoFjj/?taken-by=clydes_restaurant">Tower Oaks Lodge</a>, somewhere in Maryland. Tell me how you feel about their entrance. </p>
<p>In this gallery you can see some of their art, which they were selling in an online auction. Some of it is really interesting. </p>

There are many strange things about Beckwith. For example, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML0z0nUne0o">this Video</a> of a police officer, who claims to be the reborn James Carrol Beckwith. Beckwith had a lot of influence, he founded the Fine Arts Society and was president of the National Free Art League. One of his most famous pieces is <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Carroll_Beckwith#/media/File:Beckwith_James_Carroll_Portrait_of_Evelyn_Nesbit.jpg">Portrait of Evelyn Nesbit, c. 1901</a>.
For 1900 this is a very scandalizing picture. Even more so today, because 1901 Evelyn Nesbit was 16 years old and the only source of income for her parents. She modelled since she was around 10 years old. When she was 16 years old, 47 year old married man Stanford White took advantage of her. He was known as a sexual predator. She lived with him for some times. 5 years later she shot him openly in a theatre.This whole circle reminds me of thoose we are dealing with in #Pizzagate. An elite, ivolved in exposing girls and pedophilia. </li>

              "excellent predictor of future trouble making", eh? more highly subjective anecdotal suppositions from the crack amateur human trafficking investigators here at pizzagate central. no facts in your retort, as usual. just more of the same. 
if you want to really do some legit anti-trafficking work, go hang out at truck stops along the ohio/indiana turnpike.

            This is a bit off topic and I didn't want to mention it as I thought it was nothing BUT on the show King of Queens there is a chair on the set with Pedo Swirls all over it.  Every morning TBS plays reruns and it was bright as day this morning with Jerry Stiller sitting on it.

            Everyone in New Orleans eats king cakes at Mardi Gras time.  You don't eat the "baby" so it's not that weird.  Usually, whoever gets the baby has to bring the next cake.  Beans were traditionally used, but the FDA banned beans as unsafe a long time ago.  The plastic baby was substituted because they are cheap imports.

            Mardi Gras is the N. American (French) Catholic equivalent of Carnival that is celebrated in Central and South America.  As the name suggests, it is French ("Fat Tuesday").  The King Cake is a Mardi Gras tradition down there.  (I should know, as I was born and raised in Louisiana.)
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Wikipedia cites this history. It's from the website of a large bakery in the New Orleans area that ships king cakes all over the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Mardi Gras or Carnival season officially begins on January 6th or "King's Day" - also known to Christians as the Epiphany. Epiphany comes from a Greek word that means "to show." Bethlehem is where infant Jesus first showed himself to the world. As a symbol of this holy day, a tiny plastic baby is placed inside each King Cake."
           </p>
           <p>
            Carnival historians say the something-in-the-cake tradition started here with a golden bean baked into a cake by the Twelfth Night Revelers on Jan. 6, 1870. The king cake was served to young women, and the one who got the bean was crowned queen. (They still do this, by the way.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole tradition of king cakes came from France, and the king cake included a favor, or feve. Feve means "broad bean" or "charm." Early charms were a bean, painted or wrapped in foil, or a pecan. (Does a pecan represent the Baby Jesus?) Small bisque German-made dolls known as Frozen Charlottes were used as favors for a time and are highly collectible. The king cake doll pendant sold by jeweler Mignon Faget depicts one.
           </p>
           <p>
            New Orleans and the South have other favor traditions that involve foreign objects in food and fortune-telling. Old-line jeweler Adler's sells sterling silver wedding cake favors or pulls to be attached to ribbons and put in or under the wedding cake. Before it's cut, the bride's girlfriends pull them out. The Adler's ones have, for example, a house on one side and "happy home" on the other. (One depicts a thimble and needle and says "old maid" on the reverse.)

              It's a cultural thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I used to work customer service for an online retailer with a warehouse in Louisiana and come January, we (office on west coast) would get daily shipments of King cake. I shit you not, the stack of bakery boxes was six-foot high. From my understanding it was a way to use up all the rich foods (eggs, butter) before Lent kicked in; the additions of figures isn't that unheard of. The Irish have a similar custom, with a sixpence and ring.

               Just a note, you are confusing Fat Tuesday (also called Shrove or Pancake day,) with Epiphany (or King Cake day.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Epiphany is observed on Jan 6, the day the Kings came to visit Jesus. It is celebrated with a cake with a baby in it that represents Jesus showing himself as King. It is also the beginning of the lenten season, but Lent doesn't begin until Ash Wednesday, the day before being Shrove. On Shrove (Fat) Tuesday, everyone eats pancakes to use up all the stuff like sugar and eggs for lent. It's a day of indulgences.
              </p>
              <p>
               And that brings me back to my pancakes = pedo theory.

               alright. I see. But I am one of those christians who is even sceptical about christmas. I feel like those pagan celebrations are a strange kind of symbol, how society never questions its origins and behaviour.

                Skepticism is good. And you're right, many festivals are pagan in origin. It's how the early church got the pagan masses to convert. Hey, you celebrate the 'sun' being born every year in mid-winter? So do we! But we spell it "Son." Same goes for Easter/Ostara; the renewal of spring and the promise of rebirth.

                What gets me (I don't identify as Christian; more of an atheist with Jesuist leanings and a pagan background) is that the Bible specifically states "don't be like the heathens and bring greenery into your house" which is like the whole mainstream western symbol of Christmas; a marriage of pagan and Christian beliefs yielding a cultural norm.

                 exactly what I think! There are plenty more quotes in the bible dealing with pagan rituals and that we should not celebrate them. However, this is the big influence of the church …
