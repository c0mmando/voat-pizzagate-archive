            submission rules do require an explanation of relevance. I don't get how this is pizzagate related...though it is an hilarious marketing ploy. :-)  I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit in your pizzagate thesis. Otherwise, I'll have to remove this per Rule 1.

             Well, feel free to remove. The picture of Romney shows him eating ice cream, and I felt it was self-explanatory that Don Jr knows about Romney. No, it's not research - was only meant to encourage others.

             I haven't posted in the pizzagate sub for awhile; had forgotten about the more strict posting rules.

              If you want to repost this as a research post, you can use links to our research archives on Little Baby Ice Cream (creepy videos) and Unilever's Good Humor brand (exact girl lover pedo logo). You also might want to throw in the recent fact Romney's secret Twitter Alt

               people learn how to post in accord with the rules. You could have easily helped him fix his post, rather than attack him so he won't come back again. Well done.

                 He admitted he forgot we had more stringent submission rules. That happens all the time; it doesn't mean someone has ill intent or is deliberately forum sliding. He is not in danger of a ban, because he's shown no pattern of disrespecting the submission rules. You, of course, know this, because we've discussed this before. You are portraying him in a dishonest manner.

                 You, on the other hand, are getting in the habit of attacking contributors. As I did with ES, Donkey and many, many others who have tried to drive people away, I will call it out.

                 It never makes me mad. Quite the contrary. Whenever people show their true colors, I find it heartening. Truth is liberating.

He's been here since November 2016, but he gets excited and forgets to include a link in a post about Epstein's death and you accuse him of being a forum-sliding shill. You'll notice he hasn't been back since then, and didn't repost with a link after you "shamed him" either.

                      So you calling me a nazi, that's not you being a racist? Or were you just trying to be edgy?

                      You are the one who started calling me names when I asked you a question. A question you didn't answer, by the way.

                     You chose poorly. And yes i think you are mad at me and therefore cannot see clearly. Otherwise what else am i left to think about you constantly defending people you should be excoriating? I defend myself because i have no defenders. I defend PG sub because you are constantly reminding me of how your life is just too busy to bother.

                        Doesn't it bother your conscience that you are driving people away? What if someone you think is a POS because they didn't understand the rules is actually someone with vital information to share, testing the waters before they drop their treasure?  I've conversed with at least a couple of
                        <em>
                         dozen
                        </em>
                        people here over the years who got sideways at the beginning, had a belligerent fit about their submission being removed, and turned out to be someone legit. Several were law enforcement. Several were veterans. Many were survivors or friends of survivors.

                        If you care about the mission of this board, you won't try to drive people you deem unworthy away. It's pretty simple.

                             stop archiving EVERY FUCKING WORD I WRITE.  you make me afraid  to have normal discussions. With ANYONE. Becoming caustic is how i choose to cope. I tell you I'm upset and what is your response. 'Just make and use an alt.' Not once did you address my fear or concerns, did you, Mr. Fippant. Here's the thing, when you abuse and use people, they tend to become abusive. I've stopped posting archives to your sub, maybe you could stop with the spying? That would be super.

                              Have you guys considered that you are both been played by a third party? For someone who is comfortable calling you a nazi, or throwing such buzzwords, surely does not sound like a victim trying to contribute in this subverse. I think you are right in calling them out. Let's not forget that there are accounts built for this purpose, to drive a wedge between people who try to do good to shed some light on evil.

                              For the record, the intent behind selective archiving was to keep words to their mouths. It all started when I saw numerous accounts, such as freshmeat, that were attacking Putt, in such a way that made him felt miserable. So yeah, I felt the pain in him for that moment, when all he wanted to do was to provide a free speech platform; but so much of what he got was brutal attacks. As I have made clear in our private messages, that was part of the reasons for archiving. I further archive some other users' comment history, because it has values worthy of preserving. As you know, I did not consider yours a shill account. That was made clear long ago. Your work of archiving in the background has being precious and important to preserve. I think your contribution deserves more appreciation that is often unnoticed :-).

                              , or anyone else, has asked me to do something with your comments, I can tell you that no one has asked me to do such thing and no one has looked at your comments. If you are so worried about your comments, I think searchvoat is a bigger problem to you. Think about that for a moment.

                              , I think he is also overreacting (you both are very tense at each other). Again, for the user who throws buzzwords around does not sound like a genuine contributor, as

                              would like to believe. And your comment on twos's lawsuit was very funny, even I could spot the joke.

                              I was once abused as a little kid. I chose not to talk about it whatsoever. But if a real victim has built up enough courage or made up his or her mind, that person will sure find ways to tell the story. I do not believe what you are doing will stop them.

                               Yes, I'm an easy target to mess with. My internet age is only 1 yr. older than my Voat age. That's why I stay here, in the trenches, fastest way to learn.

                               I don't care about any of the words I've used being used against me, and I know about SV. I am able to erase both Voat and searchvoat if I choose, can't erase you. (don't want to, just feel trapped) I told you, I'm not mad at you for doing it. I'm outraged that it was done behind my back. I will get over it, thought i was.

                              I don't have a "crowd" SWMBO. It's just me and and Eric here now. You know why? Because when I told Crensch that genuine contributors were afraid of him, he was shocked and immediately offered to step down for the good of the subverse. He was genuinely worried he was having a chilling effect on the research.  It was a humble and gentlemanly act.

                               tell you it was because of that comment? If it was, then bravo for figuring our how to fix own problem without yelling for censorship. But I fail to see a larp. I meant to call out the jew. It needs to be done if we are ever going to get all of them with their dual citizenships deported. If it is the reason, then I am truly sorry for causing the extra work. I am starting to see the pattern you are leaving, let's label swmbo as a shill, along with ES and donqi. That way when you ban me you can keep telling yourself over and over that 'she was just a shill like the others'. You've been doing it for long enough now it is easy to see.

                               Isn't it nice that you get to see a human side of crensch. Too bad he couldn't have learned to be a gentleman sooner. I have degenerated into a snarky bitch when dealing with you and he, not going to argue that point. I was honest from the moment i found out you were archiving me that i didn't like it. Your response to my fear remains the same. Attack me because you refuse to admit that you have hurt me, and you refuse to STOP. some things don't change. I don't know how I'm supposed to react to finding out about things done behind my back, without my permission. It has made me angry for so very long now, I don't even realize it, until forced to think about it. I hate it. I have been singled out and TARGETED by you to have all my words saved, this means I don't get to be a normal user of Voat, you've made that an impossibility for me. You are correct that

                               beiing banned is the straw that broke my back, not much left to keep me donating my time and resources, is there? doesn't change the fact that i have asked you to stop, and you have refused. Sounds just like what a victim of a crime might say, doesn't it?

                               I do not understand what my response to webby has to do with this? I told him what I thought of his threats and big talk on an earlier submission. I really am missing the accusation you're making. For the record, webby should have been banned for the additional doxxing he did on thotfull_criminal. My intentions have never changed, only tried to help where I saw need. You don't need. Our opinions are at opposite poles. I will not stop calling out stupid people, ever.

                                 I don't know how I'm supposed to react to finding out about things done behind my back, without my permission. It has made me angry for so very long now, I don't even realize it, until forced to think about it. I hate it. I have been singled out and TARGETED by you to have all my words saved, this means I don't get to be a normal user of Voat, you've made that an impossibility for me.

                                You take on yourself the heroic task of archiving people's sources, knowing that Media Matters, Podesta's lawyers, JIDF and God knows how many three letter agencies have from the beginning scrutinized this board and use our posts to scrub source material from the internet. You list all that source material under one username where it can be easily archived and viewed. After months of this, when users have grown lazy about archiving their sources themselves and we decide after a DDoS to start backing important things up in case Voat is taken down permanently or you decide to ragequit and delete your account making all those backup source links disappear, THEN you decide you are terrified and "don't get to be a normal Voat user". I call bullshit.

                                are constantly saving other people's speech in case they decide to scrub it, like the VOP videos!  Rampant hypocrisy.

                                You claim you believe in free speech, but the only free speech you are interested in is consequent-free speech. And when you don't get it, when you don't like the consequences, you have a cowardly tantrum and go on a vendetta and justify it all because you're "hurt".

                                 Wow, I forgot to put /s at the end of my response to webby. This is what happens when you look at things out of context, I promise you that webby knows I wasn't issuing an invitation. I am sick of the word heroic being used in association with me and my archives. I make them for my own personal use. I was trying to be generous by posting them, not hero. Once archive has been made there is no reason to have to post them anywhere, as long as they exist, there has never been a good reason to archive my comments. You can twist my words to make yourself feel better about what you've done, i can't stop you, and will never be able to keep up with your typing. I asked to be banned by crensch once, (not by you and not repeatedly) during srayzy departure because i couldn't trust myself to stay out of it if he didn't, i despise that witch for what she has done. I know you probably think this makes me your enemy, i don't care anymore.

                                 I don't know what this means. what VOP videos? I do not archive EVERY SINGLE COMMENT an INNOCENT PERSON makes on a website. I am unable to put words to the emotions this causes. Fear is the only word that comes out. But you've made it clear that it is my own fault for feeling like a victim and that you've done nothing wrong. My point is that since I no longer volunteer my time or resources to the PG sub anymore, maybe you could stop.

                                  Comment freely she, I appreciate all the archiving you did for us and myself in the past and never saw you in a bad light. Although were you calling Howard or myself a fucking boomer? That I admit kind of pissed me off since I try to report on the many aspects of the pizzgate world, including Q since for better or worse. The way I see it is the more people we have redpilling the more exposure we bring to these sick fuckers.

                                    What? Yes I know what boomers are (most are good people. Just ignorant. I had to redpill my own parents and trust me the programming made them fight back.) Second so were you referring to Howard Stern as one? I have admitted Im in my 20s. Shit I used to do video logs for my old YT account thats non pg related called gamepwn.

                                     Stern is a boomer, yes i was refering to him and boomers and jews in that comment. Not you. I have only met a few good boomers in my life. The boomer women are exceptionally gross, with their camel-toes and pounds of make-up. I just threw up in my mouth a little thinking about them.
