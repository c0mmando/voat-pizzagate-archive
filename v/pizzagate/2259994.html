<p>I know this has been discussed previously but I am trying to locate an article wrote in 2011 that caused a popular crime blog to be shut down. Operation Flicker is beyond all doubt Pizzagate related and provides a good example of how people were silenced for trying to spread the truth. </p>
<p>One of the first online blogs I became a member of was a website called The Hinky Meter (www.thehinkymeter.com), which no longer exists. It was ran by an aerospace engineer who went by the mod name Valhall.  Her website was made popular by the Casey Anthony case and she had a way of breaking down to scientific evidence that was easy to understand. </p>
<p>Anyways, I checked her website multiple times a day, ready to read the latest. After the Casey Anthony case was over, she focused on other unsolved crimes and disappearances like Kyron Horman and Haleigh Cummings. She had a large following and in the websleuth type sites was the best, in my opinion. </p>
<p>The direction I’m going with this is last thing she wrote about was titled “Operation Flicker.” It wasn’t long after that her website was shut down and she quit writing. I believe she claimed to have had a breakdown and had to take time away. You can find numerous word press pages with her articles about various cases. The MSM reported on the child pornography ring bust but of course didn’t name people. Well, Valhall did. Many of the pervs were military personnel and security contractors who had government security clearance at every level and most were not punished. </p>
<p>I have searched to find this write up she did on Operation Flicker. But it seems to have been scrubbed from the internet. Below is a quote from a thread on ATS. </p>
<p>“This is the most disgusting of the disgusting... What\'s even more disgusting than the atrocious acts these fiends performed, is the fact the Mainstream Media is keeping the names of those arrested, which is public record, out of their stories.”</p>
<p>“In a case this horrendous it amazes me the names of those arrested, their computers confiscated and found to have TERABYTES of the worst kind of child porn on them are being hidden.“</p>
<p>“Well they\'re not hidden anymore, The Hinky Meter www.thehinkymeter.com, a site with a community devoted to reporting, investigating, and discussing crimes against children in the hope of bringing justice for the kids, has outed almost everyone of the sick, twisted, sub-human scum that were involved in this...”</p>

             Operation Flicker – Child Pornography Found At High Levels of Government
            </p>
            <p>
             03 August, 2016 / in Controversies, Government
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The aim on Operation Flicker was to shut down child pornography on the internet, but in the process, they found that many government and military personnel were viewing and download child pornography on their work computers.  This operation has been kept fairly quiet, for obvious reasons.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The following is a write-up by Voice of America on the government investigation known as “Operation Flicker.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Federal investigators have identified members of the U.S. military and defense contractors who allegedly bought and downloaded child pornography, at times on government computers.  Some of the individuals have high-level security clearances.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The Pentagon released 94 pages of documents related to investigations that date back to 2002. Many names and details are blacked out, but the facts that remain are disturbing.
            </p>
            <p>
             A contractor with top secret clearance, tasked with providing support to the National Security Agency, was charged with possessing child pornography.  Investigators say he tampered with his work computer after agents searched his home.  He fled the country and is believed to be in Libya.  The case is closed until he is arrested and extradited.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             A National Reconnaissance Office contract employee acknowledged he regularly viewed sexually explicit images of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             One sailor admitted to accessing child pornography while stationed on the Naval destroyer U.S.S. Mason.  He was sentenced to nearly four years in prison.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The findings come from a wider investigation conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  That probe, dubbed Operation Flicker, identified more than 5,000 individuals who subscribed to child pornography websites.   An assistant U.S. attorney general requested that the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, under the auspices of the Pentagon’s Inspector General, assist in identifying Pentagon-affiliated individuals.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The above article was written when only the DCIS investigation was released, which is found below. Since then, I have managed to get quite a few more pages declassified, which can also be downloaded here: POSTED IN LINKS ABOVE

             You have to be. There is no limit to what they will do to cover their asses. I do think the tide is slowly changing. 
My mom is a hardcore liberal and wouldn’t hear a word of it when I would try to initiate a conversation about Pedogate this time last year. I dropped it but would bring any big trafficking busts or solid sources to her attention for the last year or so. With all the Hollywood shit going down, people are opening their eyes. I’ve gotten her to look into all the huge trafficking rings busted all over the world involving the elites. I left Pizzagate out of it because liberals still get defensive of Hillary for reasons I can’t understand. But once she starts reading these other cases worldwide, it will lead her back to here. 
She’s pretty hardcore and if she’s considering it then anyone that was on the fence about some of it have to already see what’s been happening.

              OH Brother!  I have this same problem in my family. I nearly shoved them all out on Thanksgiving.  She was tearing down this woman that accused Franken and proceeded to tear her down because she posed for Playboy and had a job on a Conservative Radio Show.  I said it could be that they where seeking someone to come out against him, but I believe the accusations.  I asked her if she was using the "Short Skirt" Excuse, letting him off by blaming the Victim.  There were two accusations and she would not hear of it.  Her husband whispered to me, I am with you, but it falls on Deaf Ears.  I can't wait for Their Take Down.  Oh, The Revenge Will Be Sweet!

               Oh, I cannot wait. It’s coming and it’s gonna be amazing. It is hard for me to understand how people can be so blind because of political affiliations. I could care less if they are conservative or liberal, it’s on both sides and it needs to be exposed. I know exactly what you’re saying, you just want to grab them and shake some sense into em. Lol.

                Actually at this point I just want to shake them!  As far as sense, some people just will never have any.  No matter how educated, some people never see the forest.

            Other federal employees exposed in Operation FLICKER included members of NRO (National Reconnaissance Office), NSA (National Security Agency), National Defense University (NDU), DCMA, local police, serving and retired military members, federal employees of other agencies (at least one CIA contractor was categorized as a civilian contract employee within the Office of the Secretary of Defense), government contractors (like Oracle, DynCorp, Lockheed Martin &amp; MPRI, L-3 Communications and others).    This also mentions the word PedoGate.  Amazing.  Notice DynCorp and Lockheed.  Very Interesting.   Does this help in any way?

             Yes, thank you! I hadn’t seen this article and it has most of the info I had read years ago. How true is this quote?
            </p>
            <p>
             “In this fashion, yet again, the margins of PedoGate as an epidemic are blurred, and the phenomenon is artificially contained. Investigators apparently must set limits somewhere, and the result is that many pedophiles consequently escape investigation and indictment because their misconduct falls outside the arbitrary limits set by such policies.”
