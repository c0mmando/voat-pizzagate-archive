            Yeah I see connection. Just thought it was a funny coincidence there's a child named James (as in James Alefantis) in the book...

            Haven't seen the movie yet but might have to check it out now. Funny how one of the boys is named James! Do we happen to have any connections to pizzagate, clintons and someone named Eamon as well?

            I knew that movie was sick and turned it off as soon as i spent 5 minutes watching it. Its blatantly obvious that it is made by pedophiles
