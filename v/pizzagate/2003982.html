<p>Mrs Biddlebox - another children\'s book  but was written by Linda Smith and illustrated by Marla Frazee. Its about a witch who was so unhappy with the day she went out and twirled up the day like SPAGHETTI (PASTA) and put other things into a pot to make a dough out of it. </p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/thispicturebooklife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/68480019.jpg?resize=570%2C371">https://i2.wp.com/thispicturebooklife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/68480019.jpg?resize=570%2C371</a> </p>
<p>While the dough was cooking  she danced around the oven. After she ate it she was very happy and went to sleep on &quot;NAUGHTY HILL&quot;.  wtf??</p>

            Yeah I see connection. Just thought it was a funny coincidence there's a child named James (as in James Alefantis) in the book...

            Haven't seen the movie yet but might have to check it out now. Funny how one of the boys is named James! Do we happen to have any connections to pizzagate, clintons and someone named Eamon as well?

            I knew that movie was sick and turned it off as soon as i spent 5 minutes watching it. Its blatantly obvious that it is made by pedophiles
