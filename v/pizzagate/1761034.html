<p>In a letter signed by the director of the Governor\'s Office of Youth, Faith and Family and the Arizona Broadcasters Association, Ducey recognizes that large events like the NCAA Final Four &quot;are not the cause of trafficking; however, they provide an important opportunity for the community to coalesce around a common message.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the letter, victims of trafficking are typically U.S. citizens, including adults, girls, boys, and transgender youth. It states that the average age of entry for youth into sex trafficking is 14 and traffickers &quot;often target the most vulnerable,&quot; including runaways, homeless, and youth involved in the child welfare system.</p>
<p>The Office of Youth, Faith and Family said 1 in 3 homeless youth in Arizona identify as being sex trafficking victims.

            For those who do not know, Tucson News Now is MSM because it is the website for the company that owns the local CBS and FOX affiiliates:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Tucson News Now is the Internet home for KOLD, the CBS affiliate in Tucson and KMSB, the FOX affiliate in Tucson.
           </p>
           <p>
            Raycom Media, Inc., which owns KOLD, Sander Operating Co. V LLC d/b/a KMSB Television, and Tucker Operating Co. LLC D/B/A KTTU Television, entered into a Shared Service Agreement, under which KOLD provides news, marketing and engineering services to KMSB/KTTU.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tucson is the 71st largest television market in the United States. KOLD-TV broadcasts the most local news in Southern Arizona - more than 8.5 hours per weekday and more than 47 hours per week.  That total includes news that KOLD provides for KMSB-TV.  KOLD produces a two-hour morning show on KMSB from 7 -9 a.m. and a one-hour daily 9 p.m. newscast."
