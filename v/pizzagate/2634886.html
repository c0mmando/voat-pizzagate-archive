<p>&quot;The Sex-Abuse Scandal That Devastated a Suburban Megachurch
Inside the rise and fall of Sovereign Grace Ministries.&quot;</p>
<p>She went online to find out more about the revolt inside Sovereign Grace Ministries, the religious conglomerate that Covenant Life had grown into. A few years earlier, a pair of disillusioned followers had launched a blog called SGM Survivors. It was like a public square, and an increasingly crowded one at that, where former congregants of Sovereign Grace churches—there were roughly 90 at the time—gathered to vent.</p>
<p>Pam had visited the blog before. But this time, she encountered a whole new narrative. Parents were reporting that their children had been sexually abused by other church members. And they were sharing stories, saying they were mistreated by churches when they spoke up. Until that moment, Pam had no idea there were other families out there just like hers.</p>
<p>SGM churches typically have a lead pastor and a staff of deputy pastors to oversee different spheres of church life. The business has been a family affair. Over the years, many of Mahaney’s friends and relatives have held the upper rungs of power. “People were the best of friends, the closest of friends,” says Brent Detwiler, an early leader.</p>
<p>It\'s so bad there is an active website of survivors that was mentioned in the article. </p>
<p>&quot;SGM Survivors&quot; </p>

<p>One of Larry Nassar\'s former victims Racheal Denhollander speaks about the child sex ring that operated at her local SGM Church. She writes for one of the biggest Christian websites Christianity Today.</p>
<p>&quot;We Need an Independent Investigation of Sovereign Grace Ministries&quot;</p>
<p>Allegations of child sexual abuse and staff cover-up continue to swirl. Let’s set an example for all churches to follow, bringing healing to victims and churches alike.</p>
<p>To put it simply: Sovereign Grace Churches (SGC; formerly Sovereign Grace Ministries) and its individual churches and leaders, present and former, who have been accused of failing to adequately respond to past incidents of child and sexual abuse should submit to a thorough, truly independent investigation.</p>
<p>For six years now—and more intensely in the last few weeks—charges and counter-charges (see links below), accusations and defenses have been conducted in public forums and in the courts, without a satisfactory conclusion. This has left many, many observers bewildered, angry, and deeply suspicious of SGC and these accused churches. What’s worse, these unseemly events reverberate outward, mixing with the #ChurchToo discussion and lingering anger over the Roman Catholic Church abuse scandal. Many now wonder if there has been a habit of covering up and denying child and sexual abuse in evangelical churches in general—if there is something in the evangelical DNA that makes us hesitant to deal with accusations quickly, openly, and truthfully when there is the suspicion of grave sin in our midst.</p>
<p>We call for a fresh and thorough independent investigation not because we believe those accused are guilty of every one of its critics’ charges. We are as bewildered as anyone and simply don’t have enough information to make a confident judgment on the matter.</p>
<p>Time Magazine on it.</p>
<p>&quot;Inside the Investigation into Child Sexual Abuse at Sovereign Grace Ministries&quot;</p>
<p>The February issue of Washingtonian Magazine featured an exposé of long-buried sexual abuse of children in a prominent evangelical church network, Sovereign Grace Ministries. Freelance journalist Tiffany Stanley, a 2015 National Magazine Award finalist, spent 10 months uncovering reports of child rape and molestation in Sovereign Grace churches over the last three decades, particularly in the community of the then-flagship Covenant Life Church in Gaithersburg, Maryland. (Covenant Life is no longer a part of the Sovereign Grace network.)</p>
<p>Her investigation, “The Sex Scandal that Devastated a Suburban Megachurch,” chronicles the inside story of crimes against children in D.C.-area Sovereign Grace churches, explores how church leaders including founder C.J. Mahaney did and did not respond, and recounts how victims’ mothers joined forces to seek justice.</p>
<p>Unlike the hierarchical Catholic Church, evangelical churches often function independently. But their influence is widespread—as Stanley points out, Wayne Grudem, an evangelical theologian at Phoenix Seminary, once described Sovereign Grace Ministries “as an example of the way churches ought to work.”</p>
<p>The church denies it but had a slip up from a Church in Fairfax, Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;Leaders of the Fairfax, Virginia, church accused in the lawsuit have &quot;acknowledged the stories of abuse and issued a tearful apology to the families.... senior pastor Mark Mullery blamed the church’s model of reconciliation. “This resulted in the victim’s family being corrected when they should have been gently cared for as sufferers,” he said, according to the Washingtonian Magazine article.[56]&quot;</p>
<p>Here is a map of every single one of their Churches from their website.</p>

              I don’t know anyone personally who has been raped at a church, although you read it in the news constantly of course. Like I said it was Church of God in two different countries that I grew up in. I think evangelical and Catholic Churches are more cult like. I do know do quite a few women who have been raped in a secular environment, though, partially as babies. I would still never let a priest near any of my kids

            This article talks more about some of the defendants and how they are still being allowed an active leadership role in SGM churches.  Also names a few more that were not on the lawsuit.

            Mark Hoffman-listed in the civil lawsuit for his abuse of Plaintiff Thompson used to moonlight as a clown.  Here is his creepy self description on the website.  I believe he has since been fired from the company.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hi! It's Mark Hoffman, Oops the Clown and Mr. Funnyman.  I have been performing stage shows and doing children's entertainment for 25 years.  When I started I was emceeing, creating and performing skits, giving object lessons and puppet shows for large events up to 600 kids.  About 15 years ago I began doing parties, shows, and corporate events as Oops the Clown or Mr. Funnyman (festive costume, balloon hat, no make-up).  I perform in Northern Virginia, Maryland and DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe I have been given a gift to make people (especially children) laugh. Of the many gifts I have, the one I think that has the most effect on my entertainment is my gift of discernment.   I have a very strong ability to read people, and be able to adjust my style accordingly  Give me a few minutes with most kids and I can win them over, no matter what makes them tick. They will be smiling and maybe even laughing hard by the time our interaction is done.   When I am making a balloon or painting a face, I don't want anyone to walk away with just a balloon in their hand or their face looking cool.  I want them to have had a special experience with someone who they now feel a connection with.  I want them to leave the event or party saying "That was the most fun I have ever had at a party!"
           </p>
           <p>
            About nine years ago, my daughter had open heart surgery at Fairfax Hospital and my wife and I lived there (Ronald McDonald House, how appropriate is that) for 29 days.  About two weeks in, I had to do a party as Oops the Clown that I had scheduled months before. When I returned back to the hospital (in clown), the nurse told me of a nine year old girl on the oncology floor who probably would not survive too much longer.  I went into her room which was somber and I approached her gently, starting up a one way conversation with her.  She was very depressed. Slowly, I engaged her and asked if I could do a trick for her, then another, then a balloon.  When I passed gas with the balloon, she started laughing hard.  I spent some of the most precious minutes of my life laughing and interacting with this sweet little girl.  As I left, she gave me a big hug and thanked me for coming and being her friend.
           </p>
           <p>
            The events where I can connect with another person are my favorite types of events.   It gives me a big rush and it motivates me to get more of that reaction.  So, if you want a balloon or a kid face painted and that's all, call someone who throws on a costume or does those things only to make money.  If you want the kids (and adults) at your event to have their own special moment of laughter and joy, think about having Oops the Clown or Mr. Funnyman come to your event.   Also know that my experience with About Faces is that they strive to bring on only the entertainers like me.  So, if I am not available, check out some of their other fun characters.  Many of them are my friends and mentors."

            Listed as a defendant in the civil lawsuit brought against SGM as a sexual predator, Larry Tomczak has his own ministry and website now.

            He has issued a "bullseye challenge" to other Christians and talks in blog posts about current topics as they relate to Christianity.  In his facebook pictures he looks creepy and clownish and has some pictures of himself with young children.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is active on Twitter and has many YouTube videos including this slightly bizarre one that begins with magazine cut out pictures of babies and his description of them being cute and cuddly.

           </p>
           <p>
            Than goes on to talk about why its hard to make friends when you are narcissistic (and relates it to babies by basically saying they are narcissistic).
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow ok it gets even more bizarre and creepy.  In this youtube video he is wearing a satan mask as he talks about some random stuff in the news. Reminds me of Elsagate videos and the masks used in those.

            Talks about being healthy and staying young.  He seems to have a interest in celebrities, how they age and if they have plastic surgery as he has some other posts on this topic.

            He remains friends on facebook with some of the other defendants listed in the civil suit (Layman, Gallo and Mullery).
            <br/>
            His sexual abuse is detailed on page 37 in the civil suit.  It is alleged that he assaulted a young girl from the time she was 3 until she was 26 years old.  He used his hands as well as sticks and he also physically abused her.  On several occasions he imprisoned her and denied her food, attempted to suffocate her and punched and hit her leaving bruises.

            By the way, research like this is incredibly important for people like myself.  I grew up in the church, all these names and speakers were influential in my life and I am just now starting to realize the corruption.  But I started seriously looking at SGM because my own current church uses their music and some materials.  All of what is found here I will be sharing with my church and entreat them to stop using anything produced from SGM.  Thank you all for contributing.

            Ok its starting to slowly come together.  I don't have time to elaborate much right now but the Gospel Coalition, affiliated with CJ Mahaney and many other prominent evangelicals has ties to Clinton and Soros apparently.  I haven't had time to completely read this article or further explore yet.

             THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ARTICLE : MUST READ!
The article was well researched, and based on my own research, I agree with his conclusions. The Apostle Paul warned that the church would be infiltrated: 
"17From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.
            </p>
            <p>
             18When they came to him, he said, “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I arrived in the province of Asia. 19I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, and in the trials I faced through the plots of the Jews. 20I did not shrink back from declaring anything that was helpful to you as I taught you publicly and from house to house, 21testifying to Jews and Greeks alike about repentance to God and faith in our Lord Jesus.b
            </p>
            <p>
             22And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. 23I only know that in town after town the Holy Spirit warns me that chains and afflictions await me. 24But I consider my life of no value to myself, if only I may finish my course and complete the ministry I have received from the Lord Jesus—the ministry of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.
            </p>
            <p>
             25Now I know that none of you among whom I have preached the kingdom will see my face again. 26Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. 27For I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole will of God.
            </p>
            <p>
             28Keep watch over yourselves and the entire flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God,c which He purchased with His own blood.d 29I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. 30Even from your own number, men will rise up and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them. 31Therefore be alert and remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears."
Acts 20:17-28

             Ligon Duncan mentioned in this article above also spoke at the T4G conference from which CJ Mahaney excused himself as speaker after people began to protest his appearance there.  But Ligon has defended CJ. I will try to post links to all this later.

              Long article details more on Ligon Duncan's connection to Mahaney as well as Mahaney's admittance of blackmailing Larry Tomczak (apparently Justin-Larry's son-had confessed some sin to Mahaney and he later used it against them).

             Sadly that is an accurate description of many many churches today. However, the Bible offers remedy for ignorance: 
James 1:5 
"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
            </p>
            <p>
             I am beginning to see a Spiritual Awakening. I think the exposure of Pizzagate is part of it. Jesus always defended widows and orphans - children.

            Steven Furtick of "Elevation Church" is also a pedophile.  He invited Norm Vigue (convicted pedophile) to be celebrated after his conviction.  Furtick has said some creepy things about children in the past.  Furtick also has frequently put on the red shoes that signify a child molester in symbology.  The orange pyramid is a freemason symbol that his place uses.  He is part of the prosperity false gospel that someone above was talking about.  He is a false teacher and is on the inside with police and entertainment figures.  The real Jesus rejects these criminals like Furtick.

            This is a very good topic, however, your title does not appear to be accurate. I could not find evidence in your links that "Mega Church is running a pedophile ring."  The accusations and lawsuits appear to be regarding individual incidents of sexual assault by some church members on other church members, some of the guilty even appeared to be minors. The big problem was how the pastors handled the situation. The desire of church leaders to keep rape incidents out of the news and courts is real. However, from what I read, the motive was not to cover up an active "pedo ring".  Please post pertinent quotes if I am wrong about this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think parents should go straight to authorities if their child tells them they have been assaulted, or worse. Parents really need to wake up and realize that this is a major cultural problem that has been allowed to be brought into the church. Even Jesus showed tough love to the money changers in the Temple and drove them out with whips! We are the first line of defense for our children. Check out leaders in the church, especially those who work with youth, just as in any other situation. No spend the night parties. No cell phone till they're 16. Do not let a youth leader have access to your child's facebook, instagram, etc. Helicopter parenting can be good. Well supervised daytime group activities are fine. I always told my kids to never allow themselves to be alone with an adult at church. If someone tries anything, start screaming. If you have a strong relationship with your children, they are not easily taken advantage of by predators. If you were foolish enough to marry a pedo, SHAME ON YOU.

            Someone who is a better investigator than I should look into the money, follow the money.  CJ had a huge following and nearly 100 churches at one point.  I believe Morales conviction and the civil lawsuit is merely the tip of the iceberg..,

            Sovereign Grace is Calvinist I believe?  The civil lawsuit details sound disturbingly similar to elements of pizzagate, sleepovers at a church members house in which children would be brought out and gang raped by men wearing masks, tied down, physically abused, etc.  It was so much more than one individual who was caught.

               Thanks! I had not read that when I made the above post. The civil suit accusations are sickening. It does not appear to be fiction- it fits a pedophile pattern. Of course, Jesus had the strongest words for monsters like this: "It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones." Luke 17:2 
The modern church has become very weak, ignorant, and worldly...the wolves in sheep's clothing are flooding in.
              </p>

               The civil suit PDF should continually be put out there for all to see. It's time to clean house.

            Covenant life church was in the Sovereign Grace Ministries network. This is the only conviction I know of that came out of the scandal.  There should have been many more so how is this church/group/organization protected?

             :  "Judge Burrell found that any conspiracy to cover-up should have been brought within the time frame of the alleged abuse. Therefore, all of the claims by the Maryland plaintiffs were dismissed in May 2013 because the statute of limitations had expired, 3 years after each turned 18; the claims by two Virginia plaintiffs were still within the statute of limitations.[47] An appeal of the lower court's decision was heard by the Maryland appellate court in May 2014, and the lawsuit was again dismissed when the court found that the Plaintiff's attorney had filed the appeal too early. Maryland's highest civil court, the Court of Appeals, denied certiorari on September 24, 2014, permanently ending the case.[48] [49]

             All charges brought by the Maryland plaintiffs were dismissed with prejudice by Maryland Circuit Judge Sharon Burrell, permanently barring plaintiffs from ever bringing those or related charges in Maryland civil court again at any time in the future. During the hearing, Judge Burrell referred to an affidavit filed by Brent Detwiler supporting the claims of the plaintiffs as "vague and irrelevant". The court also found that the "Covenant Life School" sued by the plaintiffs did not exist during the time frame of the alleged abuse.[50][51]

             As reported in Time Magazine (February 2016), Susan Burke, the lawyer for the victims, plans to file another lawsuit in Virginia, involving the two individuals from that jurisdiction.[52] As of January 2018, two years later, no such lawsuit has been filed."
