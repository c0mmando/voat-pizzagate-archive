<h1>Media Matters for America</h1>
<p>Media Matters for America (MMfA), a non-profit media &quot;watchdog&quot; organization for the United States Democratic National Party, is David Brock\'s most famous organization. Founded in 2004, the official mission of Media Matters is to oversee the Republican Party\'s presence in the media and attempt to counteract this through a variety of means.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America">(1)</a> George Soros has been the chief financial backer for Media Matters since at least 2010.</p>
<p>On the surface Media Matters uses YouTube, blogs and social media to attack and discredit their opponents. Behind the scenes, however, they admit to actively blackballing their opponents from press outlets and having successfully done so in the past in the case of Rodger Stone, as was discovered by Project Veritas.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=705Os-3YOoc">(2)</a></p>
<p>Media Matters continues to function to this day, but many have considered its role to be increasingly less significant when compared to the more recently formed Correct the Record and Shareblue.</p>
<h1>Correct the Record</h1>
<p>Correct the Record (CTR) is a &quot;SuperPAC&quot; founded by David Brock to support Hillary Clinton\'s 2016 Presidential Campaign. CTR would spend $1 million USD find and confront social media users who posted unflattering messages about Clinton and paid anonymous tipsters for unflattering scoops about Donald Trump, including audio and video recordings and internal documents. The organization\'s president, Brad Woodhouse, said they had:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>about a dozen people engaged in [producing] nothing but positive content on Hillary Clinton...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correct_the_Record">Wikipedia</a> </p>
<p>All in all CTR would spend around $10 million USD in total on the 2016 campaign according to Open Secrets.<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?cycle=2016&amp;strID=C00578997">(3)</a> All of this would go towards &quot;correcting&quot; Redditors as well as members of Twitter and other social media. CTR can be found in countless Reddit threads, investigations and moderator oversights as having been involved in major censorship on subreddits such as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and more. They even have an entire subreddit dedicated to correcting CTR themselves, known as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRecordCorrected/">/r/TheRecordCorrected</a>.</p>
<p>On that note, CTR may have been one of the primary instigators for the eventual banning of the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Operation_Berenstain">/r/Operation_Berenstain</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/CitizenInvestigators">/r/CitizenInvestigators</a> subreddits. David Brock was conveniently and intimately associated with all of the key individuals initially involved in this scandal: John Podesta, James Alefantis and Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>David Brock\'s connections through Shareblue, from Zero Hedge</p>
<p>Shareblue is one of Brock\'s lesser known, but more nefariously-connected web-based groups. Shareblue and its owning corporation, True Blue Media LLC (also owned by Brock),  run a website for producing videos and investigative reports in political opposition to President Donald J. Trump.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareblue">(4)</a> Many then rightfully consider Shareblue to be an extension of Correct the Record, whose official mission would have ended with Hillary Clinton\'s loss of the 2016 Presidential election.</p>
<p>Investigative reporters at Zero Hedge would find substantial evidence that Shareblue, and in particular True Blue CEO and ex-Clinton staffer Peter Daou,  worked alongside the Chinese government, the City of London, Mexico, Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Clinton Foundation and other Middle Eastern Groups to subvert American politics and promote censorship.<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-27/democrat-propaganda-group-shareblue-has-ties-chinese-government-host-foreign-special">(5)</a></p>
<p>Chinese Tycoon Ke Xiping and the Chinese government bought influence in Shareblue and concealed the purchase as a mining deal. Employees of Shareblue also have strong ties to the PeaceWorks Foundation, which is run by Mexican billionaire Daniel Lubetzky.<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-27/democrat-propaganda-group-shareblue-has-ties-chinese-government-host-foreign-special">(6)</a></p>
<p>Independent researchers have also discovered a large number of Twitter and other social media accounts associated with Shareblue. The exact purpose of all these accounts is unknown, but it seems to be a personal social media brigade run by Shareblue.<a href="http://archive.is/ykYZ2">(7)</a></p>',

            Pretty sure CTR should lose all non-profit status, at the very least. At one point during the election the group mass-trolled Bernie Facebook groups and posted pornography including that of children to those groups which got groups shut down. Disgusting. Link to one article about that

            ..." - This tragedy (Kevin Bell) has reverberations in the powerful political circle of David Brock and ShareBlue...Arrowgrass Capital Partners LLP is intrinsically linked through Partner Michael Edward, whose is a board member for "Third Way", a Globalist Think Tank.
           </p>
           <p>
            Third Way is an active partner with David Brock and Shareblue, and was featured prominently in Politico's February 24, 2017 article detailing Brock's January conference meeting:
Michael Edwards
            <a href="https://archive.is/sZMhm">
             https://archive.is/sZMhm
            </a>
            "Mike Edwards is a Partner at Arrowgrass Capital Partners where he serves as Head of the firm’s US business, member of the Executive Committee, and Head of Global Event Driven Strategies. Prior to joining Arrowgrass as a Partner in 2010, he spent six years at D.E. Shaw &amp; Co as a Portfolio Manager in Global Special Situations. Mike co-managed D. E. Shaw's Risk Arbitrage and Event Driven sub-strategies and oversaw its Pan-Asian Special Situations business. He began his career as an M&amp;A banker in Credit Suisse First Boston's Technology Group in San Francisco, where he advised on a broad array of transactions with a particular focus on cross-border situations."
           </p>
           <p>
            Another notable Third Way name: Ronald Klain: joined Third Way’s board in 2011, with co-founder and President Jonathan Cowan
           </p>
           <p>
            Klain was portrayed by Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey in HBO’s 2008 film ‘RECOUNT.  Also he became Obama's Ebola Czar,

            an appointment highly criticized by Sen. John McCain, but supported by Sen. John Casey (D-PA)  Klain was on the Third Way board of Trustees but his name was removed from the Third Way Website: "The Free Beacon reported Friday on Klain’s status as a trustee for Third Way, and his past experience lobbying on behalf of a drug company that was accused of denying life-saving drugs to dying cancer patients."
