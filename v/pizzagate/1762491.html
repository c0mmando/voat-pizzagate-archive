            He probably is protected.  Garza is a crypto-Jewish surname, so the man is Jewish and very well may be a Freemason.  If he is, the judge will protect his "brother" and likely just slap him on the wrist.  We see this time and time again, unfortunately.

             I am glad you raise the Freemason issue, because you are exactly right.  I am convinced the people we are dealing with in the DC area are all Masons, and that is why nothing every gets done.  They take an oath to protect each other no matter what, especially against outsiders.

            The underground compound won't be available until 2018, so I don't see the connection here.  (Both stories take place in expensive Dallas, but Dallas is a big city.)

             I do not believe every word on that site, do you? Maybe they had to say something like that because people were getting suspicious.

             Trident Lakes is obviously not for the whole population of Dallas, just the elite.

             It's a symbol of Satan's scepter, used by many in the occult.

             You could also make the connection with the forks shown in cannibal art, like in the painting in John Podesta's office.

             Yes.  It's the Trident spear of Poseidon-Neptune, sometimes represented by the numeral 3.

            This has been rumored to be true. That these underground bunkers are in for elite. Garantee you this must be already operating for military. Going underground and having your own police force with tunnels is literally the "devils playground"

             Yeah, they say that, but they already have a thousand plus "waiting list"--and that some areas, above ground, are open to the public. It's like the Scientology underground camp--they are not going to tell the truth about it.
