<p><strong>RELEVANCE:</strong> On March 11th 2005, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney grilled Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers on the DynCorp child sex trafficking case.   <a href="https://youtu.be/xTJe3F9zmvg">#Pedogate Dyncorp Child Trafficking as Rep. Cythia Mckinney grills Donald Rumsfeld</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TRANSCIPT: “Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade. </p>
<p>“The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business. But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children. </p>
<p><strong>“While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax vaccines, and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program. Mr. Secretary, is it the policy of the U.S. Government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?”</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As Dyncorp is one again in the news because of the Feinberg appointment, this post looks at the connections between the Alefantis family, the complex biotech world of vaccine companies, accusations of military human experimentation, the US company Dyncorp and the UK company Porton Down.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Tim Alefantis, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1460709/7060326">cousin of James Alefantis,</a> is a senior scientist at Sanofi Pasteur</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pharmavoice.com/article/2016-06-flu-vaccine/">Tim Alefantis, Ph.D., Sanofi Pasteur and Sam Lee, Ph.D., Project Strategy for Sanofi Pasteur</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim Alefantis, Ph.D., Sanofi Pasteur’s R&amp;D lead on the second-generation vaccine program, and Sam Lee, Ph.D., project strategy for Sanofi Pasteur’s pandemic and new influenza vaccines, talk about the company’s work to develop a broadly effective influenza vaccine. </p>
<p>Sanofi Pasteur is conducting preclinical research that could lead to a flu vaccine with broader protection. In March, Sanofi Pasteur announced publication of data in the Journal of Virology on a vaccine strategy that elicited a broadly reactive response against seasonal and pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses in mice. The company, along with researchers at the University of Georgia, is working on a vaccine to protect against multiple different strains of H1N1 virus at once. </p>
<p>The H1N1 influenza virus caused a worldwide pandemic in 2009. When it was first detected, it was called swine flu because the virus came from pigs, but the virus now circulates in humans as a seasonal form of influenza. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here\'s a Steemit article on the possible origins of the H1N1 virus <a href="https://steemit.com/news/">https://steemit.com/news/</a>@v4vapid/the-vaccine-industry-the-cdc-you-and-me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR; It appears that DynPort (DVC), Baxter pharma and the National Institute of Health (NIH) may have colluded to create H1N1, develop a vaccine for H1N1 and ultimately profit from demand for the vaccine generated by the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu. </p>
<p>Today, as if on cue, I came across this article by Jon Rappoport Robert F Kennedy’s Devastating Quotes On Vaccines And The CDC
I highly recommend reading this article and what Robert Kennedy Jr. says about the CDC and allegations of corruption within the agency.</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“CDC is not an independent agency. It is a vaccine company. CDC owns over twenty vaccine patents. It sells about $4.6 billion of vaccines every year. And its primary metric for success in all the departments in the agency are vaccine sales. The groups, for example the Immunization Safety Office, where the scientists who are supposed to be looking at efficacy and safety in vaccines, they are no longer a public service…agency. They are subsumed in that metric: We have to sell as many of these things as possible. And so they do things to their science to make sure that nothing interferes—no information—interferes with sales.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And from another article by the same author: <a href="https://steemit.com/pedogate/">https://steemit.com/pedogate/</a>@v4vapid/dyncorp-vaccinations-and-me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Officially, Dyncorp is no longer in the business of researching and developing vaccines because it sold their subsidiary to another company CSC in 2003 and 2004.</p>
<p>In the not so distant past, Dyncorp created a joint venture with Porton International (UK) that became DynPort, later known as DVC (Dynport Vaccine Company LLC). Here is a brief history of DVC ownership from 1997 to 2017.</p>
<p>Today Dynport is owned by CSRA. CSRA headquarters is located about a 10 minute drive from Dyncorp International headquarters. Curiously enough, Dyncorp\'s parent company Delta Tucker Holdings LLC is literally next door to CSRA in Falls Church, Virginia. </p>
<p>For those familiar with Dyncorp, it will come as no surprise that Dynport focussed on developing technologies for the military working closely with government agencies such as the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Institute of Health (NIH) on vaccinations concerned with ‘biodefence’. </p>
<p>Before teaming up with Dyncorp, Porton (UK) had created a US branch of their company know as BioPort. In the 1990s it had become one of a small minority of companies with the ability to produce an anthrax vaccine. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend reading the whole article...it goes on to sarin gas use in Syria...</p>
<p>More about the anthrax vaccine scandal from a mainstream news outlet: <a href="https://www.salon.com/2001/10/15/anthrax_vaccine/">https://www.salon.com/2001/10/15/anthrax_vaccine/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>After three years of getting bailed out by the Defense Department, <strong>BioPort</strong> could be poised to make a fortune -- as its CEO Fuad El-Hibri did working with the British seller of anthrax vaccine, Porton International, during the Gulf War a decade ago.  </p>
<p>The mania for privatization in Margaret Thatcher\'s England made it a great place for entrepreneurs like El-Hibri. In the 1980s, an El-Hibri acquaintance named Zsolt Harsyani, an American Ph.D. in genetics who had spearheaded an early report on biotechnology for the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment, became involved in what would become in its time the largest private biotechnology firm in the world, Porton International. Porton got the rights to sell vaccines and other products developed by the U.K.-government run laboratory, the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR), on commercial markets. CAMR had done the early research into products like botulinum toxin, or botox, a bacterium that can be injected to stop spasms (as well as prevent wrinkles, its most popular use in the U.S., at least until now) and anthrax vaccine. </p>

<p>This seems like an appropriate point to re-post a thread on the links between Porton Down&lt; Biopharma and the ICMEC : <a href="https://www.voat.co/v/pizzagate/2517949">Oil and gas executives, big pharma and bankers on the boards of children\'s charities.

              I do what I do, and you do what you do, but you have been putting out the real deal. I put in 30 minutes a day? I have multiple day jobs that somehow overlap into the time that I am not supposed to be working. Thank you, sincerely, for what you have already done.

            A few years ago, the second of two best friends I was close to, died. They both died, about 4 years apart, of Lou Gehrigs disease. There are many types of that disease and the technical form called Lou Gehrigs is actually quite uncommon. I found it interesting that these two best friends had one big thing in common. They enlisted in the military together and stood in line one in front of the other as they received all of their vaccinations. I contacted the Lou Gehrigs research association (I forget what it is called) and told them about this. Their immediate answer was 'no connection.' Now, how could they know this without even giving it time to consider the possibility? Why would they act as if there were no chance? Two men who had been healthy their whole lives until LG hit. I still don't think it is coincidence.

             That's terrible! The vaccines definitely could have been the cause and its bs that not only is this done to our military, but they continue to lie and cover it up!

             Chickenpox vaccine caused people to develop shingles. Given by the military, so it must be safe. Now they invented a new shingles vaccine for people over 50. Recommended for those stupid enough to take it. Country folk recognize when the kids get it, and they invite all the other kids over to get it like a kids party. The young immune system takes over, and you never get it again, unless you were too weak to live anyways. Tie mittens to their hands so they don't scratch and turn the thermostat to a cooler temperature if you have one.

            Interesting, cousin huh. I KNOW that the etymology of the Alefantis name pretty much precludes any doubt that they are cousins but do we know that for sure? Quite circumstantial anywhichway because this thread simply proves that these people all move in the same circles. This thread is the perfect template on how the elite look at death and destruction simply as a business to be capitalized upon and profit is micromanaged. They start a war and see OBVIOUS runoff in the form of orphaned children, so what do they do with the runoff, let it go to waste or profit from it? So they farm children out to perverts ,occultists and biotech while the other half figures out ways to kill half of us off prematurely (while stil making a profit). It REALLY goes to show what SEEDY NASTY BULLSHIT RISES TO THE TOP OF THIS SATANIC FUCKWAD "CIVILIZATION".

             /Not only trafficking them in from other places.  I believe they are taking organs from children that are shot or killed for whatever reason in all large cities.  LA NYC and Chicago.  How many of those kid's parents have the money for an autopsy or fighting anything they may suspect.  They can'g even bury them properly.  When those kids are shot how do those parents REALLY know how they died.  When an elite is waiting for an organ who do you think becomes more important.

             required the inoculation of all military members,[1][2] despite the fact that the FDA issued a Warning Letter to the anthrax vaccine manufacturer threatening to revoke its product licenses unless immediate action was taken to correct deficiencies on March 11, 1997 (see Appendix 6).[3] In June 2001, the DoD halted vaccination due to non-FDA approved changes in BioPort's manufacturing process....

             It all goes back to certain British families. Remember the Orangemen lodge was not about Protestants and Catholics but about English control. Togo, USA, and possibly Canada branches, and started in Northern Ireland with the further invasion of Ireland. Togo is the nexus of the slave coast.

               here is transcript of one of episodes talking about that
              </a>
             </p>
             <pre><code>So they took the mutation of these genes of all these mutated creatures, 
and then started mutating them even more, more, more and more.

And then they became so mutated that the cells were actually dying too quickly.

And they were able to add proteins to them to re-animate the body, even though it was brain dead.

David: So this is similar to the concept of the zombie.

             <p>
              or
             </p>
             <pre><code>
David: So how does “Resident Evil” play into this? I mean, it's a large movie series.
 There's like nine of them or something.

Emery: Well, you have the Cabal. I mean, it's a perfect description of a Cabal.

David: There's this umbrella corporation.

Emery: Yeah, this corporation umbrella. 

And they basically were a regenerative medicine corporation, 
if you read actually the storybook of whoever wrote it.

And what they were doing is trying to regenerate cells for face creams. 
So it's a great storyline because a lot of these big pharma corporations are behind it . . . of a lot of these things.

So this medicine actually went bad and started actually destroying the skin cells, 
but it also re-animated them at the same time. So it was really new.

It was kind of like destroying, dying, killing, dying . . .
 because you want to kill your skin cells so that they grow back faster.

So it was a great concept.

And the thing was they had an underground base somewhere in the United States of America, 
which was very realistic.

David: In the movie.

Emery: In the movie, which was very realistic.

David: And that's the Hive, right?

Emery: Yeah, the Hive.

            You should triangulate minor H1N1 outbreaks with global elections, that's how I figured out that the 2010 Ukrainian Swine Flu outbreak was possibly a setup to pressure the Yanukovych gov (who manafort was helping get elected).
           </p>
           <p>
            IMO the UK/US did not cover their tracks in the latest round of bioweapons. You also have to think in terms of these shadow groups using the whole body, they are too smart not to use organs, blood etc after they're done.

             That's sourced from animals though. Cows, I think. Testing could be done with it, but I would suspect, it must come from humans for the best, or most potent or whatever. Otherwise more people would know about it. Shit we know about all the weird drugs Shulgin made even though the majority never got to market. Something like the adrenochrome Thompson talked about would have to be kept secret.
