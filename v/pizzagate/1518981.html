             A website named Child Development Institute has an article called

             Apparently there's a spiral on the site somewhere, but I can't for the life of me find it.

            JonBenet Ramsey: "The Last Bulb of the Christmas Tree"
           </p>
           <p>
            JonBenet was murdered on Christmas Eve. A sacrificial ritual for this date is called "The Last Bulb of the Christmas Tree".
           </p>
           <p>
            "Greenbaum" (Christmas Tree) means green tree and relates to the Cabalistic Tree of Life.

            I know I shouldn't even go down this rabbit hole but while watching a recent interview on TV with John Mark Karr, he insinuated that he was at JonBenets' and that he was able to get to her through someone that basically was able to get to any of these kids that performed, and was brought to her home, by an acquaintance of this person. So from what he seems to elaborate on, and most people agree is that Michael Helgoth was the actual killer. So on a sick intuition, I started to look into who could have helped these two, I began my search with Michael Helgoth, and Helgoth family which BTW was very strange he lived with his Aunt and Uncle in Bolder. So I began to investigate others in the Helgoth family or with that last name, I do know his birth records are a little shady...no one applied for a birth certificate until he went to school, it seems that both his half sisters lived very short lives like he did(he committed suicide 1 month after the JonB murder), seems like the family lives in Co &amp; Nebraska(Franklin Cover-up)....But then I run across 1 person with the Helgoth last name that just so happens to be a casting director in LA..

            Moving into producing and directing, Steve has directed over 150 NY off- off-Broadway plays, and several Los Angeles Productions as well as serving as the artistic director for several NYC theater companies. These included the Sanford Meisner Theater and the Vortex Theater Company. His former production company Steppin Out Productions produced the long-running show Dressing Room Divas in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since coming to Los Angeles, he has continued producing theater with such acclaimed shows as Driving While Black in Beverly Hills, Marmalade Skies, at the Matrix Theater and **The Caine Mutiny Court Martial at the Tamarind Theater.

 Always expanding his horizons, he formed Helgoth and Associates Casting in 1998 and quickly garnered such festival hits as West Bank Story (which won numerous awards both in Sundance, and an Academy Award. Close Call and Lost Lake, both which were distributed by Warner Brothers and Are You Scared distributed by Lions Gate as well as many others.

            I haven't yet been able to place them as to being kin, because Stevens data seems to have been wiped out of the database I use to do my research, but from my years in genealogy research, it seems like they might be of some relation. Just a hunch....Did JonBenets mother try to advance her career by giving access to these people, knowing he could make her famous? I just had to get it off my mind...and into the world incase anyone else may be able to actually connect them.

            Looking at so-called "reality TV" of late, there's no end to the lengths those trying to legitimize their perversion by sexualization of children will go.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oddly enough, an article from the MSM from a few years back seems to question things in the right way, and points out that child "beauty pageants" were banned in France.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/22/beauty-pageants-children--ban/2842431/">
             http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/22/beauty-pageants-children--ban/2842431/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            To that end, we still have a
            <em>
             Toddlers and Tiaras
            </em>
            show running now, and there's no end of the same type of show on TLC and other "lifestyle" cable channels.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/little-miss-atlanta-tlc-announces-african-american-pageant-series/">
             http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/little-miss-atlanta-tlc-announces-african-american-pageant-series/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Granted there may be a legitimate market for other types of "reality TV" shows like
            <em>
             Dance Moms
            </em>
            , the premise is still the same, create a competitive environment where a parent can project on their offspring often unrealistic adult competitive values, often by using "who dares wins" mentality to push boundaries of decency and skewing morality to achieve a goal. The end result is a child growing up with a warped world-view.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doing a search on the damage that "little miss" pageants can do, and the fact that MSM themselves have covered this story on more than one occasion, and my finding above that such events are banned in France, just proves my point.

            It's amazing... they'll go after the greyhound racing industry in Australia, over concerns for the quality of life offered to the rabbits and dogs...
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet, child beauty pageants are still a thing? (Not sure if any go on in Australia, but my point stands)
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedos or not, child pageantry is an industry that should have been shut down long ago.

               I believe there are some double meanings present in the article on "striving against double consciousness." The references to the Santa Fe Indian School and Alaska Native Heritage Center sound like Gnostic references.
              </p>
              <p>
               To be clear, I don't think it's related to abusing kids. Probably secret society stuff.

            Met a child pageant girl all grown up, after she was raped for years by a sibling, even impregnated by him, and her parents made her keep the child, which they later took away..... Of course big-brother was protected, given an ultimatum and a career, has a family/wife &amp; children, and a nephew/son that doesn't know the real story. Pageant girl/victim had a hard time adjusting, couldn't handle the abuse, the cover-up, and being forced to live with the same parents who allowed the abuse to happen by their own incompetence.... Of course her natural reaction to the circumstances was to become "mentally ill" on some levels, which she was but it was more of a natural reaction to the circumstances than anything.... They drugged her, used her "mental illness" as a way to cover their sins, made her totally codependent on them and their money, and dominated her life well into her 30's............
           </p>
           <p>
            She was still a beautiful person when I met her, still had a good heart, was a little bi-polar and tormented by her overbearing father/abuser {sorry dad, you allowed for the conditions you're just as much the abuser whether you touched her directly or not}, but the damage done to that girl.... And the kicker was the government
            <strong>
             KNEW
            </strong>
            , her dad was in the military, her brother was offered a career in the military, which he took, but her son just thought of her as a "Sorry whore", which he called her a few times in front of me, who didn't know who her father was................... They actually convinced the boy her mom was just promiscuous........ Which wasn't that hard I guess, the birth-defects weren't that serious.....
           </p>
           <p>
            I still can't think of any person or persons I've ever personally known of needing shot in the head anymore than certain members of her family..... And the ranking military personnel who allowed her brother to get away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            &amp; for that and so many other reasons, I've got to unsubscribe to this subverse, it's just pissing me off. Nothing is going to change things, the sick shit is just going to keep going on, predators will continue being protected, parents will continue failing, and victims will continue paying the price.

             With stuff like the Franklin coverup, Jimmy Saville, Jeffrey Epstein, and Dennis Hastert, I think pizzagate is just the tip of the iceberg into what these sick elites have been up to for decades.

               The comic was what made me more aware of my surroundings and observe these sorts of things in how children interact with adults.
               <br/>
               These observations have been very helpful, which is why I encourage more people to become aware of the telltales

            The weirdest thing to me has always been the use of blush on the little girls in the pageants.
           </p>
           <p>
            Blush was invented to make a women's face look like she was blushing, to imitate the affects on a woman's face of being sexually aroused.

            Putting that kind of makeup on a kid is completely fucked.

             Consider. Historically the age of consent or age of maturation was linked to menstruation and childbearing, which can vary, and surprisingly young girls really can blush from arousal. In the UK that's Friday night.

             I'll spare u further rant but the sexualization of younger kids is more a result of the pill and abortion and welfare etc enabling consequence free sex. In fact if anything that Marxist achievement has enabled pizzagate: most people i have told about it seemed bemused, basically saying that true or not its the cops job not ours. They ask why I care so much more than about evidence.  This is probably due to media conditioning, ie absence of coverage of increase in abduction/cp activity ince the internet made it profitable

              women on birth control are very similar in hormonal balance to children. a lot of you people don't stop to think before you condemn. birth control very likely does have correlation to this as people are conditioned to sexually desire infertile women.

               How so? I don't think kids have enormous amounts of estrogen and progesterone in their bodies. The pill is designed to increase those hormones to simulate pregnancy.

              It has absolutely nothing, in any way, to do with the pill and abortion. It's about sickos that are demonized, or people who want to blackmail those with power.

               Lol those are the sacred cows of the only people in society attempting to destigmatize pedophilia, but the two couldnt possibly be connected as a broader ideological campaign? I would have thought an empty head revealed an open mind but here you guys are

            When did the point of kiddie pageants become making them appear like drag queens or paved over porn stars? They're obviously being whored out for marketing cosmetics.

             I have a feeling the pageants are a menu. Or maybe in order to win you have to let the guy in charge have a pizza party with your daughter. "I'll make your daughter a star. Just drop her her off at my place and come pick her up in the morning."

              The whole culture is cancer marketing cancer.. parents are vicarious whores, inbred losers pimping their kids for corporate marketing and perversion.

              Honey fucking booboo.. funny how they made an industry around that eh. What should be shamed and shunned was instead glorified and normalized. With her fucking go drank.

              For sale or not.. they're mocking the livestock dressing them like clowns. That shit is not even remotely attractive on a gorgeous adult woman who would not need it in the first place. It's a cosmetics marketing engine to hook them on their shortcomings while young and most vulnerable.

                The amount of toxic, harmful chemicals in make-up products that absorb right into your body is absolutely horrific but people have been so brainwashed to not notice or care.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is why I switched to making my own homemade, organic makeup... it looks identical to and absolutely no different than the toxic stuff,  - but without the horrid chemicals seeping into your body.
               </p>
               <p>
                The toxicity of that shit likely affects a child 100x more seeing as their brain, body and organs are still developing. It's awful that adults think nothing putting that shit on their face for hours every day - and absolutely horrid that they'd think nothing of putting that shit on a child.....
