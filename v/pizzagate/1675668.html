<p><strong>Happy 4th of July, BOGO $5, Random Acts of Pizza and more</strong></p>
<p><em>Excerpt</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My favorite project this week has been Random 
For Email Marketing you Acts of Pizza, a pay-a-pizza forward concept 
can trust hosted by Reddit.com designed to bring 
sustenance and joy to people when they are 
Locations down and out. <strong>You know that feeling you get 
Campus when you open your pizza box?</strong> <em>We want 
2324 Guadalupe everyone to feel that, especially if they have 
been eating Ramen for a week. Pizza brings 
Central love.</em> You can see it in the faces of the 
3637 Far West Blvd. people who win our &quot;Follow the Interns&quot; 
1600 West 35th St. lunches. Austin\'s Pizza owes everything to 
the people of Austin, so to give back we have 
South offered to send out 5 Random Acts of Pizza per 
1817 South Lamar day for 30 days. If you or anyone you know 
3601 William Cannon could benefit from some randomness, click here

              I remember seeing a thread about the Google reviews and how some reviewers had dozens of thousands of followers and how it seemed they might be there for pedophiles to communicate with each other on where to get the kids. I also remember the OP catching black sedans and/or cop cars in about every review picture.
