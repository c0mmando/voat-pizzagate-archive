            Going to reiterate that I was working near killary campaign HQ in Brooklyn when the Erik prince allegations about Weiner laptop and NYPD surfaced.  Literally within days I was outside smoking and saw NYPD setting up what looked like a protest cordon.  Several uniformed officers were in the cordoned area.  It was weird because I had never seen NYPD stand inside protest cordons.  Shortly after some white shirts showed up [NYPD lieutenants] and started a discussion with other officers .  Shortly after that the cordoned area was taken down.  I was so shocked I did not even take pics.  I have no proof but 100% believe this was tied to the allegations regarding weiners laptop contents.  Yes, "are we sure", I am sure.........

            Loretta Lynch would in a NY Minute use the Eric Garner case to Blackmail those LE Officers into submission.  This has nothing to do with racism on her part (although there could be some) but is all about making them jump through her hoop.  I don't know what is on that laptop but now we know there is something they don't want exposed.  The last thing those Policeman and DeBlasio wanted is for the Garner case to explode even worse than it already had.  The NYPD and DeBlasio had  to keep this from turning into Ferguson Mo. and Lynch knows that.

            Generally, I find that ‘are we’ can present a useful sounding board, making valid claims stronger and straining out weaker ones. Sometimes, a comment from this voater actually helps expose particularly absurd and overwrought logical fallacies. Often the comments seem (to me) to be mean and contrary. However, ‘are we’ has been noticeably more aggrieved by this topic.

              However, ‘are we’ has been noticeably more aggrieved by THIS topic. Where did the report of the laptop FIRST originate? Let’s follow it from there to here.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The laptop claims started circulating by anonmyous users on Facebook and Twitter and probably the chans.   Then there was a coordinated campaign to push them that started with an article in the fake news site TruePundit.com
            </p>
            <p>
             I came to this late, but when looked into the Weiner laptop claims I found ALL of them to be not only bullshit, but part of a coordinated campaign tied to the Trump campaign.   The NY offices of the FBI was known to be very close to Trump and leaking like a sieve.   As opposed to the counter intelligence group that was handling the Clinton email investigation and was not leaking.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wrote several posts on here questioning and ultimately debunking these claims, I think I have the bookmark at home and will post later, but essentially the Comey letter came so close before the election that the Trump team saw an opportunity.  They figured nobody would know why the case was reopened and they could flood the zone with bullshit as Steve Bannon called this strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some background
            </p>
            <p>
             Guiliani went on TV, Fox, I believe and talked about a big surprise coming out regarding the Clinton investigation.  BEFORE the Comey letter came out, so somebody on the FBI leaked to him
            </p>
            <p>
             Then a coordinated push on these super secret, super criminal files on Weiner's laptop was pushed to the conspiracy crowd.  Somebody put together a list of ProTrump people who pushed these stories or seemed to have knowledge they were going to come out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Assange
Bannon
Flynn
Giuliani
Kallstrom
Pirro
Prince
Trump Jr.
            </p>
            <p>
             TruePundit came out with its article about secret NYPD sources  having evidence and the FBI shutting them down and they will go public if Clinton is not indicted.   This is a good place to start with this nonsense.  Clinton was not indicted noone from NYPD went public  (Why?  Because this whole story is bullshit.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Erik Prince went on Bannon's old radio show at Breitbart telling a similiar story with his secret NYPD sources
            </p>
            <p>
             The Hagmann Report Guy went on Alex Jones's show.  He let slip Rudy Guiliani was behind these stories and Alex Jones switched topics immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of these stories were about NYPD getting the laptop, finding evidence of dozens of crimes, that would take down many, many democrats, but the FBI stepped it and took it away from them.  But if the FBI tried to cover them up the NYPD would expose it to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was all bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI quickly reviewed the relevant files, found most were duplicates they already reviewed.    NO OTHER CRIMES CHARGED.  Just Weiner.
            </p>
            <p>
             NYPD did bupkis.  No exposure, no secret source coming forward, no release of the evidence copied by a NYPD Chief.  Nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why because it was all bullshit.   The NYPD NEVER HAD THE LAPTOP.

             It was subpoenaed by the US attorney in NY,  a federal supoena.  The FBI seized the laptop and it never left their possession.  It's completely false.
            </p>
            <p>
             Comey made his letter public because he feared the partisans in the NY FBI office would leak it any way.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why claim the NYPD had it?   My guess is to take suspicion away from the folks who actually did leak it, people in the NY office of the FBI.

             When Rolling Stone tried to get to bottom of where pizzagate started, they evidence of this bullshit NYPD claim circulating on line even before TruePundit and Erik Prince.
            </p>
            <p>
             They found an anonymous woman in Joplin, Missouri was the first to push the story on Facebook and an anonymous anti-Semitic user on Twitter was the first to push the story on Twitter.  THEY BOTH CLAIMED TO HAVE NYPD sources. This was before TruePundit and Erik Prince and the outline of the story  AND THE SECRET NYPD SOURCES were already set.
            </p>
            <p>
             A cat lady in Missouri posted this on Facebook.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "My NYPD source said its much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner's device. The email DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend's plane, the Lolita Express. Yup, Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls. . . . We're talking an international child enslavement and sex ring."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Rolling Stone found out who this user was, Cynthia Campbell of Joplin, Missouri and wondered how a cat lady in Missouri had this inside scoop and deep NYPD sources.  She called them fake news.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rolling Stone went to talk to Hagmann about having "court ready sources" and when he revealed he had nothing, they were completely embarrassed for him.  You have to listen to the audio, to really get this.

              Hint: It's easy to identify fake news from the nature of the source. If its MSM or a left leaning source, then its fake news. Center or right leaning sources are more likely to tell the truth.

               Nothing in the IG report says the NYPD had the laptop.  The Fox report says "hundreds of thousands of emails turned over by Weiner’s [attorney] to sdny" in the last week of September.  SDNY is the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of NY

               The actual laptop was seized the first week of October, by FBI agents.  They got it directly from Weiner, not the NYPD.

               Actually, the people she came down on were not the NYPD, but FBI officers.  The NY Office of the FBI was leaking about the Eric Garner case.   She came down hard about stopping political leaks of all kinds from within the Department of Justice.

            Loretta would definitely threaten the cops with prosecution for Eric Garner's death by cop chokehold.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the cops being the corrupt  cowards they have always been would have definitely caved in to Loretta.

            I love you guys and the work you do.  A LOT of what you do never makes the mainstream.  I think this really could be a major happening.  From a sort of etic perspective take my advice and push this hard. 
It resonates with normies that a black woman was able to suppress the entire NYPD with threats. Spread this like wildfire.

            Sounds like a bunch of cowards.  There are great policemen, no doubt, but most police especially the NYPD are corrupt.  Do not call or talk to the police.  Know your rights.

             This is not true. The police have also been extremely muzzled and hampered by DeBlasio. The mayor of NYC has always set the tone for the way the police act.  With the AG breathing down their ass, it only worsened the conditions they operated in.

             the culture within the NYPD is well-known and going against it is a recipe for disaster for any individual. if the fucking federal government and the top law officer in the country (AG) is threatening you, in order to protect extremely powerful political figures, you take it serious. Especially having some idea of the type of corruption they were trying to cover-up, it would be unwise to go against that force. If not for you, for the other members of your "brotherhood" who may have their lives completely destroyed and for which you would bear some responsibility. I'm certain the small group of people in-the-know about this evidence discussed the merits among themselves and considered the likelihood of conditions improving in the future to ensure this information got out, without enduring the costs being threatened by the AG. It's easy to forget post-election how dire and powerless the situation was prior to Trump's taking power. It's been a process but if you look back you can see that he's been gaining and consolidating power this entire time. It really does feel like a different environment and he's establishing a situation where "law and order" can be restored - exactly as he promised and made a centerpiece of his campaign during the nominating convention. It should be no surprise that only after that credibility is established can the truly damaging stuff come to light - it was simply too risky for individuals prior to having a backstop from Trump.  This is why he's always going out of his way to appreciate the military and the police and others - he's building trust and backing it up because he knows that they have the ability to really move the dial on all of this, but first they have to know he can and will protect them. At this point, if you doubt Trump's sincerity and willingness to take bullets in service of the truth, you're a fucking fool.

              You make valid points. I am not into the creature worship of Trump, but I have noticed that he seems to be building power. He seems to be making progress, despite being under constant attack.
             </p>
             <p>
              His opponents, the deep state, have been in power; unchallenged since before the Kennedy assassination. Doesn’t Mueller date back to this era? We can see that Trump is not perfect, but I suspect that he is backed by the military. Maybe they planted pizzagate evidence in Cohen’s office so that it would get sucked up into the public record by the Russian Collusion probe.
             </p>
             <p>
              That would be hilarious; poetic justice, but I freely admit it’s just a fiction of speculation on my part.

              I hope you're right.  Not all men are as brave as those who are no longer with us.  As President Trump quoted, "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends."

               Just a reminder to not get your hopes up with a human leader... but keep ‘em high with the Big Boss. Something is happening. The truth will come out, with Trump, or somebody else.
