', " Please share the new song/video.  #uneasy ? #share #tellyourfriends #tellyourneighbo rsThe less cool Corey Said on TV The worst Hollywood story's The one we don't see Like 1,2,3 He spelled it out slow The host was uneasy Since he's in the know Believe it or don't  Or.. just watch the tape The screams are no show Those children are raped Gaped, dismantled  Tortured, destroyed  Their fate in the hands of Those who employ Horrible ploys To foil kids plans Like Vernon did Roy Detroit understands Exploiting command They always demand more Their Atlas is Rand They stand on the poor Their tantrums implore You ignore what they do The advantage is war The scores nothing new Like a whore on the move I'll buy their belief  When the born again's prove The screws in the feetI'm just not into schoolgirls  Give me a big fat woman You're feeding a cruel world  Thinking it's a goodin For little girls With hair in curls To sever their bowl of puddin Giving pearls You bitter squirrels  Say word when you know you shouldn'tPeople often ask me  Why I'm so obsessed With children being happy  Having never had butt sex Quick to change the subject Like you want to jump this track But if you think that you're disgusted  Let's just bring you back To a day when all the grass  In whoever's yard was greener  When you giggled at an ass And laughed at a ba-jinger When to smell somebody's finger  Meant you'd probably smell poop When your ignorance was king and your Unripened sexual fruit Was more like a scoop Of unplanted seeds When you didn't need for proof For Santa's good deeds Back when weeds And grass were different  Way before Meads Mill put the focus on pigment Innocent Remember being a seedling  Now imagine you're bent Over and bleeding Crying and pleading The weakling you trusted To stop, you were kneeling  Because he said you were bustedI'm just not into schoolgirls  Give me a big fat woman You're feeding a cruel world  Thinking it's a goodin For little girls With hair in curls To sever their bowl of puddin Giving pearls You bitter squirrels  Say word when you know you shouldn'tIt's everywhere you look It saturates pop culture  The Eagle is a crook Who should be looked at like a vulture  What is the vault for Why's there so much protection  For the monsters at fault, your Asking the wrong question  Neglecting to mention The Hollyweird past Like how even Chris Hansen Is given the shaft When children are passed Like the Dochie, or food bowl It goes beyond sad The emojis frown two fold But the old silver screens hold The darkest of secrets Like the westerns who's scenes show Our racist beliefs, it's Not for the squeamish  But truth seldom is While they feed you your jesus They prey on your kids The faces that lift Are ageless in scope I say this as a gift With knowledge comes hope At the end of your rope You'll find new beginning  But when truth is controlled  The lie's always spinningI'm just not into schoolgirls  Give me a big fat woman You're feeding a cruel world  Thinking it's a goodin For little girls With hair in curls To sever their bowl of puddin Giving pearls You bitter squirrels  Say word when you know you shouldn't"
