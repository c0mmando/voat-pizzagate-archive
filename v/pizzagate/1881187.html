            Not too out of place if you think about it...
           </p>
           <p>
            Think of how the mainstream media handles leakers/publishers of leaks, the general consensus is that they are evil, traitorous scum that are eligible for death penalty. Regardless of how terrible the crimes they expose are. THOSE are the leakers they can't easily kill off, or as HRC suggested "drone" them.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the leaks that are known and effectively silenced, the narrative becomes a fever pitch of the false evil doers, the terrible source of the leaks, that cause the "jeopardy of our very democracy" - in this case, Russia. They've mounted such a repetitive campaign about Russia (to the point of which most Americans simply assume all leaks are now of Russian origin), that the foundation is incredibly sturdy for them to explain this away to the masses, even if a bombshell hits tomorrow and paints a vibrant paper trail from JP, JPo, RM to the death of SR via SEIU as a retaliatory mechanism for the DNC Leaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keeping the masses dumbed down, divided and uneducated is key. Even when a smoking gun is sitting in front of everyone to see... they will still be able to run damage control and effectively 'erase' the truth with repeating talking points, changing subjects or worse - a total media whitewash.

           <p>
            Truer words have never been said. That's almost always how these thing get going. It reminds me a lot of the Bernie Madoff scandal. It looks like Bernie made a few mistakes and thought he'd get cute and cook the books for a quarter or two until he caught back up. Sometimes people catch up but sometimes they don't. The ones that don't have a choice of going bankrupt, selling all the toys, admitting you cooked the books and spending 6 months at Camp Fed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or they keep it going for 2 more then 4 then 8 and the rest is History. Bernie didn't start off saying to himself "I am going to spend the rest of my life trying to pull off the biggest Ponzi scheme in recorded History.".

             People out of Boston  did catch Bernie YEARS before when they tried to match his results and realized what was going on.  The SEC and the Fed covered it up.  Excellent dicumentary "Chasing Bernie"

              Today with all we now know about the upper echelons of power and the fact that psychopathy appears to float up there along with the crème de la crème I wonder whether the SEC really wanted to find out what happened.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whatever the case I have a sneaky suspicion the imminent collapse of the Deep State may precipitate out some more Bernie Madoffs. I get the impression this fucker's gonna shake the very foundations of our Republic.

            Here is what he wrote:
           </p>
           <p>
            "We’ve lost one hell of a friend, brother, colleague, teammate, and patriot, but I hope his legacy will serve as an example to others who might step in to take his place."
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the same sentence with the word "but" replaced with the word "and".
           </p>
           <p>
            "We’ve lost one hell of a friend, brother, colleague, teammate, and patriot, and I hope his legacy will serve as an example to others who might step in to take his place."
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like the word "but" negates what comes before it.

            Is this pizzagate or is this Seth gate? I am getting sick and tired of hearing about this is stupid Seth rich. Was he molested? If not, then this has nothing to do with pizzagate. Start a new topic that is about Seth and let's stay on topic here.

             Wasn't Seth Rich a source for some of the Pizzagate emails?  Either way, he was associated with the people involved in Pizzagate, and, if they had him killed, then I think it is important that we discuss it.

            His point is that for the elite to win, they need to control the masses... and to control the masses, you need to strip away freedom, choices and free will, slowly enough that the largest populations don't even realize it. The war on drugs, the war on terror, international wars, censorship, FCC limitations imposed on the internet, etc... each of these "wars" or "battles" begins with one or many "attacks" to not only allow them to strip away our liberties - but to ultimately train us to ask them to be removed in exchange for the perception of safety.

              Ah, I just posted something similar but you beat me too it.  It seems that the sentence changes meaning if you replace the word "but" with "and".  It is not as ominous.
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT:  I reread it again.  There is also the word "might" instead of "will".  I think this is a clue regarding the meaning of this sentence.  They might have someone replace Seth and take over his job, or they will?  It seems like they will at the relevant point of time.

               Yes, exactly. It is that conjunction alone that suggests the meaning of the second clause in his sentence.

                Ok, am I reaching too far if I form the sentence as:

               <p>
                "We’ve lost one hell of a friend, brother, colleague, teammate, and patriot, who's unexpected death hopefully serve as an example so that no-one will step in to take his place, as we will have a person to that position in time."

               <p>
                ...or am I reaching as far to the other side with this one:
               </p>
               <p>
                "We’ve lost one hell of a friend, brother, colleague, teammate, and patriot, but I hope the next person who will step in to take his place will follow his legacy."

                 I can understand the confusion,
                 <strong>
                  but
                 </strong>
                 this is not how he formulated it. Imho, the word BUT suggests a negative contrast to the first part, which is positive.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, Andrew's other tweet calling Seth and all Bernie Sanders supporters (pandas = Sanders campaign mascot) an "embarrassment" here
                 <a href="https://archive.fo/yMO93">
                  https://archive.fo/yMO93
                 </a>
                 only emphasises the theory that his words were meant as a threat, or at the very least, in a negative sense. It almost feels like Andrew is holding a grudge against Seth Rich... (for knowing or having heard that he was a leaker perhaps?
                </p>
                <p>
                 If it reads like a threat and sounds like a threat, it most probably is a threat.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm also wondering if the DNC or the press didn't force Seth's mother to hold on to that stuffed panda bear during the interview as a "hidden in plain sight symbol" that says to those in the know: "this is what he got for secretly having been a Bernie supporter and a traitor."
                </p>

                  Missing all the background info on the pandas, been focused elsewhere, so maybe I should just shut up on this and remain a bit confused ;) Hoping for others to catch this fish then. For me, too many possible meanings, but a threat is definitely one of those possibilities.

            If I had to guess I bet  Andrew Therriault regrets his choice of words. I'd give him the benefit of the doubt of not knowing to what depth the depravity had gotten. You've got to remember many in this crowd believe "The Ends Justify The Means". That's how the frog was slowly boiled and eaten. They're inched along slowly, asked to lower their standards just a little. Oh ignore that one exception, it's all for a good cause after all. You've got to remember Donald Trump wants to make all women wear dog leashes and keep gay people in cages. So please disregard your conscience for the next 24 hours. And on and on.........

            Sometimes you'll see this phenomenon referred to as "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.".
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately it gets worse. After you agree to lower your standards then you're asked to put on the blinders, followed by those old people wrap around sun glasses that hardly let any light in at all.
