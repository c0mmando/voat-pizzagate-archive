<p>DUST IS A BIANNUAL MAGAZINE BORN IN 2010 BASED BETWEEN BERLIN AND LONDON AND DISTRIBUTED WORLDWIDE. THE INTENT OF THE PROJECT IS TO EXPLORE THE UNIVERSE OF YOUTH, IN THE CONTEXT OF A PRESENT TIME MARKED BY A CONTINUOUS STATE OF CRISIS. OUR INTEREST IS TO ENLIGHTEN THE GENUINE AND NON-CODIFIED ASPECTS OF YOUTH AND OF THE NEW EMERGING GENERATION BY DIRECTING OUR GAZE FAR FROM INSTITUTIONALIZED GEOGRAPHY AND TRENDS, AND ABOVE THE CURRENT STANDARDIZATION THAT TENDS TO CONFORM THE EXPERIENCE OF YOUTH IN REGULATED FORMS. IN OUR RESEARCH WE CROSS CONFLICTING TERRITORIES, WHERE STRUCTURES COLLAPSE AND THE WESTERN CODES OF APPEARANCES DISSOLVE INTO DIFFERENT KINDS OF CHOICES, DIFFERENT KINDS OF DYNAMICS. WE LIKE TO UNDERLINE A SILENT GEOGRAPHY, AT THE MARGIN OF MAINSTREAM PATHS, IN ORDER TO REDISCOVER A STRONGER ATTACHMENT TO LIFE, SOMEHOW MORE VITAL, GENUINE AND AWAKE; SOMETHING THAT IS HARD TO FIND IN THE ANESTHETIZED YOUTH PRESENTED BY THE DISORIENTED CIRCULATING CULTURE. THE TERRITORY IN WHICH WE DIG IS ‘THE CRISIS’ AS THE ELECTED PLACE WHERE TO REDESIGN FORMS, IDEAS, VALUES AND STRATEGIES FOR OUR GENERATION TO EMBRACE A DIFFERENT WAY TO CONCEIVE OF LIFE. WE OBSERVE THE COLLAPSE OF STABILITIES TAKING PLACE GLOBALLY AS AN IRREVERSIBLE SHIFT OF SCENARIO THAT’S PUSHING YOUTH TO AN URGENCY OF CHANGE, AN URGENCY TO FIND A NEW AND PROPER VISION. AS MANY DO, WE FEEL RENEWAL TO BE NECESSARY IN ALL FIELDS, BASED ON A MORE PERSONAL SENSIBILITY. IN LIGHT OF OUR CONCERNS AND INTERESTS, THE REALMS OF COMMUNICATION, VISUAL CULTURE, ART AND FASHION NEED TO BE RECONSIDERED FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW. OUR MAGAZINE IS INTENT ON CREATING, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ANY CULTURAL PRODUCT PRESENT IN THE MARKET, THIS NEW VISION. WE CONSIDER THE MAGAZINE A LABORATORY OF IDEAS AND CONCEPTS THROUGH WHICH WE SEARCH FOR A NEW ESTHETIC AND TO GIVE THE IMAGE NEW VALUE. OUR PERSONAL INTERESTS GO BEYOND THE IDEA OF COOLNESS, TRENDS, WAVES OR ANYTHING ESTABLISHED BY POP CULTURE. WE PREFER TO DIRECT OUR GAZE TO THE BASIC, GENUINE WAY THROUGH WHICH YOUTH EXPRESSES ITSELF, FROM WHERE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED.</p>

            the entire fucking fashion world is basically pedo. Look at every major cover, there are girls/women there DOING THEIR LEVEL BEST to look like pre-pubescent boys... LOOK... it's not much different in the "art world", which basically acts as an incubator and supply chain for the fashion world.

            It's interesting to me on a spiritual level just how much filth flows from Berlin. Then here they are importing the horde that will be used by Satan to slay them.

            Sort of off topic to your very well researched post. Kudos to you.

            Not so subtle promotion of pedophilia and bringing that into being socially acceptable. Bullshit crap. The elites are working through hipsters like this making pedophilia 'normal'. Makes me want to puke

            I have read multiple threads today that are describing the mods deleting important threads. I hope this doesn't become a pattern with voat or we will all have to go somewhere else.

              What the hell does all-caps have to do with someone's first language?  And notice I didn't delete the post.  I was just giving my opinion that using all-caps for an entire paragraph only makes people want to stop reading.
