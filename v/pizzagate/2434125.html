            , I think there is something missing from your post. From the quote. It doesn't make sense. You can go ahead and include the url directly to whatever chan comment that was. Reformating stuff from the chans in Voat's markdown coding isn't easy. You have to add carriage returns and remove spaces.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to give this the 24 Hour Reprieve flair so you can edit it.
