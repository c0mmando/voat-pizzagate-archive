            The problem with nursing is we are told in school to be critical thinkers but by the same hand are taught to obey and not question. Those who do are met with criticism and ostracized. I've had more character attacks than I can count for years because I have actually researched vaccine safety and tried to open others' eyes to the problems there. And people wonder why so many nurses get frustrated and leave the field. I'm almost there myself.

             You know, I believe that most people still believe in "authorities", whoever they think that is. SO, if the doctors, CDC, and pharm reps tell them vaxxing is safe and good, they will believe it unquestioningly. I, on the other hand, have seen that no institution has remained uncorrupted. The chain of trust is broken, and with that comes the fall of civilization as we know it. When the editor of the Lancet says the majority of studies cannot be replicated, and are frauds, there goes science as we believed it to be.

            Social engineering of the mind. That is seriously freaky power.

            There are also some posts that have been reported so many times that just posting them will get you banned from Facebook for 3 days, or 30 days or whatever. I had to use my husband's account one time after posting a photo of the oral suction circumcision practiced by ultra orthodox Jews. They banned me within 3 seconds of posting the photo. It's an autobot thing that recognizes certain content they don't want. Facebook and David Brock are working together on doing the max amount of censorship possible ever since Pizzagate broke.

              The reason for posting it was to expose it. Facebook doesn't allow that, they'd rather babies keep dying of herpes. I wouldn't want to see it either much less be the child undergoing the torture. You have to take a stand sometimes.

            It's called a shadow ban. They ban the content from the newsfeed but allow you to post it on your page. Nobody will see it unless they go to your page, and sometimes, even then they will censor the content. I noticed this on my own page also. There are some posts that are in my memories from years ago, that have no share button, while everything else in the memories feed has a share button. So I have to go to extra effort to get it to repost, or copy and paste it again. A lot of the links are now defunct or suddenly removed. I recommend copying and pasting the entire content of an article into a description on each and every important article you post to avoid this censorship in the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            My friend goes through periodically asking everyone to go to her page and click on like on all the posts that they can see so she can tell which ones Facebook is banning.

             I still have my FB acct...but I don't post to it. I don't do anything with it. The entire week after the election and all the Pizzagate stuff was enough to get me away from there. And after I've learned more about FB, the more I hate it. You'll never get any "news" there and you certainly won't get any support from your "normie" friends and family about stuff like this. I've not missed it one bit. If you want to check on family and friends, share a few memes and cat videos, the FB is harmless. I for one don't want to give Zuckerberg any of my traffic whatsoever.

            Medical personnel know that human/child and organ trafficking is happening.  I know I am beginning to sound like a broken record, but there are conferences and symposiums being held to make doctors and nurses aware of what is going on.  Last Spring, our cardiologist came back from a conference in France and told us that is what it was about.  He said it had reached epic proportions and that the world would soon know-because you could not keep something this big hidden any longer.  We kind of looked at him like "you have got to be kidding", but he wasn't.   He said what they learned was horrifying and we in America live in a dream world, not believing what is going on, especially in Third World countries.  Our cardiologist is involved in legal heart transplantation, and this conference was to make them aware of the illegal trade of organs and, of course, the illegal trade of humans who become part of the evil process to make money on the black market with the transactions.  A new heart on the black market is $160,000, in case you were wondering.  This does not include the surgery, though.  David Rockefeller is on his 9th heart transplant.  My guess would be that he did not go through regular US channels for all of those transplants.  I don't think UNOS would allow that.  Of course, I could be wrong about that.  So, this nurse who is trying to educate other nurses and medical people is not alone in her knowledge, just being silenced.  Our friend was pretty spooked about what he learned.  He is a very smart doctor who came from a middle class, working class background.  He went to a ivy league college, but, I don't think he ever really got "into" the elite, so, this was probably pretty astounding to him.  We have not discussed any of this that came out from the podesta e-mails, because we have not seen him for an appointment since the fall.  I would like to tell him, though, that I truly and completely believe what he told us, now.

             Unbelievable. Wow. I had heard about China using their prisoners, especially the Falon Gong peaceful political activists for their organs. They always arrest and put them in prison to do this because the Falon Gong meditate regularly, don't smoke and take care of themselves well, therefore their organs are perfect for this. The Chinese government is looking for ways to move this practice into hospitals in Canada with Chinese organs. It's beyond sick.

            Bless her heart cant say im a biblical or religions fellow however the book does speak of a time where towards the end good will be scorned and sin embraced or something like that. You often get punished for doing the right thing in today's world never made sense to me until learning that elite child raping and murdering pedophiles who own over 50% of the entire WORLDS wealth are ruling us. The justice system etc it all makes sense now.

            Good for the nurse all the good things we enjoy today is because of people like her who said to hell with my personal well being I am going to do whats right anyways. People like her is the reason why im not chained up in a backyard picking cotton or at a human animal zoo which existed in the 1900s for people of color.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most good things we have come from those who challenge the status quo regardless of what befalls them in return. She is a hero if they terminate her for it have her set up a gofundme for support.
           </p>
           <p>
            A man was sent to jail for 3 years from stealing steak from wal mart. Pedophile child raping politicians 2-6 months in prison at most or a slap on the wrist and in the case of jon podesta hilary clinton alefantis tony podesa epstein and more NOTHING at all. People should be outraged over the fact that we are enslaved by elitist pedophiles who even manipulate the very news we are fed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing is true and we are enslaved just under different tiers of slavery depending who you are we are allowing these perverts to run the world unchallenged.

             - &gt;This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 2For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 4Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 5Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 6For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 7Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 8Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 9But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.

            Yep, a few times I posted stuff about pizzagate on facebook....there were immediate responses from people I don't know.  I don't usually get a lot of responses, but on one...there were three responses within seconds...all from different people with blank profiles and a link to some bizarre site....I think the site linked was to discredit the information or associate the post with the bizarre site about a talking doll or something.  I didn't even click on the link, but it was about a talking doll or dolls that talked.

            We are "all" the "face" of PizzaGate... but I have heard a lot of people say David Seaman is the face... I personally think if we really are going to have a "face" of PizzaGate it either MUST be a victim of pizzagate or a woman. Whether we want to admit it or not, there are some serious credibility issues with Seaman... this woman, an educated nurse, is more on point... just my thoughts...

             David never was, is, or could EVER be the face. He is "our" tool. He has value, your opinion is also important to me. Even if your tone is loud. ;-)

             No one is the "face" that's absurd. This is getting stupid to say the least. Research and bring awareness and stop the horrific trafficking and stop fighting about who is getting more attention and who isn't it's bizarre, narcissistic and childish. If you are looking for attention, don't come here-it's about the fight, not about you and who's more popular for fuck sakes. And no it does not have to be a woman or kid either, you're thought train is rather skewed as there are MANY males who are victims in this. There is nothing wrong with David Seaman getting the message out there, that is what we need. Why do you morons fighting about Seaman not have your own YouTube channel and show your face and talk about it if your so concerned about getting credit this and credit that. It's getting way out of hand.

              THAT is my issue with "Seaman." He is hijacking this investigation for his own personal gain... he is making this a drama about HIM (cars outside his home, his friend "murdered" etc...) This dude literally wrote a book on exactly what he is doing now, how to hijack the internet for your own personal gain...
             </p>
             <p>
              "In 2008, Seaman wrote a book called, Dirty Little Secrets of Buzz: How to Attract Massive Attention for Your Business, Your Product, or Yourself. In this book, you can advice such as "Always be controversial and outrageous in everything you do" and "Enemies are more important than friends." You'll also learn interesting tidbits such as how he loves Bill Maher and Michael Moore, and hates Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly. This seems to be very contradictory, seeing as how he claims to be such a huge Donald Trump supporter. He also refers to himself as a "veteran promotional stunt planner," not a reporter or journalist. In the "About the Author" section, you'll find this info: Seaman is the founder of Shutterline Interactive, a vehicle for rapidly deploying new publicity stunts."
             </p>
             <p>
              I made a simple basic statement saying we needed someone credible (which Seaman is NOT) and you felt the need to write an entire paragraph defending Seaman... very very odd indeed...
