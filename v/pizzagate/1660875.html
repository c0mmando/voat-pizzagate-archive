             In the Documentary Movie 'The Kinsey Syndrome',
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQE_SjehdVw">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQE_SjehdVw
             </a>
             demonstrates how sexual researcher and Alfred Kinsey (a SM himself), in the 1940s encouraged the rape of children by a Nazi pedophile, and paid for "data" from other pedophile rapists in the pursuit of 'science'.  He used that data not only to claim that sex is beneficial for children, and that sexual stimulation of infants by adults is a good thing, but somehow came to the conclusion that screaming, crying, convulsions, resistance were signs of child/infant orgasm.  This sick F-ker blended the pedo stats in with other stats, skewing the numbers in order to claim that pedophilia is normative of the 'Average' person. Rockafeller Foundation funded his "Research".  Kinsey claimed, as an "expert" that all pedos molesters, rapists and sexually driven killers should be set free on parole, that they aren't repeat offenders.  As the "leading scientist in the world regarding human sexuality" he made sure that laws protecting children and women were gutted. Some of his claims? "Children are not only sexual from birth, but they can benefit from incest...they need early explicit teaching about masturbation". In a sense one could credit him with much of the epidemic of what we see today in the United States i.e. #pizzagate. "Chester the Molester (also known as Chester the Protector) was a comic strip by Dwaine B. Tinsley (December 31, 1945 – May 23, 2000) Hustler magazine's cartoon editor. Tinsley produced the strip for 13 years. The premise of the strip was a tongue-in-cheek take on a man, Chester, who was interested in sexually molesting women and prepubescent girls. The Chester cartoon showed many scenes in which the main character—and later on his girlfriend Hester—tricked or attempted to trick women and prepubescent girls into sexually compromising positions. However, modern day depictions of Chester include him luring young boys into his white van with candy."
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_the_Molester">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_the_Molester
             </a>
             As it turns out, Tinsley was raping his daughter, acts which apparently inspired his cartoon career.  The documentary explains how so many struggle with the conditioning of sex being visually combined with violence towards children through images, and generations of 'normalizing' sexual abuse of children via the tenets of Alfred Kinsey's 'research'.  (See video 1:41): Some cartoon imagery depicts the abduction, rape and murder of women, children and infants, and over time, we are now witnessing how sexual addiction has spiraled out of control.  Everyone who wants to gain some insight into the roots of our pizzagate country, this video is a must see.  In 1989 Ted Bundy, serial rapist/murderer, hours before his execution said (video around 1:55) in an interview Dr. James Dobson: "...I've lived in prison a long time now...and I've met a lot of men who were motivated to commit violence just like me, and without exception, everyone of them, was DEEPLY involved in pornography, without question, without exception, deeply influenced and consumed by an addiction to pornography."

              Yes Kinsey and Freud worked together all involved in NAZI experiments in complementing each other to formulate MK Ultra programming. Purposefully raping children and to cause MPD or alters. Then exported it to USA through the CIA black budgets. 
Of course it was supported and helped with financing from the Vatican and involvement of priest.

            This is just silly there's not evidence at all that Trump or Sessions knew about this local unit.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Obama administration had nothing to do with shutting it down.  A lawsuit was brought saying this unit could not be run out of the district attorneys office.  When they shut it down, they mentioned they would transfer the investigative part of to the police.

            This is just an example of the work against pedophilia that has been going on for a while all over the country, that most everyone here didn't know about a year ago.
