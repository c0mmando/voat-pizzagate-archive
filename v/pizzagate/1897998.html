            Visa, passport and voter fraud were being investigated by Whisenant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whisenant worked for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami in its major crimes unit. He had joined the office in January. Court records show he had been handling several visa and passport fraud cases not to mention the DNC voter fraud case involving close Clinton friend, Brenda Snipes in which ‘volunteers’ were caught shredding republican absentee ballots. Whisenant's body was found in Debbie Wassermann Schultz’s district.

A Federal Prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami, Beranton J. Whisenant Jr., was found dead on May 25th last week. A report by the Miami Herald indicated that Whisenant had suffered a possible gunshot wound to the head. Whisenant’s body was found on the waterfront of Hollywood Beach, Florida. Police are currently investigating the death as a crime. No arrests have been made at this time, and it is not clear where Whisenant died.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Miami Herald spoke with Hollywood Police Department spokeswoman Miranda Grossman, who stated that the investigation was very preliminary and that detectives and the Broward medical examiner were still analyzing the situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whisenant had joined the U.S. Attorney’s office in January of this year. WPTV stated he had worked in the Major Crimes division and had been working in visa and passport fraud cases. Some media reports claimed that Whisenant also worked on cases of voter fraud, but there has been no evidence to corroborate these claims so far.
            <strong>
             Disobedient Media submitted a request for information about cases that Whisenant had been working on at the time of his death to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami, but it was refused.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Whisenant’s body was found in Broward County, Florida, a part of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s 23rd District. Schultz has been the center of numerous DNC related controversies, most recently when she was reported to have threatened the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police with “consequences” over the return of a laptop which was seized in the ongoing investigation. Wasserman Schultz has also also been a central figure in the DNC Lawsuit, after leaked DNC emails revealed her unapologetic role in aiding Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders.
