<p>&quot;Oleg soon escapes from Anzor, then is taken in by a kindly married couple, Dez and Edele, and their two young children. When Oleg becomes suspicious of them, he sneaks Edele\'s cell phone and secretly calls Teresa. Teresa arrives, threatens her way inside the apartment, but finds no sign of Oleg. She threatens Dez, who leads her to a closet, where Oleg is tied up with a plastic bag over his head. Teresa saves him, then holds the couple at gunpoint and tells Oleg to get the other kids and leave. When Teresa finds children\'s costumes, plastic body bags and snuff films, she calls the police from Edele\'s cell phone, reports gunshots, hangs up, and then murders them both.&quot;</p>',

            ICE up to 2006 (release of the movie) had a major lead + investigation into pedo circles. Hamstrung by Bush, killed by Obama. The slogan “Abolish ICE” was coined in that context.

            Paul Walker did have his own charity for the Philippines going on, but you're sure he was a white hat?

            I don't know anything about any of this so I'm only asking for reasons why.

             His charity was also working in Haiti after the disaster.Apparently he and his partner were on the ground there and finding out just how corrupt these other charities were. Paul Haggis, the scumbag now up on rape charges, had or has a charity in Haiti as well. I personally knew Haggiis and I can tell you flat out that he is a liar. Take that for what you will. Haggis was in Scientology but I think, even their good squads got tired of covering up for him and so he left. The girls charging him with rape are not connected to Scientology. I can only imagine, if Paul Walker was a good guy, and then him discovering the layers of deceit and betrayal, including organ harvesting with crooked doctors on a large ship just off the coast of Haiti, performing these illegal operations. Keep the 'organ donors' alive just long enough to extract the heart, kidneys whatever

              Yes, but the problem is they're dead. Whether they talked about it, or talked to the wrong person, we'll never know.
             </p>
             <p>
              The thing that bothers me is that they were doing and involved in the exact same shit that HRC and other scumballs were. So why would I think they're white hats? There's no evidence of that except deaths. But we know people that are involved up to their pituitary glance are suicided all the time. It's a guessing game. I don't want to talk badly about someone that was a white hat or that became one. It's very possible that he was involved, but didn't realize the extent these people were going to to destroy society and put themselves in power. It's also possible that he was a scumbag. I don't know. I don't want to trash him, but I also don't want to praise him for something he never intended to do.

               Fair enough. Mt take on Paul Walker is that he was a good guy but hell, I have been wrong before. The fact that he was murdered(again, my take based on overwhelming evidence to suggest this) makes me think he stumbled onto to something but I respect your hesitation to assume anything. That my friend is good healthy critical thinking of which there is not enough of on here

                Thanks. It's just it's hard to know what's going on. There's also disinfo at play which muddies the waters.

               <p>
                One thing I have noticed, if the propagandists in media push someone as being the nicest person in the entire world, they're scum sucking pigs. I could name so many who've been portrayed this way like: Lady Gaga, George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, Rob Reiner, Penny Marshall etc., etc., etc. All of them PIGS!

             Don't know if he was a white hat or just knew too much. There were some hints he had become a Christian. His world view changed and he wanted out of Hollywood.

            That really scratched an itch I didn't know I had. As fucked up as that movie looks I think that it, eyes wide shut, and other films need to show realistic conspiracies like this.

            See 2:25 forward. Talks about Walker's charity in the Philippines. Some suggest he found out about vaccines tainted with birth-control being given out. He wanted out of Hollywood.
