            have written at least twice to "message the moderators" "https://voat.co/messages/compose?recipient=v/pizzagate" and received no reply. Does the link work or am I wasting my time even more?
           </p>
           <p>
            I had a post deleted yesterday by Kwijibo. The post was 10 years ago William Sessions had evidence of fraud on Hillarys "Childrens Defense Fund" (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1620595">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1620595
            </a>
            . It was judged by him to be a rule 1 violation. This had got about 40 upvotes and there was helpful discussion to research further.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was deleted, with no warnings. It would be polite , helpful and in the spirit of a research community to warn someone. But no, all i get is a comment that "we don't warn people " "Read the rules" or similar and a simplistic venn diagram , but no explanation of why my post did not fit into that diagram in the deleters opinion.
           </p>
           <p>
            As well as no explanation there is apparently no appeal so i cannot even try and convince a mod who does not understand why it is relevant. If ther eis no appeal, moderators should warn and be alot more careful that it is not their knowledge that is lacking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fine " It is the responsibility of the poster to demonstrate relevance." but for a researcher like myself who has been researching, writing and publishing child sexual abuse (pedophilia does not infer abuse takes place) for years, my mistake was to attribute a higher level of knowledge of child sexual abuse to a moderator than this one actually has.
           </p>
           <p>
            It may not be clear to one moderator of why it does fit into pizzagate,( or he may be a shill) but I thought it was obvious enough putting fraud on Hillarys* "Childrens Defense Fund". To me then it is obvious if associated with Hillary, a satanist, criminal and sexual abuser and it may well be not actually saving children from trafficking but being used for child trafficking, especially if it is used to launder money. Do you not even think pizzagate should be investigating something called "Childrens Defense Fund" that is associated with Hillary? She was head for several years.
           </p>
           <p>
            So no warning, no explanation from deleting mod, no appeal, no replies from other mods. I appear to be wasting my time on this forum. But it was not just my posts that were deleted.

            ( i dont know why the voat thread does not copy) . Jeffrey Epstein is one of the keys to the child abuse. Why can this?

            Chuck Schumer, Pay-for-Play schemes, EB5-5 investor visa program and human trafficking loopholes 63 upvoats

            </a>
            . Human trafficking methods/ ratlines are in many cases the same as child trafficking. What is the child trafficking method from pizzagate?? You wont find out if you delete threads like this. (Chuck Schumer also may be relevant)
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we have to ELI5 just so a post isnt deleted? Sorry that is not the best way to research and collaborate. Bring everyone down to the level of the most stupid mod. In fact it is guaranteed to shut down the research, by artificially restricting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The following is great original research I saw some discussion of George Webb and Waco
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1621538">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1621538
            </a>
            . If you find the cocaine ratlines, then they stand a good chance of overlapping and being the ratlines for child trafficking. Deleted without warning and any collaboration lost as the OP name does not now appear on it. Crazy. This research took much time. I know how long decent research takes. How do you think the poster feels?
           </p>
           <p>
            If mods need to delete so many posts, then there is something wrong with the set up of the group.It was always clear that Pizzagate should be the initial group for any postings, as it is the one most people would join, due to the name, and another group set up for more in depth research. But that is not how it was chosen to be , so the structure is set that moderators will have to delete loads of posts and the baby gets thrown away with the bathwater.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is clear that this is not a good structure for quality child sexual abuse research collaboration, in fact the structure and system confines it. When people questioned some deletions and there were many - 50? last night - did they get useful answers,
           </p>

            No they got that deleted eg Millenial Falcon just deleted a potentially very important and relevant thread 41 uv 53 comments

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Some deleted posts may be shills but what about the genuine posters. how do they feel, and all those lurkers and survivors who feel that it will not be worth them posting?

            Whilst writing probably my last post, as my time is better spent elsewhere, then the elephant in the room must be mentioned, Is Voat really about free speech? Voat has been said to be such but was Peter Thiel ever a champion of free speech. He shut down Gawker

             http://archive.is/6OUun

            and he created the best spying software for the spies, not the spied upon Palantir

           <p>
            I never even got to be a full member of Voat - i could not donwvote as i did not achieve enough comment points - a bizzare measure of whether someone can be allowed to downvoat. The initial lack of clarity about various things is another issue that needs to be addressed

             Chatman It is sourced with 2 links, If you think a link to the articles deleted, 3 of which were not mine, would help this being deleted you are, i think mistaken. there is one thing worse than an ignorant pompous mod and that is those that act like them who arent mods.
            </p>
            <p>
             The point is not to show the original posts it is to point out that this famous pyschological experiment shows exactly how people react with a bit of power. It goes to their heads.
            </p>
            <p>
             You also mistakenly assume that just because this has not got a link that you desire that the original posts were not sourced. doh
