             Riki Ott, whistleblower from Exxon Valdez spill, said the entire coast should have been evacuated. She was silenced. She says most of the oil spill cleanup workers from Alaska who worked with Corexit are already dead, and this is what we will see on the Gulf coast over the next 20 years.

             Why did BP's head guy, Tony Hayward, sell 1/3 of his BP stock weeks before the explosion?

             Why did Warren Buffet decide to buy a ton of stock in the makers of Corexit a year prior?

            It seems someone knew this explosion would occur. BP was loosing money on this drilling project. It may have been a business decision to blow it up on purpose.

             If they had not used Corexit, almost all of the oil could have been skimmed off the surface.

            Though BP would have paid more in fines, there would have been few deaths related to toxicity, and probably none would have been human deaths.
