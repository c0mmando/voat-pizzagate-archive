<p>Tahir Javed is a Pakistani businessman residing in Beaumont, Tx. According to his own bio, he came to this country with nothing. Opened a small convenience store and has since amassed a fortune. He now owns numerous convenience stores, hospitals, rural health clinics, a hospice, etc,...in total 27 businesses and 35 brands. Not bad for someone who came here in the \'80\'s with nothing. Link below.</p>

<p>Tahir Javed held a private fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in 2016 in his own home in Beaumont, Texas. She flew into the tiny airport, was met by 6 people, and taken to Mr. Javed\'s home. That in itself is suspicious (Folks, nobody of any fame goes to Beaumont...it\'s a small southeast Tx city surrounded by RICE fields (import of that to come out later) and oil refineries, and major metropolitan Houston is just right up the road, which would seem the more logical choice). Anyway, this fundraiser was attended by about 250 people, mostly Pakistani, and netted almost half a million dollars for Hill\'s war chest This was her 5th largest fundraiser. It was also attended by former Congressman Nick Lampson (more on him later).. Link below.</p>

<p>According to this article, this man, Tahir Javed is reported to be an ISI agent, which is Pakistani Intelligence. He is also suspected of funding terrorists and is under investigation in Alabama for foodstamp fraud. Also, according to this article, FSB placed Hill on a watch list because of her ties to this man.

<p>Now to former Congressman Nick Lampson who attended Javed\'s private fundraiser for Hillary. Lampson lost his Congressional seat due to redistricting (not sourced here, but later in this post). Nick Lampson is now employed by Mr. Javed as Senior Vice President of Riceland Medical Center, a hospital Mr. Javed bought from the City of Winnie and changed the name. (Many of his businesses have had name changed to Riceland, but thats another untangled web). Link below regarding Lampson\'s employ.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ricelandhealthcare.com/about.html">http://www.ricelandhealthcare.com/about.html</a></p>
<p>On a weird side note, while in Congress, Lampson filled the Congressional seat of Steve Stockman, whom, oddly enough, was arrested by the DOJ yesterday as he tried to board a flight to the UAE. The charges stem from improprieties with campaign donations. Link below.</p>

<p>Ok, now the possible connection to pizzagate/pedogate,</p>
<p>Congressman Nick Lampson is credited with forming the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children\'s Caucus....also, as excerpted from the source below, 
&quot;The Congressional Missing and Exploited Children\'s Caucus is credited with nationalizing the successful AMBER Alert system.&quot; I find this strange because same source says, &quot;Lampson sponsored legislation to fund law enforcement efforts to stop child pornography and exploitation on the Internet.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lampson">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lampson</a></p>
<p>We all know Amber Alert is run by one Laura Silsby, of Haiti fame.</p>
<p>I believe pizzagate/pedogate is real, however, these connections cannot be denied. H ow is this connected? Is it connected?</p>
<p>Could it be that this is, as Ben Garrison\'s portrayal of Skippy, is one colossal octupus with many, many different tentacles. Johnny looks at tentacle A and declares &quot;this is the truth!&quot;
Sally looks at tentacle B and declares, &quot;no, THIS is the truth!&quot; when in fact, they are both truth and both connected to the same body. </p>

            It calls to mind the fact that Osama bin Laden had been hiding out in Pakistan for so long before we supposedly killed him. Pakistan is indeed our ally and now I understand better why. Because there is so much money being made. A very lucrative mutual relationship for elites, but not citizens

            Jihadis fund operations all sorts of ways including child sex trafficking, the drug trade, illegal oil sales, organ harvesting, antiquities theft, or anything else that makes money. Osama bin Laden, who used to work with the Pakistani ISI, was a narco terrorist according to a congressional fact finding mission that went over there to look into terrorist funding. Boko haram kidnapped hundreds of school girls a few years ago to use as sex slaves.  These people blow up historical sites and think they are honoring the almighty.  These are some of the worst people in all of history and the CIA, ISI, Mossad and other similar organizations love working with these jokers because they create chaotic money making opportunities wherever they go.  Ordo ab chao. The problem is that these chaotic puppets keep turning on their masters all the time. McCain said we need to fund moderate jihadis to overthrow Assad. Hillary thought we needed to give them stinger missiles and sarin gas.  I don't get it.  It all seems way too risky even for the supposed beneficiaries.

            Yes this has to connect to Webb's evidence thus far. He has just put together the Awan Spy Ring Pakistani intelligence that had infiltrated the democratic congress up to the whitehose were using rice inmports as a way to smuggled heroin inside Mangos. If anyone remembers the emails between HRC, Podesta, Jake Sullivan in the Whitehouse discussing Mangos often it was about heroin smuggling. That has been proven.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rice was used as a way to hide the true shipment. Also different smell to throw off narcotics sniffing dogs. Webb has the Rat Line traced flying into Chicago &amp; paticulary Gary, Indiana a small airport. There are pictures.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday he tracked them to Texas. Waco was of several cities mentioned
Encourage you to share with him he gives credit to all contributors.

            Bingo.  The small airport.  Is the hospital near the airport and the rice fields or not very far?  Perfect scenario.  Who works those rice fields?  Possible missing people that would not be reported, taken to hospital and the airport facilitates as well.  Just a few thoughts.  This is definitely a place to dig, and dig deep.

             Yes!!!! Good thoughts...linking locations/destinations as Webb has in his video. He wonders aloud about a Casino being near a hospital...within walking distance. Would be easy to grab a few Deplorables here and there harvest organs, etc without many noticing, and sure the local news won't cover it.

              Yes.  Thanks.  I have to say that Wolftrail7272 taught me most of what I know and reading posts as well.  After hearing Webb's  video I looked around a little and found out the Casino is across from the hospital it was  watershed moment. A lot of poor people down on their luck go to casinos hoping for that one win.  A few free drinks and they are whisked away across the street.  What a set up.

               No doubt. It is seriously taking advantage of the unwitting, the unknowing, the down and out, etc. I can't stand it. I even walk around now each and every day with a different mindset...the "what's really going on here" mindset. So many people aren't even remotely aware of the true scope of this nefarious activity, and I would venture to guess that we don't truly know the scope.

                Every time I think I have heard the worst of this, there is more.  I am so glad I am part of this and getting half the news ahead of time, for there will be a horrible coming out later when the dam bursts.  That is how I got my friend to listen, by telling her she had better open her eyes and mind to it now, because it is happening and she will not be able to absorb it when the truth comes out.

             National foreign leaders are supported by the US state dept and intelligence for the precise reason they are willing to play ball "the American way," which means they will gladly exploit their own nation's resources (including its children) for a piece of the big pie. This is how presidents and prime ministers get to be presidents and PMs (read John Perkins' books). And most national leaders are compromised themselves which means they no choice but to follow the greater agenda as laid out before them. So national leaders &amp; intelligence agencies are all involved to some extent, but can vary greatly as to how deep they are in it. Drugs, weapons &amp; child trafficking are the three most valuable "resources" that leaders can trade on for personal profit.

            It would not surprise me at all if there is a child trafficking connection to Pakistan via Hillary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you ever look at the list of countries that Hillary visited, many, many of them have some of the highest number of child orphans and many are known for being heavily involved in child trafficking.  For instance, Romania, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia, Malawi,
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is an example of a Clinton Controversy in Nigeria when she did not designate Boko-haram as a terrorist organization, even after they kidnapped nearly 300 girls.

            Hillary also visited Pakistan:

            It just seems she visited countries where she could promised them something in return for something.......many of the countries she visited  had "a surplus" of orphans to deal with:   and there were people she knew would take some of them.   Could it be she was brokering deals in child trafficking all over the globe?

               The "normies" in the Middle East have good reason to want to expel our influence. We literally eat their children, and run their countries as puppet states. A lot of them are going to die soon, as the next step for NWO is the creation of greater Israel. There will be a false flag attack and Trump will initiate a ground war on behalf of Jewdom.

             Wasn't that the website which first noted Obama running to Tahiti to hide out after visiting the judge in Hawaii and Buffet in Omaha.  This was immediately after a big drug bust on the Lady Michelle.  I believe that website was the first to make that call and everything checked out.

              Sorcha Fall = David Booth.  If you read the "disclaimer" on the site, he admits that he posts FICTION there.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have no knowledge of that site EVER reporting anything truthful or accurate.  It is the bane of conspiracy forums because idiots like what they read there and run with it.

            OP this is a great post with lots of info packed in a small space! I love Garrison's cartoons.  I tweet them all the time.  He has definitely redpilled quite awhile ago.  Worth digging into this cesspool.

            Got it. I understand now. Yes they love to be the fox guarding the hen house. Here is one example where the police in Haiti arrested a bunch of sex traffickers and "johns". Some of those arrested were working for children's charities. The worst part is the perps were let go. It's pure insanity:

              I hope so. I have written letters to every single representative in Congress asking this be addressed and investigated. I'm sure they are sick of me bothering them by now, but so far I have received no replies.

            "The Congressional Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus is credited with nationalizing the successful AMBER Alert system."

           <p>
            Ok. What's next?

            "I find this strange because same source says"
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok (expecting something that doesn't jive with nationalizing the Amber Alert system).
           </p>
           <p>
            "Lampson sponsored legislation to fund law enforcement efforts to stop child pornography and exploitation on the Internet."
           </p>
           <p>
            You lost me here. Lampson sponsored legislation to help stop child pornography. Why is that inconsistent with nationalizing the Amber Alert system?
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like both dovetail nicely in fact. Could you explain in more detail what you're thinking? I'm sure it's valid, I just have a hard time understanding the specifics.

             I guess that was poorly worded. It was odd to me as viewed by the questions regarding his other connections. I was trying to reconcile his actions. His whole congressional career and elections, although nothing overt, always carried a whiff of impropriety. The missing childrens caucus and Amber Alert seem noble things, so why would a former Republican congressman, if an honorable man, be employed by a man of highly questionable character? Why would he schmooze with Hill with all her baggage? Birds of a feather flock together. At who's behest, if any, did he formulate the Missing and Exploited Children Caucus and at who's behest did he pursue nationalizing Amber Alert and is it in anyway connected to the Pakistani ties he has now, since Hill seems to be so deferential to the Pakistani ties? Those ties go back some years. Or was it all completely as it seems, concern for missing children. I have not had time to look at the legislation nor at the 120 caucus members. I guess my suspicious mind is questioning if his intent in the caucus and Amber Alert is true or is nefarious.

             By no means am I saying Lampson is involved in pedophilia, but that kind of crime cannot be practiced so openly, and it seems, with so much public knowledge in high places, without aiding and abetting and turning of the head from others, and to what gain would others aid and abet? By law, they are just as culpable as the actual perpetrator.

u can see a bunch of ismailis ..well heeled ones ..roaming around kensington in groups marching to thier ismaili centre
they are very close to the windsors..pakistan is a mi6 satellite..a mountbatten invention ..
the hanovers are connected viamaternal bloodlines to the house of orange...templar connections to the house of orange are recorded ..
the system of bills of exchange was a technology transfer of the ismailis to the champagne markets ...controlled by templar families ..moved to burges , amsterdam , then london 
they now how to farm human cattle for their energies , human parts and blood...guaranteed by a system of banking human credit into their system to provide liquidity for their further human farming technologies...next stop human augmentation

               Interesting because Canada's PM Justin Trudeau is very close with Aga Khan and vacationed with him at Christmas as I recall in the newspapers. Canadas fucked.

              I totally understand what you're saying. Yes anyone working with Hillary Clinton on anything is suspect. They're either a victim or a co-conspirator. There are no exceptions. The woman is the purest form of evil I have ever seen in my life.

               I agree. She is cruel and I am sick of her getting away with so many crimes.

              There may be no Pakistani ties to this but it seems daily with more and more coming out about the Awans (Pakistanis) infiltration, Nick Lampson is a link in the chain between Hillary, Amber Alert on one side and Pakistani ISI on the other side. I'm just ruminating that possible connection.
