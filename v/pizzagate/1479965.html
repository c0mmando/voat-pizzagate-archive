            A spiral is not generally considered a pedo symbol. If you study the FBI pedo information, it's specifically a triangle formation, a triangle inside a triangle or a heart inside a heart or a hand inside a hand. A typical spiral is VERY common and isn't a pedo symbol.

            The site you linked to is a stock image site used by MANY graphic designers and other business - these companies service millions. HIGHLY doubtful that there is any porn hidden there. And if you, personally, did not actually see any clearly pornographic imagery of children (the images you posted are nowhere near inappropriate) then it is careless and completely unproductive for you to post "filled with child pornography" or even allude to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if you haven't personally seen porn on this site, MODS need to remove this post. You are very close to slandering a business and you're discrediting PG. If you have seen porno imagery on this site - you need to report it.

             As you can see here, the spiral means LITTLE boy lover, whereas the triangle spiral is just boy lover.

             I'm not smearing anyone.  If you go to Bing image search right now and search the term "dreamstime.com nn" suddenly you are shown dreamtime hosted images of real child pornography.  They are hosting it and use the little boy lover pedo logo for their business logo.
            </p>
            <p>
             THAT'S why I am saying there needs to be an investigation.

              You're missing the subtlety of the triangular shape of the FBI example - it is more rounded but it is certainly still triangular. These details matter.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not real sure what you mean by "dreamstime.com nn"  - I did a search on a couple different engines and found a Chinese origin page that has both straightforward adult porn with some likely very "barely legal" images, too. And it also had amateur and benign stills (from a pedo perspective) that seem to have been found online (this is why you should not post pics of your kids online!!) that were co-opted by this site (and while they are certainly not 'porn' it is easy to assume a pedo will treat them as such). And all this is mixed in with stock imagery from dreamstime.com.
             </p>
             <p>
              At this point, it is not logical to state that the company is sharing/dealing pedo porn. The statement you should make is that their images are being used on a site that seems to have some questionable images of children and that maybe it needs to be looked into. But I doubt that it will take a high priority with LE - it's just too marginal. Better yet, I'd ask some hackers look into those larger images and see if there is anything hidden in them.
             </p>
             <p>
              You are saying more than calling attention to something you think should be investigated - you are declaring that this company is involved and making detailed claims about a topic that is one of the most serious of our time. Resources are thin and there are many wild goose chases. I'm just trying to help you clarify your statements for efficiency and relevance to help you and others refine your sleuthing methodologies.

            I found the next link in the chain, and I am so sick and so furious.
           </p>
           <p>
            While doing some Photoshop work for pizzagate, I found this photo:
            <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-photos-man-holding-slice-pizza-image29658738">
             https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-photos-man-holding-slice-pizza-image29658738
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I was taken aback by the pedo symbol being right on the pic as a watermark, so I went to the photo's hosting site dreamstime.com. They use the toddler lover symbol for their logo and watermark.
           </p>
           <p>
            I decided to do some image searches on Bing to see what other photos are on their site, and I discovered that they're a stock image company with child pornography on their site.
           </p>
           <p>
            I image searched on Bing, (Google doesn't find) for NN, young, child, nude, and these bring up countless images of real child pornography and tons of children with broken eyes that made me cry for hours after seeing them.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to take action.  I feel like I'm dying inside as I see this shit and I can't dig this rabbit hole further. I am in great emotional distress after what I saw, and I am now handing this investigation to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please move the investigation forward on this, and be careful out there, there be monsters here.

             Found your post because I saw a generic stock image on bing with the spiral and had the same suspicion you did and went through their site &amp; had the same conclusions. I found your post because I just searched dreamstimes on voat after having your same exact experience. Don't doubt it, the site definitely has inappropriate photos on it, and that logo would be a beacon light signalling the pervs right to it.

             Radio you are on to something.  Don't let the detractors get you.  Dig!

             Try to see what you can find on the people posting there.  You may run across something good (not just boy pics).

              I found way worse photos in a few mins, unfort. I wouldn't link them though. Not exactly sure what you meant by run across something "good", nothing good about these things, but there is far more concerning stuff easily accessible on there than the photo on this thread
