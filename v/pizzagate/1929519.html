<p>Honestly I don\'t think pasta would be that good 3 months later.  Why hasn\'t this been brought up earlier?  Did we miss this?  This is damning.

            PASTA=MARIJUANA. According to the urban dictionary one of the slang meanings of pasta =WEED although I've never heard it used before. That would mean in this case that that 3-month old pasta means not-so-fresh marijuana. T.M. wanted some fresher weed is what it sounds like, and Podesta had given her an earlier Christmas present of pot that was getting old. Consider it as a possible explanation which doesn't include pedo implications, at least in this particular instance.

            If you recall this email from December 24, 2015, which is Christmas Eve.

            If you look at the Satanic Calendar, it is customary to receive body parts of an infant male as a gift.

            So...

            The email in question here is from March 1, 2015, which is the day to celebrate St. Eichatadt according to the Satanic Calendar.

            It is customary to drink human blood for strength and homage to the demons.  The blood can be from a person of any age, male or female.

            My interpretation is this:  I strongly believe this is a satanic ritual abuse family who, although, do love their children, also have them abused sexually to dissociate and fracture their minds young. They likely were brought up the exact same way. I'd bet money Podesta loves doing this so he's likely a go to guy to send your kid to for this fucked up shit. Further, about the pasta, remember that pasta is a little boy, it may be possible that the McGuiness woman is trading her kid for a little boy that she is abusing for that time period. I know, beyond sick and messed up it's so hard to fathom but look at Hollywood elite families like the Hiltons, etc, all those kids had the same upbringing. No doubt about the fact that Podesta is a sick sadistic man. God help that poor child.

           <p>
            Unsure the implications of this chain, if any, but said I would add where I can. Not sure if ceddit will still have the old threads, but there used to be a dozen or so master threads for each mail drop that breaks down all these emails pretty well. the old sub where we broke them down was
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/DNCleaks">
             /r/DNCleaks
            </a>
            but as I understand the mods there were replaced shortly after the podesta emails and quite a lot of valuable content has been scrubbed.

            Oooh Lordy, this is not true.     The mis-assumptions about Italian food has, as an Italian, been one of the weirdest parts of this whole story.     But I believe this pasta is homemade.   From previous emails it appears John would make pasta and sauce and give them as Christmas gifts.

              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             , which is that a lot of people here earnestly believe that John Podesta's mom literally legally adopted 25 of his adult friends. (Although I remember one guy who recognized it as a common figure of speech but somehow decided that it meant she was the "elder female High Priestess" of 25 Satanic acolytes.)

              If you think about it, its actually a useful thing when people play devil's advocate. If this forum becomes an echo chamber where nobody can put any other ideas out in the search for truth then it will fail.  For your information, it is possible to disagree with what somebody says and state your case without calling somebody names. Calling somebody a "retard" only detracts from and invalidates the point that you are trying to make.

            Yes grandparents babysit kids.  But really, John Podesta.  People with that kind of money and power are busy folks, unlikely to babysit eh?  They hire nannies to watch the kids.  This man who is a mover and shaker in Washington DC is going to take time to watch someone else's kids?  Unlikely.

             You are making an argument from incredulity which means you are arguing against something simply by claiming you can't see how it would happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             This email is not describing a long venture. Why would you need a nanny? It seems like one visit. What does having money and power have to do with it? It's about somebody's preference. I know a really rich guy who spends his money on tortoises. Does that make sense to you? Answer: It doesn't matter, it just is true.
            </p>
            <p>
             After something has happened, it's probability of happening is 100%. For example, it seems really unlikely that someone would leave a bar at 1:30AM and then instead of going home walk the streets for hours making phone calls. But that's exactly what Seth Rich did the night he was murdered and the evidence of his phone calls shows this. So the likelihood he would do that that night is 100%. It no longer matters at all how unlikely it was the night before it happened or if I can understand this. It happened. And my own personal disbelief of why he would do this doesn't matter

                <p>
                 From the very first reports we know that he was on the phone with his girlfriend right before it happened.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  On the last night of his life, Rich stayed at the bar until it closed around 1:30 a.m., according to a Lou’s bartender.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Two hours and 49 minutes later he would be lying on a sidewalk, dying.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A log of Rich’s phone calls, compiled by the family, accounts for a large chunk of that time — about two hours 15 minutes. But it doesn’t explain why he took so long to make a walk home that should have taken about 40 minutes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There’s been much speculation that Rich went to another bar, the Wonderland Ballroom, after leaving Lou’s. But a person who spoke to him that night and agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity said he did not go there.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Rich placed at least five calls and received two incoming calls, according to the log. The first three were placed before closing time — two to his father, who’d gone to bed early and didn’t hear the ring, and one to a friend; they lasted only a minute.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Rich seems to have been on the phone with another friend, who had called him, when the bar closed. That 12-minute call ended at 1:33.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At 2:05, he called his girlfriend, who was in her home state of Michigan. They spoke for 89 minutes. Then the call dropped. A few minutes later, he called her again, and they spoke for 43 more minutes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At about 4:19 a.m., Rich told his girlfriend he was almost home and said, “I gotta go,” according to Rich’s father, who has spoken with his girlfriend. (She asked not to be named or quoted because of continuing harassment of those connected to the case.)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Rich didn’t sound alarmed. His girlfriend, according to a person familiar with the events of that night, went to bed thinking there was nothing amiss.
                 </p>

             He does not do this.    Read the email again.   He is the one they are visiting, the one who doesn't have to drive.  Y'all keep getting basic facts about these emails wrong.  Like straight up poor reading comprehension.

            This thing about 3 month old pasta being somehow "weird" drives me crazy. Dry pasta is good for a very long time. If the Podesta's make pasta, for a xmas gift, for example, I'm sure it would still be good in 3 mos. (Dry, homemade pastas.)
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm more concerned that the Podestas babysit anyone, than anything about pasta.

             Why would the reference a specific pasta that might not have been consumed yet?  Just say you want to have Pasta, not you want that pasta from a few months ago from Sheila's party.  Yeah, I think it is weird.

                Discretion has multiple meanings.  It means making good judgements in this case, not being private.  Shakespeare wrote that in the 1590s, so it is not modern usage.  Discretion is the better part of valor means not to be foolhardy.  In this case it means, let's not drive on an icy road

             Thanks freeagent37, there are many people out against my findings, some with good arguments.  I am just dumbfounded by the stature of the elite who think they could get away with this shit.  Harvesting peptides for creams is  real, and highly under regulated as 'synthetic peptides' technically and legally can be generated from 'raw materials' harvested from humans and resold as 'synthetic'.  THIS HAS TO STOP.

              I believe this has been happening for much longer than we can imagine...it just has been brought out in the open for all to see how broken this system is, how each individual must work to renew our world to protect and clean our shared living space here on earth....how ultimately the matrix has been protecting the criminals who made their way to the top of the pyramid. This has to STOP and will soon as the truth keeps spreading to our other sleepy family who are under the spell of this nasty disgusting groups who think they are untouchable.

             Given the email is from march and she says "Have to settle for the pasta john gave us at Christmas" .  The context is out of place, sure it could refer to dried past that John gave them during Christmas.

             The trick is that "discretion" was left out of the quote, the writer is asking if rescheduling an event might be a more cautious approach.

               I think you could be correct in saying that the weather was a factor and John Podesta was caring about the safety of his associate who was bringing over someone to 'babysit'.   Add the pasta talk and now I question the integrity of the interest for her and direct it back to him trying to cover his ass.

           <p>
            Why are you saying "fresh pasta?"  The email doesn't say that.
           </p>

            It's pretty clear what Podesta means by Discretion is the better part of valor.   There is bad weather and traffic
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             So that's our ice encased wiper and taste of the traffic we are in. Suffice to say we will not make it tonight,
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So he is asking is it smarter to cancel the get-together rather than have people stuck in bad weather and traffic.  That phrase is "said when you believe it is wise to be careful and avoid unnecessary risks."

              Your a fucktard - You must not be too smart, your attempt to make it appear as if I don't know what I was talking about.   The paper you referenced clearly notes C3P16 as a peptide.  They even note where they purchased the peptide for the study.  "The C3 Peptide P16 was purchased from Fischer Scientific, Pittsburg, PA USA."

             I am sure we wished we could all go back to those simpler times of fancy gourmet packages of Christmas pasta (real noodles).

               I know.  But think of how others (who don't know about any of this) will feel.  It will all come crashing down at once.  What?  Pizza? Pasta? Cheese?

                I just posted a question on my Facebook page to my friends, many of whom I've known for years, "How would you react if officials announced that we never landed on the moon. In fact, nobody has." I thought it was a mundane example-- as compared to Pizzagate. But most of my friends lost their shit. And when I changed the question to something like, "What if they came forward with proof that we've been colonizing Mars for decades?" They just couldn't handle it-- liberals, conservatives, people of all ages. It was a good reality check for me because my mind has become so elastic since I researched Pizzagate a year ago and discovered it wasn't just a nutty conspiracy. If more people were willing to research to find the truth, I think they would be better equipped to deal with the truth. Regardless, the truth needs to come out because there are victims out there, and counting, who deserve to be released from their Hell.

                 I know exactly what you mean.  I told my brother and sister in law about the Child Trafficking and the Clintons, other Dems and Republicans, and they could not handle it.  They believed that the CIA could be involved with Drugs but no not the Clintons.  I wanted to scream my head off because they have some idea about the 911 truths but that was under the Bush years.  They for sure would not believe the Clintons would be involved.  I am on here almost every day all day pushing and hoping and commenting and researching in hopes that working together we can bring the truth out to the masses.  As you say it must be revealed.  But I also know it will not be pretty. They will resort to whatever they have to do to keep it under wraps.

                  The most important thing in all this to me, and the thing I have to remember because it gives me tremendous strength, is that unlike the Luciferians, the NWO, and the rest of the dark forces, we have the Creator on our side. We are of the light and love. Darkness can't fill the light, but the light can fill the darkness.

                   I cannot wait to let that light fill the world and bring all of this out in the open. I do believe that Go(o)d will overcome the  (d)Evil,  I noticed a few years ago that God was within the word Good and that Evil was within the word Devil.  So I am going to believe Good WILL overpower Evil.
