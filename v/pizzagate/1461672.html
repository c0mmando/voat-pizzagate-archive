            Bruh I can only remember hearing the term for describing the daily show  which in fact had always been the place most millennials get their news LOL. In fact I recall in high school when kids would wana debate Iraq and I didn't wanna embarrass myself so I'd admit openly "I dunno haha i get my news from the daily show don't ask me"
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is low info people have been convinced that their opinion is as valid as anyone else's. Could even be part of an overall plot of public education to keep ppl ignorant rather than mere coddling.
           </p>
           <p>
            So since that day I started reading widely and soon settled pretty far to the right and with loudmouth low info ppl I say: "dude why are you talking to me like we are equals? You clearly don't know shit".
           </p>
           <p>
            It tends to make you unpopular and I've lost a lot of pussy lately cuz I won't go along with SJW shit but then u don't wanna risk impregnating an R and if enoigh dudes were like me theyd die out

            I know bro and didn't wna hijack but it pisses me off. Btw after I saw the gunman shit I checked google news and abt 17 of 19 stories had "fake news" in the headline and that pissed me off almost equally, its definitely the most Orwellian term coined in decades. The uniformity with which everyone adopted it as if it had always existed bothrs me as much as the smearing intent!

            And thats letting them win and should change. What if he was your grampa youd be bitch slapping people. Dude was thrown out of office, branded as a self loathing queer and drank himself to death at 54. And a ww2 vet. A lies inertia is no excuse to perpetuate it. So now ya know! Fuck liberal mythology

            This is interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The MSM in the election and now with Pizzagate are acting as though they are PRAVDA in a Soviet-style system.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, the internet has created a democracy of news reporting where ANYONE has access to the world.   By attacking it as 'conspiracy' people know to look further.   They've shown during the election how much they lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this is more a symptom of the dead media (newspapers) not realizing they are already six feet under.

            FYI McCarthy was a great American patriot and has been fully vindicated and opinion polls of the time show that lmost zero people considered there to be anticommunist hysteria or witch hunts.

            It should tell you something that Hollywood cunts make so many films demonizing him. He knew they were traitors and they had to destroy him.  Honor this brave man by correcting any historical illiterates u meet.
