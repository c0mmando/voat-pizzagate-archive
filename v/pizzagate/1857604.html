<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Turning this data into a piece of investigation, it implicates that in Vermont every 250th child is a reported victim while is South Dakota only every 7290th child is a reported victim. Considering there can\'t be such a huge difference in the amount of pedophiles between States, this clearly indicates false (too few) reported cases in the States in the bottom of the list. Hawaii and Puerto Rico are pretty obvious to be false, but for example <strong>Washington</strong> is surprisingly bad, and some citizen activity and journalistic efforts to make people aware of this are clearly needed.</p>
<p>The data also indicates that in the States in the bottom of the list the sexual child abuse is a more organized crime (same children being used by several pedophiles), assuming that there\'s somewhat equal amount of pedophiles all over. Having States like Hawaii, Puerto Rico, California, Georgia and Washington, known of having more organized crime in general, in the bottom of the list supports this conclusion.</p>
<p>For me, it seems that the States in the top of the list are actually safer for the kids, authorities doing their reporting better. This, however, can\'t be confirmed only by this data, as we don\'t know how reliable the reporting is in these States either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I will add the source to the minor population data and to a University study claiming that 13% later. I\'m away for the weekend and can\'t access my bookmarks, so I\'ll probably add these on Monday (wasn\'t easy to link even that first pdf being on mobile, but I needed to have at least one source already to follow the rules). I hope you can tolerate with this for a couple of days.</p>

           Turning this data into a piece of investigation, it implicates that in Vermont every 250th child is a reported victim while is South Dakota only every 7290th child is a reported victim. Considering there can't be such a huge difference in the amount of pedophiles between States, this clearly indicates false (too few) reported cases in the States in the bottom of the list. Hawaii and Puerto Rico are pretty obvious to be false, but for example
           <strong>
            Washington
           </strong>
           is surprisingly bad, and some citizen activity and journalistic efforts to make people aware of this are clearly needed.
          </p>
          <p>
           The data also indicates that in the States in the bottom of the list the sexual child abuse is a more organized crime (same children being used by several pedophiles), assuming that there's somewhat equal amount of pedophiles all over. Having States like Hawaii, Puerto Rico, California, Georgia and Washington, known of having more organized crime in general, in the bottom of the list supports this conclusion.
          </p>
          <p>
           For me, it seems that the States in the top of the list are actually safer for the kids, authorities doing their reporting better. This, however, can't be confirmed only by this data, as we don't know how reliable the reporting is in these States either.

            Note: I will add the source to the minor population data and to a University study claiming that 13% later. I'm away for the weekend and can't access my bookmarks, so I'll probably add these on Monday (wasn't easy to link even that first pdf being on mobile, but I needed to have at least one source already to follow the rules). I hope you can tolerate with this for a couple of days.

            Thanks for the work you put in...
Stands to reason that 'Sanctuary' cities would not report anything to the Fed government regarding crimes by illegal immigrants that they don't have too, and would be willing to overlook crimes in order to protect them.  Little wonder pedo supporting political groups like BAMN want Open Borders, easy access to more vulnerable populations of kids.  Abortion on demand with no questions asked enables the cover-up of pedo victims as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            In regards to "Civil Rights Marxist Activists"... Is the groundwork for legal sex tourism being laid by all these groups (knowingly or unknowingly?).  Sexual tourism in regards to underage victims doesn't necessarily involve pedophiles exclusively but could involve anyone.  It also involves huge potential profits with an easy product if Open Borders really becomes globalized; child sexual trafficking would flourish 100 fold.  No wonder greedy Soros/Clinton salivate at the untapped power and money on the horizon of "Civil Societies".  Sell children AND be lauded with all the Peace Prizes and accolades within the closed system for the Elites.

            As I originally posted, I believe that a lot of pedophilia crimes don't get reported by the victims because of the trauma of embarrassment. I believe between 10-15 of the US population has been sexually assaulted in some way, most afraid to come out or can't. Some of the victims are killed and never found.

             I think the number may be higher.  I've been looking into people who can be classified as "narcissistic" and I feel they may be survivors also.  I saw a study that said almost 30% of college students have Narc tendencies. I know correlation does not mean causation.

             Look at how many times complaints against Sandusky were ignored by police. I have a funny feeling the numbers are shockingly higher due to under reporting.  This post is a damn good start, thank you OP.

             but the number is even far higher taking other forms of sexual abuse along (stalking, flashing, groping etc). In my current understanding, as many as one in three women face some kind of sexual abuse before they reach age of 18.

            First thank you for the time and effort and please don't let my comments discourage you. I have a problem understanding your logic about how "there can't be such a huge difference in the amount of pedophiles between states". Knowing that there are different types of child molesters and that some of those types like to band together in groups and that some types prefer to live in area were ease of access is high and will move to reside in such a location. Remember, ease of access can not be defined by population level alone. What do you use to support the assumption that percentage per population should be close to the same state to state? I do agree that greater efforts need to be employed in reporting and tracking these numbers and that there are uncountable cases of cover ups. Keep up the good work.

             Yes indeed.  Another factor is that pedos -- and other sex offenders on the registries -- move to states where the laws are more lenient.  AZ is chock full of convicted CA pedos and other sex offenders for that reason.

             In addition, there are population density as well as culture.  One wouldn't expect to find similar numbers comparing California with Wyoming, for example.

              I agree with that equineluvr, happy to vote up here.

              But what seems more important as first is to check if those numbers matches with the ones reported by each State. Happy for help on that.

              Good to know, thank you. AZ also has the ease of access with a quick jaunt across the border and the many border crossings.

             This is an important note, thanks. As stated in the conclusions, there are States where the same victims are used by several pedos (more organized crime) but even that doesn't manage to explain the difference in this scale (28 times more between the both ends of the list).
            </p>
            <p>
             The amount of pedophilia (assumed close to similar) doesn't match with "percentage per population should be close to the same" (it shouldn't, noting the organized aspect). What would be required to believe that the data was accurate, would be that there's 28 pedophiles for one victim against 1 pedophile for one victim in each end, and I really don't think that's possible. The gap is simply too wide, indicating false reporting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Supporting false reporting theory, there's also this: State (VA) reporting 2,954 minor victims of forcible sex in 2014 (page 23:
             <a href="http://www.vsp.virginia.gov/downloads/Crime_in_Virginia/Crime_in_Virginia_2014.pdf">

             </a>
             ) compared to 653 reported by the feds (the data in my post) for the next year.
