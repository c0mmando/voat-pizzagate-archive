<p>This is not to say she doesn\'t CLAIM to be Majestic Ape, or that she doesn\'t sometimes pose as the character.</p>
<p>I keep seeing posts and memes alleging this, like this one I saw earlier on Facebook: 
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/arVh3">http://imgur.com/a/arVh3</a></p>
<p>So I feel like we need some clarity.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate some of the false information, I wanted to make a post about Majestic Ape and Amanda Kleinman, as I am relatively certain they are not one in the same. In fact, I think <em>Majestic Ape is Alefantis.</em> At least sometimes. Possibly, it could be multiple people, but for the most part, it is not often Kleinman, although the band will have you believe it is. She calls it her \'performance character\' although considering they have been onstage at the same time and the face doesn\'t seem to compare to Kleinman\'s more often than not.</p>
<p>In videos, despite the distorted voice, it is a voice belonging to a MALE (feminine qualities, sure, but a man portraying himself as a woman isn\'t going to hit his manliest notes). <em>It\'s a man in drag.</em></p>
<p>Based on this image I posted above, comparing the facial features, it looks to be Alefantis, imo, and from what I can tell, for the most part, Majestic Ape has only made \'her\' appearances at DC-area shows (correct me if I\'m wrong). I know this has been ever-so-slightly addressed on this forum in earlier threads but in case you missed it, you can compare the two photos:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/YdYDW">http://imgur.com/a/YdYDW</a></p>
<p>Amanda Kleinman IS a real person. A real woman, a teacher (she even has a \'safe\' profile on facebook for her teacher personality under the name Amanda K-Teacher), who is indeed in the band Heavy Breathing. I\'ve seen on voat people repeatedly say she is the SINGER. Wrong. You will find her on keyboard in this video: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRQI8huoP0Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRQI8huoP0Q</a></p>
<p>Here in this interview you\'ll see it points out that <em>Kleinman is the keyboardist</em>: <a href="https://hometownsoundsdc.com/2013/12/12/interview-with-heavy-breathing/">https://hometownsoundsdc.com/2013/12/12/interview-with-heavy-breathing/</a></p>
<p>They are a 3-piece act. The image below is of the band The Apes, an older band that all three members of Heavy Breathing were in. The man holding the leaf is Erick. The man on the far left is Jeff, and obviously that\'s Amanda on the far right. The interview I posted above has a more recent representation of them to confirm they are a trio and Majestic Ape is not a member of the act:

            No offense, but I really don't think ja is majestic ape. It seems like people just pulled that out of the air for some odd reason, in many vids, it's obvious that her body, teeth, and hands are very obviously a woman. I feel like people want to believe JA is MA so that women can't be evil or pedos, very strange and backwards.  OTPROPHET already discussed everything else. Note: actually dig and don't believe strange logic, it just takes 10 min.

            You are correct, per your source (12/12/13 interview with Heavy Breathing) Amanda Kleinman is is the keyboardist.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to that same interview,  she is also the one who wears the mask and uses the voice modulator:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Amanda, what’s with the mask?"
           </p>
           <p>
            "AK: The mask started because Apes toured constantly, and I loved all of our singers, but we always felt like there was a missing human element. We wanted the singers to have more of a banter, more of an ease. And there were also so many nights where you’re in Epsilon, Michigan on a Tuesday night, and it’s pouring, and the only person in the bar is the barmaid… So it’s like this game with yourself: What am I going to do to make myself laugh and feel comfortable before I get on stage? And that ski mask started because I put it on and I stood at a mirror, and I was making scary faces to crack myself up to chill out.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were situations in the early years where no one knew that I was a little short girl. I had dudes in Cincinnati respond to that [deep, effect-manipulated] voice saying, “I’ll take you out in the parking lot and kick your ass, fucker.” I love that part of the show, I really do."
           </p>
           <p>
            You allege there are instances that the keyboardist and "Majestic Ape" appear on stage at the same time, but fail to provide evidence to support that claim.

            Here is Kleinman in 2004 clearly identified as Majestic Ape, wearing a ski mask, with the caption:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             When a band is introduced by Amanda as Majestic Ape as Lee, you know you're in for something special.

            ". Remember that these people are artists and performers (as distasteful as that may be), and that Majestic Ape is a character for Kleinman's performances, usually before the band plays. In any case, they are going for shock value and creepiness, and "
            <strong>
             Lee
            </strong>
            " is Majestic Ape as a transvestite called Lee. It's all part of the creepy act, she is purposefully trying to sound like a creepy transexual when using the voice modulator and wearing the Majestic Ape mask and outfit. Here is a recording of that on their website of "Lee":

I am going to start writing again. I am going to be writing often. Ape life never stops but I had been keeping an anonymous secret blog since early January and devoted quite a bit of time to it. It was a blog that I have been needing to write for quite some time. I had been wanting to incorporate elements of the secret blog into this one but I got the stop/block warning from my crew. So I went under.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, its not springtime. I usually associate springtime with feelings-- the only feelings that I allow myself. Not anymore. I am a female AND I play music. I can still have feelings. My feelings right now are that WE HAVE A GREAT FUCKING RECORD COMING OUT AND I AM EXCITED!
            </p>
            <p>
             WE ARE GOING TO START TOURING AGAIN AND I AM EXCITED!

              My name is Amanda
             </strong>
             , and I play organ/keyboards for this band called Apes. We are based in Washington, DC and we have been together officially since 1999. I have been playing music with two of these fools since I was 15.

            Amanda Kleinman is vulnerable for charges. She's the weak link hence these shills coming out of the woodwork to obfuscate what is known. Ms. Kleinman works with children and is open to real charges being leveled against her for her actions/words.

            Yet you keep ignoring the videos and images where Majestic Ape is onstage simultaneously with Amanda Kleinman.
           </p>
           <p>
            And this explains why you abruptly end the conversation, because you have nothing to explain that away with. It just doesn't fit your narrative so you ignore it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, just looking at the mouth of the face beneath the ski mask and comparing it to the face of Kleinman would shut down what you're alleging, but if you haven't read what I posted or acknowledged the two being onstage together at points, you're probably not likely to investigate enough to analyze both faces.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even with the information you've provided, all you are able to say is the BAND tells people Kleinman is Majestic Ape, but we aren't exactly dealing with angelic, honest souls here...

            This is probably the 12th thread I've read about this. I decided long ago that the costume is likely shared by Alefantis and Kleinman.

             As I said, there have been threads about elements of this, sure, yet still people are confusing it or not being entirely clear. Any mistakes made will be taken advantage of by those pushing the "fake news" narrative or those who refuse to believe it, so we have to establish consistency. It needs clarity for people evidently.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first image I posted was a meme that was getting a lot of traction in the facebook groups for pizzagate, so I felt compelled to make a comprehensive thread on the issue, since clearly people are still spreading incomplete information or complete falsehoods. There is obvious confusion, and maybe Kleinman just says in interviews and official docs that she's Majestic Ape so Alefantis won't have documented affiliation like that. It could be an alter-ego that he may not wanna publicly own up to, for whatever reason...
            </p>
            <p>
             I could buy the sharing idea, even though that doesn't explain why... But perhaps the whole concept of the "Majestic Ape" was meant to be a rotating role.

            I'm not confusing things. I'm saying that it's untrue that it's Amanda Kleinman, seeing as Majestic Ape has been onstage simultaneously with Amanda Kleinman, which I've also posted, so it simply cannot be Amanda Kleinman -- and most of us agree that it is in no way a woman, rather a man in drag, so regardless of what the band chose to tell the SFist website (maybe misleading Majestic's identity intentionally -- read through the other comments, this could be because multiple people play the role, but it's not Amanda - at least not in the live footage we've seen).
           </p>
           <p>
            Also you could consider SFist assumed Majestic Ape was Kleinman and this is not accurate information on their part. All signs (other than this one line on a website you're showing me which I have already seen) point to this not being her.
           </p>
           <p>
            By alleging MA is Amanda, when YouTube still has live footage wherein both MA and Amanda are next to each other, it's only you who is confusing things and unwilling to accept this new information. That's the mentality and approach that hurts the investigation. I'm a mod here, and take this whole story very seriously - trust I'm not confusing things.

            What you are saying is not entirely true. Amanda Kleinman was in the band The Apes, yes, but she is the keyboard player in Heavy Breathing, and isn't the red-masked Majestic Ape, at least not at the times they've both been in the same room.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're wrong, and it seems you didn't read any of my post or go to the links I've provided that prove this.
           </p>
           <p>
            You seem to be the one confused here, no offense.

            Did you read my post or did you just blindly comment? Because I definitely covered Heavy Breathing and who they are, and I definitely said they were 3/4 of The Apes, so why you're responding with this info is beyond me -- but either way,  Amanda is
            <strong>
             NOT
            </strong>
            "Majestic Ape". She is the keyboardist of the band.

            I've seen pics where it is a girl, and pics where it is Alefantis for certain. He has a distinctive mouth and smile, theres a couple pics where its clearly him, but then I've seen some where its not him.

             <em>
              always
             </em>
             look like Alefantis -- some of the music videos where Majestic Ape does a voice over doesn't even quite sound the same either, you're right.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not necessarily saying Amanda has never donned the mask - she almost certainly does/has, considering the group apparently tells media and gives the overall illusion she is the one and only Majestic Ape. More often than not, I don't even think the 'character' looks like it has Kleinman's features tbh.

            That's what I'm thinking. Even if you're using downvoting as a disagree button, most people here legitimately investigating the topic would have addressed what it was exactly they disagreed with...

            Look at the video The Neutered Noel (if you can stomach it) it's here
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1457070">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1457070
            </a>
            .  Also you can look up threads here about it.  Close ups of MA in at least this video clearly show a differnt set of lips under the mask than when Alefantis appears in a red mask (which he most certainly does in at least some photos)  His wide smirk is unmistakable, A Kleinman's appearance for example in the Noel video close up shows lips that are clearly different- more feminie, a clear dip in the middle of the top lip, even a touch of lip gloss.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Kleinman was on the road and was in some of these videos - she provides plausable denial as a "beard" to Alefantis who can deny ever donning the mask.  My theory is that he is the impresario behind the video productions and some of the music, AK is just a performer and beard.  She may have been raised in mind control situations, and she at times refers to herself as "Puppet".

             Could it be possible then that "Majestic Ape" is multiple people or at least people have posed as Majestic Ape in instances/locations where Alefantis couldn't reprise the role? They might even be mouthing words that Alefantis has earlier recorded.

             Interesting that my post is getting downvotes. I'm modding here and I know this doesn't violate side rules, and if it's poor information in places, I'd asked people to address that so I could make corrections. In regards to pizzagate, unjustifiable downvotes are sometimes a good thing, but Idk if I'm necessarily onto anything

              It would be my guess as well that the Majestic Ape character is indeed 'changeable' and that is why the disguise is worn.

              You could be getting downvotes because of your headline - it is pretty established that Kleinman is in the band at least at times and in some of the videos, so that headline is pretty extreme.   I would delete, change your headline and repost.  Up to you.  I don't think it's unreasonable to question whether Kleinman herself isn't multiple personalities, handled by Alefantis, who could himself be split.  Heavy Breathing is heavy stuff we are dealing with.

                hmm yes, I misread that.   weird I wonder if it confuses others too.   However, Majestic Ape is in all (some of?) the Heavy Breathing videos, have you looked through them?  You'll notice in the Noel video other band members wear the red mask, so it's not exclusive to AK.

                 Did you go to the links I provided? There is literally no mention of Majestic Ape being a member of the band, particularly on the page with the band interview. MA is not in most of their images either, and I have seen live footage where 'she' made no appearance whatsoever.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To me, Majestic Ape is more like their mascot than anything. She is definitely not a member of the band and in video footage I've studied, it appears to be a man in drag, without a doubt, and imo it's James.

                  Here's one where it's clearly not alefantis mouth, I would say it is AK, but she is just a "model" I guess not playing instrument -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTnxBwfZH0M

                 <p>
                  Here's a video that does a good comparison of Alefantis mouth with SOME photos of MA -

                  I've seen a few live performance videos of the band with Kleinman definitely performing in no mask, waving her hair around, like what you posted.

                  Alefantis I think considered himself the real Majestic Ape (huge ego, I hate to paint this picture but I'd bet he looks in the mirror all the time and calls himself that - yuk), his face was posted into some of the weird images in the videos, and it may be him in the video I No Luv

                   I wouldn't say regarding the first video that it's
                   <em>
                    clearly
                   </em>
                   not Alefantis' mouth. To be honest it does look a little like his closed mouth in this image:
                   <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cxva3AIVIAEJR5a.jpg">
                    https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cxva3AIVIAEJR5a.jpg
                   </a>
                   I'm willing to consider it isn't him though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That said, she's not talking or anything in that footage, and maybe the reason for that is they had someone else play the role for some of these promo videos. Supposing they have different people wear the mask, I can say with almost 100% confidence that the Majestic Ape in the widespread video who was cracking weird jokes on Sasha Lord's birthday is none other than James himself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   While it's certainly possible that it's not James all the time, and even possible I'm wrong about it being James in the aforementioned video, the fact remains: Amanda Kleinman is
                   <em>
                    NOT
                   </em>
                   Majestic Ape, and that really needs to be emphasized here and in other areas, because from the looks, some people still think otherwise.

            I agree I never thought it was her. Always seemed distinctively male. Looks like alifantis to me
