            Musk is sponsored by the International bankers and his company is part of agenda 21. However, this may be the case of a scumbag on the inside being insulted and knowing pedo opperations when he sees it. Which might make sense why he was involved at all. On the other hand, now he is to prove it, which his masters would never allow. As always, Musk should have kept his toupee on and his mouth shut.

             Musk is a Narcissist and wanted to play the hero - when his attempts are thwarted he lashes out as is customary for a NARC. 
In order to regain his position at the center of attention he starts an argument and now a court case. 
Its just NARC behavior 101...  nothing to do with Pedos or Vernon or anything - when the world is looking make yourself the center of attention!

            I really think this guy has something to hide.He refused free legal council saying it didnt matter what he was saying.
Its as if someone has told the rescuer that it looks really suspicious  if you dont sue so you have to sue.
I feel the rescuer wants left alone but has to sue to look normal and not a pedo

            Did u guys watch Musk on Joe Rogans podcast? Odd guy but tries to come off as normal. He was hiding a lot of truth and not fully answering the questions freely. For someone with whom the media claims is off the rails on drug binges, he hardly took the toke and didn’t seem to know how which was really odd. The media is against him for some reason and this is the interesting part, he’s obviously done something against the plan. He also doesn’t drive his own Tesla cars, vintage Jaguar gas powered vehicle and private jets, so much for Global Warming Climate Change. He’s pushing the future and space bullshit. Who cares no one wants to live in space or go there. He also has secrets built into the cars he designs at Tesla which is disturbing. U push a secret button and play a certain song and the car dances ballet in a parking lot. Why? Don’t ever trust cars that can be remotely taken over or self driven.

             It is called an easter egg for the hidden song. They do it all the time in tv,movie, videogames, and music. Its not nefarious.

             Musk definitely does weird shit on his spare time. People have said they saw him in a sex orgy in burning man. He is like bill gates.. if bill gates smoked weed on a podcast its a good media story..

            This Daily Mail article is full of info.  Really Amazing.  There were close to 2K comments from readers.  All against Musk.  I think there is more t this story.  Why were so many boys brought there before.  Lots of boys knew about it and had been there.  Also Unsworth's 40 yr. old wife owns a Nail Salon there, in Thailand?  Nail Salons are known for prostitution here and there of young Asian girls and women.  Is she only a business partner or what and helped him get a 12 yr. old bride?  I am just visiting all options here.  That Pattaya Beach which is well known for pedos searching for kids, well it is pretty close to that area.  Are all those other boys brought there for pedo reasons?  Again just posing questions.

            According to another article I read by the BBC:  The Tham Luang Nang Non cave is the fourth longest in Thailand
           </p>
           <p>
            Why take them there then?  Why would he take those boys there?  I can't find an answer.  Danger abounds.  I am sorry none of the articles I have found seem to say why they went there and how they got in there.  There were shoes and bikes and bags found outside of the cave.

             They boys went there as an initiation rite/ dare as it was one of their birthdays. The plan was to write their names on the furthest back wall. Asian kids especially from Myanmar's ethnic groups tend to have a "Devil may Care" attitude to life. I have known so many that have died or been seriously injured over the years - gang fights, motorcycle accidents, falls, electrocution..

             Nail salons in Thailand are just nail salons they are not a front for something.  The prostitution thing you refer to is related to some Asian nail shops in the West that are usually Chinese owned. Karaoke and massage places are but adult only - underage gets a guaranteed jail sentence for the owner these days.

              Thanks, but I am shocked that the nail salons are nothing but, since Thailand is so well known for trafficking and a pedo magnate.  I still find it odd that this guy took them to do that.  The boys may have a devil may care attitude, but they are kids.  He is an adult and should have more sense.  After they were rescued they were invited by monks to stay there with them to decompress. We know that some of them have been charged with abuse.  This whole thing still stinks.

               I have lived in Thailand for more than two decades and am about 4 hours away from the caves.. None of the boys or coach have been charged with abuse or anything. Its a genuine story that cost the Thai tax payer millions of dollars. Once the Thais found out that they were Tai Lue and not Thai people there were some complaints on social media about wasting money on "these people".

               As I mentioned before the border is porous, in some areas you can get out of the car and literally take a step off the road and you're in Burma (Myanmar) no fence, no line nothing. So if someone was going to move people around they wouldn't do it through those caves. The ethnic armies that control areas around the border also won't let under age girls pass through the unofficial border road crossings. I know thats the case for the Shan army SSA. Thailand won't allow children to pass through the official borders either without an accompanying parent/ guardian.

                Sounds like there is not much chance for trafficking.  How in the world then is Thailand such a magnate for trafficking and pedophiles.  Either way I think Musk has something in his back pocket.  He's not that dumb to make such accusations without some knowledge of Unsworth's past.  We shall see.

            My theory is that musk is a black bat. Nothing but PR stunt after PR stunt with this guy. I think him calling him a pedo was an attempt to normalize the word (like how the word nazi has lost all meaning at this point)

             exact opposite. I think Musk is working with Trump. Bezos is the anti Musk, they both competing for rocket contracts.

              I sure hope so! It's just that everything about Musk screams deep state BS. Launching a Tesla into space playing david Bowie? BS. Also The fact his company is STILL ALIVE. Any other stock price would free fall after all these antics while making no money. Who's supporting him? If its us, fine.

             <p>
              Isnt he part of that "silicon valley trio" with Zuck and some other guy? We know Zuck is DS, why not Musk?

               ...the dont panic message could be a message of the deep.state to the elite...
Look ..weve made the illusion so obvious to the public ..and there is nothing they can do...we are almist at the finish line...just a series of creeated conflicts ..and we will get there with the biochip..
Weve done a test run in venezuela..
..we have the digital payment system tested in India...
..Dont panic...
We have our false messiah in place..

            Musk has been acting weird ever since he quit that council meeting with Trump. Musk must have been given orders by Trump some way or another to draw attention to this subject matter. This whole angle is very interesting. This has TRUMP written all over it.

             He apologized immediately after (the first time). That was when the cave thing was ongoing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then just recently, like the last week or so, he came out again and hinted that he was serious the first time.

              You might be careful with this theory. This board is dedicated to unmasking pedos. What are you suggesting by “it takes one to know one.”  Genius lol.

              If u check out insider trading info..for tesla..Musk.is buying shares..
If he wants to buy more..wouldnt it be beneficial if the share price tanks...

              Unsworth is asking for only 75k ...

              Maybe this is some ritual induction for Unsworth..
Baptism by fire from the high priest...and the priest gets his paycheck as well..
Is this a freemasonic stage show...
