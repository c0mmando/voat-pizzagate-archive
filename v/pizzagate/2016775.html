            I don't know about any thread being deleted, but I'm aware of some of the back story to Hell Pizza (as told by Lauda Finem, mostly). Lauda Finem went quiet in March of this year, with their last article being about child abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Key (aka the minister of pizza) resigned as prime minister around the time that pizzagate broke. Key has had a difficult media relationship with blogger Cameron Slater, who has had a strange legal relationship with onetime Hell Pizza manager Matt Blomfield. According to Lauda Finem there was a child porn thing going on with Blomfield. Other recent resignations of NZ political party include Labour's leader &amp; the Green's co-leader.

            The NZ angle is interesting with "minister of pizza" John Key resigning around the time that pizzagate broke. His daughter was involved in the dodgy art scene in London, I think he mentioned family as the reason he quit. Also there's the Hell Pizza saga with Blomfield, Slater, and co.

             Agreed.  My therapist and I actually had a conversation about Key's daughter; I myself make fanart between characters in 3D of a sexual nature (nothing violent, underage, or any of that nasty shit, purely fluffy pieces) because I was raped as a child and sex has never been "normal" in my mind ever since.  So to help me have a healthy future relationship some day, I created these pieces of art to show to myself that consensual sex can be a beautiful and perfectly healthy thing.  Why I'm telling you that, is we ended up bringing up our suspicions about Key as an abuser.... and how his daughter's explicit art is her trying to deal with what she's been through (I can't say whether her's is a process of normalization or not, but it's certainly an external medium to help her deal with it on some level).
            </p>
            <p>
             I haven't heard of the Hell Pizza saga..... is that where the National's would invite the young female National members / supporters, and put those poor girls through hell???

              Sorry to hear about your childhood. Hell Pizza is the name of NZ pizza chain that has now expanded 
internationally.  Lauda Finem covered the story extensively

            Just wanted to address this comment ^. Please provide a link to the deleted post. We rarely, rarely remove posts from
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . I am skeptical this actually happened, and if it did, would like to know who removed it and why.

             You know, for a week it was missing but trawling back through now it's showed up.

             Well now I feel embarrassed! Sorry about the incorrect assumption / accusation that someone had deleted it.  I wonder if it was the issue someone else brought up, with Voat just having technical issues and not showing posts sometimes?  As I said, for a week I couldn't see it in the subverse.

             The guy who'd posted the letter I shared on the above post (Ashley Farrell) has more recently spoken out about our former Prime Minister John Key's role in a pedophile cover-up, as to his reason for suddenly resigning his leadership.

              Hi thanks for the post, I have just this minute finished listening to Ash on the Vinny Eastwood Radio show _ Talking on NZ Dep Prime Minister Paula (pull-ya-benefit) Bennet piece of lying drug abusing garbage that one. About to check out vinnys show about former PM John(Don)Key and his possible ties to HRC, which was also hitting the news at the same time he split office, but with these crims there is always more than one reason, imo.

              You can always tell if something has been deleted -- it will be in the Removed Submissions area, the link to which is at the bottom of the sidebar in all of our subs. Voat is quite transparent that way. The only person who can make a post disappear (other than the person who wrote it) is our one and only admin, PuttItOut, who runs Voat. He only does that with blatantly illegal speech (i.e. doxing of users and CP).

              It wouldn't surprise me if our CIA has lured numerous foreign officials into dabbling in child porn. Instant leverage. That's the swamp I want drained most of all.
