I am adding here, important corroborative info from the Harvard Human Rights Journal about the Laura Silsby trafficking case in Haiti, and from Wikileaks about the case. Thank you!</p>
<p>So, to wrap up some extremely important facts: after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Haitian authorities from Haiti\'s Social Welfare Ministry confirmed that none of the 33 children Silsby and her organization were transporting were in fact orphans. Additionally, Silsby\'s own attorney, Jorge Puello, was arrested in the Dominic Republic on March 19th, 2010 (after Silsby and her fellow &quot;missionaries&quot; were under arrest in Haiti). According to this <a href="https://archive.is/ZMN5U">Reuters article</a> re-printed in one of Wikileaks Stratfor document releases, \'\'<strong>[Jorge Puello] was arrested in the Dominican Republic\'s capital on a warrant issued by Interpol, the international police organization. U.S. and Dominican Republic authorities had been looking for Puello after El Salvador officials said they suspected him of being involved in running a human trafficking ring that recruited Central American and Caribbean women and girls and forced them to work as prostitutes.&quot;</strong> And despite all of this, Bill Clinton still got himself directly involved in the Silsby case, by himself &quot;brokering&quot; the release of all the arrested Haitian missionaries except Silsby, who herself only served a minimal sentence and was herself never charged with more serious &quot;kidnapping and criminal association&quot; charges. </p>
<p>Additional evidence that the Clinton\'s took the handling of the Laura Silsby case very seriously, is provided by Wikileaks. In Wikileaks release of Hillary\'s emails while she was Secretary of State, one of the released emails is a <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_August_Release/C05769780.pdf">February 9th 2010 email</a> from Harold Hongju Koh, then Legal Adviser to the State Dept, and former Dean of Yale Law School. The email is from Koh directly to Hillary Clinton, and is cc\'ed to Cheryl Mills, Hillary\'s Chief of Staff at the State Dept., Hillary\'s Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan, and to PJ Crowley, then Assistant Secretary of State under Hillary. The email is nearly 3 pages and is nearly completely redacted, but from the beginning of the email we can tell that Legal advisor Koh must be giving Hillary, and her top staffers at the State Dept, legal &quot;options&quot; for the US Goverment\'s dealing with Laura Silsby and the other American citizen &quot;missionaries&quot; who were detained along with her in Haiti. <strong>Presumably, considering that all these American citizens except for Silsby, were swiftly released soon after Bill Clinton\'s documented &quot;involvement&quot; in the Silsby case in Haiti, is it safe to assume that Koh\'s email to Hillary, must be going into some detail about the different legal options for getting Silsby and her fellow &quot;missionaries&quot; released?</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, the Clintons were not the only ones who turn up having a very strange &quot;involvement&quot; with the Laura Sisby/Jorge Puello trafficking case in Haiti. <strong>Longtime cable news star Greta Van Susteren actually did a Fox News TV interview with none other than Jorge Puello himself, right during the middle of this whole controversy!</strong></p>
<p>On February 2nd, 2010, Fox New\'s Greta Van Susteren did a &quot;soft-ball&quot; type interview with Jorge Puello about the Silsby case. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/alleged-haitian-orphans-case-attempted-child-trafficking-or-a-big-misunderstanding">Link to interview.</a> Bizarrely, the interview occurred only a little over a month before Puello himself was arrested in the Dominican Republic on child sex trafficking charges on March 19th, 2010. In the very brief and strange interview, Van Susteren just asked very basic questions to Puello about how Silsby found the children, and what she intended to do with them after leaving Haiti. Jorge Puello said the children came from an orphanage that collapsed in the earthquake, and Silsby was trying to take the children &quot;to a temporary facility so they could be taken care of,&quot; providing no further details, and Van Susteren asked no follow-up. Van Susteren did not address any of the reports that at least some of the children actually were not orphans, and had families in Haiti. Jorge\'s final statement in the interview was &quot;There was no intention to do anything illegal.&quot; Van Susteren than replied &quot;Jorge, thank you, and keep us informed.&quot;, and the interview abruptly ended.</p>
<p>Only 9 days after Van Susteran\'s interview with Puello, on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/world/americas/12haiti.html">February 11th, 2010, the New York Times reported</a> that police in El Salvador were investigating Jorge Puello for leading a sex trafficking ring. </p>
<p><strong>The fact that Van Susteren did this weird little interview with Puello only days before news of his sex trafficking allegations got dropped in mainstream news, was a big red flag to me.</strong></p>
<p>Journalist and independent investigator Nick Bryant wrote a really important book based on his investigation of the &quot;Franklin Cover-up&quot; pedophile scandal in the \'80s called the &quot;Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse &amp; Betrayal.&quot; (Here is a link to an <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/09/10/still-evil-after-all-these-years/">article</a> about the book on the Counterpunch site). For those who don\'t know about the Franklin Scandal, it was a huge scandal in the 80s involving major allegations that political and business powerbrokers in Washington DC and Omaha, Nebraska were systematically trafficking and abusing children, and using them in sexual blackmail operations to ensnare politicians and other powerful figures. Watch Discovery Channels\' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PScfMeXAQwU">unaired documentary &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; for more info.</a> Nick Bryant also wrote a really important <a href="https://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971">article on Gawker</a> about Bill Clinton\'s connection to Jeff Epstein\'s child sex trafficking operation.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Bryant revealed in his investigation of the Franklin cover-up that Greta Van Susteren was the lawyer for Henry Vinson, who was a key figure in this whole scandal.</strong> Henry Vinson is a West Virginia-based businessman who in the early 1990s was tried and convicted for operating a male prostitution ring in Washington DC, that supplied adult-age gay male prostitutes to powerful DC political figures. Additionally, Nick Bryant and Henry Vinson co-wrote a 2015 book called &quot;DC Madam: The Politics of Sex, Lies &amp; Blackmail,&quot; that goes into extensive detail about Henry Vinson\'s involvement with a DC sex trafficking ring. <strong>As Nick Bryant documented in his book “The Franklin Scandal,” and as thoroughly documented in Bryant &amp; Vinson\'s &quot;DC Madam&quot; book, Henry Vinson, through the operation of his prostitution ring, became directly involved with two key alleged abuse perpetrators in the &quot;Franklin Scandal&quot;: Larry King and Craig Spence.</strong> Again, as documented in Bryants\' and Vinsons\' books, Larry King (full name Lawrence E. King) and Craig Spence were extremely well-connected political powerbrokers, who were both accused by multiple underage children and teenagers of operating a major underage sex trafficking ring that supplied children to powerful figures in both the Omaha, NE and Washington DC areas, and used them in blackmailing operations. Lawrence E. King was, for a time in the 80s, a bank director in Omaha and extremely well-connected to the state and national Republican party. The bank King managed was the &quot;Franklin Credit Union&quot; in Omaha NE, hence the name of the scandal.  <strong>Henry Vinson specifically describes Craig Spence as some kind of &quot;CIA asset.&quot;</strong> As documented in Byrant and Vinson\'s research, Spence was for a time in the 80s a well-connected DC lobbyist, who owned a private mansion in Kalorama, a very upscale suburb of Washington, DC. Henry Vinson specifically alleges that as part of his pimping business, on many occasions he sent adult-age male prostitutes to parties at Spence\'s Kalorama mansion. Vinson also alleges that on at least some occasions, male prostitutes who worked for Vinson told him afterward that underage prostitutes were present at at least some of these &quot;parties&quot; at the Kalorama mansion.</p>
<p>As documented in his &quot;DC Madam&quot; book, and in &quot;The Franklin Scandal,&quot; Vinson claims that his operation only supplied adult-age male prostitutes, but as his prostitution ring grew, Larry King and Craig Spence got in touch with him, started financing his prostitution ring, and eventually tried to convince him to start pimping underage children as part of his operation. <strong>Larry King even told Vinson that he had clients who &quot;actually liked having sex with kids as they tortured or killed the kid.&quot;</strong> Henry Vinson said Spence and King demanded and then threatened him that he had to get involved in their child sex trafficking activities. When Vinson refused Spence\'s and King\'s demands to become involved in pimping children, Vinson claims that Spence sent men who were CIA operatives over to his house, where they broke windows, busted up his house, and intimidated Vinson further. Vinson claims that when this intimidation didn\'t work, Spence invited him to his Kalorama mansion to talk. Vinson claims that present at Spence\'s mansion on this occasion, <strong>was a member of George H.W. Bush\'s cabinet. Vinson further claims that this Bush Sr. cabinet member verbally intimidated him, telling him, &quot;I can withstand a background check. Can you?&quot;</strong> Soon after this in 1990, Henry Vinson\'s prostitution ring got raided, and he was indicted by a grand jury on 43 charges, including pimping, racketeering and credit card fraud, all related to his prostitution ring.</p>
<p><strong>And in the next part, we see how none other than Greta Van Susteren, through her role as Henry Vinson\'s attorney, becomes directly involved with this story.</strong></p>',

            In the early days King worked at the Savings &amp; Liam with Susan Buffett. Imagine that.Cozy huh? Warren Buffett almost never has any dirt written about him.Nebraska is where he’s holed up. The Franklin Affair came out of Nebraska. Just Sayin.

             What is most horrifying in my mind, is the additional testimony of alleged victims of King that journalist Nick Bryant finds and interviews in his "Franklin Scandal" book: testimony of people like Alisha Owen, Shawneta Moore, Nikolai Caymen and others who allege of either being forced to directly witness satanic ritual murder, participate in pedophilic orgies, and much more and other horrific allegations, which again are documented at length in Bryants book. Alisha Owen is particular remembers hearing claims of children who were either "sold or murdered"... As terrible as it is, all we can do is listen and consider the testimony of the survivors, look for corroborating evidence, and weight the evidence as best we can, in a journey toward truth...

                Robert Mueller helped scuttle the Franklin Affair. Another member here commented that Bill Bart also had a hand in hosing it down. Look how they have been rewarded. Big shots on TV. Bleeping Turncoats and throwing those poor Children to the wolves.

            Trump's friend and mentor Roy Cohn, who was a good friend of Craig Spence, was also running a child rape blackmail ring for the CIA, I wonder whether he was also involved in the Franklin Scandal. Some people have alleged it.

             Cohn undeniably ran with the same crowd of people who themselves had very direct connections to the Franklin Scandal, most specifically Craig Spence. I honestly don't know if Roy Cohn's reach, whether it be his possible personal involvement, or legal involvement with the cover-up, extended into the Franklin Scandal...
