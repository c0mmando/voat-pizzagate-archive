<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Having read new information recently, including taking in all possibly legitimate and possibly dis information surrounding a number of issues, I think I\'m able to draw a multi-path narrative scenario that we are seeing unfold and conclude what the New World Order is up to. We have gotten to the point we\'re on their tails (pun? you decide!) and them in feverish damage control mode; continually adapting to how events unfold; how people and collectives respond. With this in mind keep reading...</p>
<p>This relates to PG in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It outlines the greater narratives surrounding PG by summarizing key events and related issues.</li>
<li>Explains how shills attempt to divert research away from their core. </li>
<li>Again iterate that PG is part of something bigger: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1695259">Elite Luciferism</a></li>
<li>Reiterate that it is as real as ever, evil people act upon evil doctrinue: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1732692">Elite Satanism proven beyond doubt</a></li>
<li>Further more generic advice is provided to keep heads cool and actions controlled.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
<p>Everyone by now knows that the current power structure has one thing in mind: A united world under one goverment and one religion. What\'s known to a lesser extent is that inspite all the positive reasonings to legitimize such a scenario, the actual power drive behind this one united world is an evil power. Totalitarian world domination. That is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>In actuality, they are not \'there\' yet. There are a few more hurdles to take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syria must be taken for the sake of a pipeline amongst some and more (out with Shiites, in with (Wahabi) Sunnies)</li>
<li>Russia must be taken. </li>
<li>China must be taken (and these nation\'s surrounding neighbours). </li>
</ul>
<p>The conquerment of these countries would be conducted either by coercion or out right force through false-flagging.</p>
<h2>Short Term Goals</h2>
<p>There are quite some short term goals on their list. Most of them pertain to the conquering of nations. However, domestically there are another few short term goals to achieve in the United States. That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>To tear down and marginalize the Constitution. </li>
<li>To take away your arms and 2nd Amendment. They know well that they can not &quot;just&quot; do this by force so there must be another mechanic in place to achieve this goal and that will be an enticement into engaging the state. See below.</li>
<li>Prepare the USA for unity under UN (or to be named institution) together with Europe (EU), thus creating already a united Western Hemisphere. This needs a cataclism type of event. A war. A war with Russia.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Martial Law / Operation Gladio</h2>
<p>An ever present theme throughout our timeline is the danger that the nation can and will be thrown into a martial law lockdown. This has already happened years ago in France. Recently the UK engaged martial law over the recent terror attack. Macron extended the condition in France once more. Here in Holland we have no fear of martial law lockdown. Why? Because our people are already mentally contained. All blue-pills, all 16 million of them. Well almost. Living in the illusion tightly. No. MA is needed to oppress any remaining serious resistance. See France. And now in the US we get to deal with the same thing. However, things have not yet gone havoc to the point Obama got to engage lockdown. It is a serious looming threat and they will seek excuses for this.</p>
<p>That is what \'Operation Gladio\' is all about: enticing the knowing and witting populace to rise up against their government so that they can then be slammed down and controlled by the state. To this end, the Cabal will feed angering information to the public about the state, living in a delusion of untouchability and get you pissed enough to walk right into the hands of LEO / military. Martial law is the complementary part to the angering information feeding.</p>
<p>The purpose ultimately is to get any NWO opposition killed or behind bars, leaving behind a flock of still asleep people (often referred to as sheep; sheeple) readily controlled; screaming for more security. NWO opposition will be painted as villains and dissidents obviously. This might reach a civil war scale. <strong>IT IS CRITICAL TO AVOID THIS SITUATION FOR IT MEANS LOSS</strong></p>
<p>Further in this document when describing narrative timelines, I\'ll point out where the potential for this risk appears through the term &quot;MLOG&quot;.</p>
<h2>The Unity Principle</h2>
<p>Now having outlined the relevant long- and short term goals, I will now address something very important here which I call the Unity Principle. <em>This principle will be an essential tool to the New World Order to reduce to a minimum, resistance against the full totalitarian control they want to impose.</em></p>
<p>The Unity Principle refers to the unity of people globally for a common cause. The only thing that has the power to bind and unite people globally like that is the &quot;Common Enemy&quot;. From the perspective of us, the people, uniting like that at a national up to a global level is not something that happens every four weeks! NO! We\'re not having globally threatening enemies engage us every four weeks at large, enticing us into global unity. We are talking about the uniting of the people like the French Revolution, the U.S. Civil War and similar national unitites. No. The build-up [of energy / potential] amongst people for a global unity, to then be released upon this common enemy, at such scale is a one-time event. This is going to happen only once in the next 200 years if it is to happen.</p>
<p>This means: We have ONLY ONE UNITION CHANCE and we have to make sure, when we do unite and put our souls and energies into it; we\'d better be looking at the RIGHT, REAL ENEMY and not be fooled into FAKE ENEMIES!!! THIS IS CRITICAL. </p>
<p>For, if we have discharged our energies through combat in which ever way, don\'t bet on another run the next week at another enemy. No, we\'ll be flat, out of energy, ready to be mopped and scooped up by sectarian, criminal, totalitarian control. If they have their way, we\'ll not be looking at them that way; most people would herald the new totalitarian policies after defeat of the common enemy and dust settling. People will be heralding their capturers. World up-side-down.</p>
<p>On this subject, we have only one (1) \'life\'. We\'ve got to use it wisely and not blow it on their fake enemies they have designed for us and play into their hands.</p>
<h2>WIKILEAKS</h2>
<p>Wiki-leaks. Heroes or Controlled Opposition? Well. I\'ve always been a little sceptic of them <em>before</em> the release of the DNC and CF/CGI leaks. The quality of their information leaks however speak completely <em>for</em> them. They have a 100% accuracy on their claims. Their released information is regarded legitimate around the globe. The e-mails themselves are all legitimate and so on. However; people have still been a bit weary. Isn\'t it just part of the grand plot? It just might be. </p>
<p>Today I came across another VOAT post that linked me to a page that offers some interesting background on WikiLeaks, notably on Assange. It appears WikiLeaks is heavily Rothschild driven. This caused me to &quot;retro-apply&quot; this new information (alignment flip on WikiLeaks) to my current \'truth-tree\' (that what I currently assume to be a truth) to then asses the impact of this information. Raising questions about, WHY is Rothschild (by extension) leaking certain bits and bytes? Well.. That\'s what I\'m going to outline in the next few paragraphs that are going to describe a number of their narrative paths. They do have backup plans and actively adapt their micro-strategy to the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>And this is one of the primary reasons for writing this essay as it is going to show you they do. The paragraphs about narratives take into account the updated alignment on WikiLeaks since it definitely helps explaining a number of things that transpired already, and a few things in re- Kim.com that somehow don\'t jive well and don\'t feel right.</p>',

            This commenter seems to have experienced much the same as you have.

            This is in every major city and a lot of the smaller ones and includes people you’d never imagine. You get to the point where you simply stop trusting anyone. I always wondered what was wrong with me, why certain “friends” turned on me, similar events such as those described in the pdf and movie taking place over the years. I grew up in Des Moines and never figured it out until I moved to Omaha and Franklin broke in the news in 89. Then I understood. I was to be one of them, they were after me since I was little. But since I refused to participate willingly – wich is a requirement of theirs, they tried to make life as much hell as they could. YHWH and Yahshuah are our strength and refuge in this world, protecting us from evil we never even notice.

             I think I would love that. I'd have to see how that could be made a reality though. Are there Dutch affiliations? Remote working? Emigration required..? It will raise a number of think-abouts before anything would become a reality I think. But I'd love to contribute to our collective such way.

              The Scilly Islands were at war with the Dutch as a result of the English Civil War - peace was concluded in my lifetime.  My view is that the ability to declare war or conclude peace is the essential attribute of sovereignty.  But when I examined the circumstances, it looked more like a publicity stunt to promote tourism.

            Paranoia is a mind killer. Our enemies are not omnipotent. They are few in number and rely on secrecy. They're terrified of any authentic grassroots movements. They're also opportunistic and will flee whenever possible. We can win this.

            The enemy is Talmudic Judiasm. Research Frankism and Sabbateism. It's the root of this evil.

             You are underestimating the vastness and scope. We can win this, but that relies on truth disclosure (indisputably prove they are evil rather than the ones trying to get justice). They are masters of deception and spin any good efforts into evil to the asleep public, getting away with their shite.
            </p>
            <p>
             As long as they continue to control media, hi-tech, education and other areas they will keep control of narrative and set up the sleeper people against you. They have mastered the art of 'weaponizing' people against you. That is their power. The hardcore controllers are just a "few". It's however their allied, complicit fan-out network that quickly turns it into claws all around the globe down to offices in the corporate or which ever institution.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know; I have been dealing with this real life, first-hand experience of agents being in my physical environment. I am being inverse profiled by corrupt authority and members within our Dutch secret service. Meaning they paint me as everything that I am NOT, in an attempt to neutralize my influence, belief worthiness and truth conveyance. They've set up shop in my neighborhood too (close range surveillance). They've tried to make me complicit to corporate crimes as well (licensing issues). I am not black-mailable. They've got nothing on me. THey continuously try to use every exuse against me. My involvement with the community here on VOAT has garnered me a new label from them: "Schizophrenic pedofile". Why schizophrenic? Because there's absolutely no lead towards such thing. Simply because I am not a pedophile. They use the word "schizophrenic" as a logical inverter gate to claim for thruth their claims eventhough everything's against the claim.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've also received two death threats from the agent in my physical surroundings at the company I worked for from Jan. 2014 ~ March 2016. I had 3 new jobs afterwards. At the first I uncovered first-hand a mental satanist (flashed 3 6'es at me during lunch break). At the company they love goat cheese, talk about consuming placentas, harassed me through gossip, suggesting me to be an anti-Semite.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second job no different. The agent tried to make me complicit to corporate crime involving extremely expensive licenses (Microsoft SQL Server Datacenter version and rolling out for production, Office under an MSDN dev sub) and tried hard to marginalize my profession knowledge and paint me as a fraud, all the while I was schooling him on his fallacies and attempts, in fact showing him to be an arrogant supremacist prick, making him fall flat to his face, the fucker.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the third job things were no different. After a few days the hate campaign started (anti semite), marginalizing knowledge once more, both assimilation and terror attempts.
            </p>
            <p>
             I quit all 3 jobs without social security. I'm running on my own finance for now and have not much left. I'll have to see if I can still find a job without state terror on my neck.
            </p>
            <p>
             The claws are everywhere. I have quite the personal story. Evil is not limited to a hand full of Babylonic Talmudists. Nor are they the source. The force/power of evil existed well before Judaism was a thing on this planet. Nor is it picky about race or religion (as cover) chosen.

            </p>
            <p>
             Additionally, I'm gifted with telepathy. I know their profession slang / slur words for "suspects". They've got a word for about anything. I can hardly keep track of them. (I can, just telling you I've been called about everything under the sun, with or without the "schizophrenic" prependage, depending on whether they feel they need an inverter gate to make true their claim, if not based on some factual node that can be interpreted a thousand ways.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note: almost 20 years ago they tried to subtly recruit me as part of their cyber force. I subtly let 'm know I was NOT interested because I saw a world of grayness (the color, not the aliens lol) and corruption. I didn't involve myself with local national politics for almost 18 years and kept to myself while being a biological datarecorder as I watched carefully at how people in my environment would handle me. This is how I got up to where I am now without having been prematurely derailed into nothingness. Now I've got my ammo. Knowledge.

             <strong>
              They are also responsible for the destruction of the relationship I had 16 years ago with an American citizen. A woman. My true love. We were soul mates, fully and complementarily interconnected. She had 3 kids. My visa was denied. Our appeal to the denial was denied. Because THEY passed on negative advice about me to the American Consulate in Amsterdam. It destroyed our relationship in an extremely painful fashion.  People won't know they are born as complementary halves until they have grown into one and then separated.

              I don't think you're understanding. You're never going to "indisputably prove they are evil" anymore than you already have. You already have the proof. You'll never win this in court or get vindication from the system because they own the system. They make the rules and when you corner them they'll bend the rules. The only solution is revolution. That means going full 1488. Remember all those poor jews and gays that ended up in the camps? That's what we have to do. We have to take the streets and gas these fuckers wholesale. No trials. You associate with these fuckers? You're in pictures with these fuckers? You do business with these fuckers? Then you're dead to us. This is cancer and we must become chemotherapy.

               That will get us all killed. We must use the frame of law and through truth exposure show that certain elements are corrupt and be replaced / impeached.

               Present day law constructs define the lines on this mental battle field. We don't have to illusion craft. We don't have to hide. They have to and that is our win.

                  LE are not permitted to investigate their superiors. Any investigation worth anything has been shutdown. LE cannot harm the top. Just look at Hillary's flagrant disregard for the law. She's a small fish too.

                   That's the whole point of the top-down compartmentalized authority structure. Again, truth sync is going to help with that. There must be pathways to collectively deem "untrustworthy/corrupt" a superior. But it must happen in unity.

                     You have to turn the duality disk. Meaning you'll have to look at an individual's alignment towards good / evil. There's every day Jews around as well that are tired of the shite as much as anyone else. Again, neither good, neither evil are picky about race or assumed religion. They look at whether one lets in either one or not.

                      Great but that's not a practical plan. We have cancer. We don't have perfect precise cure for cancer. We do have the scalpel and chemotherapy. We work with the blunt instruments we have or we die.

                       Only as a last resort when all else fails. It's exactly what they want to entice us into. They've got all the ammo (bullets), gear, hi-tech. They can 'nuke' whole areas with EM tech and make whole swathes of people drop like flies without a finch. Don't be silly. Instead, we've gotta take back what rightfully belongs to us. Awakening is taking place in the army as well.

            I read your work with great anticipation as always. Your depth of understanding of Luceferian/NWO agenda is always impressive. I agree on most of the topics you covered but would like it if you can really expound on the difference between Zionism &amp; Judaism and the explanation of how the State of Israel is not a Rothschild creation itself but was gifted to the Rothschilds as part of the Balfour declarations for the US joining the war. The Rothschilds wanted Israel and ultimately greater Israel and one work government &amp; religion as a take over of the planet. They are Luceferian not Jews. That is their plan even now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't have time to get into George Webb now but assure you he is more aware of the darkness of this evil than he has been able to let on due to threats against him. What he is doing currently is attempting to expose the criminals in the FBI &amp; congress who are literally have their top secret communications run by Pakistani nationals linked to Pakistani ISI intelligence officials who have stolen top secret military operations that have already lead to two Navy Seal deaths because democrats do not know who has access to their top secret files.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb is working with US intell, Dutch intell, intalian intell, Russian intell, French intell, etc. &amp; law enforcement  who are providing him with real time infor into Seth Rich Muder &amp; FBI cover up.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might not like him because he is on the raid reporting constantly due to death threats. He refuses to back down and in fact the FBI informant killer of Seth Rich A. Jollah was taken into custody a few hours ago., would this had happened if George Webb didn't have balls of steel and post the truth.

             Hi Jem, thanks for your comments. I just keep open any options and keep into account the existence of additional 'layers' surrounding stories and continually evaluate existing factual / deducted frames against new information. As this post is a display of that, incorporating WikiLeaks as a complicit element and figuring out its purpose from such perspective with all that has transpired so far, and knowing what the end goal is.

            just so you know, I'm not needing to spend my evening reading about Kissinger. He has been evil for decades and my mind won't be changed. Strange (or maybe not) that there is such a pro-Kissinger contingent here now.

             Zionism is the outside cover the Luciferist / Molochites don themselves with. That's the whole point. Zionism originally, at its core was a movement for the desire of an own country, regardless of how it would come into existence. The version we see manifest over the past centuries however is Rothschild's spin on it, He's the funder and creator of modern day Israel in its current inception. Was a reward for involving the US into WWII at request of British Royalty, through the Belfour Declaration.

            I don't see any alliances between Trump and Rothschild and Trump and Kissinger (as per the Al Smith Dinner during the campaign, this is not a cozy relationship) so do you have a source for these assertions?

               That doesn't bode well. With a bit of luck Trump smelled the sulfur and decided to stay true in his heart. I can't tell. No, he ain't a knight on a shining horse either. But, running a casino is nothing like running a satanic blood drinking sect.

              Please make your links separate so that it shows where it goes. Thanks. also, your article quoted is not very conclusive. Trump is Kissingers guy? based on one meeting? Not convincing whatsoever. I don't think you are investigating Pizzagate so much as disinfo sliding. You are giving a network of interrelated criminals too much credit. they are not that well organized and they aren't very good at hiding their agenda.

               No, he's not his "guy". Kissinger is his intended controller. I know Trump ain't liking him.

               P.S. They're not just interrelated criminals that are not that well organized. You are underestimating the deviousness and conciseness of people / families that have been at it for centuries. Citizen research here has uncovered the insane network over a large time-space cube (all happenings in a given space cube over a given timeline).

            PART 3: Trump &amp; Predictive Programming
           </h2>
           <p>
            You may or may not have read about this
            <a href="http://www.oddityworld.net/2014/07/the-creepy-illuminati-card-game.html">
             Illuminati card game
            </a>
            being out there that has a track record of predicting some of the events depicted on these cards. Amonst these are 9/11 and the death of princess Diana. There's a card in there that relates to current events, notably to POTUS Trump. And this is going to be a very interesting card. It is the card that shows the angry Trump face, that seems to have a bullet trace going through the image.
           </p>
           <p>
            People have explained this as the card predicting a Trump assassination. However having looked at the card and going by a few more semantics of the cards set, I have come to a different conclusion:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Note the colored dual-triangles? You can't miss them when you're a VOATer!
            </li>
            <li>
             The "bullet trace" is no bullet trace. It's the background shining through, where the big black opposite triangles almost touch. It's no more than a triangle separator, as much as the actual vote count sits in between the vote buttons like here on VOAT. However, the blackness of both triangles says something: Voat IS on the dark side. And the cabal back then already cocked up the plan of releasing assorted platforms for people to share thoughts. The VOAT forum has been planned. As so many other things.
            </li>
            <li>
             See the blood splash behind it? When looking at current issues, this most likely represents a reference to blood consuming; parabiosys.
            </li>
            <li>
             The card title is "Enough is enough". This coincides a lot with the Trump administration, Trump taking on this festering
             <strong>
              HellGate
             </strong>
             problem.
            </li>
            <li>
             The card has NO SCORE (The Princess Diana card had "2 power" and "5 resistance". They already classified her to be against NWO). However, this card instead says "Draw no plot cards this turn". Translation: Trump, do NOT reveal the 9/11 plot you're aware of, or you're screwed. This card is threat to Trump. VOAT has been preplanned as "free-speech" platform well in advance.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Take it as you will; the prediction rate as far as I can tell isn't very high of these cards; meaning; some cards may actually depict plan B or plan C predictions / narratives. This predictive card covers for when Ted or Hillary would not make it through the elections.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sidenote on this cards: Have a friend in media; have a friend in deepest NWO circles where one's aware of century-scale planning and it'll be easy to release "predictive" cards for your long-term plans. Nothing magic about it. All planning and by design.

            . Further pushing narrative towards ET disclosure and pushing our "Unity Energy" towards a select group of "Babylonic Talmudists" as the source of evil. THUS: Taking away focus from the core: Luciferism in its various inceptions (along with its Islamic variant,

            ). Also does not at all mention Rothschilds nor the Vatican. Nor the Babylonic EU. Right now, he is steering towards (again) MLOG: Calling to arms on the basis of the Constitution, to rise and citizen arrest Podesta, Clinton, DWS, Alefantis and more. Although very cleverly linking this intent to a whole slew of FBI twitter accounts. The lower tier outskirts of NWO perps. Yes, at this point in time, Hillary/Bill Clinton are now disposables. No deplorables. Disposables to them. Also displays himself as "The Evangelist", a bit of son-of-god allure.

            On Reddit people are quite sceptic about him as well. This guy is manifesting, just like George Webb, as an insider with access to inside information from CIA, FBI and other agencies, notably AFSC. Also links to and pushes WikiLeaks cables about Kissinger supposedly having taken command from Draconids.

            There was something about the content this guy was pushing. Even more so, when looking at the accounts Twitter activity, one can see that the account has been very low-key, posting minimally untill the beginning of May. However, after the beginning of May, activity shot up to the red-line; almost bi-hourly posts and presenting the appearance / image I just told. It appears that the narrative strongly rides off

           <h2>
            Closing
           </h2>
           <p>
            The NWO Luciferist cabal seems to be running out of options. The Russia ruse backfires. WikiLeaks induced MLOG is backfiring (good job everyone on keeping your cools and not be fools). Syria operations are backfiring. Maybe North Korea will draw attention away from them; they need it so much. All the while trying to noisify and mistify any citizen research going by injecting information from accounts that appear to be an insider authority that do tell a number of things, but all together don't offer much progression in terms of uncovering the luciferist body and head of the parasite. Instead, attempts are made to steer away narrative towards the skirts of the power structure which is multi-fold again:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Give the people their justice
            </li>
            <li>
             Have people waste their Unity Energy at their disposables.
            </li>
            <li>
             Dispose of no longer needed compliances / liabilities. Most of them are preliminarily bust anyways, like the Clintons. They're no longer useful to the cabal.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This is not to say that the good side is not making progress. I'm just saying that we're now facing highly dynamic narrative changes depending on what happens in the world and in research communities. They are becoming quickly a cornered cat. They are known to make weird leaps when cornered (as per a Dutch saying).

           <h2>
            The Presidential Candidates.
           </h2>
           <p>
            The NWO narrative is defined by its long-term goals and dynamic at the microlevel. This means, the micro narrative adapts to evolution of current events / revelations / leaks / research etc. What I am now going to do is to write down chronologically the timeline from the Primaries up to now; highlighting per time section the one or more narrative paths that could possibly be taken. Obviously, for the past, one narrative became the actual path, where I will highlight possible alternatives that did not work out as intended. But before that, I'll need to tell a bit about the presidential candidates before getting down to it:
           </p>
           <p>
            It is important to understand that the Cabal "installs" preferred, willing presidential candidates to help them further the agenda. Each side (D/R/I) will offer candidates of which only a handful are their cherry picks. Meet this election's hand-picked contenders:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             (R) Ted Cruz (Right-wing neo-conservative)
            </li>
            <li>
             (R) Donald J. Trump (Art of the Deal)
            </li>
            <li>
             (D) Hillary R. Clinton (What difference does it make?)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            As far as support goes from the NWO heavy-weights Rothschild / Rockefeller, each supports a preferred candidate, whether the candidate is the preferred winner, or the controlled opposition that's intended to lose. They do it like this to avoid the image of partiality obviously. Going by associations derived from media sources, this election's setup was like this:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>

              (D) Hillary R. Clinton (Powered by Rothschild (tm). $100K plates. Private invitations. Open support (Lynn / Evelyn)
             </a>
             .

           <p>
            Hillary has been indisputably been proven to be the preferred candidate. The magazine Newsweek printed "Madam President" issues only. No issue for a Trump victory. This was well before the final counts were in.
           </p>
           <h2>
            Narrative: Pre-Election, Beginning of Primaries.
           </h2>
           <p>
            Now we get to the evolution of the primaries. Let's start off:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             On the Democrat side, Hillary Clinton was the preferred candidate. She's the designated winner for the 2016 election. Plan A.
            </li>
            <li>
             On the Republican side, Ted Cruz was the preferred candidate on the Republican side of the equation. Presented as the "voice of reason" compared to Trump. Ted Cruz is Plan B.
            </li>
            <li>
             Trump served the cause in multiple ways: To boost Cruz and Hillary. He likely knew that this was his involuntary use as their "useful idiot" puppet.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Things did not work out as intended. Trump rose, Cruz got eliminated. The reason for this was exposed voter fraud, notably in Colorado, and differentially, Trump gaining incredible support amongst the people. This prompted 'Them' to handle the calamity in a multiple-birds-with-one-stone strategy as they so cleverly always try to do: Release damning DNC information through WIKILEAKS. Rothschild did it. Which birds would be hit by the stone?
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Enable the Russian Hacking ruse to enable and create the fake enemy needed to unite against the US and EU.
            </li>
            <li>
             Discredit Trump with Fake News over fake misogyny stories and Fake Russian collusion stories.
            </li>
            <li>
             Begin culling the 'skirts' of DNC through the e-mail revelations.
            </li>
            <li>
             Present Hillary (and DNC) as victims, attempting to gain voter sympathy.
            </li>
            <li>
             Enable Obama to engage martial law over the Russian Hacking, possibly going to war with Russia before the end of the election, ensuring NWO control through another Obama administration.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            That's a lot of birds. Note that the MSM never reported on the contents of the leaked e-mails. Only about how Russians allegedly hacked classified info and influenced the elections. They banked on the general populace to never found out really about the content of the e-mails, let alone understand them in a greater picture context. Further more, the e-mails did not contain overly damning information on Hillary Clinton. The leaks primarily showed DNC collusion with media and suppression of Bernie Sanders. DWS-gate.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point there are two MLOG motives:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Enable Obama to stay in power; take on Russians (not the preferred scenario). Soros astro-turfing tried to accomplish this with the Trump / Dallas riots.
            </li>
            <li>
             Enable Obama to issue a gun ban and take away 2nd Amendment rights. (Thus attempting to rile up notably Republicans with Guns and their NRA)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Further more, at this point the plan is that Hillary should have been the President and Russians established as The Enemy. Well, that didn't appear to be the case. Donald J. Trump won the elections which was not their intended outcome. Now one can see, in hind-sight, the role of WikiLeaks.
           </p>
           <h2>
            Narrative: Post-Election
           </h2>
           <p>
            With Trump having won the election, we now ended up with the situation where Rothschild's chess piece was sent off the board (Hillary) and Rockefeller was left with an unwanted, rogue, erratic chess piece (Trump). A scenario that was not their plan A. Not their plan B. But instead, plan X. They had to accept the new president one way or another. So old plans were reinforced and new plans were hatched:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Step up the Russia ruse once more.
            </li>
            <li>
             Impeachment
            </li>
            <li>
             More Soros astro-turfing.
            </li>
            <li>
             Media hate campaigns.
            </li>
            <li>
             Celebrities hate campaigns.
            </li>
            <li>
             Through Twitter shills and media / celebs, entice a hit on the President.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            And with this, MLOG is still an ever present danger. This time not through the Russia narrative, but, through assassination of the POTUS. Imagine what'll ensue if Trump does get waxed. This may not happen at all cost. CIA / MIC will step in and lock you down; possibly re-instating Obama (if that's possible et-al).

            . It is this that threw a YUUUUUGE wrench into the wheels of the NWO. The people found out that it was about MUCH MORE than just "mundane" pedophilia. It was much more sinister. It was un-earthed that we're dealing with occultists; satanists; luciferists. In short: prime EVIL. And so I dub this whole thing collectively:
            <strong>
             HellGate
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <h2>
            Gap Stop Summary
           </h2>
           <p>
            Now that we got up to this point; this is where we're going to see their continual change on narrative in response to multiple concurrent events and evolutions amongst people. This is where Martial Law / Operation Gladio (MLOG) and HellGate come together as the following set of paragraphs will show. Ever since citizen research (through Reddit, VOAT and other platforms) took off, it became infiltrated with shills. NWO shills, pedo shills, satanism shills anything. In an attempt to derail research; in an attempt to marginalize aspects, be it the pedo aspect or the satanism aspect and so on.

           <p>
            I've been paying close attention to posters and what had been posted on Voat. I keep mental profiles of posters based on their postings to determine for myself who are the good guys, who are the bad guys, who pose as allies but are not allies and so on. Through this, I have noted that VOAT is compromized. In actuallity, VOAT is a Lion's den. I'm not the only person to have come to that conclusion. It is safe to say the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            NWO uses VOAT for a number of things:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Collect researchers on a single, limited platform.
            </li>
            <li>
             Anticipate on people's uncoverings. Erase tracks. (that's why you all must web-archive anything important!)
            </li>
            <li>
             Identify people and possibly turn some into targeted individuals if they're threatening enough.
            </li>
            <li>
             Worst case: pull the plug on VOAT and take down ALL POSTINGS.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Adapt the narrative in order to achieve the prime goal of providing an Enemy to achieve MLOG and optionally a war.
             </strong>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            It is the latter in which you should see narrative development of shills. They will attempt to steer
            <strong>
             towards
            </strong>
            MLOG, and steer
            <strong>
             away
            </strong>
            from
            <strong>
             HellGate
            </strong>
            . Thus, steer away / marginalize Luciferism as the drive behind TPTB, steer away from Rothshilds and assorted Babylonians. To steer away from the Vatican; the hidden seat of Satan. This paragraph should ever be present in your mind. This is what shills will attempt in order to protect themselves and direct our "Unity Energy" at a directed, conjured, enemy to diffuse that energy from the populace.

           <p>
            Now, some side notes follow in regards to a few persona who are actively responding to what evolves on VOAT, showing this attempt to influence narrative away from the core of NWO and onto its disposable out-skirts.

             Your election info is completely flawed.
            </p>
            <p>
             EVERY POTUS "election" has been "won" by the guy who had the most royal BLOOD.  That goes back to the (s)election of George Washington in 1789 and is 100%, ZERO deviation.
            </p>
            <p>
             BLOODlines rule the world, and BLOODlines dictate U.S. elections.

              Hillary and Trump are related to the same blood-line; I remember reading the text you linked. I also remember one of the replies outlining that H and T are related to the same bloodline where there is no differentiation between either of them two having "more" royalty.
