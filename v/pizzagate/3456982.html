            FURTHER NC RESEARCH:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The North Carolina connection to human trafficking
            </strong>
            Jan 2010
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It is hard to believe that, in America, we have people trapped and forced to work as laborers or prostitutes as slaves of human traffickers.  North Carolina has been ranked in the top 8 most common sites for human trafficking.  One of the reasons we are so popular is I85 and I95.
            </p>
            <p>
             Human traffickers love the I85 and I95 highways in North Carolina and they also use another high speed highway to recruit, enslave, and find new customers-the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Human traffickers target those who are society's most vulnerable, have the quietest voices and find it hard to fight back.  Often, victims include immigrants and children.  Children who are loners or runaways are also a popular target of cybertraffickers.
            </p>
            <p>
             North Carolina passed a bill in 2007 which makes human trafficking a felony and offers state assistance to victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the last several months there were several cases in human trafficking uncovered in North Carolina.  Human trafficking via the internet to enable their crime rings has long been on the radar of the law enforcement community.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Few Recent NC Cases:
            </p>
            <p>
             Sex Ring:
            </p>
            <p>
             April 2009, a man was sentenced to 24 years in prison for operating a human trafficking sex trade between Charlotte and Washington.  Girls were as young as 16 and smuggled in from Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
             Child Sex Case – Internet Sting:
            </p>
            <p>
             June 2009, a Duke University official, was arrested after an Internet sting.  He was charged with trafficking a 5 year old boy for sex.  His name was provided by a defendant in a different trafficking case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Spa case in Monroe – Ads on Craigslist:
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2008, a spa in Union County was using Craiglist to advertise services that were offered by people who had been coerced into a human trafficking scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shaniya Davis – Mother allegedly sold her into sex trade via internet:
            </p>
            <p>
             In NC we have the pending case and trial regarding the alleged human trafficking of Shaniya Davis.  Her own mother allegedly sold her daughter into the sex trade using the internet to find a buyer and to send messages.  This case should be a wake up call to parents,  teachers, and all caregivers.

             for the dig on the area. My Search has contained only :
             <strong>
              Gastonia
             </strong>
             as that was how it was designated in the article, and have little prior knowledge of the even NC. Will broaden to
             <strong>
              Gaston County
             </strong>
             and see if any dots connect.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately, like a lot of these stories from Anywhere, USA,(or the world for that matter)  all they tell us it is either an epidemic within humanity, a malevolent kind living among us, or a massive infernal conspiracy network.

              Human trafficking continues to be an insidious and widespread problem in North Carolina. The  exploitation of people for sex or for labor can happen in a wide range of situations, from illicit massage parlors to farm operations or even well-frequented restaurants.

            Hidden History == AMERICAN 14TH ORIGINAL COLONY ==
           </p>
           <p>
            THE TRANSYLVANIA COMPANY :
           </p>
           <p>
            Continuing to investigate the mysterious thread between Kentucky and Romania, I looked to see if there was any common denominator between Transylvania in Kentucky and that in Europe. This led to a rather astonishing discovery and that is St. Germain (Rákóczi is his real family name), the famous Prince of Transylvania who, according to Manly P. Hall’s Secret Destiny of America, was present in America during the settlement of the Transylvania Colony and also instigated the Declaration of Independence as well as the revolution itself. Hall also asserts That St. Germain was a reincarnation of Francis Bacon, the author of The New Atlantis (as well as Shakespeare’s plays) which positions America as the New Atlantis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bacon and St. Germain were both Rosicrucians. As Benjamin Franklin is also deeply tied to the Rosicrucians, I looked for a connection there and found out that he was a major investor in the Transylvania Company as were many politically influential colonists such as George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and possibly Thomas Jefferson. Franklin and Jefferson both travelled to Paris where St. Germain also resided according to regular history. His presence in Paris is tied to the French Revolution. The common denominator in all of this is Rosicrucianism, a powerful secret society. Freemasonry and the Illuminati lurk in the background as well, and it is a well known fact that Jefferson commented on and corresponded with Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati. In such a scenario, it is anyone’s guess what “illuminated” agendas were at work. When we consider the realm of quantum synchronicity, which is obviously the principle at work, we are forced to consider that there is a quantum affinity (to use a term from quantum physics) or magical sympathy (to use a term from magick) at work here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The historical references and conclusions about St. Germain, to say nothing of the idealized New Age notions about him, state that he was tantamount to a time traveler. Not only did he appear in too many places at too many different times, he also cavorted with royalty and those in positions of political power. While I do not for a minute mean to suggest that David Anderson is St. Germain, there is a resonance here because David knows political leaders and also lives behind a veil of mystery. The legends of St. Germain, not the historical facts, also state that he had access to underground facilities and laboratories that are somewhat similar to those described in “Transylvanian Sunrise.”

             Agreed, and wary too. Doing nothing about a possible atrocity because you are skeptical of its extent, is far more harmful than Investigating despite the extent of its skepticism.

             It's been said (((they))) like to hide in plain sight. Wish someone would start making a list of names they've used. Such as Google using the names Adrena and Chrome. Lucent Technologies was originally Lucifer. Or so many in the tech industry naming programs after Greek gods in the underworld.
