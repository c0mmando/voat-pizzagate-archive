            So what is the time limit? How many more months until you admit nothing is happening, their is no PG investigation, the Podestas are not in Gitmo, CIA was not arrested and there is no "storm"? You can't just do this open ended indifinately. What is the expiration date for this bullshit?

            From the date of Trump's nomination on July 18, 2016 to his Inoguratuion Jan 20, 2017 - a 187 years passed! 
Remember that scene from Big - Tom Hanks - when he morphes into an adult.... when lands a job and gets his firt adult paycheck he exclaims: '....a 187 dollars!!!!' Just last week Jimmy Kimmel was making fun of Trump and his wall and said this '.....remember the wall, which was like 187 dumb ideas ago.....'!!!! 
Guys, we are dealing with Occult psychopaths who are obsessed with rituals (Gematria/child sacrifice/wars/celebrity death rituals etc....) Once a coincidence ... thrice a pattern. What we are witnessing is an internal battle between benevolent gangs (oxymoron of sorts) which includes Trump who are into making billions + corruption but have no business in the dark occult vs the Dark Lodge members - total psychopaths who are well passed making billions (Soros, Rothchilds, Rockefellers....) and have decended into madness - PG!!!!!!! 
We are in the midst of a monumental battle but we must keep it real (wise words from Ali G) Ted Gunderson has once said that the day public gets close of finding out their dark 'little' secret is the day the perpetrators will launch global wars - for they rather see earth burn in a nuclear Hollocaust than being outed as child murdering satanists that they are. 
Kepping this in mind - what are the odds that the Hawaian nuclear allert was real (pacific fleet had launched its own allert apparently), is it far fetched that these satanists had launched their own nuclear missile in a desperate effort at diversiob of what is about to be uncovered, a missile that was brilliantly intercepted by the great US Millitary!!! 
(Just keep USS Liberty - 1967 in mind!) 
Folks, these pedophile child killers could actually be outed and like a cornered rat they will strike in desperation.

            Speaking of 187 - from 1776 (Foundation of USA) to the assassination of JFK in 1963 - there were 187 years! Coincidence? 
Note: This is no longer Little League, this is the Big League of conspiracies.

            Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from multiple people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! Don’t ever question the validity of these claims! Just spend MONTHS ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

            If there is something, why is nothing happening? Where’s the Emergency Broadcast System announcement? Where’s Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people? Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Why, given the massive flight risk all globalists are, would anyone want to leak the proceedings of such an event in advance? Why would someone ostensibly leaking the proceedings not actually leak any information? Why would someone who claims to be on our side not give us a playbook for how to operate during the event? Why isn’t he telling us how to become leaders of our community to calm the terrified millions around us–who will inevitably exist once the media starts reporting on the “Trump coup”, or when they see their favorite media reporters arrested by the military live on air? Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

Question is or [Q]uestion or [Q]UESTION (however it is y'all derive meaning) will this conspiracy circus ever stop or lead to actual "change".  SHOW ME ACTUAL REAL WORLD RESULTS ALREADY FUCKERS

            I am not saying this true but one of the things I read during the election is that Valerie and Obama purchased an old mattress  warehouse, in Chicago, before he was President. They turned into a gay club where child porn was produced.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone seen this written before, or know where I read it?

                       I'm just giving her a hard time trying to get her to name one actual news site she goes to. Haha, she's stubborn. I didn't expect this to become pulling teeth. I expected a short list and an immediate direct response. I, and most people, are usually happy to share.

             She was the real President for 8 years and it's disgusting how the SS protected her they are all traitors if I were on that SS detail she would have been tortured to confess all their crimes then I would have slowly killed her but instead of doing the right thing our SS traitors protected this evil bitch. She must go to Gitmo for the rest of her life.

              SS have to protect those directed even if they hate them.  They vet put through hell and operate 24/7.  Its made clear to them they may hate who they guard before they join.  Most noobs are put in uniformed division.

              She was, and still is the policy maker for neo communists.  One of many, just so happened to be close to the kenyan faggot and have low name recognition so the masses mostly didnt know her.  She hooked up Iran with tons of cash.

             I think the fact that we are seeing all of these confirmations now via Q.  There has been enough authentication to confirm Q isn't a LARP.  We all know/knew this shit was going on, but it is way, way worse than anyone thought.

              Get the fuck out of here, all indications have always pointed to Q being a larp. Any specific prediction made has fallen flat and everything is designed to be as obscure as possible to always rely on interpretation and guesses. It's embarrassing to see how much that boomer blog garbage is pushed here.

               I do not think that they are just "Larp". There HAS been a lot of proof - of course not yet the "Big Event" we are all waiting for. But there have been smaller hints and some interesting "coincidences".    But, as Q always and again said:  "Tick Tock" and "be patient". 
These things need time. We are dealing with "The Deep State" - people who are used to think they are invincible  -  and they were for a much too long time!
              </p>
              <p>
               To bring  them down you need much preparation. I think it's obvious, why Assange was posting a chessboard. Some games of chess need a lot of moves  - and sometimes the kibitzes do not have a clue, what's the meaning of a move  -  But I hope in the end we will see a nice show down - and every chess piece will be at the right place.
              </p>
              <p>
               And  - something else: I also think that they (Q) are trying to build their "army" of information  by posting these things in the web, because mainstream media does not report it - or would ridicule and dismiss the whole story.  We all know to whom  biased media belongs - and what they would make out of that story if they were the first ones to report about it!
              </p>
              <p>
               But because of "Q" we spread the news all over the planet - without mainstream media. And we are already well informed, before media tells us what to think about it.  Now the news also has reached some German language alternative media (of course not MSM). Peope there are just starting to read about it!
              </p>
              <p>
               So I hope there will be soon reached a point where mainstream media can't ignore or dismiss it anymore, without ridiculing themselves.That's why they (Q) need "us" - the "information army".

                All I'm saying is that all these blog posts signed Q all lead nowhere. There's no part of "tick tock" or "be patient" or battling the deep state that Q has revealed to anyone. If anything, I think the very first original posts attributed to Q (but crucially, not signed -Q like some faggot) are the only posts that could have been legitimate. After those 2-3 posts, suddenly some tripfag showed up saying "Oh it's me, Q!" and now it's some quasi-religion that's taken over a bunch of other spaces like
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                 /v/pizzagate
                </a>
                . Look how people here are defending it, while still not able to provide me with a single piece of evidence to actually defend and support the assertion that Q is a real insider.
               </p>
               <p>
                Q is classic disinfo; full of believable bits and referencing plenty of real occurrences so people can point to those as legitimate, but ultimately it's just mud in the water designed to lead people in circles. I'm not saying the things Q is talking about aren't happening, but I can't believe that an insider with supposed Q-level clearance (one of 10 people in the world right?) is maintaining a spooky mystery blog and building out the CBTS™ brand across a bunch of platforms. It's a bunch of vague nonsense that allows people to squeeze it to fit their expectations and preconceptions, like a religious text.
               </p>
               <p>
                Think about this, if Q was a legitimate high-level leaker then why would they bother obscuring names as abbreviations? Why say MZ and let people assume it's Zuckerberg? Plausible deniability doesn't apply if you're an anonymous leaker. If you were trying to leak the info you would leak the fucking info and not be coy about it. There's no element of surprise if you're out there putting people's initials with wink-winks beside it on a million+ reader blog-type platform. In no way does Q's obscurity or lyrical messaging make any sense unless it's designed to APPEAR enigmatic and mysterious. It's a veneer and they will only distract people from the truth exactly in this way, by making us all argue over its legitimacy or by injecting disinfo - mission accomplished.

                  As one of 10 people in the world with this level of clearance? It seems like the list is already pretty short and it would be trivial for our surveillance-based intelligence orgs to find out which of those 10 people spends an hour a day posting bad rap lyrics to an empty 8chan board, telling everyone the secret plan.

                  im on your side man, but please indulge this guy. i'd like to see proof too. i believe Q is legit, i swear, but i'd like to see guys like this silenced rather than just parroting our mantra. i'm sure you (or someone else) can prove some things that Q was right about (with links).

                    This is all so goofy. For example, in the first image the step where "Q confirms [15] marker" by posting "LOCK: 15-10-5". That's a fucking leap for something pretty clearly intended to be, and I'm sure at the time interpreted to be, a date. But now that there needed to be a "confirm marker 15!" whatever the fuck that actually means, people go back looking for a 15 and find one.

                    Thanks for posting this but all of this confirms my doubts even further, to be honest. It's sad people can't think for themselves and just want to call everyone shills instead of opening their eyes to how ridiculous and misleading this all is. Oh well.

                     You ran out of arguments, brainlet. Keep believing your fanfic I guess, it doesn't do me any harm, I'm just sad to see people so feverishly believe such obvious bullshit when there are groups and individuals out there doing REAL WORK like Judicial Watch or Project Veritas. But yeah let's all crap ourselves over spooky Q! Have fun.

                ! It's almost like you, a fucking shill pushing ridiculous Q fiction bullshit all over this sub, are sitting around upvoting your alt accounts content and defending yourself in the comment section by calling people shills. Surely though just a (((coincidence))) right mister organic independent forum contributor? I meant it when I said you should kill yourself, faggot. Your people are not chosen, they are cancer, and we'll clear you all out soon. Keep up the fun games, kike.

                    I stopped using reddit before that happened I guess. I used to enjoy arguing with people on a few subs but that place has long just become an advertising platform run by pedophile cunts, you know.

                    I'm not trying to entertain you, I'm trying to get you to rub those braincells together and stop buying into this obvious red herring Q bullshit. But you defend it, insulted, with zealotry because it's not based in fact anymore, it's based on belief. You're either shilling this new religion or you're one of its sad true believers.

                     I'm not shilling jackshit, woodchuck.  My life's experiences has led me here.  I've looked these motherfuckers in the eye.  I've been targeted by them.  I live and walk among them.  And the last fucking thing I do will be to pull every stop to see that they get a 45 between the eyes.

                      We're on the same side, and that's why we're both here, I just think the ongoing Q blog posts are disinfo. It doesn't make sense on any level, it's just regurgitating stuff that's already out there, exactly as some mossad or cia operation would. It would take nothing at all for someone to create a tripcode on 4chan or 8chan after anons started calling one poster Q, and there's nothing I've seen since then that even proves that tripcode poster is even the same as the original poster, much less some high level insider.

                     <p>
                      I actually think Mega-anon was the real deal, but funny how Q came along just in time to take everyone's attention away. Funny.

                You argue like a leftist. All personal attacks and zero actual argument. Believe whatever you want, all I'm saying is if you still take this Q shit as a real leaker this far in, you need to just go back to watching TV and getting "the incredible story" spoonfed to you and stop shitting up the fucking forums. Kill self, thanks.

                  My credibility has nothing to do with pointing out a painfully obvious larp like this Q fiction. Anyone can point that out because it's obvious. By all means, prove me wrong instead of trying to attack me personally like a weak minded leftist. Prove your point or shut your idiotic, shilling mouth.

                     You obviously have not read a single OP of mine.  It's pretty obvious to Helen Keller that I am the diametric opposite of a leftist.  I don't need to explain Q to you.  Whether a naysayer, or a shill, you will never get it.  I suspect the latter.

             Mostly old news for the majority of us here at Voat, who have been paying attention to the grand scheme of things as they progressed, but not so much for new people recently "tuning in" as it were.

             But indeed, a few new tidbits but it otherwise repeats what we know and Q
             <em>

             </em>
             to give a sort of insider, official confirmation of everything.

             Honestly it's one of those things where it feels a little too convenient however, especially with the hype over the Memo, so as with everything I'm maintaining some healthy skepticism until we start seeing results.
