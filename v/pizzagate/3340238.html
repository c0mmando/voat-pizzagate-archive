<p>LEADERS and key funders of World Jewish Relief enjoyed an intimate kosher afternoon tea with the Prince of Wales at Clarence House on Wednesday to celebrate the Prince’s role in its Ukrainian livelihood development programme.</p>
<p>In the morning room and library of his official residence, surrounded by photographs of generations of the royal family, the Prince discussed WJR’s work with 80 staff and supporters.</p>
<p>Prince Charles is a patron of the Ukrainian programme, helping Jews in poverty to develop the skills needed to get into work. It also starts job centres and provides access to child-care.</p>
<p>A long-time supporter of the charity, he opened the WJR-funded Jewish Community Centre in Krakow in 2008.
Arriving at the reception, the Prince was greeted by WJR chair James Libson, former chair Nigel Layton and chief executive Paul Anticoni. Mr Libson thanked the royal for his “steadfast support of our community”.</p>
<p>Mr Layton said Prince Charles was keen to know “if the projects were working well, whether we were getting people into work. He likes to be kept informed.” WJR trustee Linda Rosenblatt added: “The Prince knew a number of people here personally. He asked after their families, their work. He was extremely engaged and good at stimulating conversation.”</p>
<p>Her husband Harvey, chair of Nightingale, reminisced with the Prince about his visit to the south London home to open a dementia wing.</p>
<p>Guests included Express newspaper boss Richard Desmond and representatives from the Maurice and Vivienne Wohl Foundation, which backs the programme in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Prince joked with Mr Anticoni, WJR head of programming Stacey Swimer, and supporters Irving and Gillian Carter about a recent newspaper article about “talking” to plants to help them grow.</p>
<p>“He was absolutely charming,” Mrs Carter said.</p>
<p>Prince Charles also chatted to Sir Maurice and Lady Irene Hatter, supporters of WJR and World Ort. Lady Hatter said: “He asked us how often we visit the projects in Eastern Europe and we told him about an Ort school we are hoping to open in six months </p>

             What connections exist to tie Epstein to Alefantis?
            </strong>
            thread:
           </p>
           <p>
            ""Well some of Epstein's victims are being represented by Boies Schiller Flexner. What's odd about this is BSF are more likely to attack anyone that threatens an important/powerful Democrat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boies, co-founding partner in the high-powered law firm Boies Schiller and Flexner, has deep ties to powerful Democrats.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also a frightening quote from the BSF website. They sound like the mafia:
           </p>
           <p>
            known for our creative, aggressive, and efficient pursuit of success for our clients.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were involved in representing Harvey Weinstein, Aaron Rich(Seth Rich's brother) and James Alefantis. For all these baseless, crazy conspiracy theories, why do these people hire one of the world's leading law firms?
           </p>
           <p>

            An interview with the guys who represented James Alefantis and Aaron Rich
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to BSF and their involvement with Weinstein:
           </p>
           <p>
            Boies Schiller and Flexner, has deep ties to powerful Democrats. Boies also represented Harvey Weinstein, and he hired Black Cube, an organization run largely by ex-Mossad agents, to tail, find dirt on and intimidate women who were accusing Weinstein of sexual assault. Epstein case shows corruption in legal system runs deep
           </p>
           <p>
            From that same article we can find more links:
           </p>
           <p>
            Another attorney with ties to both the Weinstein and Epstein cases is New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance. A prosecutor from Vance's office argued in favor of Epstein's petition to have his sex offender status reduced in New York.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vance's office also declined to prosecute Harvey Weinstein when Italian model and actress Ambra Battilana Gutierrez filed a complaint of sexual assault against Weinstein in New York in 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boies (there's that name again) was revealed to made tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to Vance's political campaigns over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            So are BSF cutting out the middleman(Black Cube) and simply working for Epstein's victims in order to catch them out or sabotage their case?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another connection to BSF is NXIVM linked Kirsten Gillibrand was a partner at the firm: Gillibrand leaving BSF IN 2006 """

              AGREED. Lawyers are the modern day Kabal King's Knights. Think economic hitmen, but with a more trusted glamorized front. When we depend on their
              <em>
               system
              </em>
              to be the one that determines JUSTICE, their
              <em>
               language
              </em>
              the one that describes the CASE, and their
              <em>
               officials
              </em>
              to determine the TRUTH, we are open to the deception, lack of oversight, and bribery that has tipped THE SCALE AWAY FROM THE FEATHER so many times before.

               St Paul’s is built on the site of the main Roman temple to Lucifer, which in turn was built over the site of a Druidic human sacrifice site – thus the requirement to contain the energy. The pentagrams shown in your blog encompass The City of London. The City is an independent, sovereign state and along with Washington DC and Vatican City, they administer the different aspects of Pope Innocenti’s 3 Trusts of the 1400’s, otherwise known as Unum Sanctum. Hawksmoor’s 5 churches are in fact temples in my opinion. which guard and mark the boundaries of the City as do the many dragon statues on the roadways into it. The City is indeed the New Jerusalem as celebrated in that favourite hymn of the same name sung by the Establishment at every opportunity. Its called ‘New’ because the treasures of the ‘Old’ were transported here for safe-keeping away from Suleiman’s sons and daughters. These ‘treasures’ have formed the Capital of Stirling ever since and is the reason why Stirling is the only fiat currency to last more than 50 years – it isn’t fiat, its backed by treasure on infinite value and can be hypothecated to infinity as a result.
               <strong>
                Its no coincidence that The City is called ‘The Jewish Vatican’ because that’s exactly what it is. Its also no coincidence that the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family hold their coronations and marriages there. St Pauls is a Synagogue

            George Webb has been dropping dirt on Ehud Barak lately. 
Barak is an associate and visit to Epstein’s island. Barak was a leftist Prime Minister of Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb is a Jew. Supposedly outing Jewish corruption and is a Likud leaning narrator. So, he’s a Zionist and crypto Netanyahu supporter, even though he said he voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, beware of the puppet show. You have communist Jews fighting Zionist Jews over the mountain kingship.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the left, ie communists, takes a hit here, that means the Zionists have seized control. But they’re Jews. Do we think they’re friends of us goyim. Of course not.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what’s the end game?

             Re. leftist and Bernie Sanders......he is not pure and I would not vote for him ......although a leftist myself. Bernie sold Vt. off to the highest bidder, called Chavez and Castro evil dictators although the standard of living in those countries  rose dramatically when they were in office. Sanders also demonized Russia. So if he were in office, the bombs would still be dropping and there would be no news on the "leftist" media. Some confuse leftist media with "state" media.......worlds apart.

            It'd be nice if the Mail told them to fuck off and that they'd see them in court, but that won't happen. They'll tuck their tail between their legs and do as the angry Jew commands, just like all the others, unfortunately.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales has become the Patron of World Jewish Relief. This will be the first time His Royal Highness has been the Patron of a Jewish organisation working outside of the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
             His Royal Highness, a fantastic friend of the Jewish community, was Patron of World Jewish Relief’s hugely successful Krakow Community Centre project, which was his brainchild. He opened the Centre in 2008. He has also been
             <strong>
              Patron of World Jewish Relief’s Wohl Livelihood Development Programme in Ukraine
             </strong>
             which has helped over 2,000 people towards getting back into work and bringing their families out of poverty. He has been involved with the charity for 12 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             The organisation has a rich and distinguished history, particularly its work leading the rescue of tens of thousands of Jewish people from Nazi Germany, including organising the Kindertransports in 1938.

            Jews are ridiculous. Sometimes you just have to tune them out. Turn off the tv, stop reading "news" from Jew media.

              Structure things so that there is no blow back. If you do something that would make White Nationalists look bad, always do it in a way that if covered negatively by the media the narrative can be reversed back onto the Jews.

              hey,  ill send you info about hampstead and charles, (when i get to computer) lets not forget his friendship with jimmy savile.  Remember.  The royal family are descended from jews since queen victoria and her pervert husband Albert.  Please read up on his family name and who illuminati adam stayed with when he was expelled from bavaria.

             I feel it is necessary to speak out at this time about the shift that has occurred recently. Three years ago, when the first of us were asked to be initiated into the Rising Star Healing work, the cost was $10,000 and the initiation, which we were told was a "source to source" initiation and we could only receive it from Derek O'Neill in Ireland, who was the vehicle for source to come thru) however, we were told that we would be helping to heal the planet and people would be so drawn to this healing work we would within a short period of time recoup our investment. In the last few months Derek has changed his policy, which originally we were told "you cannot copy write God's work, it is here for all of us to take forward to the planet" to "As of June 1st, 2008 if you wish to practice the Rising Star Healing Modality or the Prema Birthing Healing Modality you must "join" a membership in Derek's new organization at $600 a year and pay 30% of each healing to this organization or they will take legal action against us for "copy write infringement" as Derek has now copywrited these healing modalities. ...

             Forty-eight-year-old Derek is not what you would expect in a man who was raised by an alcoholic widow and has braved poverty, sexual abuse and the perils of kung fu fighting. He is gentle, eloquent and has surprisingly small hands for a warrior. They look more suited to arts and crafts than the craft of martial arts. His neatly cropped hair is a reminder of his time in the army.

             "We lived close to the Iveagh Lodgings and there would often be 'dirty old men', destitutes, hanging around. When I was six, I went to the toilet in Patrick's Park and was sexually assaulted by one of them."
            </p>

             His experience of sexual abuse didn't confine itself to St Patrick's Park. Derek's brother Brian was raped and beaten in the notorious Letterfrack Industrial School.

             Lol how do you women explain Jews owning every newspaper and Hollywood etc. If media is essential to pizzagate that makes it a Jewish conspiracy by definition.
            </p>
            <p>
             And since media manipulation is obviously used for things besides sexual abuse, the logical classification is elite pedophilia (w or w/o blackmail) ie pizzagate is merely one branch or, if you will, one expression of the uniquely Jewish lust for power and evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Only this explains the cooperation of non-elite Jews too, like how I proved they write 1/4 of children's books about trannies.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the result of course is that nothing will change because there are well over 20m Jews to replace The Swamp:
