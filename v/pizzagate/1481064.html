            Imagine if you're Trump right now. You knew this was going on. Maybe you got sick of it. Maybe you got in too deep, and kept them at distance with bribes. How much of an opportunity is it that the news is breaking out? It is not probable that the general populace was going to discover this at this moment. Maybe there were "backroom" plans to guide the people through disclosure, and even more farther in the back of the room to solve the problem, like completely solve this in a way that it becomes a proper crime again that people start reporting each other to the police. And that only real black market, uncontrollable, invisible type of stuff remains, which will always remain possibly....

            It isn't much of a PR gift, more of a way to really mean something to the world. That is not easy. It is almost suspicious that this role is ascribed to him by sheer circumstance. I personally start to have high hopes that Trump really holds this potential, where as before I thought he was just a bit of a  swine. It is a matter of wait and see, and pray.
