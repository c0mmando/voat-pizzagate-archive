            I don't get this guy. He's directed and produced nothing that substantial. How did he have so more power and access to actresses?

             Everyone that presents himself as a producer, director, casting agent gets tons of girls of all ages. I even saw a very beautiful young women try for the obviously super gay grip, a lowly crew position, just because he was talking to the director about the next scene we were working on.

             James Toback has perfected his line of BS. So he did a few high school type flicks. That's enough of a calling card.
