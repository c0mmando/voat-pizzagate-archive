            -- this msg is to you, more than anyone else. Thanks...you just sent me down a 5 hour rabbit hole. This post is a diamond in the rough from my viewpoint. I am totally displeased that a moderator has flagged it as "debunked', based on, well... nothing. Color me unsurprised due to the nature of this subject matter which is surely above the heads of 75% of people here (not trying to be insulting to those 75%, just saying that it is likely that there are around 25% of us here looking at this matter through an alltogether different lens where I could see this post making absolutely zero sense to them.) It is also unfortunate that the author of this book has unpopular opinions - which some will say you are referencing as a means to allow easy discreditation of this research.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel that this is not the case. Just a gut instinct.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moderator totally missed the point of this post. The point is not the etymology of the world cannibalism. But rather what I believe you are talking about (or maybe you are not and this is just me placing my own spin on things) is the "Serpent Seedline" / genetic bloodline of Cain and how it is exactly the the practice of occult magic, cannibalism and human sacrifice survived through the great flood to bring us where we are today. From a logical viewpoint, if the point of the flood was to wipeout the seed of Cain (the only ones taking part in the aforementioned activities), and it is known that the seed of Cain somehow DID indeed survive (multiple references to Giants in the Bible after the occurrence of the flood, plus places like Babylon and Egypt post flood were obviously heavily influenced by Luciferian/Cain bloodline thinkers) then it would seem that the flood was a 'failure'. Not so. The seed of Cain needed to survive so that end-times prophecy could be fulfilled as was promised long before the flood. I believe this was why there was a 'curse' put upon Cain such that any person who killed him would be in deep trouble (because YHVH needed him to fulfill his plan of bringing about the Antichrist thru the seedline of Cain in the end days).
           </p>
           <p>
            So the flood was brought about to exterminate the hybrid human/angel abominations (serpent seedline) which were at that time the prevailing force in the world, but YHVH still had to retain a vehicle in which to bring that seedline forth in the future to fulfill prophecy. What was that vehicle? This is where I was stuck, until your post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ham was the son of Noah, who created the ark. Noah was married at the time of the flood, but traditional sources curiously leave his wifes name out. Ancient Jewish texts, occult references and members of the Serpent Seedline itself all seem to agree that Noah's wife was "Naamah". Interestingly, Naamah was the brother of Tubal-Cain, who was himself a descendant of the Cain bloodline.  Naamah herself is the last-named female in the genealogy of Cain. Tubal Cain is a revered figure in freemasonry, as an added note. It is claimed Tubal Cain was the first alchemist (further tying into the occult). You might know that alchemy is a science of fallen angels which was taught to Cain's tribe shortly after Abel's murder when he fled to the west to start anew. Cain's tribe were regularly visited by fallen angels who taught them vast knowledge of science, magic, astronomy, math, and more...the women of the tribe also bred with these fallen angels creating a hybrid species (The Serpent Seedline) which were the abominations YHVH wished to wipe out with the flood.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if Naamah was of the Cain bloodline then it would stand to reason that she grew up in the world where fallen-angel-science was a normal every-day-thing. Man had become so corrupted by this point just before the flood that YHVH expressed disgust and regret that he had even created man at all. Yet despite this she ended up with Noah and they ended up having several children together, one of which was Ham.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now there was a curious incident between Ham and Noah (often called the Curse of Ham) which does not make much sense from a literal standpoint but makes a LOT of sense if you think about it in terms of Genetics. The story is essentially that Ham walked into Noah's tent one night and found his father drunk and passed out. Then, Ham saw his fathers "nakedness" and when Noah sobered up and found out what Ham had done, he placed a curse upon Ham's offspring. Now, that seems pretty silly on its face on multiple levels and I have seen compelling evidence which suggests a different interpretation: That Ham used the drunken state of his father as a window of opportunity in which to 'bed' his own mother Naamah in an incestuous act resulting in the conception of Ham's son, Caanan, who became the creator of the Caananite civilization. It was the bastard offpsring which was cursed by Noah, remember. Why would he choose to curse the offspring, and not Ham himself? We all know that in-breeding causes mutations... I also know from breeding dogs that if you breed mother/son that this is a way to promote or lock in certain genetic strains which are desirable but the process cannot be repeated often without mutation. Is it possible that the incestuous act between Ham and Naamah 'locked in' or promoted the Serpent Seedline in their DNA, creating the first post-flood Cain-bloodline-DNA traits which were at that time all but surpressed? Interestingly Ham also fathered Cush, who was the father of Nimrod (the founder of Babylon). Now considering the Cain-bloodline affiliation with sexual deviancy, child sacrifice and ritual magic, it is not too hard to imagine how Naamah might not view incest as a big deal. Certainly this would not have been a spontaneous act, but a tension building up over time between mother and son and it would seem logical based on Noah essentially becoming a drunkard by that point that his wife Naamah sought comfort in the arms of another man.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sons of Noah, including Ham, all venture forth after this point to civilize their own corner of the continent. The Cain-bloodline proliferates widely and Ham's grandson Nimrod creates Babylon around the same time Egypt comes to power. Both Babylon on Egypt have mythology which closely follow the beliefs and practices of the original Cain-bloodline-tribe (using science, magic, sacrifice, sexual deviancy, genetic modification, alchemy, etc...to attain 'godhood'/ascension). These themes can be seen still today. The bloodlines and hidden mysteries have been passed down thru the ages. Lucifer himself wanted to be God, so anywhere where you see this theme you can be sure the serpent seed is behind it. In fact, every religion, every institution, every power structure, is being ran by people who are a part of this genetic 'tree'. Search your heart and you will know this to be true. WE OURSELVES are corrupted by this DNA, and it is possible that this is one reason why we must "die and be born again" - because our flesh is indeed tainted in its current form. There is a reason why there is so much talk of 'trees', 'fruit' and 'seeds' in the bible. There is a reason why there are incredibly boring and long lists of lineages and bloodlines in the bible.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is so much more to cover I have only scratched the surface.... But here we are today: the serpent seedline is more prevalent than ever before and they are actively working to bring about the 'perfect' Anti-christ thru genetic manipulation, fallen-angel-science and deceit, all in front of our very noses. They are getting bolder - look at the complete degeneracy our world-society has come to. The fact that organizations such as "NAMBLA" can even exist is a pretty good indication of where we are at, morally.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you know that Babylon was the birthplace of the concept of "Social Justice"/Transhumanism? Did you know that the Babylonian religion was a trinity of mother/father/son with an immaculate conception and resurrection story which most modern religions are based upon today, including "Christianity"?. The version that became popular in Egypt was the Isis/Osiris/Horus Story, which has the exact same narrative. There have been a lot of different names of deities in this mystery religion but they all harken back to the same source. (Baal, Marduk, Molech, Ra, Saturn, El....) They ALL = Lucifer in a clever disguise. Remember lucifer is the bringer of light and knowledge, who himself is described as a beautiful angel of light. So much more but I really need to take a typing break.

             ba'al has some connection to Aleppo : "The word Ba'al can be translated as "lord", "owner", "master", or "husband", and referred to a group of deities venerated in the Levant. Some of these deities were also known under different names (e.g., the storm god Hadad of Aleppo), in which case Ba'al was a title; in other cases, Ba'al appears to have been a name. The oldest references to him are personal names from the third millennium BCE."
