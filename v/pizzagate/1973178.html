<p>Notorious Big was shot.  The media reported that his death resulted from a feud with Tupac. The case remains unsolved.</p>
<p><strong>Tupac</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvpi0LRTa740">spoke</a> of the ritual abuse, society\'s inequalities and oppression.  His last album was “Makaveli: The Don Killuminati”. He said:  “I’m putting the ‘K’ because I’m killin’ that shit.” He was shot and taken to hospital where he died six days later. The case remains unsolved.</p>

<p>The media reported that UGK rapper Pimp C\'s death was the result of an overdose triggered by codeine combined with a pre-existing sleep condition (according to the LA County coroner\'s office)</p>
<p>But his close friend said:</p>
<p><em>&quot;He was laying down like he was praying but there was blood around like he was shot. They thought he was shot in the head. But they didn’t know what the hell happened because there was blood everything. They thought he was shot. He was kneeled down like he was preying and the candles were all the way burned down, so they know he probably been dead for a day or something because he always lit these candles to sleep</em>. </p>
<p>The man is found lying in a pool of blood, in a kneeling position, surrounded by candles--not suspicious at all!!</p>

            The Illuminati secret societies use black people as a pawn, like tools. They do not look at them as equal. They look at them like the slave masters did, as equipment to use to further their own personal goals.

            to those evil fucks pedophilia is all of the above....everything else they do is an absolute failure. they seem to only excel when it relates to hurting children which leads me to believe that their only true goal is that. everything else is just a beard.

            What's crazy is how people are SO brainwashed and under mind control, even people who are fans of Pac, Pimp-C, Prodigy, and the like, even a lot of those people don't believe in the secret societies. Its like, okay, so Tupac dedicates an entire album (including the title) to the concept, but it's just complete bullshit? Wake up people, damn. These rappers were trying to tell you something other than "get high, fuck bitches" and you weren't paying any attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you will notice how 99% of rappers these days are completely materialistic, never talking about anything real, just being goofy monkey ass negroes as Pimp-C would put it. It's because they know the deal by now, based on what happened to these guys. Talk Truth, Get Killed.

             Yep, I too have noticed that no rappers these days talk about the struggles of their people. None of them tackle the difficult stuff, which is what rappers used to do.  Nowadays they're dressed in preppy clothes and NEVER talk about the hood and the plight of the black people.

             You're spot on.  Tupac, Pimp C and Big came from the projects. They cared about the black community and were spokesmen for their black brothers. They kept it real. The new hip hop are manufactured pretty boys who know to keep their mouths shut and NEVER speak up for the black man.

              I also feel like race relations were going in a better direction until modern "trap" music came along and started creating a new generation of what I would call "hyper thugs," people who are getting into the idea of drug dealing and murdering people when they're seven, eight years old. Trap music along with all the other factors of living in the hood is creating very violent black youth.

             And Kanye for trying.  I think he has been silenced for good.  Unless something wares off and he takes to the stage again to tell it to the people.  If they let him get on the stage again.

              If Kanye ever has a breakdown again, they'll kill him while he's in 5150 hold, or shortly thereafter. He already pushed their buttons, and I'm sure if he does it again, someone higher up in the chain will say "kill that damn nigger already" and that'll be it for him.

               Yes, I am not either.  But I certainly have a lot of respect for him coming out and spilling the beans when it could mean death.  He probably thought he was worth too much for them to off him, but if he does it again, which I doubt because they have taken care of that, you can bet he will be taken out.

               I think his being married to Kim the witch helps too...I'd hate to think what could happen to him if he divorced. Sudden death or at least a major mental breakdown he never comes back from.

                Not so sure about that, being married into that witches brew only increases his own personal 'hoodoo', much much harder to leave the dinner party when you have a seat right next to one of the hostesses....

              Same withPhilip Seymour Hoffman. At that level, somebody has to give you a hot batch. Cobain however, suposedly blew his head off with a shotgun. Rediculous.

               Considering the industry he was in, you cannot doubt his exit at his age. Or Jim Morrisons. Or Joplins, Or Hendricks.Notcie...only illuminati album cover Eddie Vedder still lives. Johinie Depps good friend. Eddie Vedder of West Memphis threee are inocent fame? Damien Echols wrote a song for his album? ...Yeah Illuminati has nothing to do with Cobains death....M'kay.

                Anyone in Hollywood making any real money is connected to the Illuminati.  They are controlling them all. Most of them are Satanists or   Scientologists.  Many are also involved in Secret Societies as well.

                 This. Getting people to understand that they are ALL involved in this, that's key. People still think that these "secret groups" consist of a few hundred people at the very tippy top of the power structure. They've got covens and Masonic Lodges in every single small town and big city in America, and abroad.

                  Yeah they don't like to talk about the years that L Ron wanted to find a woman to have Satans baby so they could nuture the evil seed and thus eradicate evil...true story but not one in Dianetics.

            This is all very real. Noticed the hints, clues amd listened to these guys telling us the truth WELL BEFORE pizzagate. Watched them killed as revenge for speaking out.  Its odd how the idiots dont realize that by murdering their enemies that they are making the claims seem true.

             They don't care if the claims seem true.  They have their protectors.  But there will come a day when that won't matter.  All of the people that closely followed their music are becoming red pilled.  They will go from hundreds to thousands to the millions.  Spread the Word.

              it's already happening in front of our eyes. I can't tell you how many times I have been reading other forums, news stories or random web pages lately and noticed sooooo many people coming to the conclusion that the whole "Illuminati" "new world order" schtick is/was really just a pedophile ring making themselves seem mystical and powerful. People are coming to the same conclusions that we as a group have arrived at . its only a matter of time now until it all comes crashing down on their wierd  asses and "they" know it.

                It's mighty presumptuous to assume that I am a slave to any jew. And as far as refusing to pay taxes;  I'm 5 steps ahead of that.......And I'm glad death^ noticed that you had to bring the race card into it..... truth is, I don't really see many jews getting more than fiat currency. There is truly only a handful of their race who REALLY prosper and those guys don't seem to be motivated by money. In all appearances, it is little boy butthole that motivates the 1%. That much is undeniable.

                 This is where you really need your thinking cap on. The problem is not "Jews" but rather a group/race of people who CLAIM to be Jews, but in reality, they are the descendants of a tribe of Israel that was kicked out due to the fact that they, like you said, liked little boy butthole too much, and they also sacrificed children to Moloch/Ba'al. Those people are the people who currently run Israel and call themselves "Jews." Israel has been owned and controlled by the ROTHSCHILD FAMILY since at least the end of World War I. So when people say "its the Jews," they're only half-right. The Bible calls them "Those who say they are Jews but are not. They are the Synagogue Of Satan."

                  exactly, the reason for doing so much evil shit in the name of "jews" is to give true spiritual jews (of every ethnic background, chosen by the creator) a bad name.... a true false flag in the simplest sense of the phrase.

               I so agree.  I don't follow this music, but I commend those that have had the guts to speak out, knowing that they may die.  Yes, they knew that, for many have gone before them, for telling it like it is.

                 I agree!  Remember that Black people know about the occult. Granted there are White people that listen to hip hop but they did not hear about this growing up.  It goes way back.  Many of their grandmothers and Moms told them about this stuff as they were growing up.  I have read it on here a couple of times.  People recalling what they heard in their childhood from the people that were instrumental in raising them.  And yes, If he was not pulling in a lot of dough, yeah, he would be gone.  I remember the day of the rant.  Someone on here posted it. Wow.

                  Keep in mind that a lot of black magick (like brujeria) originate from Africa. So people took the beliefs over here when they became slaves, and then the African black magick mixed with the local occult beliefs and created entire new occult belief systems. Its impossible to really trace anything back to a single source.

                   Yes, the Slaves knew about all of this and passed it down.  Thank God for them.  Thank God for the people that listened and are remembering.  We must reach out to the hip hop group and to Black people to spread the word for our people have not been enlightened when it comes to  satanic horrors.

                    It's harder for black folks to give up their idols because they have it ingrained in their head that if someone is black, their motivations should not be questioned. "Gotta do what you gotta do" is the attitude of many black folks. I have many black friends (I live in Orlando) and we talk about this stuff often. My friends are open minded enough, but they all say that their aunts/cousins/parents/siblings think the Illuminati stuff is 100% bullshit and say things like "I don't care if ___ is a devil worshipper, they sexy!!"

                     I think this is the newer crowd.  I am talking about the really old folks, that grew up in the south and handed it down to children and then some did the same.  The ones that integrated into the cities and had children are not enlightened.  The chain has been broken.
