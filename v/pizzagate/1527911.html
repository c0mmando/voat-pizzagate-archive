<blockquote>
<p>In addition, opponents of decriminalizing prostitution for a minor believe that law-enforcement officers would be unable to do their job. It would render seizures unconstitutional, as the minor’s actions would be lawful and officers must mind the individual’s rights. Under SB 1322, an officer has the authority to take minors into temporary custody only “if leaving them unattended would pose an immediate threat to their health or safety.” Jane Creighton, the coordinator of the human-trafficking unit at the office of the Los Angeles County district attorney, suggested that legislators take a step back before passing SB 823 and SB 1322. Creighton told the Los Angeles Times that law-enforcement personnel must be able to arrest the minors and keep them in secure facilities because many will not voluntarily accept the services provided them.</p>
<p>Another unintended outcome, noted by the California District Attorneys Association and other law-enforcement groups, is that the decriminalization of prostitution for minors would give them no incentive to testify against their pimps, making it nearly impossible to prosecute the real criminals. It is clear that many relevant California authorities oppose SB 823 and SB 1322, but California’s legislature has made the decision to send the bills to the governor’s desk. “Right now, service groups are struggling with what they have in place — there [are] just not enough resources,” Creighton concluded. “I am not saying these bills should never pass. But we are not ready for them right now.”</p>
