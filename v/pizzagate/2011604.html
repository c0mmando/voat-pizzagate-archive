<p>So I pulled it up on Google Earth. And what do you know, it\'s across the street from a church.

<p>I pulled up a couple more Chicago locations (because <em>how many</em> politicians are from the area?)</p>
<p>Some show up with a map.
<a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/82be0c5cdc/32368.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/82be0c5cdc/32368.png</a></p>
<p>And some do not.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.hourscenter.com/franks-franks/chicago/6759088/">3838 W 111th St</a> is a 2bd, 1 bath, 5000sf condo. Phone number goes to Frank McGowan, a dentist, who just so works at that address. <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3838-W-111th-St-Chicago-IL-60655/58371660_zpid/">In a condo.</a></p>
<p>On Google Earth, it shows a business front, complete with patron.

<p>Check out the ribbons on the pole. When one tries to view it closer from a different angle, it\'s blurred out. One can understand why they\'d blur out the face of a stranger, but to have it extend to cover the pole as well? I don\'t buy it. They blur out licence plates on cars all the time, staying within the boundary of the plate holder. They can do precision. Why obscure that ribbon in addition to that dude\'s face?</p>

<p>The dentist office is also located across the street from a high school,</p>
<p>And in the next building, a pizza shop.</p>
<p>10956 S Avenue L
Chicago, Illinois 60617
This address goes to an accountant. <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/82be0c5cdc/32375.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/82be0c5cdc/32375.png</a></p>

<p>Funny enough, it also shows up as a restaurant with a menu sorta similar to Joseph\'s Bistro (minus the Italian language) with the addition of Pizza!
