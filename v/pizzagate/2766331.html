<h2>The extent of the scandal was outlined at the opening of the <strong>Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA)</strong> hearings in Nottingham that revealed that 343 individuals have come forward to say they were sexually abused as children.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Despite three previous police investigations and numerous reviews, the scale of the scandal in Nottinghamshire has never been fully understood or investigated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The inquiry heard there had been a historical &quot;rift&quot; between the police and social services that led to a &quot;crisis&quot; in child protection in the county.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>One unidentified complainant said in a statement: &quot;The approach that the councils of Nottingham have taken to the abuse is just an extension of the abuse. &quot;It just drags it on.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patrick Sadd, counsel to the Inquiry, said: &quot;As at 2015, when this investigation was selected to form part of the national inquiry, recent police investigations had only led to one conviction for child sexual abuse in a children\'s home.&quot;</p>
<p>Since 2015 there have been a series of further criminal prosecutions in Nottinghamshire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most notorious children\'s homes in Nottingham, known as Beechwood, has been singled out by the inquiry for special investigation. There were 136 allegations of sexual abuse from children there between the 1960s and the 1990s.</p>
<p><strong>Yet just two instances of disciplinary action resulted from the allegations of sexual abuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In another case a care worker who was engaging in sexual activity with an underage girl in his care was not sacked because \'he may not have been aware it was wrong.\'</strong></p>
<p><em>Oh great. Not.</em></p>
<p>Mr Sadd told the inquiry that the following justification was given to a subsequent investigation: &quot;He was not dismissed because in 1983 there was a lack of clear guidance given to him as the role of a house parent.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Nobody knew back in 1983 that a house parent shouldn\'t abuse children? Now, that\'s interesting. /s</em></p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, who is representing around 30 survivors, told Sky News: &quot;It is a total betrayal, the system didn\'t work for them, the institutions didn\'t even co-operate and hardly talked to each other.</h1>
<h1>The Inquiry is also examining the failure of the council to address abuse allegations from children who had been placed into foster care in Nottinghamshire.</h1>
<p>In one case Mr Sadd said the child was just ignored: <strong>&quot;The police viewed the incident as a foster child \'plying her trade... rather than being harmed.\'&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>In January 2018 the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council councillor Kay Cutts made a full apology to those who suffered abuse in care.</strong></p>
<p><em>Oh, then everything is ok now I guess. /s</em></p>

            Thanks for the ping, only just got around to reading it. I know of a case like this that happened a decade ago irl (but on a much smaller scale.) I won't share the specific case because it involves someone that I know and his family, but it was a case of a scout leader abusing his position - a man who was a police officer for a profession. It's hard to read, but these sick fucks exist and they get away with it for too long.

            It's a well oiled system.   Care homes came out of workhouses and we know the horrors that went on there.

            All we need to do is encourage reckless breeding and then offer shelter.  You will only hear dodgy people speak of the all the good they do. The good just do.

            Interesting that there's only one minor story on the regional news section of the BBC about this. They like brushing things under the carpet at the BBC don't they. Any time I see this kind of thing and see the way it has been dealt with by the authorities I can't help feeling like there are big fish to be fried and that's why nobody is really pulled up over it. Seesm they're scared that the little fishes will talk about the big fishes, and that would be a no, no.

            BBC covered for Jimmy Saville for years!! There may be some shakeups coming out of there very soon. One of their main pedo protectors works for The NY Times.

            Wow. There are 22 homes for children in one county? How many kids are there in each home? Are these orphanages? Foster homes? Are they privately run, or set up by the government? Why so many kids not with their families? This seems like a very high number. I wonder how the number of kids' homes compares to other counties, and to counties in US cities.

               Yep, thats not plastered all over the news is it?  They have been working for years to get everyone dependent on the government and its almost complete I'd say.  It pays you not to work here, you get more in benefits, and the attitude of 1,000s of Brits is why should I work, or they owe me, the sense of entitlement is sickening.

                 Sadly most of these women, who are really children, know nothing else because they have not been 'parented' properly themselves.  If your mom had you when she was 16 and you have a baby at 16 what chance do you have?  Its a culture thing, and a situation that is not easily going to change any time soon, especially as its being encouraged by those in authority.  Just a sad situation all round, for the parents and the children alike.

                  The articles clearly state women of any status or age are CHOOSING single-motherhood even thru IVF to keep their economic independence and cock-hungry lifestyle.

                  There's "bad parenting" and there's "pay for your teen daughters all-alcohol-included graduation trip to Ibiza."  UK deserves this for being such morally bankrupt slaves to the Jews.

                   I am not a libtard womans rights person haha.  No hackles go up when the word 'woman' is said. Men and women can be bad, good or ugly, we're all humans at the end of the day. I have been married 39 years and raised lovely children, I know my husband has skills/abilities I do not have and visa versa so we work together to get the most out of life.  I don't waste time on futile arguments and things that I cannot change lol
