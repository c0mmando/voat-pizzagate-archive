<p>In Ella Draper\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwoe2eB-Bo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m52s">recent video</a> she says that UK major media outlets were served with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSMA-Notice">Defence Advisory (DA) notice</a>.  <em>That is an official request to news editors not to publish or broadcast items on specified subjects</em> <strong>FOR REASONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a copy of the IPCC\'s letter to Ella Draper upholding her appeal: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/336623224/5555">https://www.scribd.com/document/336623224/5555</a></p>
<p>From the DA Notice <a href="http://www.dnotice.org.uk/">official website</a> there is an interesting <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=http://www.dnotice.org.uk/linkedfiles/dnotice/records/20150312-dpbacreviewreport-final-o.doc">Review Report</a>.  <strong>Annex C lists DA Notice requests</strong> and demonstrates the mechanism through which the government and the mainstream media work together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This approach, in one form or another, dates back to 1912, when it was decided that a system was needed to avoid the disclosure of information that might be of value to a potential enemy. From the outset it was a system jointly operated by government and media. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the factors within this case, that I think points to very high level connection is the ex-husband of Ella Draper, who is listed in the court documents as the financier of the cult Will Draper.  His full name is <strong>James William Draper</strong> and there is too much information to post about  here, so I have (<em>hastily</em>) compiled some of my findings in a separate post here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateunedited/1711685">Will Draper: banker and Royal Arch Mason</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In that post I mention a company that he was a director of : <strong>47 HOLLYCROFT AVENUE MANAGEMENT LTD</strong> which appears to be the management company for the property that Ricky Dearman, Ella and the children lived at in Hampstead.  Ricky is still registered there with one of his companies (this is significant and I will get to that in a future post).</p>
<p>.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>That company has had a series of company directors over the years, one of them being Professor Ilana Glass who <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/01023522/officers">resigned as Director</a> back in 1994.  At that time she worked for the <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VMNCDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;lpg=PT23&amp;dq=professor+ilana+glass+addiction+maudsley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LGftMKW77U&amp;sig=lO-RdtA28cRw0S_Q3igVGVdYdOI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJneni2s7SAhViLsAKHbnQB8EQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=professor%20ilana%20glass%20addiction%20maudsley&amp;f=false">Maudsley Hospital in the area of addiction</a>.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The company was also <strong><a href="https://www.companies-register.com/47-hollycroft-avenue-management-limited-05256889">registered with Temple Secretaries Ltd in Finchley Road</a></strong> at one point...and that\'s a whole other story... For now, just know that Temple Secretaries is one of those notorious companies mentioned in this article : <a href="http://www.zeronation.co.uk/71897/politicians-westminster-siphon-off-worlds-wealth-bank-accounts/">How Politicians in Westminster Siphon off Worlds Wealth into their Bank Accounts</a>  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prof.  Glass is now Prof. Ilana Crome <a href="http://www.checkdirector.co.uk/director/ilana-glass/">http://www.checkdirector.co.uk/director/ilana-glass/</a></p>
<p>There are other reasons why I think this property is directly linked with Tavistock but that will be addressed in a future post.</p>

            It's clear to me that Draper isn't only a banker. And the interesting thing is that no one really wants to pursue that line of investigation.  He  was the one who introduced Ella and Ricky.

            And yes,  I feel a slight sympathy for the idiots in DC who hang around CPP because they think it has an 'edgy' vibe, completely oblivious to the manipulation.

            My heart goes out to this lady, don't know how she keeps it together.  She had nothing to gain from making this up and has lost so much.  Would be amazing if the teachers with tattoos could be briefly kidnapped &amp; photographed to support the kids testimony.

            Tavistock Institute is headquartered in London. Its prophet, Sigmond Freud
           </p>
           <p>
            we know the Freud's are pedophiles
           </p>
           <p>
            Tavistock Institute developed the mass brain-washing techniques which were first used experimentally on American prisoners of war in Korea. Its experiments in crowd control methods have been widely used on the American public, a surreptitious but nevertheless outrageous assault on human freedom by modifying individual behavior through topical psychology. A German refugee, Kurt Lewin, became director of Tavistock in 1932. He came to the U.S. in 1933 as a "refugee", the first of many infiltrators, and set up the Harvard Psychology Clinic, which originated the propaganda campaign to turn the American public against Germany and involve us in World War II.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1938, Roosevelt executed a secret agreement with Churchill which in effect ceded U.S. sovereignty to England, because it agreed to let Special Operations Executive control U.S. policies. To implement this agreement, Roosevelt sent General Donovan to London for indoctrination before setting up OSS (now the CIA) under the aegis of SOE-SIS. The entire OSS program, as well as the CIA has always worked on guidelines set up by the Tavistock Institute.

            More bullshit lies and ignoring of the facts of this story.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was never a D-notice and media did report on the story when the judgement came in.  It just wasn't flattering to her at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing that was banned was the naming of and showing of the children for their own protection but it doesn't the few supporters of this story from plastering their images and names all over the internet still.

              Because the person whose job it was to issue them said he never issued one.  Nothing stops you asking them that question either.

              Also a D-notice isn't enforceable, just an advisory request and the press could choose to report the story if they wanted to.  The press were asked by the court not to name or show the children for their own protection and rightly so.

             I think the only people twisting the facts of the story are the media and the government, there is something not right about this story. The mother is saying there is a D-Notice and I have watched both children's 2 hour police interviews and read the medical reports where the children where sexually abused. I'm afraid it is u who us ignoring the 'facts of the story' and believing the bullshit you are fed. Unless you are a paid shill which I believe is more likely. Either way the truth will come out

             I know that Daily Mail story to be bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             But now I am interested in the D-notice claims that Ella has made.  When it comes to documentation I've never known Ella to make things up. Can you back up
             <em>
              your
             </em>
             claim that a D-notice was never made ?
            </p>
            <p>
             And my findings re
             <em>
              Will Draper and the registered companies and directors
             </em>
             that I have posted here are all verifiable.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit:  Btw, I'm quite interested in the Russian connection if you have any further info in that respect.

              You are the one claiming this to be true so you should be the one proving it instead of listening to yet more lies and parroting them back without ever investigating whether they are true or not.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was the same with the Hollie Greig story, whose mother claimed there was a D-notice (now known as DSMA) and lo and behold the usual suspects were behind pushing that rubbish also.
             </p>
             <p>
              Someone actually contacted the person at the time whose job it was to issue D-notices and showed his reply where he stated there absolutely was not a D-notice placed on this story.

                Let me assure you that no Defence Advisory guidance has been issued on the case of Hollie Greig, nor will it be. The DA Notice System covers only the core national security issues defined in the five Standing DA Notices. These are of course purely advisory and are not supported by any form of sanction, legal or otherwise; advice offered under them can be accepted or ejected in whole or in part. For full details see www.dnotice.org.uk.
               </p>
               <p>
                The case of Hollie Greig falls far outside the DA Notice System guidelines. and whether or not certain people are treating this case as a 'no-go area' it is certainly not because of any DA Notice concerns.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sincerely,

                Care to provide a link to that to back it up?  Does it state if there was a D-notice or an enquiry about one?
               </p>
               <p>
                If you have been studying it for a long time then you will be able to answer many questions about it.  Like,..
               </p>
               <p>
                How many times was Abraham jailed for violence, lying and drugs.  Also what are your though about him beating up the mother of his children so badly she ended up in hospital and having been cautioned for violently abusing one of his own children.
               </p>
               <p>
                Were you able to find out if the child porn on his phone was of Ella's children or just random children?
               </p>
               <p>
                Can you explain why the healing cuts and bruises on the children were inflicted by the father when they hadn't seen him for three months?
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you agree that torturing the children by various methods such as holding his hand over their noses and mouths so they couldn't breath, making them kneel and pouring water over them, kicking, punching them and drugging them with cannabis over a long period of time was acceptable to get the story out of them?
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you really believe evil, satanic Narnia exists behind the wardrobe of the Headmaster, even when the police saw it was just a wardrobe after all when they checked out his house?
               </p>
               <p>
                Was Ella a good mother when she left her children locked out on the balcony in their pajamas with no food or water for hours?
               </p>
               <p>
                In this transcribed part of the recording taken at Jean-Clement's place, "Mr Christie urges the children to “Say it… Say it how they say it.” A. “Kill, kill, kill.” …. Mr Christie, “What’s the word that you say?” A. “Kill.” Mr Christie, “Say it more for me. I want to hear it…. I like the sound of it. Can you say it together, say it, let’s all say it together.” There is then repeated chanting of the word “Kill” and a little later of the phrase, “Kill the baby.” Once more Mr Christie urges the children on saying, “Let’s say it together. Let’s say it together. Kill the baby.” And they do."  do you also like the sound of it or do you think there is a comparison to the recent worldcorp video of the child in the shower being told to repeat what the person wants them to?
               </p>
               <p>
                I have many more questions but that few should do for now.  Hope you are all warmed up enough to actually answer them all because nobody else usually does.  They just call me a pedo protector or other assorted insults instead.  I would much prefer to read your reply to those questions first before you carry on posting other drivel which you never investigated and just repeated because it sounded good.

                 The link re Hollie Greig ?  It's in my post...if you can read.
                </p>
                <p>
                 All the other questions ?  I've been through all that 2 years ago.  Not doing it again.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As I said, this is a complicated case.  And I don't believe anyone, apart from the children, is entirely innocent in this case.
                 <br/>
                 Are you going to paint a convenient story with me that it was the mother and her boyfriend and there's absolutely nothing else to see here ??
                 <em>

                  And there it is again.  Denial.  I have yet to find any single supporter of this story that will answer any single one of those questions because they are just too uncomfortable and don't fit their narrative or the facts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At least you have somewhat politely resorted to the usual response tactic of calling me the usual shill/pedo protector/blah blah insult instead of the manic hatefulness that is usually the case for pointing these things out. I thank you for that but I never expected you to answer those questions because you prefer the fantasy to the fact that Abraham Christie hurt those kids.  Nice deflection though.

                    Depends how hilarious and gullible I find it.  For sure it won't have any single answer to any single one of my questions still.  Carry on ignoring that elephant in the room.

                      I have yet to find a single supporter of this story that will answer any single one of them so please, for the benefit of every person here who hasn't seen your so-called answers to these questions you claim to have answered (yet provide no proof you did), why don't you just answer them instead of deflecting yet again?  Is it so hard for you to answer a handful of simple questions here so others may know your thoughts?  Apparently it is an impossible task akin to getting blood out of a stone.  Or prove me wrong in this matter.
