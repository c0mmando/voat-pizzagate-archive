            Trump is our enemy as much as the Clintons.  He hasn't done FUCK ALL for the victims of trafficking.  He hasn't fired Comey.  He hasn't fired McCabe.  WTF  is  this orange fucking coward doing, other than spending our money securing Trump Tower.

            The information in the thread title is incorrect. Read the articles themselves, folks, not just the thread titles. Taylor did not work for Heather Podesta's firm. Taylor works for Amy Swonger. Swonger is who worked for Heather Podesta's firm. Certainly a strike as far as guilt-by-association baseball goes, but it could be that it's a big enough firm that Swonger never actually worked directly for Podesta herself. One associative strike alone isn't enough of a red flag to earn a spot on a suspects list. It may seem like a big world where there are no coincidences or innocents, but you'd be surprised, power is so centralized in the hands of these scheming pedo-elite ghouls that it may be difficult for any person even the most righteous to climb the ladder without an associative strike. Conversely, there may not be enough fellow ghouls number-wise for the uber-ghouls to stock their institutions with nothing but ghouls, they may be forced by demographic reality to hire and team up with unsuspecting and unsuspicious non-ghouls, exploiting them but keeping them out of the sinister loop.

            I worked for a guy that went to prison for creating and distribution of child pornography. Not once did I ever know, nor did ANY of his co-workers. We were all extremely shocked when it came out. He was well liked and respected. Just because you know one, work with one, or even for that matter are related to a molester, does not mean you are in cahoots with them. Sorry, but these people keep their secrets and their codes close to the vest. You guys didn't even know about this whole cabal until Wikileaks, and even then it took months to put any dots together about the words and codes etc. Point is, not EVERYONE who has a connection to the Podestas, Alefantis, etc. are all in their secret club. I would imagine you would have to be really in deep from birth to be in this so called club. Its to sick for anyone else to handle unless they have been groomed to handle it.

             I think u/Quoteunquoteart and u/the_kuru are both right. The title is misleading, after re-reading the Heavy.com post, MKE did not work for Heather Podesta, only someone else who worked for Podesta. But I think she was placed there strategically as a warning from Trump, because of her association.

            Maybe it's a Godfather 2 thing. She has the goods on Podesta and those people so they seat her prominently behind Gorsuch to let people know that they better not stop Gorsuch. Maybe she was the mole who turned over Podesta's emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta knows that not all of his emails have been posted on wikileaks. They hold back the best stuff.

            There was Orrin Hatch today promoting Gorsuch for the same reasons he was leading the promotion of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Hatch is the one who recommended Ginsburg to Clinton. Hatch's big agenda is "religious freedom" for religious minorities and he likes Gorsuch on this matter. Hatch loved Ginsburg because she wanted to legalize polygamy and lower the age of consent to 12 which excited Hatch because he is the product of polygamists who had lots of young wives.

            This is bad news everyone. The Jesuit connection to Georgetown is beyond disturbing. This is where J. Podesta pretend teaches and who is also Jesuit. Along with Comey. If the road leads to Rome and the Vatican this is trouble.

             There are kids who actually do avoid being abused in those situations and are actually ignorant to it until they are either confronted by it or have 20/20 hindsight. I have a friend who went to one of these schools. He knew he had a teacher who "liked" him, but just passed it off as a weirdo at the time. Now he can look back and say the man very well could have been abusing other boys and my friend just managed to escape by not allowing the teacher to get close.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it's important to not be naive and also not to have confirmation bias at the same time. Not always easy to do. Hopefully Gorsuch is one of the good guys.

              Exactly, we can't say every single person in Washington DC is 'in on it'.  There are good and bad people everywhere.  My daughter worked in the admin office in a big church, and although friends with all the staff, she was unaware that the pastor was having an affair with one of the ladies.  She didn't like the closeness of him with this other woman sometimes, but never thought it was actually an affair.  Everyone was saying after it came out, that the staff MUST have known and were helping cover it up.  But when you don't think deviously and are a trusting person, it is hard to judge someone by dishonourable standards.  When people are doing such devious things, even more so when it comes to children, they are going to be careful who they let into their 'inner circle'.  I say we don't jump to conclusions straight away, President Trump has to choose some people and he won't be perfect in every choice, but these people will be exposed too, if indeed they are corrupt.

             Yes I have come to this conclusion myself.  It is just two mafia families battling it out.  One side is pushing for America to collapse and Israel to become the center of the world.  Trump side is pushing to bring back the wealth to America but I dont think they really have any desire to stop the Satanic Cult of child raping.  They just want to give the illusion they are doing something about it.

             I think we're going to have to hope that either Wikileaks or someone else leaks something else that brings it all down. Don't think we're going to see anything done otherwise

             If Trump weren't ROYAL BLOOD, he never would have become POTUS.  Also, you don't get to be a billionaire in Joo York if you're not JEWISH.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump is a Tribe of Dan crypto J.  He has more royal blood than Hitlery, which is why he "won" the (s)election.

               Take well known Twitter activist Cassandra Fairbanks. She was a Bernie supporter from the beginning and used her profile to fight for his nomination. So disgusted was she by the Clinton Democrats and their hypocrisy in killing off Sanders, she turned into a Trump supporter. If an intelligent, well educated activist like Cassandra Fairbanks can turn against the Democrats, they have problems far larger than Russia.

            I do not like Gorsuch either. He had good things to say about Scalia.  We know what happened to him and why. We should probably research him to make see if he will be voting in favor of laws to favor pedos.  At this point, I am sorry, I do not trust anyone, unless checked out.  That is a sad thing to have to say. Edit: FOUND THIS; In 2015, Gorsuch wrote a dissent to the denial of rehearing en banc when the Tenth Circuit found that a convicted sex offender had to register with Kansas after he moved to the Philippines.[70] The Tenth Circuit was then reversed by a unanimous Supreme Court in Nichols v. United States (2016).[54  This is not good.Neither is This  Georgetown Preparatory School is an American Jesuit college preparatory school for boys grades 9 through 12. It is among the most selective prep schools.[5] The only Jesuit boarding school in the country, it is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington on 90 acres (360,000 m2) in the suburban community of North Bethesda in Montgomery County, Maryland, outside of the District of Columbia..   Georgetown is a Jesuit School  and he went there during very tender age of 9 to 12.  Ripe for Abuse.

             If he were Illuminati the Dems would not be pushing so hard to keep him out?   Also, do you think Trump is ignorant of who his enemies are?  Do you think that we can get the guy better than the President and his team.

              Many on here have agreed that he probably was a pedo, but there is no real proof.   Connecting the dots is about all we can do.  But those dots are pretty large and obvious.  I do not have an exact link for that.

               I feel like I've also seen it here before. Would really appreciate anyone who could give me a refresher. Wouldn't be surprised though -- sometimes I think that D.C. might just be solid pedophiles.

             Sorry Carmencita but if you read the Wikipedia more CAREFULLY you will see that the school is for GRADES 9-12 not AGES 9-12. It's a prep school (high school) not elementary or middle school.
About that case; did you read the opinion Gorsuch had written, or the majority opinion? Have any grasp of the issues (hint: the issues may or may not have been whether the defendant was a bad dude). Curious to know more, not so curious to jump to conclusions...

              So sorry, I should have read closer.  But the situation is still questionable since the age range of grades 9 thru 12 are still of great temptation for priests as we so well know.  We will have to agree to disagree on the SORNA case.  I do not agree with the outcome. He should have been required to notify his move to Manila being he was a sex offender.  I have no sympathy for them. None.

              There was a Podesta email that featured the word "wetworks" which involves killing.  He was found at the Cibolo Ranch in his bed with a pillow over his head.  No autopsy was given which was very strange for a Supreme Court Judge.  He belonged to the International Order of Hubertus.  They did a lot of hunting at this ranch and the Order was a type of hunting club .  There have been many views on here and most agree there was something very strange about his death.

               The pillow was above his head on the bed, not over his face.  There was no sign of distress or foul play.  His doctor and his family knew he was in poor health which is why they didn't want an autopsy.

              <p>
               His health was so poor his doctor would not let him have shoulder surgery that he needed because he might not have survived the procedure.

                 Catholics do cremate.  It's been permitted for decades.  There are guidelines how to treat the ashes that are supposed to be followed.

                Well, that is a really good explanation, but in my mind, I cannot believe it.  It is the explanation that those that are in the MSM might report.  There have been many that have researched this over and over and there are other findings.  We will have to agree to disagree.

                 That says a lot about you.   You willingly swallow the conspiratorial explanation based on the thinnest tissues of evidence.  But you reject a good explanation because it might be what the MSM reports.

                 Think about that.  That is not skepticism.
