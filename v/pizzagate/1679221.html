<p>Probably why the deal broke down is Pinchuk\'s company was in terrible shape after it had been bailed out in 2013.  He owed a lot of money and the IMF was supposed to come after him for not paying up.  Pinchuk and Kolomoisky being the sleazy bastards they are handled it the only way they know how: money laundering and blackmail.

I have also written about how Pinchuk runs a series of neonatal hospitals which can be used to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1574610">save IVF babies who are trafficked to anyone willing to pay</a> as well as <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1590102">harvest them.</a></p>

            Were planning or are planning?  Ps great great work and write up. George Webb is an interesting hero. Someday I hope we learn who he really is,  why he is doing this,  and why "they" are allowing him to do it.

             Probably were planning.  I don't think that Pinchuk and Kolomoisky are going to be working together again after this.  But I'm sure someone else will try to break sanctions and build the Iran pipeline at some point.  The incentives are just too great not to.

             Unfortunately, Donald Trump did take
             <a href="http://archive.is/uSkwW">
              money
             </a>
             from Pinchuk.  The Trump Foundation took in 150,000 dollars from him and he paid Trump to do some interview with Doug Shoen.  I hate that he did it.  Probably Pinchuk trying to bribe Trump into not blowing the whistle on his illegal activity.  Hopefully it didn't work.  Still nowhere near as bad as Hillary Clinton taking in over 10 million from Pinchuk though.

             Kolomoisky is Hunter's boss at Burisma Holdings. Pretty freaky. Pinchuk is basically aspiring to be another George Soros.  Kolomoisky is just a violent sociopath though.  He barely even has the pretense of legitimacy.
