Todays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY94prtutXw">video</a> may have finally helped me understand the drama going on between the Ukrainian oligarchs and particularly major Clinton Foundation donor Victor Pinchuk.  I have written about Pinchuk quite a bit so it is very exciting to, I think, finally figure the scheme out.  First of all I would like to give him tons of credit for this because I am totally not smart enough to have put this together without his lead and Eva Bartlett.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/yvGn3">Three Ukrainian oligarchs</a>  have been feuding.  It appears that <a href="http://archive.is/L4C4V">Pinchuk</a> in the steel business has entered a secret deal with <a href="http://archive.is/L0KAS">Igor Kolomoisky</a> (who is partnered with Joe Biden\'s son Hunter Biden) and Gennady Bogolyubov in the oil business.  <a href="http://archive.is/NxXsl">Pinchuk</a> had planned to use this alliance to build pipelines in Iran even though doing so was in breech of U.S. sanctions.  The deal <a href="http://archive.is/L4C4V">broke down</a> with Kolomoisky threatening Pinchuk and sending goons to attack people who would act against him.  They eventually ended up settling out of court, considering none of them probably wanted a court knowing what they were actually doing.</p>
<p>Probably why the deal broke down is Pinchuk\'s company was in terrible shape after it had been bailed out in 2013.  He owed a lot of money and the IMF was supposed to come after him for not paying up.  Pinchuk and Kolomoisky being the sleazy bastards they are handled it the only way they know how: money laundering and blackmail. Instead of making the oligarchs pay their creditors the IMF helps them money launder $1.8 Billion in IMF funds to Kolomoisky and Pinchuk\'s <a href="http://archive.is/MuiNc">personal banks.</a>  Interestingly, IMF official Jerome Vacher partied with Pinchuk at the Ukrainian oligarchs private yacht. Yachts have been found to be good ways to engage in prostitution and rape (including pedophilia) without having the cops barge in or the victim escape. It sounds like a <a href="http://archive.is/WkSGF">honeypot operation</a>.</p>
<p>Pinchuk engaging in these tactics seems less surprising when you take into account that <a href="http://archive.is/nU06n">his ANTIAIDS group held a festival</a> <a href="http://archive.is/isvUK">at the camp Artek </a> which is now notorious as a child rape camp which <a href="http://archive.is/Cwhf5">had to ties to several Ukrainian politicians including officials connected to Pinchuk\'s political ally Yulia Tymoshenko.</a>  Mr. Pinchuk also paid more than 6.6 million for his 50th birthday which was held at a French Ski resort which had previously been raided by police for holding <a href="http://archive.is/KsEGi">a prostitution ring</a>  The party, of course, included a circus and Mr. Pinchuk wanted 150 children to be there.  I have also written about how Pinchuk runs a series of neonatal hospitals which can be used to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1574610">save IVF babies who are trafficked to anyone willing to pay</a> as well as <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1590102">harvest them.</a></p>
<p>Kolomoisky is a sort of bloodthirsty mafia figure who <a href="http://archive.is/vvt3T">owns his own personal army.</a>  Just like the White Helmets they weren\'t going to be satisfied with just getting oil.  You can bet that Kolomoisky would order his forces to kill some Persians, harvest their organs (in the ME smoking and drinking are rarer so the organs are better) and sell their children into sexual slavery.</p>',

            Were planning or are planning?  Ps great great work and write up. George Webb is an interesting hero. Someday I hope we learn who he really is,  why he is doing this,  and why "they" are allowing him to do it.

             Probably were planning.  I don't think that Pinchuk and Kolomoisky are going to be working together again after this.  But I'm sure someone else will try to break sanctions and build the Iran pipeline at some point.  The incentives are just too great not to.

             Unfortunately, Donald Trump did take
             <a href="http://archive.is/uSkwW">
              money
             </a>
             from Pinchuk.  The Trump Foundation took in 150,000 dollars from him and he paid Trump to do some interview with Doug Shoen.  I hate that he did it.  Probably Pinchuk trying to bribe Trump into not blowing the whistle on his illegal activity.  Hopefully it didn't work.  Still nowhere near as bad as Hillary Clinton taking in over 10 million from Pinchuk though.

             Kolomoisky is Hunter's boss at Burisma Holdings. Pretty freaky. Pinchuk is basically aspiring to be another George Soros.  Kolomoisky is just a violent sociopath though.  He barely even has the pretense of legitimacy.
