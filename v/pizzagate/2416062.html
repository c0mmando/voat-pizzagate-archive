<p>Well it seems that the owner of Dr Pong, Oliver Miller,  has Ivy league connections.  And maybe they go even further:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oliver Miller, 39, founded Dr. Pong in 2002. Miller is originally from San Francisco, but relocated to Berlin when he had the idea for the bar, which stemmed from his master’s thesis developed at Princeton University’s architecture school.</p>
<p>“I developed the conceptualization, programming and design for a recreation center,” Miller said. “The title of that project was ‘Recreating Recreation.’ In it I sought to both contrast and hybridize free time activities, such as sport and partying, and to handle the conventions and dangers of recreational drug consumption in a similar manner as with the generation of endorphins through physical exertion.”</p>

<p>Oliver Miller graduated from the School of Architecture at Princeton.  Dr Pong came about as a result of his masters thesis from the School of Architecture “Recreating Recreation”</p>
<p>But why are the visions of these ivy league created playgrounds ultimately dystopic and all the friends of Alefantis and Miller into such art movements as Brutalism and, so reminiscent of MKUltra programming?</p>
<p>I came across this book which may be quite useful in answering that question:</p>
<p><strong>Covert Network: Progressives, the International Rescue Committee and the CIA by Eric Thomas Chester</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book tells the story of the <strong>International Rescue Committee (IRC)</strong>, the largest nonsectarian refugee relief agency in the world. Founded in the 1930s by socialist militants, the IRC attracted the support of renowned progressives such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Norman Thomas, and Reinhold Niebuhr. But by the 1950s it had been absorbed into the American foreign policy establishment. Throughout the Cold War, the IRC was deeply involved in the volatile confrontations between the two superpowers and participated in an array of sensitive clandestine operations. <strong>The IRC thus evolved from a small organization of committed activists to a global operation functioning as one link in the CIA\'s covert network.</strong>  </p>

            That is certainly an interesting piece of info. NCMEC and Thorn. I am still dumbfounded by the fact that people believe the Republicans are waging a "war against the deep state."

            <strong>
             Trump's dog and pony show contribution to stop child trafficking was to meet with child traffickers in a big glitzy public display.
            </strong>
            If this were Obama the Trump supporters would be calling it evidence of Obama's guilt.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            When Trump passed an executive order to confiscate the assets of human rights abusers Trump supporters went wild expecting an international child trafficking ring, and the ring in D.C, to be exposed and people to be arrested in mass. Of course nothing happened.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            Soros moved some money around and of course that was proof that Soros was going to be arrested. Then there was the famous Q lie that Soros was arrested in the Atlanta airport and taken to Camp David. Soros then showed up at the Davos Summit to heckle Trump.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Then team Q also raided the Obama library and Obama was going down. They were convinced that Obama was under house arrest. When Obama made a show of participating in a jurty duty meeting that was proof that he was secretly being arrested.

            It just never stops with these Trump people.
            <strong>
             ZIONISM IS OUR ENEMY and these people are even ignoring the fact that Trump is the global salesman and leader of the Zionist movement. Some even defend Zionism because if they don't they have to give up their Trumpy Bear.
            </strong>

           <p>
            <strong>
             The Trumpers ignore the fact that Trump's dad was a member of the Chabad mafia and it gets no worse than that. Kushner is a Chabad Kingpin. Chabad is so psychotic evil that even the Jews that understand who Chabad is hate Chabad.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Our government has not announced that there is a pedophile ring entrenched within itself and that it is attempting to destroy it. There is no war on the deep state because Trump is now the cover for it and does the deep state's bidding as King Zionist.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Zionism is not a religion it is a political movement and Trump it its public face and leader. What will it take for the Trump supporters to break out of this illusion and rejoin the truth movement?

              I understand why they cheer for Trump. They believe Trump is "our only hope" and they believe being a Trump cheerleader is helping us. Following Trump is equal to doing nothing while Rome Burns to the damn ground, and Trump supporters are teaching newbies to be delusional which is even worlse.

                I asked OP if the Trump exposure was too much and if it was junking his post and he said no, and that it was time Trump got exposed as doing nothing that will make a difference in our daily lives or futures. The answer to our freedom when it comes to both parties is "neither."

                 OK, that is an acceptable answer. My Hobby for the last 7 years(?) was studying money, currency. Those are two different things. Watch Mike Maloney - Hidden Secrets Of Money 1-7 for a starter course. My point is that while there is no more important thing than protecting the children of the world, the best way to protect them on a macro level is protecting the economy of any given country. We are macro in this group, but we all have to realize that money moves things. I would not criticize Trump right now. Maybe next month if we find the Trump spirit cooking video. Don't think micro.

                  The human being is a very creative critter when it focuses on the correct problems. With both parties being slave to the banker's "money" it makes both parties a non answer for us. At least that is the way I see it. If the minds of Trump supporters were freed to focus on other subjects the solutions they come up with might be closer to something that would make a difference.

                   Alright, let me put it another way so that you can better understand. The entire world is in the biggest financial bubble ever. The border is wide open. Child stealing crazies have infiltrated every aspect of the USA. We have active paid government employees that hate America. One thing at a time. If I were magically President tomorrow, I would not have the money for legal fees or the private security team that kept Trump alive so far. If crooked Hillary had won, we (pizzagaters) would all be visited by bad people and in a black op prison.

                    I respect your opinion, and, I really don't think it would be that way. I think the general plan for humanity is on the same general course regardless of who the president is.

                      Actually its worse than that. I had something happen to me for 7 or 8 years that almost killed me. It was a direct result of my involvement in all this. It was horrible. Worse than I can describe.

                       Sorry to hear that. There is no R or D anymore, but the D's are always the choice of the bad people because of the liberalism. Lincoln was president when the Federal government waged war against half the country. What party was he?

             Thank you for your comment.  It is time for us to start looking at Trump's connections with a more critical eye.  I believe the whole Q thing is to pacify the truth community.

              This is not about politics. This is about the perps. That is old school LEO talk for perpetrators. When you run across a scenario 24/7, you pick a perp. I have been skeptical of Trump from the debate years ago. If he is some kind of double agent, I have not figured out how. I am not a fool unless proven otherwise by empirical evidence.

              Of course it is and it has done a beautiful job of derailing some people that were the best pizzagaters. These two political parties have been pretending to fight each other for decades. Nobody of note went to jail over the Hillary emails. Nobody of note will suffer mass arrests for "muh Russia" and I even see Q people regurgitating some of the Russian BS these days. It is incredibly destructive to our movement.

              The only thing those two groups of criminals fight over is who gets the lion's share of our squandered tax money. Trump is in the process of laying another 2 TRILLION dollars worth of debt on us, our children, their children, etc....and doing exactly jack shit to raise our daily lives in a meaningful way. Los Angeles just made it illegal for homeless people to sleep in their cars. What are these people supposed to do now?

               The real enemies are the crusty old bankers who pull the strings. People spend too much time caring about politicians and they completely forget that the Rothschilds control who becomes President, so bitching about who they chose is just pointless. People need to zoom the lens way back and see that there's a much bigger picture.

               I also see a lot of game theory psychology being used with the Q messages.  That's why everything is a riddle because it's quite clear that researchers are drawn to puzzles.  It's time for people to think about the very real possibility that they are being played and to ask themselves, as you point out, why the major players in all this deep corruption are no closer to jail.

                Its the perfect ruse because it allows participants to use as much confirmation bias as needed to solve the puzzle. The pieces do not have to fit, the pieces only need to be desired. It does not seem to matter to the players that nothing substantial ever comes of it. The thrill is playing the game and believing that it is somehow making a difference in our daily lives.

Its all over the internet right now for anybody that wants to see a real threat. I see it all over the internet on a regular basis because I don't stayed buried in Trumpisms.

                Warning about Trillions in debt coming down on our head. Warning about biometric national IDs. Now the Trump administration is supporting additional gun control measures because of this recent false flag. Youtubers who are on the correct message are getting their Youtube accounts deleted while the Trumpers jam the airwaves with noise. Their youtube accounts are not being deleted because they are carrying the proper government message.

                 Meanwhile the Oxfam scandal created a few scapegoats to  offer as sacrificial lambs for the international development community.  i watched the parliamentary hearing and noted that the outcome was the suggestion of creating a global IT system to track ID workers.  I think we understand on here what these IT systems actually do beneath the surface.. we've had ample posts on THORN for example.  The globalist noose is tightening while we play 5D chess with imaginary friends.

                   33 is the magic Masonic number. Trump is a Freemason so he knows what time it is.

                  So there you have it. A big laugh and public slap in the face from the Freemasons, Jesuits, and affiliated secret societies. What are these pedophiles names? Why is the international rape gang that we pizzagaters have always known about not being talked about by Trump? Where is this war on deep state pedophiles? Who are these fabled "white hats" playing a game of 64 Gorillion D chess on our behalf while they laugh at us and wink at us with their numbers?

                  Business as usual for the deep state and I look forward to the day when the Trump supporters get back into the real fight with the rest of us.

Anyone taking meds for ADHD or meds for Depression and related problems.  Also Veterans with PTSD and the list goes on.  You get my drift.  Also they may open new mental homes for these people like the Privatized Prisons.  There will be too many of them.  We must get them off the streets.  This is a Nightmare Waiting To Happen.

                      We have created and supported systems which have been contorted through corruption and manipulation into spending more time protecting the systems themselves, rather than performing the functions in service to the intended functions of the systems.  The few are benefiting from this while we watch the humans within these self-protected systems behave like a heartless AI programmed to win.
