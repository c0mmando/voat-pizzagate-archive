<p>Since establishing the relationship between artist Jeff Koons, the ICMEC, the Koons Family Institute and HRC ties, it’s time to take a closer look at the rest of the members of the board of directors. 
There are multiple actors, sister organizations, professional relationships that all lead to deeper rabbit holes here, so I suggest you take the time to explore for yourselves. I will do my best to clearly present what I have found.</p>

<h1>The Board of Directors</h1>
<p>The board of directors for the ICMEC is an impressive list of dignitaries, business tycoons, high-powered CEOs and political figures. If we compare the list of board members from the website to the names listed in the annual reports we do find some inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Honorary Board - <a href="https://i.sli.mg/R9QLRM.png">https://i.sli.mg/R9QLRM.png</a></p>
<p>Most strikingly, we find a long list of “Honorary” board members made up of European royalty. We also find several key players, Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer of Belgium and Greek industrialist and billionaire art collector Dakis Joannou. As we will see, these are significant discoveries. Before we discuss these individuals let’s meet a few members of the board.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/VuHwgt.png">https://i.sli.mg/VuHwgt.png</a></p>
<p><strong>Franz Humer</strong> - Chairman of the Board</p>

<p>Note: Just what sort of Strategic Business Advisor Gutkin is, is unclear.

I do not partake in Instagram but she appears to have an account. She seems to be some sort of socialite.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mohamed Mattar</strong> = Board Member</p>

<p>DNC – Chair National Advisory Board </p>

<p>Other Boards: Atlantic Council / Council on Foreign Relations</p>
<p>Bagley is a key figure, as she has close ties to the DNC / State Department and the Clinton Library (which received millions in KSA donations). Being a member of both the CFR and the Atlantic Council elevates her to an elite status. </p>
<p><strong>Ernesto Caffo</strong> - Board Member</p>

<p>Joannou is one of the biggest art collectors in the world and owns a significant collection of Jeff Koons pieces. In fact, he was the best man at Koon’s wedding and Koon’s designed/painted his mega-yacht, “Guilty”.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer</strong> – Board Member </p>
<p>Does not appear on website Board of Directors list, but in ICMEC’s 2015 Annual report he is listed as – Chairman Emeritus</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icmec.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/AnnualReport_FinalDraft.pdf">http://www.icmec.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/AnnualReport_FinalDraft.pdf</a></p>
<p>Other Boards: Missing Children Europe - Honorary President </p>
<p>Child Focus (Belgian Center for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children)  Chairman </p>
<p>Child Foundation – Board Member</p>
<p>Banks: Association of Belgian Bankers</p>
<p>So WHY is this important, you ask? </p>
<p>Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer is connected to the Dutroux pedophile ring in Belgium. The Dutroux case implicated some of the most powerful members of Belgian society, almost caused a revolution by outraged citizens  demanding action and of course there was a massive cover up by law enforcement, judges, lawyers and police to protect the elite. Ultimately, only Marc Dutroux went to prison.</p>

<h1>Honorary Board</h1>
<p><strong>Queen Paola of Belgium</strong> – Wife to (former) <strong>King Albert II</strong></p>

<p>Queen Paola provides another connection to Belgium and the <strong>Dutroux Case</strong> as it has been alleged that her husband King Albert II is also implicated in the pedophile ring.</p>

<h2>The Network of Child Organizations</h2>
<p>We find that Baron Daniel Cardon and fellow board member Ernesto Caffo are deeply involved in several child advocacy organizations respectively. Both are on the board of Missing Children Europe (MCE). The MCE connects a network of 30 more child protection groups.</p>

<p>Example partnership</p>
<p>-IAC Instituto de Apoio a Crianca (Portugal)</p>
<p>If you visit the IAC’s home page, it features several children and an adult holding am IPad. However, the background of the far right side of the frame contains possible satanic imagery. It is not difficult to make out several hidden faces in the grass. What is this kind of imagery doing on a child advocacy webpage?  Possible satanic symbolism = Moloch.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is not a completed examination of the ICMEC, there is still a lot of digging to do! From what I’ve seen so far, I’m convinced that the ICMEC plays a crucial role in this investigation and could even turn out to be a central componentI urge you to investigate ICMEC, its board and partnerships. I feel that PG is directly connected to the Dutroux Case via the ICMEC.</p>',

           So WHY is this important, you ask?
          </p>
          <p>
           Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer is connected to the Dutroux pedophile ring in Belgium. The Dutroux case implicated some of the most powerful members of Belgian society, almost caused a revolution by outraged citizens  demanding action and of course there was a massive cover up by law enforcement, judges, lawyers and police to protect the elite. Ultimately, only Marc Dutroux went to prison.

It is not difficult to make out several hidden faces in the grass. What is this kind of imagery doing on a child advocacy webpage?  Possible satanic symbolism = Moloch.

           This is not a completed examination of the ICMEC, there is still a lot of digging to do! From what I’ve seen so far, I’m convinced that the ICMEC plays a crucial role in this investigation and could even turn out to be a central componentI urge you to investigate ICMEC, its board and partnerships. I feel that PG is directly connected to the Dutroux Case via the ICMEC.

            So, Paola's husband King Albert was implicated in Dutroux scandal but he also opened up what appears to have been a brothel in Saudi Arabia.  It was suppose to be two hospitals for military men, but ended up employing 200 nurse/prostitutes for the military men &amp; I presume their friends. This appears to lend credence to Alberts involvement in the Dutroux scandal. Knowing what FBI Anon said earlier about Saudi Royals &amp; Hillary, this may be a good place to start.

             Sorry, the word limit did not allow me to explain further. I will post a follow up to explain why i believe PG and Dutroux are connected.
            </p>
            <p>
             For now though, it's not easy to summarize in a TL;DR but i will try.
            </p>
            <p>
             First of all, we have to question why the ICMEC was created in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
             The official story is that the ICEMEC was created in response to the Dutroux Case and it's mission is to protect children across the globe and eradicate child abuse, exploitation and child pornography.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe that there are signs that the opposite is true. That the ICMEC exists to protect the abusers, to cover for their crimes and to facilitate child exploitation. The ICMEC is a complete inversion.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Dutroux Case, investigations were sabotaged, detectives were pulled from the case, evidence was tampered with and disappeared. From the police officials, to lawyers, to the investigators,  to the judges, at all levels the investigation was thwarted. Why? To protect the elite who were implicated in the pedophile ring. In the end, despite the evidence and witnesses, a single man, Marc Dutroux was convicted.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the ICMEC's goals is to pen, promote and pass on legislation to its affiliates and partner organizations. It also aims to train law enforcement on best practice. In this way, it can control the laws and law enforcement officials.
            </p>
            <p>
             The way the elite were protected in Belgium by the complete subversion of the judicial system is repeated on an international scale (ICMEC), and by some of the very people who were involved in the cover up of Dutroux case.

              I believe that you are right in thinking the ICMEC was created to protect abusers. See my comments in this post where I briefly summarize the connections between the trafficking hotline and the Clinton Foundation:

              </a>
              .  Further, there is the obvious London connection via Cherie Blair.  These articles give much detail on possible paedophile connections,

             Jeff Koons collaborated with Kiehl’s to offer a Limited Edition Creme de Corps Whipped Body Butter.  100% of the net profits from the sale of this product will benefit The Koons Family Institute, an initiative of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC).  Kiehl’s also honored the artist with a special holiday event last week and pledged a $225,000 donation to the Institute.
