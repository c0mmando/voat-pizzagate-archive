<p>The very existence of adrenochrome has been debated.  It is listed in the Addiction Library.

<p>A book called &quot;The Hallucinogens&quot; was published in 1967 by three scientists/doctors, and in this book there is an entire lengthy chapter on adrenochrome and experimentations with it, mostly for the purpose of studying schizophrenia.  Unfortunately, this is the only extensive study out there at this time, and the reason why is that you cannot use live humans for experimentation in a laboratory.  This 1967 study proved some very important points, and there was really no other way to move forward.  I provide you with excerpts from this lengthy chapter.</p>

Oxygen is essential for the conversion of adrenaline to adrenochrome.  Too much oxygen would accelerate the rate of conversion, increase its production and overwhel the ability of the body to detoxify.  It is remarkable how the facts agree with the hypothesis that it is the conversion of adrenaline into adrenochrome that is one of the main factors.</p>
<p>Under the impact of oxygen toxicity, adrenaline is lost and adrenochrome concentrations increase in the brain.  They used rabbits to demonstrate this.  The rabbits went through 3 phases:
a - stimulation and motor restlessness for 10-13 minutes after the beginning of the experiment.  Brain and medulla adrenochrome increased 15-34%.
b - a period of convulsions 20-25 minutes after the beginning phase.  Adrenochrome levels increased slightly.
c - a terminal period characterized by coma, disturbed respiration, and terminal convulsions.  Brain adrenochrome increased 33% and medulla adrenochrome was still elevated.  High oxyegen then caused a massive discharge of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla until at death, it was depleted.  Adrenochrome levelas were elevated.</p>
<p>Page 324
Adrenaline (a/k/a epinephrine, norepinephrine, noradrenaline) is readily taken up by many tissues in the body.  When it is injected intravenously, it rapidly leaves the body fluids.  When added to whole blood in vitro (a test tube), it is quickly taken up by the red blood cells where it may remain active for as long as 10 hours.  Wahen the red cells are lysed (destroyed), about 80% of the adrenaline is recovered. </p>
<p>Paage 340
There is final proof lacking, but it may be seen that if adrenochrome was really present in tissue or body fluids, its presence would already have been demonstrated.  The fact that this has not yet proved, has been used to some to deny all the evidence presented so far.  There are several valid explanations for the lack of proof:</p>
<p>Relatively few investigations have searched body tissues and fluids diligently, and few attempts have been made to corroborate those investigators who claim to have found adrenochrome.  Each report seems to remain untested by other investigation.</p>

<p>An experiment in 1991 with soft-shelled turtles demonstrated that when they were exposed to stress, it caused depletion of pineal serottonin contents followed by elevation of norepinephrine and epinephrine levels.</p>

<p>In 2000, in the book &quot;DMT: The Spirit Molecule - A Doctor\'s Revolutionary Research Into the Biology,&quot; there is a passage that states as follows:</p>
<p>It was discovered that adrenaline is released directly into the pineal gland by nerve cells that almost touch it.  Nor-adrenaline and adrenaline are the 2 neurotransmitters that turn on melatonin synthesis in the gland (the pineal gland produces melatonin).  The adrenal glands aalso make adrenaline and nor adrenaline, releasing them into the bloodstream in response to stress.  However, only adrenaline and noradrenaline released by nearby pineal nerve endings, not by the adrenals, have any effect on pineal function.</p>
<p>The excerpt from the book furger states that it is not what you would expect.  Since the pineal gland does not originate from brain tissue, it exists outside the blood-brain barrier and ought to be responsive to blood-born chemicals and drugs.  Nevertheless, the body protects the pineal gland with a fierce tenacity.  The stress-related surges of adrenal gland adrenaline and noradrenaline secreted into the blood, never get to the pineal.  The pineal security system, made up of &quot;vacuuming&quot; nerve cells, simply cleans-up the blood-borne adrenaline and noradrenaline in an incredible efficient manner.</p>

<p>Finally, there are minimally-invasive ways of accessing the pineal gland, incorporated by neurosurgeons primarily for removal of pineal gland tumors.  The approach is posterior, in the back of the head.</p>

<p>I am wrapping this up.  This is all I have to offer.  We have seen the Spirit Cooking, the dentist chairs, the graphic bloody art depicting children.  Has anybody been locked-up?  Has there been any proof of child sacrifice or scaring kids to death or giving them toxic amounts of oxygen from a dentist chair?  No, not yet, but that doesn\'t mean it hasn\'t happened or isn\'t happening.  We all know how sick and evil these people are.</p>',

            The pineal gland is known as the seat of the soul. Anyone who has taken dmt will know what I mean. Do these evil people actually believe they are invading the victims soul? This is powerful stuff thank you for the info. I have the book The Spirit Molecule I will study it again. I believe these people know about this stuff. They are accessing the sacred and taking it for power and evil and ego. Their own souls have been taken by darkness.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pineal gland is the most protected organ in the human body yet scientists still do not know its full purpose. Apparently.

            The kidnapped children were picked up by men in dark suits.  The children ended up in a warehouse where there was a room outfitted with stalls, and there was a drill in the room.  Rituals were done in the warehouse too.

            Something which people have consistently overlooked here, is indeed the relationship between adrenochrome(+ derivatives), endorphins, elevated levels of

            </em>
            heavy-metals &amp; oxidative compounds/enzymes, DMT and pineal gland function.

           <h1>
           </h1>
           <p>
            It was never solely about adrenochrome, despite that for some reason, it is the only compound being focused on.

           <p>
            As an aside, per what I have tried to allude to without explicitly saying it:
           </p>
           <p>
            Humans can indeed take control of the relevant factors/compounds/elements within their own body. Stimulating autonomous functions can produce and influx of adrenochrome along with DMT; one does NOT need external sources of adrenochrome/DMT('harvested' from other humans/plants or otherwise) in order to achieve the effects being sought by those who commit atrocities explored in pizzagate.

Put 2 and 2 together with a knowledge of other biological processes and you can induce the sought-after effects.

             Tobacco contains MAOIs? Does it remain intact after heating? MAOI Anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medicine are some of the most frequently prescribed.

               Nicotine is the major neuroactive compound of tobacco, which has, by itself, weak reinforcing properties. It is known that levels of the enzymes monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and MAO-B are reduced in the platelets and brains of smokers and that substances, other than nicotine, present in tobacco smoke have MAO-inhibitory activities. Here, we report that inhibition of MAO dramatically and specifically increases the motivation to self-administer nicotine in rats. These effects were more prominent in rats selected for high responsiveness to novelty than in rats with low responsiveness to novelty. The results suggest that the inhibition of MAO activity by compounds present in tobacco smoke may combine with nicotine to produce the intense reinforcing properties of cigarette smoking that lead to addiction.

               THIS totally this. Ive been thinking something like this for years, i noticed that when i switched to tobacco from the tobacconist (sort of organic tobacco) i smoked Alot less, and didnt crave a cig in the morning straight away unlike cigarettes or store bought rolling, i had way fewer cravings, similar to how people smoke less when vaping and find it easier to cut down. Now that i vape its even better, but it seems to be the case for a lot of other people who are surprised at how little they vape compared to cigs. My hypothesis was they had extra nicotine they put in from the pesticide phase with neo-nicotinide. Centuries ago it was know that the nicotine plant was special why? because no bugs would go near it was a natural pesticide. I did a little digging years ago and there where reports of tobacco plant crops being regularly sprayed. So i just assumed that because tobacco plants didnt need any pesticide then Neo nicotinides seemed to be a good bet as to why this was, but MAOI seems to fit the symptoms alot better which could just reinforce my hypothesis (i dont know enough about chemistry though) but I find it interesting that MAOA's are used in pesticides too.

               <p>
                It's the extra chemicals/compounds added to the end product. Basically, cigarettes trick the body into feeling more nourished, than say, raw/'organic' tobacco("chop chop").

                 Centuries ago it was know that the nicotine plant was special why? because no bugs would go near it was a natural pesticide.

                It was mostly used(in 'ancient'/pre-historic times) in a 'religious' setting, ie, it was treated as as a 'sacred' plant due to its psychoactive properties(MAOIs and the effects thereof) and used in conjunction with psychedelics(DMT extracts).

               <p>
                Ditto again. It's fascinating, really, learning about this kind of stuff, even if the best resources available are the internet and self-exploration.

                 Next question. If MAOI encourages self-medication as seen in those rats, regarding the weak reinforcer, nicotine, then what other weak reinforcers could MAOIs boost?

               <p>
                Not sure I understand the question...
               </p>
               <p>
                The inhibition of MAOs(via nicotine and other harmala alkaloids) results in higher concentrations of some neurotransmitters(tryptamines), resulting in a desirable effect on the CNS(Central Nervous System), resulting in re-dosing.

                Can have positive and negative effects, positive being the opportunity to relax, negative being addiction leading to undesirable results such as agitation in the absence of the addictive substances(eg: nicotine addiction).

                Monopolization of MAOI-containing-products is also considerable here.

               <p>
                In a case of addiction, very much so, but, dietary considerations can help to correct this. For example, one could make a strong habit of consuming foods containing L-tyrptophan(such as eggs, for example) in order to provide the building blocks for more serotonin.

                 This could explain certain newer "cultural" phenomenon. What if you become addicted to something inane. Can you get addicted to certain thought cycles?

               <p>
                So, what an MAOI does, is to lessen or outright prevent the breakdown of tryptamine neurostransmitters, this can have a variety of effects on thought processes, most notably an 'anti-depressant' effect. This doesn't necessarily reinforce certain thoughts by itself, but, it can have an affect on your sensitivity to external factors which might be depressing.
               </p>
               <p>
                In effect, this could be good or bad depending on one's personal circumstances, ie, the anti-depressant effect may help you to cope with some things but t may also prompt ignorance of problems that need addressing.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's a double-edged sword, for one of a way to put it. It's important to understand the effects these substances have on you, so that you aren't just using them as an escape, so to speak.
               </p>
               <p>
                To answer more directly, yes, you could become addicted to certain thought processes, but, this is again, a situation where "mind over matter" comes into play. Knowledge is the key here, rather than just taking something because it makes you 'feel good'.

               Nicotine is the major neuroactive compound of tobacco, which has, by itself, weak reinforcing properties. It is known that levels of the enzymes monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and MAO-B are reduced in the platelets and brains of smokers and that substances, other than nicotine, present in tobacco smoke have MAO-inhibitory activities. Here, we report that inhibition of MAO dramatically and specifically increases the motivation to self-administer nicotine in rats. These effects were more prominent in rats selected for high responsiveness to novelty than in rats with low responsiveness to novelty. The results suggest that the inhibition of MAO activity by compounds present in tobacco smoke may combine with nicotine to produce the intense reinforcing properties of cigarette smoking that lead to addiction.

            The question is whether adrenochrome can be extracted from the body.  Here is the clearest explanation I've found regarding the feasibility of that:
           </p>
           <p>
            (PDF file)
            <a href="http://www.geocities.ws/TheB3Situation/Adrenochrome.pdf">
             http://www.geocities.ws/TheB3Situation/Adrenochrome.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Is Adrenochrome Made in the Body?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            As soon as scientists discovered adrenalin turned pink in solution it appeared likely what happened so readily in vitro could also occur in the body. Adrenalin is a member of a class of catecholamines which polymerize very readily. The melanins are these polymerized, oxidized and indolized catecholamines.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the conditions required for the oxidation of adrenalin to adrenochrome in vivo are present. These are: (1) the substrate - noradrenalin, adrenalin; (2) the enzymes and metallic oxidizers which convert adrenalin to adrenochrome, or accelerate its auto-oxidation. Auto-oxidation does not require an enzyme. The oxidation of adrenalin to adrenochrome in water is an example. It requires oxygen and is accelerated by traces of metal such as copper ions.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have discussed the theoretical argument for the formation of adrenochrome in several previous reports (Hoffer, 1981, 1983, 1985; Hoffer and Osmond, 1967).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Ideally, final proof would have been gained when adrenochrome crystals extracted from the body are in one's hand. But because adrenochrome in solution is so reactive it is highly unlikely it can be extracted. It will have to be stabilized first by combining it with another molecule. Adrenochrome semicarbazide is a stable derivative. Perhaps this could be made in blood or other fluids and then extracted. However, any stable derivative will do. Nature has already made a number of stable derivatives of the catecholamines.
            </strong>
            ”
           </p>
           <p>
            “…melanins derived from adrenochrome have been extracted from blood plasma… (Hegedus and Altschule, 1968,1970,1970a; Hegedus, Kuttab, Altschule and Nayak, 1981).
           </p>
           <p>
            Adrenolutin is another derivative of adrenochrome and more stable in blood.”
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            That paper was written in 1990.  Who knows whether the stabilization of adrenochrome in the body followed by harvesting has been perfected over the last almost 30 years?  It would apparently not be impossible or even especially difficult, at least in theory.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Interesting study from 1955 that talks about pH levels affecting adrenochrome creation:
            <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/220/1/237.full.pdf">
             http://www.jbc.org/content/220/1/237.full.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Body pH levels are affected by stress/fear:
            <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/panic-attacks-as-ph-problem/">
             https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/panic-attacks-as-ph-problem/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            “The amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep in the brain, has a critical role in the circuits that control the experience of fear, both instinctive fear (like being afraid of snakes or large carnivores) and fear that is learned from life experiences. The Iowa study shows that a very basic metabolic factor, pH -- acidity -- also has an essential role in fear.”

             .  I perused all past adrenochrome-related pizzagate submissions and read this.  We can only glean so much from scientific research when real humans (and pertaining to aderenochrome, child humans) are needed as specimens. I also tend to believe that it has been perfected under nefarious, sick methods.  Right now, I just want to stop thinking about it and this entire day 
researching and reading about this.  My glass of Sauvignon Blanc is helping.
