            In the docu-series there is another man who was in Maskell's office that participated in the abuse and traumatization of the students called Brother Bob. In this interview above there are two men named Bob; Bob Wood and Bob Squire, both are dead now. They were both heavily involved in politics and both had close ties to the presidents/candidates of their time. Tony Podesta had contact with both of them.

            </p>

             TP: Yes, he was, and Ithiel de Sola Pool [Chair of the Department], the whole collection of very distinguished faculty members, interesting group of people..."

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             TP:  "...I got a call from Bob Squier I remember, saying, Bob called and we had this conver-, he probably had the same conversation that I had with Senator Muskie, you know, was it a good thing or a bad thing, was it a terrible thing and so forth and so on. And Bob said, “Oh no, it's a great thing. It humanizes him; it's fabulous.”

            I did find a man, who is alive right now, named Bob Shrum who is Catholic and was adviser to John F. Kennedy and also a Democrat. He is mentioned a couple of times in the Wikileaks e-mails addressed and CC'd to John Podesta:

            Here are some religious themed articles he has written:

           </p>
           <p>
            In a book written by Sydney Blumenthal, 'The Clinton Wars', I found an acknowledgment of John and Tony Podesta and also Bob Shrum:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "I thank especially John Podesta for his encouragement throughout."
            </p>
            <p>
             "I appreciate the stalwart support I recieved during these recent years from many people, including James Carville, John Emerson, Mark Penn, Tony Podesta, Bob Shrum..."

            Tony Podesta, who ran the scheduling advance operation for presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy, had conversations with two men named Bob; Bob Wood and Bob Squier.

            I have some new details that place Senator and presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy in the D.C. area at the time of Cathy's murder. John and Tony Podesta were volunteers for his campaign which would have placed them in the D.C. area also. I learned from a political expose'/documentary show 'Scandal' that the candidate volunteers following them everywhere they go and help with various activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Per Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "In 1971, he [John Podesta] graduated from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he had served as a volunteer for the presidential candidacy of Eugene McCarthy."
            </p>
            <p>
             "While studying at MIT in 1968, [Tony] Podesta left to work on the presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy, for whom he did field work and ran the scheduling advance operation in California and other states."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Here is the timeline I have been able to put together so far:
           </p>
           <p>
            Just to note it is only a 30-40 minute drive from D.C. to Baltimore:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              November 2nd 1969 Senator McCarthy giving a press conference in Washington D.C. (Newspaper clipping included)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              November 7th 1969 Sister Cathy 'disappears'.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              November 13th 1969 Massive anti-war protest in Washington DC, Senator McCarthy's whole campaign effort was anti-war so he would probably have been in the area during this protest, which would have put the Podestas in the area also. (Photo included)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              November 21st 1969 Senator McCarthy types up a letter to a banker addressed from the Senate in Washington D.C.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            So it appears Eugene was in D.C. for almost the entire month of November which would have placed the Podestas in D.C. also. I will try to find more documents and articles that might narrow this timeline down even more. I suppose they could have traveled to other locations during this time but I will look more into this.

            During the time of this murder he was campaigning for Eugene Mccarthys candidacy, don't people fly around to other states, especially the DC area to promote and fund raise for their candidate? Just a thought. More research is needed.

             Try out the free Netflix one month subscription to watch. Just remember George Soros bought a controlling share of the company. They also recently put out a documentary about child sex for sale on Backpage and the former girls now suing the company. I saw The Keepers documentary, there are about 7 or 8 parts an hour or so long. It's is very slow and drags on at times but it is more insightful focusing on the sexual abuse rather than the actual who murdered the nun. My end conslusion is basically that the priest who was molesting students ordered the killing be done to silence the nun from her knowledge. The actual who is 3 suspects 2 of whom were outed by their families and the other 1 is the priest/pastor church friend of the nuns who wanted to marry her and leave the church. He is extremely normal and believable, however, he lied to his whereabouts and it makes no sense. The sexual abuse aspect of the documentary has one main victim, an outspoken braves woman who talks about all the sick shit this Father Maskell piece of shit pedofile did and I believe she has Disossiative Identity Disorder as many of the memories are hidden deep within her and she doesn't remember them all right away. The part I strongly objected to was the part where they talk about False Memory Syndrome which is garbage as this was made up by high powered doctors covering up Satanic Ritual Abuse when all these victims started coming forward and psychwards were filled with these people claiming these things happening and the abusers and the MK Ultra programs didn't want this coming out into the public. My main question is why George Soros would want this documentary out there for people to see given the fact that all Netflix is is garbage programming movies about zombies, cannibals, time travel, science fiction and extreme horror films. It's just trash and the fact that u can rate movies one to five stars means they obviously can get a profile on u. Yes, I do think u should watch this as it is informative as everyone from the cops, doctors to priests etc are abusing girls but it gives u an understanding of the power of the Catholic Church and how brainwashed people can be and how truly sad it is for the victims and their family's. 
EDIT: the only way to truly know whether Skippy was john podesta is to show the main victim in the series the photos of JP when he was young at that timeframe to spark her repressed hidden memories as she states over and over she can't see his face. This could be done under hypnosis or something similar. I'm not convinced it's him but who really knows.

              Thank you! Of course George Soros has a share in Netflix. Anything that gives him control over what people hear or see. That is curious that he would be ok having The Finders on here. But, thank you for explaining all of that.

               Do you REALLY believe that the investor who owns controlling stock in a company -- in his case, ONE company out of a HUGE portfolio -- will MICROMANAGE it down to the level of determining which programs it will air on a case-by-case basis?!!

              Thank you for helping me to connect those dots about Soros and Netflix.  It occurred to me at the beginning why are there so many segments to the series, why is it so slow moving (although I like that so I can take it all in).  I never thought about putting all those things together, but now that you mention it, they are devious as we all know.  This program is just tailor made for our researchers, right, the sex abuse, the priests, the LE and lo and behold, the extra added attraction of someone named SKIPPY (out of all the names it would have to be that one?).  Idk, but I do admit I tend to over analyze, but would this not be a perfect distraction to take our eyes off of the prize. The Seth Rich Investigation.  Remember Soros has not 10 or 20%, but he has Controlling Share in the company.   We need to keep this in mind, imo. I have taken interest in this documentary serious, because of personal reasons, that being I attended Catholic School for 12 yrs. but my first commitment is to help solve the Seth Rich Investigation.   Just a few thoughts.

               Yes and they definitely threw in the whole "False Memory Syndrome" thing which to me is a lie as I've researched this in depth and it came forth when many victims were coming forward with Satanic Ritual Abuse in the US and they didn't want it in the mainstream so they said these people were making it up.  No so. This documentary really played into that. I can't watch anything on Netflix without consciously believing it is mind control propaganda because of Soros. It's absolutely HORRENDUS the kind of movies on there geared towards teenagers. Yes I thought The Keepers was also tailor made for this time with pizzagate and Podesta a lot of red flags but likely to take us off the path into other rabbit holes. Most of the perps are deceased now. With Seth Rich, I called out a mainstream media news reporter on a certain social media platform about whether or not she was told not to speak about Seth Rich and if not would she look into it and do a story, I repeated it over and over she kept ignoring me but I know she saw it and she blocked me from making the comment!!! The Ariana Grande concert bombing was a huge distraction on Seth Rich, yes it happened but it was orchestrated for that timing as a distraction. They know we know and soon everyone will.

             It's like the docu-series 'Stranger Things'. A long informational movie split up into 7 episodes. It is a bit slow but it's worth the watch. Yikes maybe there was some abuse there..good to hear you didn't fall prey to them..

             I heard it is very good (read that on here). But it moves slow they said.  I like that because you won't miss anything.  I don't have Netflix right now and it is killing me.  Would really love to see this.  I went to Catholic School 12 years.  This could have happened to me in grade school.  We had a sleazy priest.  Nuns for high school and they were great!

              I would rather it be slow too so I can absorb it all. Was your priest a pervert? The nuns were the reachers? How does that work? Is it boys and girls both or what?

               High school was all girls and about 90% were just great.  I loved the school.  Grammar school we had a Pastor that would invite us all in after lunch.  He had a really nice fixed up brick rectory with wall to wall stereo systems fire place and he would let us play games and then bounce us on his lap, We really were babes in the woods.  When he invited us in after school we would sometimes go in his bedroom and change clothes.  How naive we were.  Now I wonder if he had some kind of camera or electric eye in the wall.   Brrrrrr.

                Yeah looking back I can see how you might wonder that! Well you seem really sweet so Catholic school must have been good for you 🙂 This is just my opinion, but from what I read, it seems like boys are the ones most of the priests go for. Thank God you didn't go thru all that.

            There was another post on here and it included a picture of him I believe with a mustache as well.  Also he wanted to become a Jesuit and I believe he did this at Georgetown U  which is run by Jesuits.  Baltimore  and Georgetown are only 42.8 mi. apart.  I was amazed they were so close.  Being that LE was also involved with the pedo priest, this sounds like it is right up Podesta's alley.

             One of the readers of my blog actually sent me a link to a photo of him in 1971, with brown hair and a mustache...I have added it to the article..Your research is right on about the Jesuits. They are towards the top of the pyramid on this planet..Thank you for your post..
