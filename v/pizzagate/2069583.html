            They can. 
If you are really a born transgender you usually know it as soon as you start thinking, which is usually at the age 2-3. 
I do not  have a problem with transgender people  (I know a few),  but I have a problem with that organized LGBT-people who are (ab-)using that topic for politics  and for trying to gain more power and importance for themselves. 
(In my opinion, transgenderism  is a kind of a "birth defect" like any other birth defect. It's shit, but you have to live with it. And society should be kind).

            Ok to clarify, I have a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Psychology, as well as a Associates degree in Family therapy. I actually used my own sexual and mental abuse at the hands of my stepfather to basically put people away that were pedophiles and sadistic assholes like he was. This is unequivocally untrue. Yes some children can be born gay but that not at all the norm, and most of the time at the age of 2, if you do believe Jungian psychology, the personality that will stick with a person for most of their life will happen when they are that age. Child development does not end at 2 though because a child's brain, bones, and every bit of their tiny bodies develop for the rest of their lives. We are all still growing in one way or form of another within the human condition. Most of the time what they state as deviant social behaviors, whether that is being a mental disorder, psychopathy, or being within the LGBT spectrum are not established until much later. At 2 years old, a child is still trying to get a full grasp of their native language, social norms and mores within their family structure and develop a personality. I never fully understood this until I was a mother myself. My son is 3 and he's a very caring and sweet natured little person who loves to help me cook but my daughter who is about to turn 2 in October, changes daily. One day she will want to kiss her entire family and little toddler friends then the next second she wants to boss them around in her funny little baby talking.

            Psychology, psychiatry, along with other bullshit pseudoscience subjects like chiropractors, are like the illegitimate, fake news equivalent of CNN, NYT, WSJ, etc. Most of academia is nothing but a joke and a waste of time.

            I am horrified at the psychologist advice.  I worked in a nursery school in the 1980s for many years and only came across one boy age 3 who did all the 'girl' things, iron, clicky shoes, played dress up with the choice of girls clothes and shunned the boys.  His mother told me that she desperately wanted a girl and saw no problem with him behaving like a girl.  To me it was obvious that his mother was the influence in his behaviour.  I have 4 grown children, 3 girls and a 1 boy, I am from the 'old school' where a boy is a boy and a girl is a girl.  I may be fortunate as my son was rarely interested in his sister dolls, even though they used his Action Man as a boyfriend for Barbie, his brain just worked a different way, more action/war-like with his toys.  IF he had shown an interest in girly play, I, as a responsible parent, would have steered him back instead of encouraging it.  Oh and by the way, when his little baby sister came along, he was great and very protective of her, as a grown man he is kind, gentle and masculine, just like he should be.

             Great to hear someone who actually understands that it is NORMAL for boys to be masculine and for girls to be feminine. So tired of all these Millennials who want to believe that its totally okay for there to be this blurred line with genders. I'm sorry but genders are something given to us by our Creator and to deny that is like spitting in his face.

             And yes I am aware that an EXTREMELY TINY NUMBER of people are legitimately born with their brains and bodies all twisted up, and they don't know what's what, and they get confused and feel like a person trapped in the wrong body. That's about %0.001 of the "transgender" population. All the rest of them are attention whores and mental cases.

              So if  you concede that there are legitimate transgender individuals who simply want to live what they feel is an authentic life and don't want to bother anybody and have no tendencies toward pedophilia, etc. how do you propose to keep those people safe from the witchhunt that could very well be unleashed by people who are investingating Pizza gate and who hold ultra bionary conservative anti-transgender views?

               Our job is pedo hunting. I don't really care about the fates of trans people, sorry. They made their decision and have to live with the way that society views them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Should someone assume that all LGBT people are pedos? No. 
Was the LGBT political movement started by Harry Hay, who was an open NAMBLA supporter? Yes.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am fine with people who are gay, or trannies, or whatever. Its the LGBT political movement that has direct ties to pedo scum.

               I'm from 4chan /pol/ buddy, so you're barking up the wrong tree here. I'm not saying that trannies should be immediately associated with pedophiles, but trannies are still whacked out in the head overall. I wouldn't let a drag queen near my kid just like I wouldn't let a creepy homeless guy near my kid; they're just fucking weird.

                Well a lot of things in nature are "weird." Doesn't mean they are threatening. Just different. Transgender ppl eat breathe work shop sleep bleed and shit just like EVERYONE else. Perhaps you could challenge yourself to watch a documentary or get to know one so it's not so foreign to you? Is that a fair challenge?

                 I have a trans cousin and I've met two or three trans folks through my gay roommate. All of them are fucked in the head, including my cousin. Just because you've got one or two trannies like Blair White who can "keep it together," trust me, they do not represent the majority of average people who become trans. Its almost always a bad decision.

            How many people volunteered over the last century to be homosexuals and to be persecuted for who
they were and having to live "closeted" lives?

            Who would volunteer for such a life?  No one.

            Actually, I recall reading some long time ago that as many as 14% of US births are other than normal.
And there is no reason not to believe that that children can recognize a disconnection between what
they feel themselves to be and what their genitals suggest they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doctors have been forcing gender decisions on parents at birth -- so why wouldn't a 2 year old 
child understand their own sexuality?

            and Westmead Children's hospital gender disphoria unit. Of course didn't you know every 3 year old now in Australia if their OTO occult kiddy fiddling parent wills it can be forced into a life of a receiving mens penises and HIV semen up their butts because the choice to be heterosexual was taken away with their penises.

            You should see how happy all the gay dads are on the forums saying it only costs $170 to get your first appointment at westmead children's government hospital gender disphoria unit to force your child into a life of tranny anal.

             That made me sick because I know the lasting effects of NPD because my mother happens to be an N. Another reason why I went into Psychology for college because I really wanted more to understand why the brain is so amazingly complex but causes us to do all sorts of crazy things.

            nobody's grooming anybody. i do believe that gender identification can come up  when they are quite young. why not? why is that such a big deal - it is not. now, having said that, i do not, nor have i ever, feel children should be abused by grownups for sex!! that is utterly ridiculous &amp; horrible and it needs to be stopped. but from what little i have read, it's the children themselves that are bringing up the idea of gender identity, the parents are actually surprised and shocked that the kids come up with this. this is a soul issue and kids are evolving and getting smarter, so they probably are just more self aware than they used to be. if it were my kid i would NEVER shame them about their identity. never. i would probably just give them plenty of room and time to just be a kid - whatever that means to them. i would wait a bit to bring up sex education. what i don't understand is the tremendous fury and fear around these issues with people here. we are all just human - if you have intense fear about these issues (NOT pedophilia) then you might want to make an appointment with a quality therapist.

and I think the MODS should be giving that some thought.

            This is another jew that needs a bullet in its psychotic criminal commie pedo skull. Every single one of these inbred pieces of commie maggot shit needs to have its skull bashed in, male, female, young or old. EVERY SINGLE ONE of these pieces of shit needs to be killed, especially the ones hiding behind fake names like "smith", "miller", jones, perry etc. Any kike that spouts about "diversity", "migrants", promoting homosexuality, or all the other sick things that these inbred retards do, needs to have its skull bashed in with a lead pipe. Douse this subhuman shit with gasoline and burn it alive. if there is a problematic jew dog turd on your local city council, bringing "migrants" into your community, you need to hunt that piece of shit down and smash its head open.

             What worth? They aren't worth the paper their "degrees" are printed on. Psychologists are just tools of the elite to push their ideas onto people. Just another branch/arm of the elite pedos.

             Mainly now they are being used to prescribe medication --
            </p>
            <p>
             But, the profession continues to feature "talking therapy" -- the idea of having a friend/supporter.
And it can be valuable when a therapist is seeing over time many clients and has that experience 
of problems and outcomes which the patients divulge to them and the ways that they are sometimes
resolved.
I think the movie "Ordinary People" is an excellent example of that "friend" supporter interaction....
based on the actual experience of the therapist in their discussions and interactions with many patients.
            </p>
            <p>
             but ...NOTE ....
AUTISM and SCHIZOPHRENIA have a good deal in common -- 
in both cases there is obvious damage done to the brain -- genetic damage by unknown cause ...
but possibly by vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
             In both cases the synapses are effected -- either by being under pruned or by being over pruned.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Autism, the synapses are under pruned ...  In Schizophrenia, the synapses are over pruned.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, the race is to create new medicines ... but the reality is that something is causing this genetic damage.  And, while Schizophrenia has been with us longer than vaccines have been, men have always been mining the earth and digging up metals.  The ingredients in vaccines remain under question and should continue to be challenged.
            </p>
            <p>
             Plus, a lot of thought given to other harm done to children possibly by vaccines ... now thought to be Sudden Infant Death, Colic, Projectile Spitting and all the lesser symptoms of AUTISM....such as Attention Deficit and 
hyper activity.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think we are only beginning now to see some of these teenaged victims in society.
These families need help.

              Just to clarify-- in my state, a psychologist cannot prescribe medication.  They are pretty much "talk therapy" with some smart-sounding techniques in their bag.  But the CAN an DO refer their clients to their prescription-pad buddies.   And I am sure there's some kind of kickback.

               Yes, I believe in most states you have to actually be a doctor to do so -- Psychiatrist.

               Psychologists can't prescribe, but psychiatrists can and they are even worse that psychologists. They are nuts themselves, crazier than any of their poor patients.

Recent statistics show that people who are unvaccinated are the most healthy.

               Right -- the government has long fought investigating the unvaccinated versus the vaccinated ...
              </p>
              <p>
               and the Amish are one of the largest unvaccinated populations so the government is always knocking
on their doors pushing the idea of vaccination until they finally intimidate families into vaccinating their kids.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, seemingly those who watch that population see immediately that their healthy, rosy cheeked children 
are quickly turned into sick looking kids with running noses.
              </p>
              <p>
               They'll keep at it until everyone is forced into vaccination and we're all sick.

                I agree. I have two kids and actually do my research about every single vaccine that the doctor wants to do to my kids, and I only get about 1 or 2 in their entire lives. My son did not even so much as get a cold for the first time until he was 14 months old. My daughter is almost 2 and she has not been sick at all. My son is now 3 almost 4, and he has had one cold, two ear infections and a broken collar bone on his birthday this year, and this kid was a preemie mind you. Healthy as an ox both of them. I wasn't ever given vaccines either because of my families religious beliefs, and I get sick with colds or anything like that maybe once ever 7 or 8 years and I'm 36. Now I do have heart problems stemmed from birth and being born at 29 weeks, as well as I have a rare disease that only affects Mediterranean people, but other than that, I'm extremely healthy.

                 Wish every parent (myself included) had the wisdom to do what you have done to protect your children.
And very happy to hear that your children are well as a result.
And, of course, this isn't only damage to them physically, but physical damage to the brain.
The lesser cases of course began to rise with hyperactivity and attention deficit which was a warning
that vaccines needed investigation, especially as children were getting shots of so many more vaccines 
and so much more frequently.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Congress is protecting these drug companies because they also work on vaccines for military and
provide antidotes for various poisons like Anthrax.  In other words, "National Security."
Of course, their vaccines have also made many of our soldiers very ill.
Best wishes to you all -- and may you all remain healthy.  :)

                 Sadly, my daughter has watched this harm being done within her husband's family
as his brother has three beautiful children who seem effected by the vaccines.
Doesn't seem to be full blown Autism, fortunately, but various learning problems, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These learning disorders began to be seen in the 70's and that was the time when all of 
this should have been stopped.

                Vaccines are a cash cow for pharma with the benefit for government being that a sick population is docile and easier to control.

            I remember decades ago when I was in college and debating whether to major in English or psychology, a beloved English professor told me,  "Psychology is a pseudo-science.  If you want to know anything about human nature, just study great literature."   Never have I forgotten his words, they have become ever more true with the passage of time.   In short:  Fuck. That. Psychologist.

             The very basis of Freud's "talking cure" has been based in dishonesty and lies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Originally, Freud used hypnosis on his patients/clients .... but many of the those he was training 
in psychiatry were NOT able to actually hypnotize patients ....
            </p>
            <p>
             So Freud removed the feature of psychiatry.
            </p>
            <p>
             Betty Friedan was brilliant, but fortunately she did pursue a career in psychiatry, but she did succeed in untying women from Freud and his teachings and dumping him in the garbage can.
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider the Oedipus Complex wherein Freud made the outrageous suggestion that it is infants, toddlers and young children who are the sexual aggressors against males in their families -- fathers, grandfathers, uncles,
male cousins and male friends of the family.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was, of course, total betrayal by Freud of his young patients who had confided in him their sexual abuse by male members of their families....and male friends of their families.
            </p>
            <p>
             And today it is thought that Freud, himself, may have been a pedophile.

               This may not be pg related, but I watched this movie ages ago and the scene where 'Nicholai' is in the Board Room is the only way I can reason how the public and MSM are duped into saying/behaving/being brainwashed like they they are into believing that all this pg is not happening. Its an interesting movie, and I loved Family Ties when my children were growing up. Kirk Cameron (TV Sitcom: Family Ties) Left Behind Movie -

                I remember that movie did not get very good reviews, but I never watched it.  Perhaps I will in view of the new eyes I have acquired the past year or so.

                  Some of my favorite movies are the low budget ones, especially if they are cheesy.  The low budget movies tend to focus more on the story than special affects.  I saw Prometheus, and hated it.  It could have been great, but the story sucked and was predictable.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I watched for about 1 minute as a psychologist was allowed into a school to manipulate the children into an outcome that he wanted.  Social engineering in the UK is now in overdrive.

              I watched that BBC 2 Documentary today, what put you off was probably almost the first sentence, 'all going to have to use the same toilets'.  There was not another mention about this after and since generally in primary schools, as far as I remember, the boys don't have urinals but toilet cubicles the same as the girls, I ignored that comment.  So far, it was a good episode, not pushing sex stuff at all.  It was focusing on stereotyping thinking girls weaker than boys etc., and self esteem. I have no clue why the school was not teaching 'all to have a go' my childrens primary school did.  When I worked there in 1998+ we had the girls and boys participate in every subject in school, including cooking, football, sewing, dance/music, etc., They did not encourage boys to be girls and visa versa but let them all have a go at everything.  -  Now having said that, I have a feeling as the Documentary goes on, it may venture into the sex subject, which I will probably have a problem with, but want to watch so I can keep up with whats going on around me and be prepared.  :)

               When I was at primary school we all played the same games and did the same activities.  Of course, there were times when we played 'boys to catch the girls' ;)  The brainwashing does not only extend to which bathroom one should use or thinking about sexual themes.  The danger is in getting rid of pronouns and all the ramifications that will have on reading material, etc.  I noticed for example (the bit that I saw), the psychologist got the children to read modern children's books and compare them to more traditional books.  The characters in the new books for girls seemed to be based on the superheroes you see in comic books.  And you know that those are largely developed by men/boys, right?  I don't have much confidence in the common sense of today's 'psychologists'.

              Watch the VICE documentary on their YT channel about kids in Sweden being brought up Genderless. To see these little blonde boys smiling from ear to ear and saying "I am not a boy or a girl" will break your heart. It pains me to know that this is the future of mankind.

                At this point, brother, that's all we can do. Try to red pill our friends and family. The worst thing about this fight is that, more often than not, our own families and friends don't have the mental fortitude to take on topics like this. Our fathers, grandfathers, as hardened as they are, can't take the idea of the government running a massive pedo ring. We have to get them to understand. Educate the old, educate the young, and pretty soon everyone will wake up to the truth of this world.

               I just watched that VICE documentary, thanks.  Yes sad, they do a good thing by giving the children great opportunities to enjoy their childhood and ruin it by confusing them about their gender, all because they are mixed up weirdos!  The Psychiatrist David Edburhard was exactly my position on this whole thing, let the children experience everything pertaining to playing with toys, climbing trees, etc., but let them embrace the fact that they are NATURALLY a male or female without making accept the weirdo adults that the ADULTS chose to hang around with!

               It's why I couldn't watch the BBC programme.  I can't bear to watch anything put out by VICE, the propaganda hits me squarely between the eyes.  I actually have a couple of friends who call themselves journalists and sometimes post articles and videos put out by them.   Those are the people that are the hardest to reach..the people who think that they work closely with the news and turn up their noses at what they consider to be 'citizen journalists'.  I do despair sometimes.
