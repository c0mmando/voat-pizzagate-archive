            So if the pedos will be exposed in 2018 , but the economy will be crashed in 2017, they'll be exposed but we'll be too broke to do anything. ...nice.

            RDS is hysterically funny.  I only watched for a few minutes but he was also talking about AJ calling him a CIA psyop and his retort is that AJ is not worth a CIA psyop (though it's been clear for a while that the truth community is being targeted via AJ..he's even being mentioned by mainstream media and politicians, including Hillary).  RDS also says he not talking about the Mars thing anymore, he's going to focus on US integrity - guess the blowback from the truth community about the whole Mars thing made him/them realize it was a step too far.  As for the reputation of Project Avalon as a CIA hangout...another lol.  I notice they wisely disabled their comments section.

             I don't know how to discern whom to believe so I just keep it all in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some people say the following people are truthers while others say they're disinformation:
George Webb 
Robert David Steele 
Dr. Piezcenick 
Alex Jones
Titus Frost
David Seaman
High level insider 
Fbi anon
Anon 5
WhiteHouse insider
Victory of the Light 
Navy Jack
David Icke
Cynthia McKinney
            </p>
            <p>
             And the list goes on
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no way any of us can say for sure what's truth and what's lies.  So I just keep it all in mind then see who's "truths" pan out.  I think fbi anon proved himself with his predictions last July and I actually think seaman did have insider info on arrests but Comey shut them down and David ended up looking like a liar

              I don't trust AJ either.  The only thing I trust is my own research.  Anyone who has a high viewer count on any of the main social media platforms is suspect.

             I took the No Prison Time for Pedos to be an enticement to get some to come forward and turn on the rest.  That way, we can avoid a direct confrontation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think of it this way.  RDS probably knows the full extend of the pedo issue, and understands the amount of power these people have.  I know that The Cabal has enough money and power to bankrupt any nation they want.  This is why the Federal Reserve has never been audited.  I would also assume that The Cabal can control the military (U.S., Britain, etc.) through various means.  I also read about the "Samson" option which involves the placement of nuclear weapons in various cities which can be lit off by The Cabal if they feel threatened.
            </p>
            <p>
             So...  Is it better to negotiate with The Cabal and leave them an out for disclosing all?  It is very distasteful to think about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, I personally would like to see The Cabal arrested AND executed for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and treason, among other crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, we need to fully understand and appreciate the risk involved.

            It's difficult to trust Robert David Steele after some of his recent stunts.  Pressuring people to get a meeting with Trump, heavily pushing that "Un-rig" stuff which seems a bit suspect and then the Mars nonsense.

             Just thought it was interesting that he said the pefos would be fully exposed by 2018.  I think there's some disinformation, but I do believe there's life not on Earth.  I think he's pretty spot on on a lot of the stuff he says in the video
