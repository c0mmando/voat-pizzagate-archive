            Well, there's the part where we're accusing these people of these things... why are we accusing these people (on a publicly viewable forum) in the first place?
It comes back to the first thing that started all this... some strangely worded e-mails that used words that showed up in some FBI documents that seemed to tie Podesta to child sex trafficking that were leaked.  And, as a whole, we took that and ran.
I know HRC or whoever isn't going to personally post a picture of her slaughtering a child and taking a big bite of the adrenaline gland, but maybe someone had a camera going.
But, to say that, because she went to a thing at Comet Pizza, where some strange things exist, and those strange things could tie back to something else, and that something else might tie back to child sex trafficking, and that, and so on and so on... soon, we get into the "my second cousin told me about something his friend was told by his friend who says he was told his best friend's dad's third cousin's brother" kind of thing.
Without proof, of any kind (screencap of a security camera, a laundry-list of articles saying that Adrenochrome (there's no nice abbreviation for that one... Google Chrome's autocorrect doesn't know what to do with that one, even) will make you live longer or whatever), claiming that the Adrenochrome angle is why all this is happening (or the Satanic abuse angle, or whatever) doesn't hold water.
You could slap any label on any group of individuals... be they
            <em>
             REAL
            </em>
            Satanists, witches (which I am one), Hebraic, Muslim, Goth, Catholic, White, Native American (1/5, combined from both sides of the family, otherwise 2/5 German and 2/5 Irish)... because one single Goth molests a kid doesn't mean every single one is a child molester without proof.
Of course, HRC isn't going to post the proof herself!  If it was really that easy, the court system would move along a lot faster.
Remember, the whole world can see this, and outrageous claims make us look like a bunch of raving idiots.  Stuff about the Podesta e-mails and that isn't a big deal, but saying that this is **all ** just to harvest Adrenochrome (which, given it's efficacy, according to people who have used it), wouldn't make it exactly a worthwhile venture.

            Sorry, SweetChicken, but no. You'll have to provide linked evidence for this statement, and it needs to be a medically accurate, scientific source. No one has ever demonstrated this is even possible from a biochemical standpoint, let alone true. In case you happen to have such information you'd like to add to the post, I will give this the 24 Hour edit flair. Otherwise, this will need to be removed per Rules 1, 2 and 3.

             Adrenochrome is released into the bloodstream when adrenaline is released and then oxidized. Why do I have to prove this fact? Are you suggesting it can’t be extracted?

              That isn't what you have to prove. You have to prove there's a reason anyone would do it. You have to show evidence of pharmacokinetic efficacy that could withstand the human digestion system.

                  Sorry, SC, I did not see that you had added a second link. You didn't mention you'd edited the post.

                 <p>
                  The Erowid material says excess adrenochrome created metabolically from excess adrenaline causes chemically induced schizophrenia. I am not seeing where it says it can be "done" "to get high," especially by drinking the blood of someone who has been tortured into producing it. Could you quote the relevant material? There are dozens of articles there.

                    That reference isn't to adrenochrome, SC. It's to adrenochrome semicarbazone, and has to be dissolved in butter or alcohol in order to be absorbed by the digestive system:

                    You've done a good job proving adrenochrome is a real substance with real effects. But not that it is something that could be "harvested" via torture like milk from a cow, and still have a desireable effect worth kidnapping and killing kids for. That is all still speculative.

                    The page you linked seems to mostly link to articles by MDs and such.
The main page on Erowid has a section where people have submitted their own personal experiences with the so-called Adrenochrome (and, even then, they were using oxidized epinephrine).  Science is fact, as far as medicine goes, but if we're talking about why you would supposedly kill kids after scaring them for days and then harvest their Adrenochrome, their is no evidence that using oxidized adrenaline as a super drug or whatever actually does anything other than give you a little boost for a minute and cause bad headaches.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Now... if you have verifiable stories from people who have harvested Adrenochrome after scaring kids to death or whatever just to gain superpowers or live longer or reverse aging or something, I (and a lot of other people) would like to read them, and I would invite the people reading those stories to do their independent research into what actually happened.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Now... if you post a link to a video of "HRC killing a kid and harvesting Adrenochrome to look twenty years younger" or something, and after ALL the enhancements everyone can throw at it, there is no denying it is HRC, then I will accept that as being an actual effect of Adrenochrome, and there may be some basis to the whole thing.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The big thing, is... the more solid links you can provide, the better.  And, not the usual suspects in the crap conspiracy news world... MIT, Mayo Clinic, Cambridge, BBC, are a few good ones... AP is also good, if it's from like Tampa Bay, a link from there and from a few other unrelated sites that cover the same story.

                I am not disagreeing with you, I do believe they do satanic torture killings to get the adrenochrom high but there is not enough evidence to back it up.

               <p>
                But your edit doesnt do anything but expand on Adrenochrome.
