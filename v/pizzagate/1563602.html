            While I'd agree that  they use pictures to scare children and women and men too,  it appears to have many purposes.  I don't agree that fear tactic is the only reason these things are used.
           </p>
           <p>
            Including fear tactics, I  can't come to any other conclusion than  they use it because they personally derive pleasure from torture in the form of art.  (insert here the many PG  pics showing  podesta torture art and  CPP art showing a decapitated head,  Art Blu Café's  dark art, along with  Abramovic's  bdsm in the name of  art,  etc)
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeffrey Dahmer made artwork out of his victims before he was caught and AFTER his victim was dead.  He may frighten or intimidate and manipulate others who may have seen it,  but how is this a psyop when it's part of their  mental and psychological  "culture" related to what they believe to be spiritual based events.
           </p>
           <p>
            Along with personal pleasure,   they also use  it as part of a ritual as described in  Marina Abramovic Podesta email:
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893">
             https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            and  Podesta email  asking  Obama for a  Thelema favor:
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39459">
             https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39459
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In the above 2 emails the rituals are specifically for adults, as  Abramovic has shown it's a conjuring ritual act as well as art.  (see her reddit definition of art or ritual, one might be public and one private, but it can be interchanged  depending on what the artist decides to choose.)
           </p>
           <p>
            I repeat, how is this a  total psyop when it's part of their  mental and psychological  "culture" related to what they believe to be spiritual based events.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Abramovic is just an artist, and Podesta's and Obama's are just engaging in meaningless Thelema favors, then  Jeffrey Dahmer was just a chef experimenting with different types of meat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it true that FBI CIA types don't like to look into rituals as part of their investigation format?   If that's true, Webb is an example of this format.  This won't help an investigation for many reasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            First off, it shuts down leads that can branch to other people or places that might provide a network of  more leads and  evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second off,   if you don't look into the aspect of personal involvement you've abdicated any psychological motive and thereby shut down charges that could be put on extended motives.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll agree that they can use it to intimidate as a psyop, but I've researched  rituals for too long and know that people who engage in this level of ritual either believe it or  are trying  to learn to believe it.    If you don't factor it in you won't be able to understand their psyche, it won't lead you to a broader network of leads in people and places, and it won't extend their  charges or any rehabilitation help they can get after the charges.
