<p>**Authorities still were looking Thursday for a 12-year-old girl who they say ran away from home and who may be with a man who is at least 10 years older than she is.</p>
<p>Paw Ku was last seen running away from her home near 51st and Maple Streets on Jan. 8. Her family reported it to police the next day.</p>
<p>She has a history of running away, said Lt. Tracy Scherer of the Omaha Police Department’s child victims sex assault unit.</p>
<p>“Her age and her behavior, who she associates with and her prior runaways ... puts her at risk, but we do not believe she was physically taken against her will,” Scherer said.</p>
<p>Police have not been able to talk to the man, Eh Ther Ger, who is 22 or 23 years old. He has not shown up at work since Jan. 12, Scherer said, and has not appeared at places where he usually stays.</p>
<p>Investigators have not found any evidence of grooming or a sexual relationship between the two, Scherer said.</p>
<p>In December, Ku’s mother filed a protection order against Ger, saying that her daughter had been skipping school this fall to spend time with him. Her mother told her not to date someone so much older, but she continued to find photos online of the two kissing and hugging.</p>
<p>Dec. 27, Ger called the mother looking for Ku and was “very aggressive,” the mother wrote in the protection order.</p>
<p>If Ku is found with Ger, he could be charged with harboring a missing juvenile, Scherer said. Both speak the Karen language, and they will be interviewed by police after the girl is found to determine whether any further charges are warranted.</p>
<p>Ger’s parents kicked him out of their home because of the relationship with Ku, Scherer said.</p>
<p>Officials think Ku may be in the Omaha area.</p>
<p>Ku is 5 feet tall, 100 pounds and has blonde hair with brown eyes. People are asked to call 911 if they see her.</p>
<p>“The parents would like her to come home, and we would like to help her with whatever she needs,” Scherer said.**</p>
<hr />
<p>Only 13 hours ago, 10 DAYS after the child went missing, the Omaha PD asked for Omahan\'s help in finding her. <a href="http://www.wowt.com/content/news/OPD-asks-for-help-locating-missing-12-year-old-469842273.html">http://www.wowt.com/content/news/OPD-asks-for-help-locating-missing-12-year-old-469842273.html</a></p>

<p>OPD officials said they do not feel she is in any danger but the Child Victim Sexual Assault Squad (CVSA) is concerned due to her age. The Special Victims Unit has been actively searching for Ku, but say they’ve exhausted their leads. </p>

<p><strong>She\'s with a 22 year old gang member but she\'s safe! No worries - Love, Omaha PD</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Apparently the failure to alert the public about her disappearance is due to the (COUGHlaurasilsbyCOUGH) Amber Alert System and their strict requirements:

<blockquote>
<p>Specific requirements must be met for an Amber Alert to be issued. A number of these requirements were not met.</p>

<p>Omahans on Twitter are very defensive, only one person is speaking up about the possible connections to sex trafficking, and she is being attacked on all sides:</p>

Her mother told her not to date someone so much older, but she continued to find photos online of the two kissing and hugging.   WHAT? Her mother told her not to DATE someone so much older?  DATE?   What is going on here?  This whole investigation is also Suspect!  It does not seem they are too interested in finding this CHILD.  Yes.  She is a CHILD.  Not a Juvenile.  This is Omaha the state of W Bu$$et.  Yes and LE has been protecting pedos for ever.  What more does it take for people to wake up in that state.  I am on the verge of insulting them Big Time.  OOH  I AM SO MAD!!!

            Amber alerts and the "have you seen me" fliers tend to not include kids who are deemed run always unless it can be shown the kid is in danger. I would assume any run away 12 year old is in danger, but hey that's just me. There is proof that this girl was "dating" a 22 year old so you would think the authorities would have been more on top of this. If it were my daughter, this pervert would be "missing" long before my kid could have been manipulated into running off with him.  We can't depend on the corrupt authorities to do the right thing it seems

             It just dawned on me too that when they are abused they get attached to their abuser.  He is and has been grooming her.  She of course will follow him. The parents do not understand about this.  They think it is Dating when in reality it is Grooming.

              But we are not allowed to say that anymore  remember "stockholm syndrome" is no longer a thing....but realistically (if kidnap is not involved and maybe sometimes when it is) when girls start having sex they get attached even if the guy is a jerk/pedo espeacially if they were your first...most girls wouldnt do it unless they thought they were "in love"

               Yes and especially if she is a very young girl and a CHILD still, as this one is.  She is not experienced enough in dating and guys or men or even with people in general to know that they sometimes have only their own interests at heart or are extremely sinister.  Her parents seem much too lenient and it seems she is looking for attention and he is giving it to her.  The Grooming is definitely working.  The Stockholm Effect is a result of Grooming.  If the pedophile is extremely good that is his goal.  That is how he will get her to latch on to him.  The pedos know this.  So is this how the kidnapper of Jaycee Duggar operated?  He knew this.  Why is it now that NCMEC wants Victims to never mention Stockholm Syndrome ever again. There is a Method To Their Madness.

               OMG you guys - can you help me dig into these comments? I've gleaned a lot just from reading them... Apparently her FB page is under "Paw Htee Ku" and her pictures have tons of sexual comments by all sorts of older men. People are saying to take screenshots of the comments (which are being deleted as we speak) but Facebook isn't allowing them to post the screenshots for the cops. Police sound pretty defensive...

                  I am not on facebook either but I read all the comments.  You are right.  Just click at the bottom of her pic where it says comments.  They are really amazing.  so many are really ticked off about the OPD waiting so long to release this info because of Amber info.  Those laws are tailor made for the pedos.  No release of info unless there is a plate. What if someone did not get the license plate or what if they met on a corner because he has been Grooming Her as in this case.  Evidently he has her trained like a little Puppy Dog.  This is disgusting. There were a couple of girls that said they knew her and one was her cousin.  Another said that he was a next door neighbor and was told she went with her Dad some place.  So much misinformation.  The Good Thing is that many were Sharing the Info.

                    I am so livid right now and physically sick to my stomach.  I had to force myself to listen to that woman.  This is part of the write up:  Neither of Paw's nor Ger's parents approved of the relationship and it was Paw's parents who called the police when she did not come home. Scherer said Paw and her boyfriend are likely still in the Omaha area and the police  believe the pair does not want to be found.   THE police believe the pair does not want to be found.  WHAT?  Of course we know he does not want to be found.  He is a 22-23 yr. old man on the run with a 12 yr. old girl.  She has been Groomed and Spirited away from her family with whatever he has promised her.  I can almost guarantee that he has had sex with her so once he does that, being that girls quickly latch on more so than boys, she is LockStep In Love With Him.  She is way too young to understand about Real Love and a Sexual Relationship.  This is all So Very Wrong On All Levels. Also, they could very well be on the way  to Canada and already out of the area.  He had a job, so how do we know he did not save up some money to tide them over til they are safely over the boarder.  They could have taken a Greyhound Bus or any other type of Bus.  Relatively Cheap.  This is Frightening at Best.  People in that area should be getting groups together in their cars so look for this Pervert and his Victim.

             I am so in agreement with you.  Dating?  She has run away before?  First of all they have her down as having Blond Hair.  I do not see Blond Hair.  It looks like it is streaked but it is NOT Blond.  Are they trying to Misinform people On Purpose?  Something Reeks.

               What I don't understand is the guy was living with the family while the mother told the daughter not to date him?  There are things in this story that just don't add up.  Like I said, the hair color. Makes me think they don't want her to be found and calling her a Runaway.  Remember Newsham in DC that said a lot of the missing Children?  Stinks.

                 Omaha is a Cesspool.  We have gone around with them before.  They threw a guy that lived there in a a mental home after coming to his house with guns and dogs.  Why?  Because he insisted he saw children that looked trafficked in the basement of a restaurant.  I don't put anything past them.

               Super Sketchy in my book.  Does someone want this girl?  Where did she always run to when she ran away?  Things don't add up.

                I know the story is she ran off with the guy she thought was her boyfriend, but it's pretty common for young guys to pose as a "boyfriend" to young girls to lure them away from home and turn them out into forced prostitution. They're just pimps who trick naieve innocent girls into thinking they care about them

                 Yeah, like R Kelly  Another procurer of sex for elites.  This is about as Sketchy as it gets.  There was a guy on here that months ago saw something in a restaurant that he said pointed to kids and trafficking.  He tried to get people to investigate but then the next thing the police and dogs came to his house and he was taken to jail.  They put him in a recovery place like a mental home.  It took many months but he finally got out.  I have lost track of him maybe someone knows.  I think it was also in Nebraska.  There is some really Bad Stuff going on out there.

               I sens something somewhat strange about that guy's remarks.  When she asks what he might know about that he backs down and takes off.  Possibly a Pedo Wimp.

             The police admit he is a gang member, how could they also assert she is not in danger?  And isn't it cause for alarm, or arrest, that he has been "kissing and hugging" a 12 year old?

              I hope to God that ICE is going to return this Gang Member not only MS 13 or Mexicans.  This guy should have been returned to his Country of Origin if he was arrested for pedophilia before.  AARRGGHH.
