            I like Rogan and regularly listen to him.  I like Callen, too...I agree his dismissive attitude was weird and I can only think of two plausible answers.
1) The most likely answer is that he has a network TV show going right now and the quickest way not to have a paycheck would be to back pizzagate.
2) He knows that pizzagate is real.

            Nice analysis on Callen, you hit the nail on the head. He's smart enough but like you said comes off a little desperate and a bit tryhard which ends up feeling ingenuine(screw you google spell check this is a word at this point!)  Eddie has always seemed cool to me. I wonder what Joey Santiago would have say, lol.

            There certainly was no doubt that Eddie was %100 convinced in my opinion. I don't know what the fuck was up with Brian Callen. I never really cared for him that much anyway tbh but he really turned me off during that podcast.

            That's very interesting. His instant dismissal of Pizzagate is bizarre for someone who considers himself an information junkie.

            Man quality post. A lot of interesting conjecture here. I guess a big question for us, as well as most other political forums is 'what exactly IS Trump going to do?'. And to my mind, hes been such a wildcard the simple answer is i have no clue. What i think we can bet on, and without putting words in your mouth, what i think you were saying, is Trumps forthcoming policies lie at the intersection of that which is most profitable to him (by way of power/influence gained, and personal economic benefit) and prevailing public opinion (the man is a unabashed populist, making him to my mind, perhaps somewhat ironically, the most democratic president, perhaps politician, in modern history).
           </p>
           <p>
            All that being said, all we can do is contribute to the meme machine and work some sweet Kek magic on the heads of the ruling political elites. Peace and love brother, keep being woke

            Joe Rogan has daughters so he should particularly interested in Pizzagate though apparently it's to much for him to stomach.
However he did say in a recent podcast that he would get into it more once the dust had settled.

            I was hoping that the Fighter and The Kid woud have a debate on it but Brendan has no idea.

            I used to listen to the JRE all the time but I just got so sick of Brian. He added nothing and constantly took away from the show imo. Is he not on the show anymore? I would go back to the JRE if I knew Redban didn't have a mic.

             Yeah man, he only returns as a rare featured guest. I dont know man, i was sometimes a fan of his puerile, crass humor. Particularly when itd rustle joes jimmies. Like joe would get all holier than thou when brian would ham it up and id think 'dude! Youre not exactly the fucking height of intellectualism joe,' at least brian isnt putting on airs.

              That is very true and I guess I can respect him for that. That being said, he was almost like the human version of the Fleshlight- Both were with the show from the beginning but eventually had to be dropped because it brought the show down and prevented it form being more. If that makes sense, lol. But I will get back to the JRE. If he dismisses pizzagate though, I may not be able to listen to him. This issue has really become a litmus test or barometer for me tbh.

               Lol well said. Clever and apt simile with the fleshlight. And also, i agree concerning joes stance on this issue. Man i have dismissed every conspiracy theory ive even encountered. Pizzagate is something different. We're doing good work here, and those who oppose us are more than just wrong.

            I have asked him in the comments of his YT vids and on Twitter and he hasn't responded but I first heard DS on JRE during the 08 elections and he was mostly talking about Ron Paul. He needs to go on the show and inform that fanbase, it would definitely help the cause I believe. I've also Tweeted Joe and he did not respond. I know how Joe can be about stuff but I do believe if he was presented with the facts he would speak out against it.

            So (((David Seaman))) is "legit" because he got fired from a shill news organization that he worked in for years?...

             +1 on Jordan Peterson. Love that guy.
            </p>
            <p>
             So glad he is getting notoriety. I've been following him for years. Read his massive book and everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             IMO his views on humanities capacities for evil are relevant to pizzagate. His view brought me some much needed realism and inspiration during a sort of existential crisis.

            Joe must get tons of requests daily for people to be on his Podcast. Assuming David is up for it (he may not be), I think the best thing we could do to make this happen would be to try and crowdfund his plane ticket/accommodation.

            Apparently they had a bit of a falling out. Also, David Seaman now lives in Colorado, not LA.

            Joe has mentioned Pizzagate twice to my recollection now, so I think it's fair to say he's aware and intrigued.

             Great contribution man! I had no idea that is so incredibly unfortunate. Kind of leaves this campaign to reconnect them dead in the water. And wtf with Redband badmouthing him. Very very disappointing

              I don't think it's necessarily 'dead in the water'. Joe has quite the curiosity. Whenever something happens in the news he always has to talk about it. He's already mentioned Pizzagate twice by name. If we could first ask Seaman if he'd be willing to go on the JRE, and then organize a campaign to get Joe's attention, and maybe even crowdfunding Seaman's airfair -- I think it's doable.
             </p>
             <p>
              Joe gets 60+ million download a month. I think it would be worth the effort.

               Id like to agree with you friend. I hope to see it happen. I am actually trying to contact david to this point, it would help a ton if others here did the same. Hopefully we can all put aside our egos for a noble cause

            Personally, I think we shouldn't take the gloves off until 01/20. I think we should open the floodgates when Trump is in.

            Until then nothing can happen anyway. Except public recognition.

            I would collect and compile (I am) and continue to meme and get the word out, but I think new information should be kept on the DL. I don't want to give anyone any more notice that we're coming after them.

             All due respect, I've seen this line of reasoning on here before and completely disagree.
            </p>
            <p>
             The key is 'public recognition', though I believe the concept is more complicated than this phrase intones. All that matters is what the people believe, and the opposition is daily engaged in misrepresenting the truth to warp their perception. We need to fight man. If we hesitate or cede ground the truth may be lost to time

              Yes. Public awareness is key. Media attention is good, no matter how nasty it gets. In fact, the nastier the better: when the truth comes out, everyone will know who the cowards and liars were.

            Did he ever go on Daily Show?  If not, why not?  Just curious.

           <p>
            This is a good idea.  Start commenting on Joe Rogan's videos to this effect.

             Oh, and to answer your questions no he has not been on the Daily Show. Last I heard the producer he was in contact with there was rephrasing the invitation to imply this discussion panel has not been (ie never will be) approved by the people making the final decisions

              Ah, they likely got spooked by him. Had hoped for a total lunatic or well-intentioned dummy to step forward and be easy to take advantage of, and discredit through mockery and editing tricks. Likely something tipped them off that their usual tactics wouldn't work in this case.

              But even ideologues like the people who populate the production teams of that show must know that they're playing with fire on a subject like this. Enough of them
              <em>
               must
              </em>
              know the truth to the extent that they understand there is a
              <em>
               genuine
              </em>
              risk of it all coming to light, and to have come out against it in a dismissive and belittling manner would only harm their reputation, perhaps even fatally.

             Thank you for agreeing! I know some here see Joe as nothing but a shill, but i give him the benefit of the doubt. Been listening for years - hes not always my favorite person but I judge him to be a good man. And his audience needs somebody smarter than Eddie Bravo and Bryan head-up-his-ass Callen presenting our cause
