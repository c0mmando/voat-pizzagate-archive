            Thanks for the heads up. So she says a pedo hearing is not what Trump needs to do cuz his tax reform and other needs will take a back seat if that is going on. I will never waste my ears on her. Oh...the poor pedos it will wreck their lives and people "will fight"?????

            Catherine it's a fight that has been coming for years! If you don't think it's what Trump needs to do and will not be good for the country as it's disruptive, then please get out of the way and not cause more resistance.

             I think I heard it differently. It needs to be done carefully, not avoided.
