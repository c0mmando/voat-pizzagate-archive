<p>Blink-182 have canceled their co-headlining summer tour with Linkin Park in the wake of Chester Bennington’s death. The band announced the news via their official Twitter account on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Blink-182 is wrecked by the loss of our friend and amazing musician Chester Bennington,” their post reads. “We could never imagine playing Blinkin Park without his incredible talent and voice. It just would not be possible. We send our deepest sympathies to his family, bandmates, friends, and fans. Refunds will be available at the place of purchase.”</p>

<p>In an email — subject line: &quot;Important things&quot; — sent in October 2015, DeLonge introduces himself as &quot;the one who interviewed you for that special documentary not to long ago,&quot; offering to set up a meeting with Podesta and two &quot;important&quot; figures.</p>

             Here's a strange one
            </strong>
            : Some abuse victims repress their memories. There are many parallels between ritual abuse victims and alien abductees (

            George Webb is saying that Chester Bennington is a "throw", but he couldn't be further from the truth on this.

            This isn't about "the biggest story since Watergate". This is about the Fate of the World.

            - did you follow the leads that were presented in the Crowdsource the Truth chat?
           </p>
           <p>
            This is only the beginning. You are missing the other co-author Peter Lavenda, who is connected to Jack Parson and indirectly to Crowley. DeLonge is from Poway, California and is part of the inner circle that is planning to use Sustainability, Aliens, and AI to forge a one-world Luciferian religion. They will use "Community Policing", one world currency and chip embedding to enforce it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the trend, this is just the beginning. It is called The Mark of the Beast. Soon you will not be able to buy or trade without it.
            <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40710051">
             http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40710051
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The real connection is Paul Ryan. That is why Racine, Wisconsin is so important. DeLonge, Travis Barker, Romney and others from LDS like Evan McMullin made a partnership with Paul Ryan who also made a partnership with the Clintons, Podestas, Emanuels, Ashton Kutcher and the DNC, was on the plane with Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch. These partnerships corrupt both church and state, and lead to the real agenda of Global Enslavement. The "ROOT" of this is in Racine, Wisconsin, and Paul Ryan is the deal maker selling out both church and state.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is there such an unusual percentage of Mormons in the CiA and FBI? This has been a long-term plan. We found out the FBI had no interest in the rule of law long ago, and started connecting more dots to figure out how deep it goes. It goes back to ancient history.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone seen the underwater pyramids, carvings and stone formations discovered in Wisconsin? There is a reason why Racine means ROOT and why it is used as a model for the global agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            Part of the deal with Paul Ryan, Loretta Lynch and the Clintons was to stonewall RICO investigations into Racine, Wisconsin that led to Clinton Foundation and the real elite tied to Pilgrims Society which leads to Black Nobility, Kabbalah and the Council of 13.
           </p>

            Stuff gets stranger by the day....instead of falling apart this whole conspiracy sticks together like a steel web.  I think we can all go back over any silly and weird conspiracy story we have heard over the last 50 years and see how it ties in.....like one of the guys on the Joe Rogan show said.  Pizzagate is the conspiracy theory that makes all the other conspiracy theories make sense.....and you realize in reality there is only one real conspiracy.....the rest is just different parts of the whole.  It all ties together like an web.

             baby parts for anti-aging serums, sacrifices for their magic/occult religious beliefs (satanic), molestation because the demographic that founded the illuminati believed in proposed messiahs like jacob frank and sabbati zevi who did terrible things (like rape their daughter, episodes of madness and terrible acts) and the gospel from both these self-proposed messiahs was that humans achieve godliness and "heal the world" through either good or bad, but it has to be all the way and everyone. around this time in the 1600s and 1700s, many Jews started to believe as core to this new prophet that by being as diabolical/evil/unspeakable as possible, they transcend into godliness and usher in the new era. Here is an episode of a pretty good documentary series on pizzagate going over these European Jewish Messiahs in Germany which were part of the inspiration (or at least some crossover, not the whole inspiration of course) of the illuminati, specifically the part about becoming God-like, at any cost
