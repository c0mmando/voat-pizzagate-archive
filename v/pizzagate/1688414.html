<p>Well I think the foundations for a solution are revealed in this YT clip where Alan Watts talks about Carl Jung and his ideology on the subject.

<p>According to Jung, the main mistake made is assuming that the world is embroiled in a battle of good vs. evil that will never be resolved, when in actuality it\'s not a battle at all! There is a deeper layer where no opposing forces exist and we can call that unified field of divinity. The problem that occurs when we operate within the realm of division is that when we recognize evil within ourselves or others we immediately take up arms against it. This actually represses the evil and in turn causes it to be projected elsewhere and you get situations where you end up becoming the evil you set out to defeat in the first place :) </p>
<p>THE SOLUTION - being able to take a step back into unified field and realize that we are all capable of evil... At the core of this evil is really power abuse, and we are all guilty of that to some degree. And think about trying to deal with these situations if you were abused as a child and raised up within this structures? </p>
<p>&quot;To the degree that the person becomes conscious that the evil is as much in himself as in the other, to this same degree he is not likely to project it onto some scapegoat and commit the most criminal acts of violence on other people&quot;</p>
<p>Now I\'m getting pretty tired so I\'m not going to go further with the implications, but will say this... We have to make sure we don\'t eliminate this current system of evil at the expense of creating another one to take its place. That\'s the danger that can be prevented with a solution derived from more cultured cognitive approach. </p>
<p>Hope people read/listen and enjoy hehe. Looking forward to feedback goodnight!</p>',

            Ah great response. Definitely agree with Trump think but still holding out hope. The problem with politics is that when you attach yourself to one of these people you invariably attach yourself to all of their negatives and their perceived negatives. You have to actively combat and separate all of these pitfalls and fallacies every time you try and navigate an argument it seems like.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting point about refilling swamp. An idea I just had was... what if we can combat the cabal's underlying a prioris. These are supposed to be some of our best and brightest humans heh, but they've spent their entire lives trapped in the domain of power abuse. Is it possible to convince them that the future for humanity needs their POSITIVE contribution? Maybe that's not even remotely possible BUT what if we could 'convert' just one? Expose, unravel and heal the evil!

             Sadly power and money corrupts them to the core of their soul. 
They rather watch the world burn than 
Lose their grasp of power. I mean look at how the left are acting. Sheer lunacy
They act like their favorite team lost the championship .

            I think unplugging, IS THE ONLY WAY.  You won't miss a thing.  PBS is no better than anyone else....no better.
The churches of oprah (ugh, yuck), olsteen and the 700 club are cults in and of themselves.  I recall hearing olsteen's wife (on a previous youtube post) say, "don't do it for God, do it for yourself.  THAT will make God happy."  Snoprah is so dazzled by her own wealth, well, she's a goner and a supporter of Jeff Besos.  These so called love and light organizations that promote nothing but self-absorption.  It is a downright disgrace that anyone, anywhere, needs all the money that these people make.

            The real solution is - Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's home district.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is the key to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption with ties to every major secret society, both major parties, every major industry, and all links back to Agenda 2030, the new oil (water), and a global system of corruption and abuse.

            Question everything and everyone. 
Our downfall as a nation would be if we blindly gave into trump. Look what happened with 8 years of obummer. 
There will always be pedophilia.  On a local level and on a world wide systematically controlled level. We as consciously aware individuals must make sure the powers that be are doing their jobs right and sadly they are not.and in turn we have failed in our 
Responsibilty of protecting the children.

            I love me some Carl Jung :)
           </p>
           <p>
            However I think that most people don't or can't 'get' him.  One can only understand the concept of the unified field by first doing some inner work and challenging one's own dark nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jung on group experience:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “A group experience takes place on a lower level of consciousness than the experience of an individual. This is due to the fact that, when many people gather together to share one common emotion, the total psyche emerging from the group is below the level of the individual psyche. If it is a very large group, the collective psyche will be more like the psyche of an animal, which is the reason why the ethical attitude of large organizations is always doubtful. The psychology of a large crowd inevitably sinks to the level of mob psychology. If, therefore, I have a so-called collective experience as a member of a group, it takes place on a lower level of consciousness than if I had the experience by myself alone.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Individual experience:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "The mirror does not flatter, it faithfully shows whatever looks into it; namely, the face we never show to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask of the actor."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            As Jung said, most people are not capable of doing that internal work.  Look around, you'll see that's true.

             He's such a baller aha. Very true! He's definitely a litmus test for self-actualization. Luckily I stumbled into his biography and Joseph Campbell in late teens :D

            Jung was a student of Freud.  Jung said that we all have a 'dark side' which, if we attempt to deny it and not integrate it, will be projected on to others.  You can see this on a personal micro level and on a larger scale, where countries accuse other countries of what they themselves are guilty of but cannot acknowledge.  Jung loved applying his theories to myths, and John Campbell has written a series of books about Jung.

            I too struggle with some of what you're saying. In the spirit world, all that is supposed to exist is love and goodness.  We experience suffering on earth because of the duality here.  As spiritual beings and parts of God, we are supposed to have created the physical world so that we could incarnate and experience hardship to know what we are not and to discover our true selves as spirits. That's what I've read, and it has resonated with me.  But now, after reading and seeing these horrible pizzagate stories, I'm beginning to think that there is a satan, perhaps created by the collective minds of the fuckwits who believe and worship him.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I know for sure is that Jesus taught us to love one another and be kind. And they are the teachings I choose to follow.

             Jung started off as student and friend of Freud but definitely parted ways mid-life. Don't think Freud ever took on metaphysical battle.

            <p>
             Yeah same boat here. Not entirely sure if 'satan' but it's definitely much darker degree of evil than was previously privy to.

             There are a lot of wonderful teachings in all religions of the world that can improve not only the quality of your life but the quality of life for those you come into contact with!! I would highly recommend reading Joseph Campbell for his ability to analyze and compare humanities mythology :)  A lot of beautiful insights

              I'm beginning to think that there is a satan, perhaps created by the collective minds of the fuckwits who

             Absolutely.  If you're referencing 'magick' 'holy spirit' 'Christ consciousness'...it's all the same thing.  It's the power of intention, and reality manipulation.  I know  some of you have read about it on /pol/ or /x/ or fringechan or any other site that dives into such theories.

             Our focus is what causes the anomalies.  Example:  We have a population nervous about WWIII.  The universe doesn't hear "oh, WWIII will be BAD" or "WWIII is just what we need!".  No, it only 'hears' (no other word to describe it) "WWIII".  And the universe provides..whether it's inherently 'good' or 'evil' is up to us, the catalyst for it all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, this is just a fringe theory that's floating around out there.  I personally have witnessed such instances on small scales throughout my life, and I am a firm believer.

            I don't agree with this concept at the end.  I think When evil is rooted out it could be filled with good, but if we don't eliminate evil it will grow like weeds.  Pornography is probably causing some of this evil.  Eliminating child porn, snuff films, torture etc would help even if unlikely we can do this completely.  To me the main problem is no checks and balances.  The blackmail and shared perversions are what keeps systems intact.  Positive feedback loop.  And somehow we were taught to love and forgive and be tolerant.  Clever ruse.  We need to call out evil.  Need a way to arrest these people or some consequences to make it a negative influence on the behavior.  Complacency is partly what lead to all this.

              Yes.  But of course I was mentally abused by a parent and so am not a typical person.  I'm not all hung up on "what I get out of life" because life has been hard for me and I never feel like a winner anyway.  My kids are adults.  I am on a list already for sure.  It's a matter of how can I help or what should I be doing?  No one knows.  I've been studying this information quite a while now.  Unclear if I can make a difference. I would gladly give it all up to make a difference.  So would many. Pedophilia is what we can rally around because it's wrong.

             Yeah agree with complacency!! I fell asleep before fleshing things out, but I think an improved attack incorporates this positive mindset. When you create structures using a positive mindset as a foundation then those structures echo them. You only have to look at what George Soros' business deals have left in their wake to see the power the priorities behind manouvers can have

             "And somehow we were taught to love and forgive and be tolerant. Clever ruse."  And WHO do you think set that up?

             This is NOT about individuals.  It's MUCH larger than that, which is why it's so pervasive and so difficult to tackle.  It is about SYSTEMS and CULTURES.
