Why do you think he feared certain family members? Apparently his new girlfriend also wants him talking about his past. This will not end well for anyone.

Did he arrange for them to like like Father and Son?  This is SICK beyond words.  WTH.  Then it says Scott was shocked at the image of it all. Ugh.

            <p>
             In the 1990's internet was not a big thing like it is now. 'Controversial' news was often kept out of the news. All the big lawyers in LA knew each other and any victims trying to come forward would be known before the day was over. Anyone trying to come forward against the 'big shots' would be turned away.

             Nothing will. Don't bother with sheeple. Share with those have have awoke, let sleeping sheeple slumber. They will drag you down, turn on you and be a bigger enemy than shills or the enemy itself. They are addicted to lies,poison and enslavement, they reject the truth the moment it is uttered.

            maybe that is why we need to lighten up a little on some of the actors and go hard after their handlers. some actors are the handlers, but that would be the older ones or directors or moguls? Poor McCulkin, he was a kid, who never had a chance. I think even Michael Jackson was a victim first before he became predator.

             Michael's father pimped him out when he was a young boy he was rented out to all the big music moguls this is a fact it's been researched in various places it's why MJ was so screwed up.

              I know. I felt sorry for him, i had read long ago his father beat him all the time, and the other kids too. I know that he was sick in the head, but so talented. it is really very sad these kids had to endure what they did. and its still being perpetuated by the matriarch

               Corey named them back in '93. They have the recordings of his statements. He recently confirmed them on a show.

               McCully just hasn't come forward. Doubt he will at this point.

               I'm not even sure how much that site is rumor or truth and i don't know how he'd have a job as an entertainment lawyer. Altgough some of the stuff is pretty old, i can't confirm it anywhere else.

                The two men Corey named on Dr. Oz's show (a Sony production) were small time fish no one ever heard about. He has been threatened and will not name the big names including Michael Jackson (a Sony artist). Gloria Allred's hands are deep in this as well. Her daughter Lisa Bloom is good friends with Dr. Oz.

             Shocking to be revealed.  But the perpetrators can not be as it states in the comments.  Much too dangerous.  The comments keep mentioning SS though.  Almost every time that HO'R is brought up his name pops up.  Must be a reason.

              Funny how people who speak out against Spielberg end up at Thalians.... in a hospital in which Spielberg has a whole Pediatric Research Center building named after him!

               The Key is always the word Pediatrics.  If anyone has any concerns or belief about a Research Center or Hospital, etc.  Check if there is a Pediatrics Dept. That is usually the link to involvement.  Yes, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen are all over LA.  Check the Donors as well and usually Alarms will Go Off.

              totally agree. We mentioned this before I think, but SS has also been doing some very strange 'not-like-him' activities lately, being goofy and taking selfies/photobombing, walkabouts etc.

               Spielberg has so much power in LA it's not even funny.

               Spielberg worked for Universal pictures on several projects. For those who don't know, Universal Studios is a very popular theme park in Studio City, CA, popular with families and kids. Many kids were 'recruited' through this theme park.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't forget Spielberg is very good friends with fellow pedophile Jeffrey Katzenberg.

               Is someone maybe making sure he does not talk?  Is he being given something to shut him up or not speak out?  He just recently was on the news trying to placate what has been coming out.  How terrible he says.  Maybe someone thought it sounded too strange and wants him quieted.

                 I am sure there is something at play there.  The drugs flow freely in Hollywood.  Those that are in power know who has them.  They have possibly been responsible for many deaths.

                   I think we lost it going back and forth.  The drugs are about Culkin not Spielberg.  Yes, someone kept him drugged to control him and keep him hooked.  Spielberg is about HO.  I could never get mad at you anyway.
