<p>According to Court Documents Filed This Month, Alan Dershowitz is a Pedophile</p>
<p>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
Case No. 08-80736- Civ -Marra/Johnson
Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015</p>
<p>As with Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, Jane Doe #3 was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein.
(following is from pages 3 and 4 of the legal document filed in Florida)</p>
<p>The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from Jane Doe #3, in violation
 of her rights under the CVRA.
If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe #3 would prove the following: In 1999, Jane Doe #3 was approached by
 Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the main women whom Epstein used to procure under – aged girls for sexual activities 
and a primary co-conspirator in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme .
In fact, it became known to the government that Maxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein ’s
 sexual exploitation
 of minors, including Jane Doe # 3 .
Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe # 3 (who was then fifteen years old ) to come to Epstein’s mansion in a
 fashion very simila
r to the manner in which Epstein and his other co -conspirators coerced dozens of other children (including
 Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2) .
When Jane Doe #3 began giving Epstein a “massage,” Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual 
encounter, as 
they had done with many other victims .</p>
<p>Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and with the assistance of Maxwell converted her
 into what is 
commonly referred to as a “sex slave.”
Epstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about 1999 through 2002, when she managed to escape
 to a foreign
 country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years .</p>
<p>From 1999 through 2002 , Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm Beach
, but also in
 New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in international airspace on his Epstein’s private planes,
 and elsewhere.
Epstein also sexually trafficked the then – minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to politically –
 connected and
 financially – powerful people.
Epstein’s purposes in “lending” Jane Doe ( along with other young girls ) to such powerful people were to
 ingratiate himself 
with them for business, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail information .</p>
<p>One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then -minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was
 former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein ’s and well -known criminal defense
 attorney .
Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was
 a minor, 
not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
In addition to being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshowitz was an eye –
 witness to the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s co -conspirators.
Dershowitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein’s behalf .</p>
<p>Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal prosecution in the Southern
 District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to “any potential co – conspirators of Epstein.” NPA at 5.
Thus, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a provision that provided protection for himself
 against criminal prosecution in Florida for sexually abusing Jane Doe #3 .
Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if disclosed, Dershowitz ( along with other members
 of
 Epstein’s defense team) and the Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein’s victims 
and the general public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.</p>
<p>The Dersh categorically denies these allegations calling Jane Doe 3 a liar and a prostitute among other
 things. He has
 yet to say the charges are antisemitic but it’s long before he plays that card.

            What the Tribe Wants You to Think --
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mr. Dershowitz said that even if that were true, which it is not,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              no one people in history have ever suffered more than the Jews of the Holocaust. No one was ever been more degraded, incarcerated, or slaughtered.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            Still, the Jews never chose to blow up German kindergartens or school buses in response.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Now come the scurrilous and downright weird accusations that Mr. Dershowitz and Prince Andrew engaged in under-age sex with a woman tied to a once-jailed financier. Mr. Dershowitz has categorically denied the allegations completely and utterly. Moreover, he has gone on the attack, demanding that the woman in question repeat the allegations under oath and not just in a civil suit. He has also vowed to have the woman’s attorneys disbarred for making these allegation
             </strong>
            </strong>
            s without checking flight manifests and other forms of evidence that would give them credence.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no way any of us can know if any of this is true. But
            <strong>
             <strong>
              I believe Mr. Dershowitz
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , and not just because he denies it. Rather, it would seem that if any of this happened the woman in question would seek criminal charges against Mr. Dershowitz, or at the very least civil damages.
           </p>
           <p>
            She has not. Rather, she has implicated him in a civil suit against someone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are all mindful of women who are victims of sexual crimes and they must, of course, be protected. But the reputations of individuals who have devoted their lives to the greater good deserve consideration as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            But establishing the truthfulness of these allegations is not the purpose of this column. Rather my purpose is to ask, Where are the Jewish leaders to rise to Mr. Dershowitz’s defense?

            38 Fellow Jews and Crypto Jews -- er, Harvard Law Profs - Sign Letter "in Support of" Derschoshitz
           </p>
           <p>
            "A group of 38 Harvard Law School professors have signed a letter “in support of” Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz, who was recently accused of having sexual relations with a minor who was allegedly trafficked by billionaire Jeffrey E. Epstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the letter, the professors argue that Dershowitz was unable to directly respond to the recent allegations in a legal setting, citing the fact that he does not have standing in the civil case in which the allegations of sexual misconduct were first filed and that Dershowitz denies.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Responding to highly destructive and highly publicized allegations requires finding a forum that can credibly resolve the disputed facts,” they wrote. “The courts should not be used to make such attacks while preventing any effective response.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The civil court case in which the allegations surfaced challenges a plea deal that Dershowitz helped to negotiate for Epstein, who pleaded guilty in state court to soliciting prostitution, but per the plea deal, avoided federal prosecution. Dershowitz is not named as a defendant in the civil case, but has filed to intervene in the case to protect his “reputational interest.”

            You have to be a Semite to  accuse someone of anti-semitism. Semite means brown skinned in every dictionary before the Khazars took over the printing presses. A Khazar is a white skinned tribe with a seriously flawed past. What you are opposing is that the mods ban me for pretending to be Chinese. I am not Chinese. You are bad at history, and anyone can be anyone on the internet. You are also defending one of the only countries in the World that has no laws against slavery(Israel) on a thread devoted to jailing pedos you loser. Go ahead, look it up. You are in front of a computer. Don't come to Florida because it's the GUNSHINE STATE.

             Cernovich filed the exact same motion to intervene as Dershowitz, he claimed 'the public had a right to know' through his advocacy as a journalist but if he really believed what he was saying he would not make a request on only a few specific/'cherry-picked' files, he would be asking for many more disclosures.

            He murdered his first wife when she found CP--which precipitated the divorce. She was murdered during the custody battle. He has made a career out of helping criminals get away with murder and worse. He was behind the OJ "defense" in that circus fake trial.

            My assumption at this point is, (((anyone))) who operates at the level of Dershowitz and keeps such company should be suspected of at least having a penchant for this depravity even if they haven't acted on it.  A pathological hatred is likely established in these people at an early age and the principles espoused in the Talmud and Kabbalah adopted.  Their inversion of the sacred and the profane enables them to participate in unfathomable cruelty and to regard gentiles as worthless.  By supplanting the notion of God with that of their delusional self proclaimed demigod status, they believe moral objectivity to be fallacy and individual freedom the key to world domination.  More broadly speaking, I think Jews who subscribe to Sabbatean-Frankist ideology are inherently nihilistic and are driven by arcane demonic forces.  I believe there is much about the human condition and higher states of consciousness that has been concealed from us by those who mean to do us great harm.

              When I started researching this a few years ago, I was in the same boat.  I had been an advocate for 911 truth for years by that point but was unaware of the scale, history and esoterica that constitutes the foundations of the current state of OUR world.  I had no idea that such ancient, unrelenting evil was still in existence and that the same ideology had always (to some lesser extent) been present in humankind.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am now painfully resigned to the belief that we are a defective and self destructive species with an innate capability to reside at the antipodes of good and evil.  Those who willingly choose to commit such cruelty in our world are not always victims of cruelty themselves however and this inspires fascinating conjecture as to why?  Is it due to something congenital, i.e. epigenetic or from learned behaviour through the myriad negative influences of the human condition or a combination of both?  I'm personally not qualified to answer this accurately but the more I study US as a species, the closer I'm getting to an understanding of what we're witnessing.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would be remissive if I didn't mention where I have learnt so much about this subject and it's someone who many of us are probably already familiar with but if not, take a look at the work of Henry Makow.  He is one of the leading authorities on THE ancient, monolithic global conspiracy and has a very accessible writing style.

               It is almost like humans are capable of such great evil, that they had to make up supernatural beings to blame it on.

              <p>
               Maybe self-awareness causes a lot of the defective and self-destructive behaviors.  I mean, we are here and we cannot leave, so what does it matter if we commit evil acts?  That is not how I think, of course, but a lot of others may think that way.

                This is exactly how these people justify their malevolent and tyrannical behaviour.  They disregard moral objectivity and supplant it with the credo of nihilistic individualism.  By subverting the good in the world, they believe that evil is simply the antipode of good and thus just as accessible and natural as choosing to be virtuous.  However just because we can doesn't mean we should...
               </p>
               <p>
                As humans we are capable of making moral choices that are in accordance with nature.  To indulge negative, cruel and destructive urges is to deny one's self of all the beautiful and wonderful things in the world.  Some people will know no different if they have suffered terribly as children and will ultimately go on to develop into the monster that they originally fell victim to.  It's a self-destructive and self-defeating revolving door that grows exponentially with every new victim.
               </p>
               <p>
                The only way to resolve this nightmare is to wipe the slate clean and apply a damage limitation approach to those who are still young and able to be saved.  And by saved I mean more than just literally taken out of the reach of their oppressors but by counselled and rehabilitated back to a state closer to where they would have been if not subjected to such cruelty.  Unfortunately for many adults who have developed this psychopathy, there is likely no hope and thus would need to be euthanized.  This may sound extreme and harsh but we have passed the tipping point and it is literally a fight for the preservation of the human spirit.

                 I recall a study I read several years ago.  I wish I would have saved it.  It was about a group of chimps in Africa somewhere.  They were dominated by about three males that were violent and ruthless.  Well, the dominant males always ate first and took the best food.  One day they came across some meat that was discarded by some researchers and the three dominant males ate it all themselves.  The meat was tainted and the three dominant males died from food poisoning.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The researchers watched the group to see which male would rise to the top and become the leader.  They predicted that the new leader would be violent and ruthless like the predecessors.

                 Another male did rise to the top, but he was not violent at all.  The group lived very peaceful lives for then on.

                 The NWO globalists want to reduce the population of the Earth to about 500 million.  I think a better idea is the cull the herd from the top.  A lot fewer people would die, the most ruthless and violent, then the rest of us can live in peace.

              My assumption at this point is, (((anyone))) who operates at the level of Dershowitz and keeps such company should be suspected of at least having a penchant for this depravity even if they haven't acted on it.

             It's the other way around -- they've acted on it even if they don't have the penchant.  If you want to get to that leve but you don't allow blackmail material to be made, you'll be blocked.  That means that at some point you end up at a party, and it's made clear that you're either going to abuse that little girl and get yourself dirty, or not only are you not getting that promotion, you're not making it out of the party alive.

             The only other option is to do what Trump did, make your way outside the circles, and then bust in from the top down.

              Where is all this "pedo-busting" that Trump is doing?
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't cite the low-level busts that have been made since he was inaugurated, most of which were WORKING INVESTIGATIONS when he took office that had been ongoing for AT LEAST A YEAR.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump has been in the modeling AND acting businesses.  His "mentor" was CIA Jewish attorney and "lynchpin of the pedo ring" Roy Cohn.  Trump was friends with Epstein.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump is as dirty as the rest of 'em.

               No way - if he was dirty, the dirt would have been leaked by now. And there wouldn't be a #resist. It just doesn't make sense. I'm not saying he's squeaky clean with all of his business dealings, but he's not a pedo - he has the dirt on the pedos.
