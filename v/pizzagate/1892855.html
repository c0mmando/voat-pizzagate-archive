            Another disturbing story about her misleading adoptive parents as to the condition of the RUSSIAN children they were adopting.  (no wonder Putin put an end to Russian adoptions.  He knew the agencies were compromised.)

            "“It’s just awful what happened to Ann,” said Margaret Cole, the adoption agency’s director. “But there’s not a lot I can do about it. She showed up to be an autistic child. Nobody had a clue, and all of a sudden she started having problems.”
Cole said she doesn’t remember what she told Boylan about the importance of Gabrielle’s medical records. But she said 30 percent to 50 percent of children from Russia are labeled as having “perinatal encephalopathy and hypaxial damage.”

            gay baby flesh trading ring where GAY MEN WITH AIDS can pay to shoot their loads into 3rd world and US women to breed GAY AIDS BABIES.
            <a href="http://www.britishsurrogacycentre.com/heterosexualsurrogacy/">

           <p>
            We are also extremely pleased with our results working with HIV+ surrogacy.  We are happy to announce that the BSC has been working with the HIV+ community for several years and has built links with clinics to ensure HIV+ men may now have a biological child of their own, without transferring the HIV virus to either the child or surrogate mother.  This service is open to both the gay and heterosexual community.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you research the sperm washing it's a scam, and the service is only offered when using 3rd world surrogates who don't know that even a gay man is the baby buyer let alone she's getting AIDS semen injected up her twat. Don't HATE the HIV+ GAY AIDS BREEDING NAZI BABY FACTORIES OR YOU ARE A HOMOPHOBIC FASCIST.
           </p>
           <p>
            THE GLOBAL BUSINESS OF THE GAY BABY FLESH TRADE IS SO BIG EVEN ITS BYPRODUCTS ARE SO BIG.

            on twitter with of gay baby flesh breeder fans is making cosmetics out of gay baby flesh called RX Genesis, using placentas smuggled in from the 3rd world by cryo-cell.com
He was banned from doing medical testing in the UK but if you in the gay pedophilia elite the government backs off even after multiple lawsuits from the MHRA finding him guilty of fabricating medical studies.
           </p>
           <p>
            He even has a documentary about using american and 3rd world women to breed for the gay pedophile elite. He has genetically identical twin sons BORN 8 years apart. He gets the younger one on the documentary to speak from his personal experience that men who rub their penises in other mens rotting excrement before it comes out their bum holes make better dads?? How could this young boy know that only cock on on other man's shit rubbers make the best dads? What proof does this boy have that only man on man anal fresh shit rubbers make the better dads? How can that little boy know that only the faggot is best suited to raising children not the heterosexual?

             I don't even know what I just read.  I am ready to believe just about anything after that, but it is hard to wrap my head around it.  How did all of this start and when?  How are we going to help the children of this world?  I feel so hopeless after that, but thanks for informing.

              And true to form Garry Burns is suing the winner for the media awards, just like he sucesfully sued my dad for homosexually vilifiing those who must be respected, i.e. Mark Newton and Peter Truong, all Australians must love under law love under will as they push their penises into screaming Russian baby bottoms they human trafficked with Australian government complicity illegally issuing passports without a DNA test - all for this one comment:

              That comment cost him $20k and made him a politiical refugee from Australia. Now they are trying to take his house in NZ. See that same link in the case law below

              The GLORIAs: Gay &amp; Lesbian Outrageous, Ridiculous
and Ignorant comment Awards.
THE RESULTS ARE IN
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you to everyone who nominated comments, voted for the finalists, and came along last night to the GLORIAs Awards Night for 2017.
             </p>
             <p>
              Almost 500 people voted and 100 people attended last night's awards.
             </p>
             <p>
              Special thanks to our outrageous host, Kirsty Webeck, and special guest performer, Barbra Blacksheep.
             </p>
             <p>
              The winner of this year's awards, after a seriously raucous boo-off to decide the worst comment of the year, shows the serious side of the GLORIAs. I'm proud we voted to show our support for our friends overseas who are facing the most horrific persecution.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's keep standing together.
             </p>
             <p>
              Kind regards

               I live in Sydney - I will look into it. A man can lose his job if he says anything about gays here in Sydney (never mind if it's true) It was my contention that Gay Marriage was a mask for pedophiles. They have no idea what is comming. Once public comes out of a trance - it will be pitchfork and fire time.

                The guy who wrote the book on gay marriage for Australian marriage equality ordered a chick with dick into a womens prison (first tranny given the right to use a womens toilet in the world - that ended with a MASS AIDS RAPE EVENT and then after the MASS TRANNY AIDS RAPE he got 1 million dollars in payoffs because the warden breached his rights to aids rape more women by disclosing his HIV+ status to other inmates so they could discriminate him and not do AIDS sex with him), done by NOEL CROMPTON HALL, and Rev Fred Nile (child porner - controlled oppositision) asked questions in parliament that he was lied to about the funding of the gender centre that was funded by Christopher Puplick who got order of Australia in the same month the AIDS rapes that occured on his order was covered up. He was found by ICAC and Ombo to be guilty of doing fake gay hate crimes at the NSW Anti-Discrimination board so his anal bumsex partner could pay back 6 grand who owed him, but had to be let off by the pedophile who ran the DPP and the time Nicholas Cowdery.

             that's terry bean's outfit - the pedophile HRC. It's gay and lesbian victory fund pedophile operation runs in Australia too and is connected to Aliefantis's facebook friends. Terry bean disappeared one of his many child rape victims to avoid justice in gay democrat controlled child sex zone of Portland Oregon, after first trying to pay off the victim of his child rape with a civil settlement before disappearing the child and his whole family to get off.

              Strangly enough Hillary gave a speech at Wellley college (where she graduated from) few days ago and took shots at Donald and fake news relating to Pizzagate by saying '..... DNC running child trafficking out of a pizza parlor....ridiculous' 
They are really doubling down! Pushing that HRC running sex ring out of a pizza parlor is begining to sound like a cover up - they don't even have imagination!

                  He has to play ball. Zionist cabal has hijacked US Since the establishment of Federal Reserve in 1910 on Jekyll Island. Woodrow Willson was their first puppet. Trump has to go along and please Israel but he won't leave US behind (he could have proof on Comey). Let's give him till 2018 to see what he does. Compare to the psychpaths and idiots US had since JFK Trump is a blessing (I could be wrong). Again, unpresidented number of pedo-ring busts in 2017. I want to see who he appoints as FBI chief - this will tell us if he is for real in relation to taking on the Pedo/PG.

                    I go back to numbers - 4000+ arrests so far. During Obama - only 400 for the whole of 2014. Let's see what he does. (Putin is corrupt to the core but he is the biggest pedo fighter out there)

                      We abandon bipartisan views, race, creed. Pedophilia is something that cam unite us. Trump maybe corrupt (like all of them) but believe me he is not a child molesting pedo - I can bet my life on it. I could only say that about JFK. What if Trump has the proof on everyone and he is trolling them. We don't know everything. We do know that their secret has been outed - for good.
