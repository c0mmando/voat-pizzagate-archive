&quot;Originally led by the British Secret Intelligence officer, Major John Rawlings, the Tavistock Institute was designed even from the beginning as a coordinating center for the planetary social control using &quot;psychological shock troops&quot; - a term invented by Reese. These shock troops in white laboratory coats branch just like a planetary fan, penetrating various organizations to implement policies considered productive by the strategists of the organization. The Tavistock core is formed by British Secret Intelligence agents, freemasons working with the heads of the psychiatry hydra worldwide to achieve two goals: </p>
<p>(1) A unique world order in which the national states are abolished and there is only one totalitarian control center.</p>
<p>(2) Simultaneously, the psychological control of the world, or to use the term invented by them, &quot;societry&quot; (t.n. free translation: a method of accurate structuring of the social relations). Even the official documents of the Tavistock Institute admit its global orientation towards the global control of people\'s minds.&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding (1), today we see the weeds: Open Borders, Open Societies, Civil Society movements, which we now know were subversive schemes planted in the mid to late 19th Century.</p>
<p>Regarding (2)…Snowflakes that can’t see past their genitalia, False Flags and other political theater, Censorship, DeepState, Mk-Ultra, 24/7 Globalized fake news via MSM.</p>

I encourage independent follow up research, and would appreciate to be updated on findings to update this post. I leave you with a quote from Aldous Huxley, a member of the Tavistock group. &quot;There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>The Early Fabians: “Educate, Agitate, Organise” The Fabian Society is Britain’s oldest political think tank.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fabian Society emerged in 1884 as an off-shoot of the Fellowship of the New Life. The new Society soon attracted some of the most prominent left-wing thinkers of the late Victorian era to their ranks.&quot; 
‘The Society has and continues to be at the forefront of developing political ideas and public policy on the left.’ </p>
<p>Edward Carpenter (29 August 1844 – 28 June 1929) was a founding member of the Fellowship of the New Life and was at the first meeting in 1883. He was also one of the founders of the Fabian Society, the Labour Party and one of the most well-known people of the century. He was an English poet, socialist philosopher, anthologist, and early gay rights activist. He was interested in the main ideas of the Fellowship, including politics, sexual radicalism and the works of Henry Havelock Ellis.[12]</p>
<p>Fellowship of New Life: Founded in 1883, by the Scottish intellectual Thomas Davidson and disbanded in 1898. He mused that pure intelligence would lead to a better and higher society. The Society objective was &quot;The cultivation of a perfect character in each and all.&quot; …transform society by setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow. Many of the Fellowship\'s members advocated pacifism, vegetarianism and simple living, under the influence of Leo Tolstoy\'s ideas.[5] But when some members (<em>like the sexual radical Edward Carpenter</em>), also wanted to become politically involved to aid society\'s transformation, it was decided that a separate society, the Fabian Society, would also be set up. “and although the society was a branch of the Fellowship of the New Life, Thomas Davidson shared no sympathies with Fabianism.”  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellowship_of_the_New_Life">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellowship_of_the_New_Life</a></p>
<p>Havelock Ellis, Lolita, &amp; The Sexual Child (Occult Yorkshire 3)</p>
<p>By Jasun Horsley November 18, 2015 <a href="https://auticulture.wordpress.com/2015/11/18/three-havelock-ellis-lolita-the-sexual-child/">https://auticulture.wordpress.com/2015/11/18/three-havelock-ellis-lolita-the-sexual-child/</a>
Horsley’s blog begins,</p>
<p>“The link between the Fabian Society and the Pedophile Information Exchange, while unmistakable, was also inconclusive. It was necessary to go further back, to the founding Fabians, to get a better sense of the philosophy which my grandfather embraced.”… </p>
<p>Havelock Ellis is attributed with coining the word “homosexual” and was one of the first people in history to show an academic interest in pedophilia. (The term did not become widespread until the 1950s.)[1] This is hardly surprising, since Ellis compiled a six-volume work entitled Studies In The Psychology Of Sex, between 1897 and 1928.</p>
<p>Ellis was reputedly a sexual experimenter as well as a drug user, and allegedly even combined the two (hallucinogens and private group sex sessions). The writings of Ellis were among the key texts that formed the basis for sex education in British colleges and, later, schools. Ellis is sometimes known today as “the father of social psychology.” From Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sexual Research, by Vern L. Bullough (Basic Books, 1995, p. 76):</p>
<p>“To get a sense of how far-reaching Ellis’ influence is—not apart from but congruent with his influence on literature—there was a syllabus in the 1990s at Cornell University called “The Sexual Child,”… Though not mentioned here, Havelock Ellis was included in the course.</p>
<p>Lectures had titles such as “The Child as Sexual Object and Sexual Subject,” “Big Bad Wolves,” “Loving Children,” and “Having Children” (for which one of the readings was Nabokov’s Lolita). English Professor Ellis Hanson, the course instructor, defended the course’s content by stating, “The erotic fascination with children is ubiquitous. One could hardly read a newspaper or turn on a television without feeling obliged to accept, study, and celebrate it.” In his own words, the course was designed to “undermine preconceived notions about what a child is, what sexuality is, and what it means to love or desire a child.” (link)</p>
<p>The bisexual trans man Pat Califa also contributed to the course. In a piece included in the course, Carifa wrote:</p>
<p>“Culturally induced schizophrenia allows parents to make sentimental speeches about the fleeting innocence of childhood and the happiness of years unbroken by carnal lust—and exhaust themselves policing the sex lives of their children. Children are celibate because their parents prevent them from playing with other little kids or adults. . . . They are not innocent; they are ignorant, and that ignorance is deliberately created and maintained by parents. . . Even though many prominent sex researchers have documented the existence of sexual capacity in children (for instance Kinsey verified the occurrence of orgasm in girls and boys at less than six months of age), our society is fanatically determined to deny it.”</p>
<p>And in that simple statement we come full circle of the great lie, that “science” justifies pedophilia to meet the needs of sex starved children and babies, because parents are ignorant by not participating in or allowing child molestation.</p>
<p>(Of course we know that Kinsey did not engage in science as much as he did indulge his own sado-masochism, by paying a Nazi child rapist murderer and other pedophiles for their ongoing study or ‘stats’, then using the data as though it represented the norm of human sexuality because it was healthy and natural for children.  I seriously doubt at this point that radical human sexuality professors care about that and will continue to indoctrinate college students with the great lie).</p>',

            Part of the societal control mechanism by Tavistock involves exploiting cognitive dissonance. The approach called for creating a false political dichotomy (two-party system), in which both parties work toward the globalist agenda, just from slightly different directions (government-controlled versus corporate-controlled). People will select a side (the "party"), and then those same people have a problem believing that "my candidate" ("my favorite actor") could be involved in any kind of evil. The flip side is that they will oppose the other side in knee-jerk fashion. The party-identification (picking of sides) serves to blind us to the truth of the NWO agenda when it involves "our team," and it creates a balance so that no one side gains too much power (always a 50-50 split) as they will always be OPPOSED by the other team. This creates control and prevents major changes by a charismatic leader bent on change (think Trump) so that the progression continues in the intended globalist direction.

             Exactly..and any chance for the American people to live in a united, peaceful AND diverse Country (think Trump), out from under the yoke of the pedophile supporting NWO, must be rigorously opposed by BOTH so called 'sides' (i.e. the lie).  This is where the insanity is undeniable; we now see the cozy friendship of the Bushes and Clintons (and even treasonous behavior by the puppet Obama administration), united against the outcome of the election they lost control of.  That their collusion is so exposed resulted in the panic of the SuperClass/Deepstate, as evidenced by the symptom of 'Fake News' from a MSM that doesn't even try to substantiate their whole cloth fabrications.

              Yes. I connected "Fake News" to pizzagate and predicted a move to mass censorship of the truth (in a Reddit thought piece on the pizzagate subverse on 11/22). My essay was immediately shadow banned, an idea that was totally new to me that day, as the people in the forum were responding that they could not see the essay I posted...even though I could see it. Only later did I realize this technique, in which simply logging out of my account would show that ONLY I could see the post, and I have seen it many-fold since, especially on Twitter. Within hours of my post about the use of the "fake news" meme to censor pizzagate or other inconvenient truths, the pizzagate sub on Reddit was flat out banned (with 33K subscribers)!

              That was the day I realized how big and serious this was. This anecdote is one of the best ways to red pill people (if they generally find you reasonable and stable). This is part of the reason I have dedicated a lot of effort in this domain to documenting the lies/censorship by the media, Twitter, Google, FB, and YT.

            Praises and thanks for the research!  I remember as a mature psychology student in 90-94 looking to continue post grad training  in Clinical Psychology I expressed a wish to enrol with the Tavistock Institute which was then portrayed to us as one of the finest educators in the psychological field and places were much sought after and revered.  However, I was massively berated back then by a tutor (whose name ashamedly eludes me) who was an author of a book that debunked 'false memory syndrome' which he explained had been a term and concept  created by the Tavistock to explain away the increasing numbers of children coming forward with sexual abuse claims that they were remembering from their past.  I remember his very intensive instruction that if I want to use my psychology training to truly help the suffering, I must avoid the Tavistock at all costs.  I did, and  I'm glad.  It's sad that even today The Tavistock is still revered as one of the highest reference authorities for psychological consultation in the U.K.   If only they all knew what we do.

            Remember phrenology? A science invented to justify slavery and the inferiority of blacks. Yes the 1800s were a wonderful time. It seems like bs science papers were created to justify anything. But hey, they fought against tesla real well.

            Adult subjects of Kinsey's research don't seem to be too happy in having been made to have sex as kids.  Men who want to rape kids write science papers justifying raping kids.

            I wish I could upvoat this 1,000 times. Tavistock psychological war machine is pushing this crap in schools, media, entertainment, internet..worldwide creating a new generation of freaks without minds of their own. They've been doing this slowly, methodically and deliberately for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros, Clintons and many more actually have schools/colleges worldwide as well. And with the huge surge on vaccines, (we see you Bill Gates) are they really screwing with the genetic make up of humans? Between vaccines/psychological warfare, more and more people claim they have no gender or gender confusion. It truly is so screwed up.

I agree. Saw a link on drudge about the furry sex fetish movement and how a college was teaching a course in people curious about furry sex and sea with animals. Major newspaper now pushing and promoting eyes wide shut parties. Check the video, they are trying to normalize all things people think is perversion

            I believe that trans men and women deserve respect and are entitled to be treated equally.  What I don't like is sexually confused people pushing their sexual confusion on to parents and children.   Just because a baby can orgasm, does NOT mean we should be helping him/her orgasm.  That is abuse.  Why the hell can't these people understand that?  Victims of abuse do not grow up to say, 'Mummy/daddy just helped me orgasm.  I'm so grateful.'  They don't say that, because if an adult were to do that, it would be an abuse of boundaries.  As parents we teach our children that their bodies are theirs; that no one else has a right to touch them.  That's an important aspect of teaching our children that no one has a right to disrespect them.   "Ignorant' is not the word to use; 'innocent' would be a better word.  And it is right to keep children innocent until they are mature enough to make those decisions and understand the ramifications of those decisions.  The pre-frontal cortex (the rational, executive part) of the brain does not finish developing until the age of 25.  Before that time, young adults do not have the capacity to understand the consequences (for themselves) of their actions.   I'm not saying the age of consent should be 25.  But certainly children don't have the maturity to understand sex and everything it entails.

            Good stuff there, OP.  I'm glad to see the Fabian Society discussed here.  It's an important piece of the puzzle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is Q&amp;A on Tavistock - 
Question: “Simply put. Soros owns Tavistock. Tavistock owns the government. ...”
           </p>
           <p>
            FBIAnon: “Someone is on to something.” (IMO, This means that Soros and Tavistock Institute is wrapped up in Pizzagate as well.)
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been stated on here that "Soros owns Tavistock."  Notice that FBIAnon did not say that Soros owns Tavistock.  S/He implies that there is a relationship. (Tavistock is MI5/MI6.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, it is important to remember that Tavistock Institute and Tavistock Group are two different entities.  (I have seen threads in the past conflating the two.)

             George Webb videos describe his take on the part Soros plays in the big picture of the various rat lines.  Regarding Joe Lewis and Soros, it's not an area I've looked into but will include this here:
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lewis_(British_businessman)">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lewis_(British_businessman)
             </a>
             "After selling the family business in the late 1970s, Lewis moved into currency trading in the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in his move to the Bahamas where he is now a tax exile.[5] In September 1992, Lewis teamed up with George Soros to bet on the pound crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The event, which was dubbed Black Wednesday, made Lewis very wealthy, and some say he made more than Soros.[6][7] Lewis is still an active FX trader.
[8]"
I'd have to look further to see what exactly 'teamed up' means historically; is it literal or just figuratively speaking?  A lot of articles claim they teamed up.  If so, have they collaborated on other 'investments'?

             He does have an interest in Life Sciences.."Lewis’ influence on Florida’s effort to build a life sciences sector extends back to the very origins of the effort — to the vision of bringing a research institution to Florida around which a biotech cluster could form..."

            Fabian Society member David Owen and Jimmy Savile
"...Robert Graves’ buddy William Sargant, who worked at St Thomas’ Hospital from 1948 to the end of his career as head of the department of psychological medicine. In 1962, Sargant found himself a new assistant in one David Owen, a neurology and psychiatric registrar who had only just qualified as a doctor. Two years earlier, Owen had joined the Vauxhall branch of the Labor Party and the Fabian Society.[1] The reason this is relevant is that Owen was allegedly complicit in allowing Jimmy Savile access to the psychiatric hospital Broadmoor, where he (Savile) abused countless patients over a period between 1968 and 2004 (when Savile had use of a personal set of keys to the hospital).
           </p>
           <p>
            According to The Daily Telegraph, Savile’s “involvement at Broadmoor was rubber-stamped in 1974 by Dr. David Owen, now Lord Owen, who was health minister.” Thanks to Owen, Savile “came to be in charge of Broadmoor for a period in the 1980s when he was put in charge of a task force to run the secure hospital.”
           </p>
           <p>
            "In 2014, Kate Lampard carried out an independent review of Savile’s predations within the British National Health Service (NHS), including over forty hospitals. Her report was quoted in The Guardian in 2015: “Savile’s status and influence . . . . was enhanced by the endorsement and encouragement he received from politicians, senior civil servants and NHS managers. His access within NHS hospitals gave Savile the opportunity to commit sexual abuses on a grand scale for nearly 50 years.” (emphasis added)"

            So institutionalized pedophilia was okay for the purposes of government 'research'?  Or was it a privilege due to services rendered or ongoing blackmail?
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking of economics, lunatics, Tavistock, Fabian Society, Great Britian’s pedophiles and world domination…here is what I wanted to explore the other night, when I ran into such an avalanche of info: The Mont Pelerin Society.
           </p>
           <p>
            Citing its lofty reason for existing: “This society would bring together for mutual enlightenment and encouragement the leading figures of classical liberalism.  One of the founding members was Karl Popper, George Soros’ inspiration for his megalomaniac mission to enslave the world.

            The Mont Pelerin Society and its history helps make sense of the what appears now to be a world on the brink of suicide.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example: “Other founders of the Mont Pelerin Society were prominent members of the various Eugenics societies, popular in that era, whose agenda was the race purification and population reduction by means of sterilization, controlled selective breeding and genocide. Sir Antony Fisher, a member of the Fabian Society, founded the Manhattan Institute in 1977 with Friedrich von Hayek. In 1994, Manhattan Institute scholar Charles Murray, co-authored The Bell Curve, a landmark publication advancing the theory of intellectual inferiority of black races. Another founding member of the Mont Pelerin Society was “Ralph Harris, a leader of the British Eugenics Society which had earlier helped draft Hitler’s race laws.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “The Mont Pelerin Society, from the outset, was to be a clandestine agency committed to implementing the ‘Hayekian’ Conservative Revolution. 
“One of the key figures in this effort was Antony Fisher. Born in London in 1915, educated at Eton and Cambridge, Fisher was elected to the Mont Pelerin Society in 1954. The following year, he founded the Institute of Economic Affairs in London, as the first of dozens of front groups for Mont Pelerin that he would help launch. Other IEA founders included von Hayek, who at this point was at the University of Chicago; Ralph Harris, a leader of the British Eugenics Society which had earlier helped draft Hitler’s race laws; Keith Joseph and Allan Walters.”
