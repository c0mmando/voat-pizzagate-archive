            Hunter S Thompson had a compound in Colorado. He is known for being a Satanist, pedophile, Illuminist, etc. He attended Bohemian Grove and was implicated in the Franklin Scandal by Bonacci. He is allegedly the one who filmed child porn and a snuff film for some elite clientele.

              Thompson was definitely a sick man. He Johnny Depp and Jon Cusack were fan boys of these sick elite. They used to attend occult rituals and sex parties. I don't know why he was killed but it wasn't suicide that's for sure.

            John Ramsey married a patsy, beauty pageant winner Miss Virginia who died from ovarian cancer, I believe Patsy was abused as a young girl on the pageant circuit. All here should know it has been written by Cathy O'Brien who saw John Ramsey at the Mackinac Michigan military base when her father took her there to see Robert Byrd. Senator Robert Byrd. To check Cathy's story they went to the manifest list when she claims she saw him as a child. Indeed John Ramsey's name was on the Manifest. Cathy O'Brien was trying to tell her story about MK Ultra and sexual abuse. Cathy saw John at the base long before he married a patsy. Very involved I would say. I would also bet Patsy knew all about it. Maybe it was The Ultimate Christmas sacrifice she would not have followed through on. Some believe Patsy smashed jon benet's skull when she was aiming for John or whoever was harming her. Because that childs skull was smashed from front to back. That part doesn't sound like a ritual at all. John also had child porn in his Amsterdam office, not admissable in a U.S. court.

            Misleading. It's a promotion for a Netflix documentary where people in town are asked what they think as they audition to be in the film. There are no new charges, arrests, facts, or statements. FWIW... nothing against DM, and I've believed a pedo ring was involved for years. So I'd love this to be accurate, but there's nothing in this article.

            Absolute nonsense. JonBenet suffered a massive head injury which was only discovered at her autopsy. She had been hit over the head by a heavy object. She was then strangled while unconscious although the head injury itself would have been fatal eventually. The autopsy also showed that she had consumed raw pineapple not long before she died from the plate of pineapple on the kitchen table.
           </p>
           <p>
            She may have been subject to sexual abuse in the past but there is nothing ritualistic about her death whatsoever. Nothing at all. She was prodded with a piece of train track while unconscious, amateurishly tied up but then lovingly wrapped in a blanket. The chief investigator for many years, James Kolar, has written a book, Foreign Faction, where he all but states outright what really happened: JonBenet and her brother fought over the pineapple, he chased her and hit her over the head with a Maglite and then Patsy covered up the scene and wrote the ransom note in order to make it look like an attempted abduction.

             I don't deny this is a very plausible scenario. But too many coincidental crossovers: Jon Ramseys computer porn; the older sister dying; the creepy family friends etc, for me to think Burke randomly killed her over a pineapple.

              Those crossovers may be true but have no bearing at all on the crime scene. None of them explain the physical evidence obtained from the autopsy. Besides, no-one could have entered the house that evening because the only access was through the basement window which had undisturbed cobwebs across it.

            I'm glad to see this, but the "cheese pizza" angle has been brought up before.  Nothing much is done about it, of course.  I have read that Jonbenet's half sister made claims regarding SRA and John, but I can't find details.

            One think that I noticed about the "knots" which were used on Jon Benet was how they compared to the garrote which has been described and used in other MKULTRA murders of young girls.
See the Belgian case -- and the survivor who discussed seeing a young girl killed in this manner.
Witness which testified to young girl killed by garrotte in her presence - Regina Louf at 43.31 on the video
            <a href="https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/marc-dutroux-monster-belgium/">
             http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/marc-dutroux-monster-belgium/
            </a>
            Note that Regina Louf solves a murder for them in explaining the murder of a young girl whose body was
found showing the very injuries described by Lous - including the garroting which was the manner of death.
Yet, with all of the information that Louf provides, especially in regard to the network of wealthy men (both
businessmen and politicians and criminals) they doubt much of what this primary witness is telling them.
Or, they pretend to doubt.  Later, the MSM in Belgium is used to suggest that the case is limited to Dutroux
and the 6 or more girls he kidnapped and murdered.  No pedophile network.  As the public is swayed by 
this propaganda campaign, they also conduct a campaign to slander Regina Louf and her testimony.
           </p>
           <p>
            But also see Noreen Gosch, mother of Johnny Gosch, who was given photographs of young boys tied
up on beds.  When I saw the "knots" it was very clear they resembled those on JonBenet's body.
And they are serious "knots" not only intended to hold the children down, but to cause damage to their bodies.

            Click on any of the photos where the children are tied and you can view them in two different enlargments.

            As well, John Ramsey had served in the US Navy where he would have become familiar with knots.

            The young son certainly seems to have been showing signs of sexual abuse in some very angry
behavior and emotionalism which was put down to jealousy over the attention his sister received 
from their parents.

            I didn't know he dated Natalie Hollaways mom! I seen the Dr Phil show where Jon Bonet's brother was being interviewed. He's a very strange person and smiles at really inappropriate times. I don't know if it could be because he's been thru a lot and had to always try to stay out of the limelight. Or, if his parents were involved, maybe he lived a life of abuse too. But he was pretty creepy in my opinion.

             One possibility about the young brother -- Burke -- was that he was suffering some effects of Autism syndrome.
But now that I reflect on it, it seems much more likely that he was also being sexually abused.
At the time I was questioning the "knots" I also realized that the father (John Ramsey) had some questionable contacts, including having served in the Navy, I believe, where he would have certainly learned "knots."  Later he was a pilot.

             They were hugely instrumental in uncovering a lot of Catholic Church abuses in Ireland, particularly the recent discovery of mass grave of 800 babies and young children. No coincidence that Wikipedia banned them as a legitimate source since PG emerged I reckon

               It's horrific. And the Irish government just announced that the same nuns (Sisters of Charity) are to be in charge of our new national maternity hospital - like some kind of sick joke. They still haven't even issued an apology for mass grave and refuse to pay €3 million they owe in compensation to victims of other abuses they carried out over the years. Angry doesn't even begin to describe it

            It's good that the media is talking about a child porn ring being involved.  What they won't (or can't) talk about and why investigations appear to hit a brick wall is because of who's involved.  Normal procedure is for the FBI to immediately take over the investigation when a crime against the child of someone working for the military-industrial complex occurs.  That didn't happen. Why was the FBI asked to stand down?  Those orders would have had to come from the very top.

            If you research, it becomes evident pretty quickly that Patsy was not pimping her child out.  It appears that she knew about some prior abuse of Jon Benet but had been told that it had stopped.  What Patsy was guilty of was vicariously living through her child and forgetting about her emotional and physical safety needs.   I believe the father was pimping her out to further his career. But 'the game' went horribly wrong. And when it happened, Patsy knew it was her husband that was responsible.

             I know I read that the father was somehow involved with Lockheed Martin.  I would assume that he was somewhat connected to people with power.

            Absolutely it was a ring and John and Patsy were totally into abuse and torture. My theory: that they were pimping her out and using the dark web to stream torture and sexual molestation. I totally believe John Mark Karr when he says he killed her. I believe he was the one calling the action of what they were going to do with her that night. The garrotting got out of hand and she wound up dead. You can see why Karr feels so guilty .... because he is guilty. It's another case where the police botched things up to cover up brethren. They really have to start screening government postions and law enforcement for allegiance to secret societies. No such thing as serving two masters.

             Dark Web? Streaming? Did you have the internet in 1996? I did. No way could you stream videos back then, hell it took 1-2 minutes to even get a website with pictures loaded.

            It's the national enquirer of Britain. People send their conspiracy theories and wild accusations to that paper because they might actually report it. Especially Americans because there is an immunity to lawsuits if the British rag posts the accusations compared to a US rag. I'm sure on occasion they will get a good story that the lock-step msm refuses to air, just like National Enquirer with the John Edwards scandal, but you have to be smart and presume what you are reading there is garbage until you can absolutely substantiate the story with evidence.

              Forgive me but let's take a well established fraud like 9/11. It was an inside job from start to finish. Why would the Deep State have Abel Danger produce gigatons of evidence pointing to that fact?
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd suspect Abel Danger of disinfo if they did something like try to prove alien reptiles or some type of new directed energy weapon bullshit brought down the towers.
