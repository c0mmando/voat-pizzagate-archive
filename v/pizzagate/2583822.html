            JOHN TESTER, SECRETARY of the Orwell Freemasons, talks to Orwell students Tuesday about the 800 historical documents that he found in a Masonic Lodge desk. The documents, some dating back almost 200 years, trace the history of the Orwell Freemasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            ORWELL — When John Tester, secretary of Masonic Independence Lodge No. 10 in Orwell, sat down at the lodge’s 1864 flip-top desk to do some spring cleaning last May he made an unexpected find — almost 200 years of handwritten history. About 800 documents, written on tri-folded parchment in impeccable condition and neatly tucked into the back of the desk, told the story of the Orwell Freemasons like Tester had never seen it before.
           </p>
           <p>
            He brought the documents — and a lesson in Freemason, town and U.S. history — to Orwell middle school students on Tuesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of the documents were created before 1880 and are petitions to apply for membership to the order.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The Masonic rituals have been unchanged for 700 years,” Tester told the Orwell students gathered at the town hall. “The qualifications for acceptance have always been the same: A man freeborn, of good and worthy standing, who believes in a higher being, whether that be God or Allah or someone else.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Tester recognized the names of prominent families in Orwell like the Bascoms, the Barbers and the Bottums. Roswell Bottum, who wrote his petition in 1817, had been a district court judge in Middlebury as well as Orwell town clerk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some members of Independence Lodge recognized the pencil handwriting on the back of each document, a brief sentence from the last time these papers had been sorted, as belonging  to Julius C. Thomas, whose 91-year-old son still lives in Orwell. Julius Thomas had been the secretary of the fraternity in the early 1920s, and in 1934, he was the first Orwell member to become Grand Master of Vermont.
           </p>
           <p>
            The documents also include correspondence from other lodges in Vermont, discussing the expulsion or suspension of certain members — warnings to Orwell Freemasons not to allow the outcast to simply rejoin the fraternity in a different lodge. Most members were expelled for not paying their dues, which in the early 1800s were 50 cents a year. Others were kicked out for drinking distilled beverages in excess or committing adultery.

              Yes, I did not want to copy the whole thing because it is so long.  The rest is Eye Opening about their past and still doing.  What REALLY scares me is that he is pushing belonging to the Masons to young kids.  And the Girls.  Sicko.  Evil Sicko.

            I've got some edit requests for this posts, please see below. The mindcontrolblackassassins article where you derive many of your claims is very speculative. We'd need especially a legit source for the claim that Pena was a NXIVM sex slave.

            Do you have another source for the claim that the two have been pansexual/bisexual, apart from the photo showing them together?

             Ok. I'll just post MigratoryPatterns thread that makes the same supposition as this one, in his own words, not written by an ex black panther lol, that WASN'T flaired or fucked with.

             I guess I have to put a caveat in there like he did:
            </p>
            <p>
             "So, I guess, I have no independent proof that Pena was associated with NXIVM and I would like some. But her being a member of Skull &amp; Bones is disturbing as is her background. It was enough for me to have my doubts about what her motivation truly was."

              is cautious and tries to make an assessment of the allegation. She clearly states that

               there is no proof

              Do you see the difference? Please also see the comment I wrote earlier.

              The mindcontrolblackassissins blog is sometimes problematic, because it pretends that unproven allegations are facts. If you would like to continue using it as a source, it would be great if you vet the info that is posted there. Just citing the blog as a source is not enough to back up a claim.

              =&gt; We need to be accurate in our research, and point out what is proven, and what is merely speculative.

               I resent you referring to me as a woman. I do not correct shills/trolls who for some reason keep flinging the gender thing at me, but I am not a woman, have never been a woman, and am not planning on crossing over to become a woman.

                   Part of the game is the doxxing of identity. Shills hammer at the unknown variable and calling a man a woman is a strategy. It's why I never outed myself, but I'm fine with cutting down the options of who and what I am to 50% of the world's population.

                     Part of the game is the doxxing of identity. Shills hammer at the unknown variable and calling a man a woman is a strategy. It's why I never outed myself, but I'm fine with cutting down the options of who and what I am to 50% of the world's population.

                    Its because you told a member of this forum that you were quantokitty and kitty was supposedly a woman.

                    Yeah nobody will find you by cutting it down to 50%. I acted like a guy for a couple of months in the beginning. When people made me mad, I’d tell them to suck my dick! 🤣  I outed myself when this crazy feminist chick was going off on me about how terrible men are. I told her off and said I’m not even a man wench!

                     Why do I not remember that? Must be selective memory ... but you think I'd remember someone that actually gave me a compliment!

                    <p>
                     Most time I think it's funny when shills go off in that direction. They should have a shill flower emoji for shills who give the best rant. Or maybe an emoji shill Academy Award for best performance without actually getting so hysterical they run out of breath?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We're all here and I don't see the point in outing gender except to dox someone, but gender is a tactic for getting a rise out of someone ... and that's what shills want. LARPs also and God knows they're around! Me? I just plod along ... trying to keep focused on why I'm here which is
                     <s>
                      to receive flower emoji's
                     </s>
                     ... which is to post about pizzagate and keep pizzagaters informed.

                       Thanks. When you realize that they're winning by getting you upset, it ceases to matter. Eye on the prize ... eye on the prize. And Donkey?  ''She's'' blocked so I don't even know what's been said. The same goes for everyone I've blocked.  I don't hit ''Show''. Once in a while I will just to see if they're still being stupid, but usually? No. Absolutely not. They're not who I'm here for.

               OMG, being in the periphery and a private meeting with the bronfman sisters isn't enough 'evidence'? You want the NXIVM roster before it'll be accepted on VOAT PIZZAGATE. I think you were bored and needed to throw around some weight. Ok, go ahead a pick apart an EX BLACK PANTHERS work, a dude that grew up around ALL of it in some of the roughest cities in california.

             I think you are being a bit bit picky. There is no way I can "Prove" a supposition for this:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Please add a source (a legit source):
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Pena appears to have been a MK ULTRA/MONARCH NXIVM sex slave inside the White House.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Pena was heavily involved in recruiting NXIVM operatives inside the WH and U.S. military..."
            </p>
            <p>
             That would NEGATE it being a CONSPIRACY THEORY and  hypothesis (educated guess) and therefore a fact beyone being able to be proven, because it is proven....
            </p>
            <p>
             Ridiculous, you are asking ME AND THE SOURCE of this material NOT TO THEORIZE about what's actually happening and it's not submittable if I can't prove it.... it's a bit of an anathema to conspiracy THEORY...
            </p>

              - you claim that there was a NXIVM plant in the WH. And yes, a claim like this needs to be proven.
             </p>
             <p>
              And the OP of the blog you linked even alleges that she was a MK Ultra/Monarch sex slave.

              Elaborate? I'm afraid I honestly don't know what you mean.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding NXIVM: You might have read my numerous comments on NXIVM research threads - if we could indeed prove that there was a connection to the WH, that would be huge! But we need evidence.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can always post speculative submissions to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              first, gather more info, and then crosspost to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, if you indicate by your wording that you - or your blog sources - are merely speculating, this would be of great help.
             </p>
             <p>
              Example: 'Did NXIVM have a plant in the WH'? would already indicate that you're not sure, but trying to dig up evidence.
             </p>
             <p>
              While 'NXIVM had a plant in the WH' is a claim that would need proof.
             </p>

               , I agree with think-. We are not the MSM who just throw around Fake News claims with no substantiation. The link you provided does not provide support for these claims any more than you do. jpg's of people together are not sufficient for the bold claims you are asserting. You need to either temper the claims so you don't bit off more than you can chew, move them to the Comment section (where speculation is fine, confining the body of the post to source-linked research only), or post this in
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                v/pizzagatewhatever
               </a>

                You honestly don't know what I mean? You've flaired my last 2 threads, and I've seen more flairs on things than I have in a long time, some without flairs that need them... I mean you're always fair for the most part but what all of a sudden people have problems with solos threads...

                 , IIRC correctly, I PMed you a couple of days ago, and ask for an edit, so that I didn't have to flair your post. (And you've been so kind as to edit.) So I think it's a bit unfair to allege I was 'flair-happy'. I'm always glad when I don't have to flair posts, honestly.

                 Just state clearly what is proven fact, and what is a mere possibiltiy, and it'll be fine. :-)

                 Perhaps the heating up of the Swamp Draining process has made you more prone to loosen your standards for supporting what you post. :-)  That's understandable.

            Are you seriously trying to tie NXIVM with MK Ultra? NXIVM is a wart on a nutsack in comparison.  I do not believe the government would allow NXIVM to reach the levels of Scientology or other organizations utilizing these practices.  I was curious if the Bronfmans were being blackmailed and allowed NXIVM to use their money to avoid collateral being released.   It just not add up why they would tie themselves to this dweeb.

             It's pretty obvious Raniere was WELL VERSED in MK-Ultra technique. Now whether he borrowed that from th internet or if he was invited at the behest of big personalities I do not know, his connections indicate he latter. THICK

             Stop expecting them to fight themselves. We do it or nothing gets done. The entire system is theirs. stop with the Trump and Q bullshit. They aren't going to save in X amount of days, months years. We have to do it. Step one, close your bank accounts. Let me guess, asking too much?

             I got something completely different from this. They tried to infiltrate and failed. Still on the fence with Pence.

            sisters in the WH to talk to Pence.
