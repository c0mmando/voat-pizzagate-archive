<p>-Pitchford talks at length about porn that he enjoys watching, including &quot;camgirl&quot; pornography, in which a host exposes themself to a live feed and takes requests and financial tips from consumers. Pitchford explained that he was &quot;a consumer of this content.&quot; He confirmed that he copied a specific video &quot;to this memory stick&quot; to, as he describes it, &quot;work out the method&quot; of how a camgirl host faked the act of female ejaculation. (Be warned: he describes how the video looks in particularly graphic detail.)</p>
<p>&quot;I realized, this is not a sex worker,&quot; Pitchford said on the show. &quot;This is a fucking magician.&quot; Pitchford, for those unaware, has a vested interest in the field of magicians and owns the magic-focused Genii Magazine.</p>
<p>&quot;This was before I learned I should probably have password-protected memory sticks,&quot; Pitchford says, before admitting that he had indeed left a USB flash drive at a Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament restaurant. &quot;Some kid, an employee of Medieval Times, discovered this memory stick, took it home... and discovered secrets of my company and future games in development, and also discovered the pornography. It was \'barely legal\' porn. This girl\'s handle was \'Only 18.\'&quot; The USB flash drive was returned to Gearbox, Pitchford says, in exchange for &quot;swag&quot; and video games.</p>

<p>Randall S. &quot;Randy&quot; Pitchford II (born April 21, 1971) is one of the founders of video game developer Gearbox Software and currently the CEO and president of the company.</p>
<p>Pitchford\'s father worked within the United States intelligence system, device high-technology equipment for other agents. His father has brought home one of the computers he had developed in 1975, when Pitchford was five years old, and later gave Pitchford his own computer, build by his father, when Pitchford was seven.</p>
<p>He further succeeded in gaining membership into The Magic Castle in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Pitchford was also interested in magic, as he was the great-nephew of Richard Valentine Pitchford, a magician known by his stage name Cardini.</p>
<p>Magic huh. Magic Castle too? Where Neil Patrick Harris and Gary Goddard hang out? Naw.</p>

            Hey pizzagaters, any updates on those "imminent pizzagate arrests"? :)) I can't wait to see "Podesta scurrying into those tunnels", for "famous suicides" and for "Clinton and cronies" to be arrested for being part of an elite satanic child raping/sacrificing ring operating in places like CPP. =))

            Interesting indeed. The relationship between 'magic' and sexual deviancy is real. Both require an unwilling participant that is manipulated.

             These slight of hand tricksters are doing nothing but obfuscating. They are liars, cheats, con-men and that must eat at their hearts and tempt them to take these "skills" even farther working or doing 'jobs' for these elitists that would love to have a hypnotized mk subject do anything they want.

              great eye. I ruminated on creating a thread about it and just said no to myself lol I'm glad you picked it up. Sometimes I wonder if people get and understand my direction and flow into the psychological and extremely esoteric and get sick and tired of me hammering away on these bigger connections that are more or less so big they are simply just left in conspiracy dreamland, too damn scary and too big to touch.This thread is a confirmation that I'm making some sense to someone and I thank you for that.

               No problem. I think the truth is becoming more known, pizzagate was a good red pill. But we need more. This will help contribute. We just need a big 'break' and a lead.

                Regarding the ludicrous pizzagate conspiracy theory, not that no pedohpille arrests have been made in general. WTF
