<p><strong>Today\'s Blind Items - The Real List</strong></p>
<p>Several months ago I wrote a blind item which I revealed stating that this back in the day A list teen actor had been compromised. The always in need of cash to support his Hugh Hefner wannabe lifestyle, the former actor took a very large payment in return for always staying silent. What he was allowed to do and even encouraged to do was keep up the noise and pretend he was going to do a huge expose. With the help of his benefactors he did compile a list of absolute nobodies. Although they were nobodies, they did do damage to kids growing up. There is one actor they messed up so badly that he didn\'t work for almost two decades. He basically earned a living from his wife\'s salary and the gay porn he did. It is only this year that he finally is doing legit mainstream work again and is also getting his revenge against the A list producer from that movie who looked the other way. That producer made tens of millions from a very hit pay cable show which later became a movie while tossing away the actor as a cost of doing business.</p>
<p>Anyway, it shows that nobodies cause hurt and pain and even lead people to commit suicide. What they don\'t have is the money to make things right for the people that are hurt. Because the former teen actor won\'t come through with the goods, I will.</p>
<p>I have shared a few via blind item, but over the past few weeks I have spoken to someone who knows the names. The person I spoke to, knew that the former teen actor was full of crap with his list because the person I spoke to has first hand knowledge of the biggest abusers of that time. Their relative was at the center of it all.</p>
<h1>1 - This horror director was A+ list. Whether you were male or female, you were going to have to have sex with him for any part other than a lead. If you were out of your teens, don\'t even bother to apply. If you were over 18, then you didn\'t make the cut for many of his earlier movies.</h1>
<h1>2 - This foreign born horror director has hundreds of audition tapes which mainly involve young boys and girls undressing while he asks them a series of sexual questions. He always asks basically the same questions and always tries to get them undressed. His most recent wife left him recently when she discovered the trove. He wrote her a massive check to keep her from going to the authorities. In that trove are at least five or six A+ listers who were unknowns back when they were abused.</h1>
<h1>3 - This permanent A list mostly movie director raped a series of teen boys who were auditioning for a a movie starring 95% men. His check to keep everything quiet was by far the largest.</h1>

            For the #2 blind item I strongly feel that it can be Lars von Trier. Recently with the allegations from Bjork but also Nicholas Winding Refn's wife was also harassed. Since this it seems that a lot of allegations and people have come forward about his actions. I do not like to assume that someone's art reflects their life. However, with films like Nymphomaniac and Antichrist (which he wrote and directed) I cannot help but analyze and think about them (the films) and him as a person differently after everything that has come to light.

            Why does it matter what Feldman does or doesn't say? If you have info, give it and don't worry about riddles, and guess who games, just give the info. If you are afraid of the consequences, then why would you consider revealing the truth if Feldman doesn't? If you aren't worried, what are you waitng for?

            This cult abuses, compromises, and then co-opts its members. You might start out as a victim, but you're soon forced to do things that compromise you, and then they own you. You're trapped. As the Eagles sang in "Hotel California":

             I was in hospital once and the young girl in the bed next to me played that song over and over and over again on a little CD player. She had set the player to repeat obviously. She wouldn't speak but a nurse told me she tried to commit suicide. I always wondered what happened to her and i always related that song to her. Very sad.

            He really shot the moon with the "I need 10 million dollars to make a documentary!" shtick. 10 million  dollars? A piece a paper and a pen costs less than 1. Not saying it's that simple, but 10 million dollars, Corey? Really?

            A while back someone tweeted, "Why isn't Corey Feldman getting the financial support that he should be getting?" 
I tweeted, "Maybe with the recent news of Hugh Heffner being CIA/MKULTRA &amp; the tunnels &amp; Feldman being a part of the Hef family for the last 25 years, that THAT was extremely concerning. Maybe that's why people were a little apprehensive."
I went into Feldman's page weeks later and discovered I was BLOCKED!
He literally fed Haim to these, "vultures" .....and Feldman has NEVER been capable of being a friend.

             Losing. Bro, its lost, do you not get the point of this blind? Feldman is intentionally and willingly withholding information and has done so for over 30 years. Unless you want to dispute Enty's blind, which you're entitled to do, I guess he has been wrong and has thrown in misleading blinds and information at times. I'm not quite sure why its so hard to grasp, Feldman's a mess.

              what the fuck is your problem asshole? i'm not your fucking bro! i didn't know because i did not give a fuck about him because i have never ONCE seen him act. IN ANYTHING. i do not consider him to be consequential to begin with, so he could very well be doing any number of things and the only thing i could say is that i never even heard of him before now. why don't you fuck off, you fucking pedophilia super hero. i mean don't let me distract you, obviously you are single handedly saving the fucking day! shit what a cunt you are.

            It took awhile for people to see Corey for what he is, I tried and most here are Red pilled
           </p>
           <p>
            When I think of all those people giving the sleazeball money, I can't help think we have one uphill battle to open people's eyes if we don't get some solid help
           </p>
           <p>
            People hear didnt want to hear it
           </p>
           <p>
            I got 4 likes when I made a post is Corey Feldman a shill, Grant you, it was in whatever but there have been posts there with much greater likes
           </p>
           <p>
            So those that didnt believe, can you explain why,  how you started to think well maybe, and what finally convinced you
           </p>
           <p>
            Migratory and Carmencita have explain
           </p>
           <p>
            Can others chime in?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's important, so I can figure a solid plan to Red pill, and even then, what we can do, what to look for
           </p>
           <p>
            Why, how, when
           </p>
           <p>
            Because if a character like Feldman can blind you, do we even have a chance?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does being him being a victim have anything to do with It?
           </p>
           <p>
            His relationship with Corey Haim?
           </p>
           <p>
            Haims mother, Feldmans mother?

             I spent a lot of my time trying to convince good people not to send him money. It made me despise Cory.  He fooled so many. It must have been a good gauge for those POS to see how many normies were still asleep. It also made me realise of the uphill battle we had in front of us.

               I agree 100%. I don't trust him at all! I believe he was molested as a child and I feel sorry that happened but I think he BECAME one of them or a FINDER. When he was asking for that money to make a movie, all I could think about was how bad he was acting and how sick I felt after.  When his wife made that YouTube video (when the donations started to slow down) I felt the same about her.  She was not believable either. I can't believe people fell for it. A total con job.

             i just was not that familiar with either Haim, nor feldman, nor do i give one solitary fuck about them or their careers to be honest, so i didn't have much of a backstory to go on. i just thought maybe he would spill the beans. for me there's nothing more than that.

             For some strange reason people like Jackson had such a brainwashed fan base that any criticism of him is stifled with deafening fad cadence, like an invisible cloak, the same vapor trail Feldman has subsisted from like a parasite for 30 years.

               This is the question I have too. I understand non-Voaters, non-red pillers have no fucking clue about fucking anything, but when people on Voat start questioning shit, I lose patience.

                the red pill is an elephant or orca pill compared to a "horse pill"

               <p>
                and it does come back up sometimes

               <p>
                I think the good people of voat don't want to accuse without solid proof
               </p>
               <p>
                its hard for people who have tried to think the good of people then all the bad, to enter an arena such as we have
               </p>
               <p>
                people are watching, people are listening, we don't want to fuck up now do we?

               <p>
                I'm not always right and not ashamed to admit it

               <p>
                who here can say the same?

               <p>
                even CDAN have admitted they not always right

               <p>
                I go by my gut when it's yammering, a lot of people don't have that

               <p>
                guess sometimes red pilling at home is the hardest, and this is our home of sorts

                just wish we would get a little help on some solid shit, this guesswork is for the birds

             It has everything to do with it... Although my gut feeling always said BIG RED FLAG here when looking at Feldman, my brain said, don't trust your gut feeling, since he has been abused, you must pity him.
            </p>

             But then, people can be victims/survivors

              and
             </em>
             a**holes at the same time. I think this is what most people (even me at times) don't realize and what might be important telling them.

                 Most people have gut feeling, but also most ignore it. And sometimes I'm surprised when I think someone is fishy and others can't imagine why.

                  Migratory patterns gets pissed off at anyone who disagrees with her. She blocked me instead of proving her point when I didn't agree with something she wrote. She's actually calmed down a lot in the past few weeks because she was called out on that heavily, by syrazie as well as others. It's too bad she gets so upset and screams shill so easily because she does a lot of good work.

                   Well, I always try to hint that there might be some other big Hollywood names going down in the near future....as a kind of pre-redpilling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And am hinting as well that the music industry is worse than they might have thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That the real bad stuff re: pedophilia in Hollywood still needs to come out in the open. I recommend watching 'An Open Secret'....
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I feel we kind of have to respect that others might be reluctant to accept the truth. It surely is emotionally overwhelming (in a negative sense). 
It takes a lot of time and it takes mental strength to digest these infos.

            Blind Items Revealed #37
December 14, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            She was a momager. She was always around her daughter. She was not an absentee parent at all. The thing is though, she had two issues. One was her husband who wanted more money so they needed to work their daughter more and the other issue was that to get more work for the daughter, she had to let her "rehearse" and "read for parts" with producers. The mom was more than willing, not only to appease her husband but also because she loved being on sets and basking in the glow of fame from her daughter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her daughter had been acting from a very young age, but was not really molested or assaulted until she was about seven. She got a big break that year. She had been recommended by an A+ list director/producer who had seen her for a screen test. Uh huh. He had been consulted because of an interest in an upcoming television project. The A+ lister had been involved in a similar type project, but not for television.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, the producer of the television show loved what he saw and told the mom he needed to spend some time alone with the girl to make sure she could handle the rigors of the episode. Two hours later he brought her back. One of the actresses in the episode who literally has played basically the same character for every episode of television she has been on for the past 30 years had tried to tell the mom what would happen if she let her daughter go with the producer. The mom told the actress to mind her own business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fast forward a couple of years. Another producer. Another recommendation. Who did it come from? That A+ lister again. It was a project in his sphere even though he was not involved on a daily basis. This time it was a movie. For the very short amount of time the movie was being filmed, the nine year old girl was repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped. The mom let it happen. She pretended to not notice the men taking her daughter to their trailers or would tell others that the men wanted to go over lines or play video games. She had a never ending list of excuses. There was an actress on the set who had bit parts in the franchise. She never worked again after that movie because of what she saw. She said she could never work in an industry that would allow that to a little girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was shortly after filming wrapped that the girl began to cry out for help and was reluctant to ever be alone with anyone. She began to self harm even at that young age. Her family was no help. The mom wanted the fame and the dad needed the money. The dad had no idea though about the assaults. When he did find out, he blamed the mother and the daughter. He killed them both before killing himself.

            The franchise mentioned is Land Before Time so A+ must be Spielberg.
This makes me so sick.

            The first project was Twilight Zone - Spielberg did the movie.
Makes you wonder what Drew knows...

Yep, when she was 7, she would have been in Twilight Zone, the television series. Then just before she died, she was in Jaws-The Revenge. That would have been when she was 9 years old. This would have been a "project in his sphere".

             When the lead said something about a double murder/suicide, it had to be in reference to the "Ducky Incident" (the character voiced by that girl just before she died). Her death was shortly before Land Before Time was released.

             I remember being a small child during that. Maybe now she'll finally be avenged.

              The  movies that come up when searching these people's names: The Devil's Advocate, 8mm (snuff film), Neon Demon, Lost Boys, The Outsiders...  We can pretty much say once and for all that the movies these people are filming are about topics they are VERY familiar with!

            Blind Items Revealed #40
           </p>
           <p>
            November 9, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in the mid-80's was peak child molesting time in Hollywood. There was no internet. There were very very few mobile phones. Children came to the set where they were left alone by their parents. For the next 8 hours they were subject to every kind of horrible thing you can imagine. Drugs were commonplace. They were used to try and get the kids to not be so hysterical when being assaulted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Producers loved casting shows with kids and tweens. If someone pitched a show that involved a handful of tweens with a dozen tween extras per week, it would get a green light. Even if the show was going to suck, and everyone knew it was going to suck, if you got the right pedo at a studio he would say yes just to come for the casting and taping of the pilot. As sad as it is to say, there were a lot of parents who told their kids to go off with the nice man in the suit and do what he says. It was a sick sick time.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was just past the mid 80's when a producer came up with the idea of a tween show that not only would feature a rotating cast of extras, but would make the studio a bunch of money because they would film quickly and not hire any adults. Further, the faster they filmed, the more time they would have to molest all the kids that would be hanging around.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the first day, it was the worst place on earth if you were a kid. The studio where the show was filmed also had several other shows being filmed there, most of which featured lots of children. Executives would drive over to Hollywood right before lunch and would stay at the studio for several hours each day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, on this particular show, there was a special guest star. A very special guest star. Still not a tween, everyone knew who she was. Executives flocked to the studio that day to see her. She was first molested when she was 5 or 6 and had continued to be molested throughout her hit movies and also on a previous show.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the stars of the show who has spent her life bouncing in and out of rehab because of what she saw, and who was actually nominated for awards from the show, described the atmosphere that day.
           </p>
           <p>
            "A bunch of f**king pigs. I had just turned 12 or 13. I was the same age as the actress coming in. Maybe a little older. We had been shooting for months and I was old news. They knew I would do what they wanted, but they always wanted someone new. This was someone new and someone they all knew. They had it set up like a peep show almost. She had finished shooting that morning and they brought her out on a stage. The stage was used most of the time for a game show that was taped there. That game show is still on today. I can't watch it knowing what happened to her there. They brought her out and the front four rows of this theatre were filled with guys who were already rubbing themselves. The girl was wearing a bikini. The show took place around a beach just so they could make these girls wear next to nothing. They had her walk around under the lights. The lights were focused on her and she couldn't really see out to the audience. She was squinting. It must have been blinding for her. They had her walk back and forth. Then they had her start dancing. All of these guys were doing what another star at that same studio got busted for. This went on for about 20 minutes. Then three of the guys took her to a different area of the studio."
           </p>
           <p>
            The actress didn't see what happened, but about 45 minutes later, one of those three guys came running out and needed a set medic. Apparently they had inserted something inside the girl and things were bad. The medic came and the ambulance came. The parents of the girl were told some crap story. That crap story ended up killing the girl because the parents believed the executives. Two weeks later, the show finished shooting six episodes all at once and then everyone was sent on their way forever. No one wanted the kids around or any witnesses to what happened.

              It is horrible that is for sure.  It is about as disgusting and  slimy as it gets.  This and the Heather Blind have got me down too.  I want all of it to come out and for everyone to know how dirty and despicable and vile Feldman and Spielberg really are.  I want their whole facade taken down.  I want their masks pulled down.

              It is difficult. Hey, where did I read that story about the director that describes the shoes he was wearing as a coercive tool? These are the stories our worst nightmares are made of, believe me, some of this shit shakes me to the core, things I know I'll never recover from, that in the end only propels my motivation further to make it change.

            We all knew Feldman was compromised. We all said it, and we all tried to talk ourselves out of thinking it because we want to see a win; we want to see justice. Im so glad this came out because it means our eyes and hearts and minds are still working well. Stay vigilant.

            Feldman has been paid ... and is being paid, but not for his silence. Feldman has been a handler and in on this from the beginning. He sold out his friend and been playing vampire in sucking what's left of Haim being raped to keep his own fake persoa alive.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know what people are not getting. From day one, the shill Feldman has stated that he TOLD ALL in that 1993 tape with the LAPD. So finally the tape is released, and he didn't TELL ALL. He named NOTHING BURGERS!!!! Even back then!!! Don't you get it? He went to the LAPD to head of Corey Haim from going and actually naming the people responsible! He probably convinced Haim that he'd take the bullet, but there was no bullet because it was all a staged hoax to get Haim to stay quiet. And after the trip? He could tell HIS FRIEND (RIGHT) Haim that see? The police don't care because they're not doing anything!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            And don't forget that Feldman did that to protect SHEEN and MICHAEL JACKSON. Jackson was who the LAPD was after, but the shill Feldman LIED and told the police he didn't know anything about Jackson. Really? When Haim was his bf and Haim told Meyer, a producer that Sheen and Jackson abused him?

            I don't know what it is with people not seeing through Feldman. HE'S A SHILL and a HANDLER. He SOLD OUT AND BETRAYED his best friend and is still making money off of it and using it to garner legitimacy!

              Cory never fooled me. I didn't trust him from the beginning although I followed his Twitter to see what would happen. When he asked for all that money my suspicious were validated. I unfollowed him and turned my back on him in DISGUST.  He is one of them! VILE

              Yes. But they're gradually coming around and still not getting the entire picture.

             I totally believe you and agree with everything you said.   At first I did not see the light because I admit, I just did not want to.  I could not face that someone could be that vile and evil.  Then slowly I came around but even just hinting at his stabbing Haim in the back got me down voats. But when he came out with the idea of collecting money for his Bogus Tell All Movie, I knew he was a Shill and No Friend of Haim.  I felt either he would never make that movie or fill it with lies.   Yes, he was paid off and so was and is Haim's mother.  The are Both Guilty.

             <p>
              One of my most UpVoated comment is one in support of Feldman. I didn't want to believe it either. Somebody here redpilled me. Don't remember who, but they gave me the links to his tweets in support of Killary and calling pizzagate a bunch of lies meant to deceive and to that Corey's Angels video from his birthday. I woke up and have never looked back and now everything suddenly became clear.
             </p>
             <p>
              Haim should have run in the other direction from Feldman. And Haim's mother ... no words ... I have no words for a mother who could do that to her own son.

                Good point. And it was all to keep Haim out of it and not in any shape to go to the cops.

                  Are you talking about Haim? I know how Feldman tried to get rid of the suppliers he owed money to. Those are the names he gave the LAPD. He probably owed a whole bunch of shit to those Nothing Burgers, but he didn't want to work it off by performing lewd sex acts so he turned them into the LAPD instead of the Big Taco Bell Burgers he was working for and that were running the cabal.

                    Depends on who it is. We pizzagaters will know, but those that haven't been redpilled will have to be convinced. Plus it depends on the star. Some don't have credibility because they're so screwed up by what happened to them. I'm so ready to support the one that does come forward. Waiting for it to happen so that these big names can start going to jail.

               I think she went off the rails the minute she took him there and looked the other way and allowed them to rape her child.  After that it was too late.  She was hooked.  She loved the money more  than she loved her son.  She is still on the payroll.  I don't know how people like her and Feldman sleep at night.  I really don't. I have had sleepless nights many times reading reports and stories on here about what has been done to children.  The fact that they are or were stars makes no difference.  How parents can just sell off their children......I just don't know, I have no answers for this.  It is beyond sad.

                 Would not be surprised.  Whatever it takes is what they do.  They are the scrapings from the bottom of the barrel.  These studio heads certainly would be looking for parents of kids that have problems and are already weakened.  A head start of sorts. Scumbags looking for Scumbags.

                It is. And, yes, the stories I read affect me, too. Those poor kids. You think they're so lucky, but they're not. They have no protector ... no one with a moral compass that will tell these predators, "NO!" and pack up and leave. And Elijah Wood said he avoided it by his mother refusing to let him go to those PedoWood parties so it's certainly not impossible.

                Haim was passed around and Feldman did nothing. His mother did nothing. Horrible More than horrible. I can't process someone not caring enough to drag him out of that environment of predation.

Neither of them have discussed it in a long time because of the other co-star she is really close to now. He would freak if he found out about it."

              Looking forward to the thread where we can one day talk about how TWO of Ashton's ex-girlfriend's have died in mysterious circumstances.

              Speaking of...knowing what we all now know, think
              <strong>
               Brittany Murphy
              </strong>
              was a part of/found out about and was going to spill on, Pedowood? We all know she was deliberately killed, but how and why has never been really fully discussed.

               I met someone once at a prayer group. He was deeply involved in the occult for a long time and was trying to get out. He told me that Brittany Murphy was heavy into satanism and was still alive. Apparently she is living somewhere incognito in rural Canada and hooks young people into the occult. Also, Kutcher and Sheen are huge satanists as well (shocker) 
  He had quite a few very strange looking tattoos and explained that they all involved the occult, and that his soul could leave his body through them as a sort of portal. He said that is a huge signal to other people.
    He also said that a lot of lyrics from pop songs are directly from the devil. He knew one young girl who began playing with a ouija board at a young age, which introduced her to that world and she had direct conversations with demons. One of them gave her lyrics to a song, which she entered into a competition, won first place, and gave the lyrics/song to the singer Kesha, Crazy stuff I know.

             Happy New Year
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            2017 was a year of a lot of change. After months of fighting of DDOS attacks, staying on WordPress was just not a possibility. Going back to Blogger and letting the people at Google fight off all the attacks turned out to be a much better option.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was a year where, those of you have been reading for years and telling your friends what kind of scum are trolling through Hollywood were vindicated. I don't see how 2018 will be any different in exposing the worst of the worst. One of the great things about this coming to light is more people feel safe coming forward and sharing the stories of things that happened on sets or they experienced themselves. I** think 2018 will have bigger names taking bigger falls and people getting jail time.**

               Someone I had to think of - unfortunately forgot his name - is the director who did "The Driver" with Ryan Gosling like three or four years ago, it won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival, and the year after, he shot a grossly violent movie, also starring Gosling. (Gosling = Mickey Mouse club, together with Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears).
              </p>
              <p>
               This attraction to violence (applies to both the director and to Gosling) always made me wonder what happened in their lives. I vaguely remember an interview with both of them, and both of them seemed to have watched horror movies at a very young age, the director literally seems to have been obsessed with it.
              </p>
              <p>
               (On a side note, "The Driver" is a shitty film and I couldn't understand why it won the Golden Palm, lol).

             Blind Item #7
            </p>
            <p>
             Apparently the marriage of this former A list teen mostly movie actor is on the rocks because he can't stop trying to hit on women who are all over his social media now. I wonder how this all fits in with his current campaign. I'm sure his wife would love knowing about the woman he hooked up with last week. Don't even get me started on the the women a close family member is having sex with only wanted to help and now are being used.

             Doesn't Enty usually refer to Corey as A-? It kind of makes sense but who is the close relative? I like the Ashton guess better - but I don't think Enty would refer to him as a former A list teen mostly movie actor, so maybe that isn't the right guess either.

             Corey's wife wants a green card. I doubt that she cares what he is doing.

             Ya know, I never really looked at it that way, but you're right. If Freddy wasn't a straight male it wouldn't matter at all. He was/is still a monster

             I guess I never analyzed the elm st movies that in depth, above and beyond the transparent fact that freddies character exemplifies the type of people we write about here, but Ill bet that's 100% true.

            I pointed out that Feldman was compromised long ago and got down-voted into oblivion. He got his "shut up money". It's so obvious. Then he started begging for money to make a movie?? He trying to profit off of people's stupidity. Apparently he liked getting molested.

             It still is to a degree. I've always loathed the turd but I have empathy for his illness. I sat on the fence and watched many climb either side but always knew he has been holding something back.

             His programming is too  outwardly evident for him to be anything other than the mess he is, along with his constant, panging conscience, or what's left of it.

              When I say shit is gonna happen, it happens. When I tell you someone is a shill, they turn out to be a shill. Try and keep up. The pedophilia in Hollywood is a jewish thing and all roads lead back to Israel---BUT I never brought that up. YOU did.

               Everything does lead back to Israel. We can all admit that there are Jews that are complicit, that much is evident. But people like you seem to make the same callous mistake of lumping everyone into the same category. Way too many prominent researchers above and beyond your dirty ass have gone to great lengths to show that it is a PAGAN CULT hiding within ALL religion that is pulling the strings and they just happened to realize that they can use a particular demographic to help stem their own persecution indefinitely and use them as fall guys any time they choose. People like you only ebb that on like full on southern redneck retards, my god why do you choose to so arrogantly fill such a stereotypical role? Hasn't all this constant criticism helped you want to find out why or are you comfortable in your shitty diaper?

                First of all, I could care less if you judge me. I am who I am and I'm not apologizing for it. I've arrived where I am based on life experience and scientific facts.

               <p>
                The work done here at Pizzagate is valuable and I try not to associate myself too much with it because I know I am a controversial person, but I will drop little nuggets here and there. I've sent messages to many contributors(real ones, not a little showboating thief pussy like you) over here for help looking into things that I think could lead somewhere. You attack me like a little butt hurt kike and try to derail the thread all because I have linked jews to being sexual predators and degenerates. PROVABLE TIME &amp; AGAIN. Now, I will address some very troubling things from you and I hope everyone associated with this sub takes fucking heed of your ass from this day forth:

                 Way too many prominent researchers above and beyond your dirty ass have gone to great lengths to show that it is a PAGAN CULT hiding within ALL religion that is pulling the strings and they just happened to realize that they can use a particular demographic to help stem their own persecution indefinitely and use them as fall guys any time they choose

               <p>
                Oh of course!! Its never the fuckin jews. You're making excuses. Its very clear.

               <p>
                and there it is, - you fucking goddamn yankee fuck kike piece of dogshit. Us southern folk are smarter than little cocksuckers like you and always have been. You aint done shit and jump around using others work. Your little ass would set the fuck down and shut the fuck up around a man like me.

            Victor Salva was born in Martinez, CA. So not him. But he is a disgusting creep who needs to be blacklisted from ever making any form of entertainment. I was the only one outside the theatre at Jeepers Creepers 3 boycoting it. No one cared.

              Very scary is correct, especially if the context is Victor Salva projecting his inner monster onto screen.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said, the JC series can be seen as a fictional and (albeit highly) exaggerated biography of sorts. Victor Salva literally preys on the helpless and young.
