             I think and know that talking about Child Fucking in the USA is BIG, and needs to be discussed, its at the core of USA Politics  and Hollywood owned and ran by Team AIPAC.

             That said, "WHERES THE BEEF?"
            </p>
            <p>
             When anybody with a brain looks into 'pizzagate' what you find is that CIA took over wikileaks salted some emails with pizza, about 10 out of 300,000 emails, then hijacked or created an instatram acccount on comet-pizza and put some stupid photos. That's the Beef right?
            </p>
            <h1>
             Pizzagate is ran by CIA/MOSSAD to put TRUMP in office and destroy Hillary, ok they won, but like here on VOAT nobody will allow the real child-fucking discussion to happen, which is how the FBI since 1930s compromises usa politicians with child snuff videos.

              Where's your evidence? How do you know that the CIA took over wikileaks and planted some emails? How would they go about doing that in the first place? What would they even hope to accomplish by doing this? Furthermore, that instagram account predates pizzagate by a few years. Unless the CIA has future-predicting powers, I highly doubt that they'd be able to see this far ahead.

              I'm sorry, but all this amounts to is meaningless conjecture.

               Wikileaks was co-opted by CIA back in October, anything on computers can be fabricated, dated, and photo-shopped, if you don't understand this, then you don't understand how computers work. CIA released the podesta emails, this is well documented, they only had to salt a dozen with pizza talk, and place some questionable child photos and comments on instagram,
...
This is why CIA(TRUMP) is desperate to get ROMONEY (MORMON-NSA) into the TRUMP gov, so that that trump can OWN the NSA, at this point it doesn't matter too many white-hats in the NSA like Snowden have let the cat out of the bat.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now they're trying to shut #PizzaGate down, but it has taken a life of its own, it has gone viral, it was supposed to have been shutdown after the Trump win, but the NSA who hates the CIA will not let this story die, think of the war as UTAH vs DC
              </p>
              <p>
               NSA is UTAH, and CIA is DC

               Who is they? Who is we? be specific in your question.
              </p>
              <p>
               I can tell you what the people will do think V for Vendetta, the GOV is a mixed match, army, navy, fbi, cia, everyone of those guys will kill each other cuz their all armed to the teeth, once the USA goes bankrupt and all these pigs don't get a paycheck any more, then they have to crawl home to main-street where they will be eaten and skinned alive
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               They had their power since  1911, they turned the USA into a cattle ranch where children were fucked killed, bled and eaten. Now its a new day for the next bully on the block to take power.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again all eyes I want to answer your question, but please don't talk like a 'bot' ask a specific question I will answer.
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Get through what you seem to be an intelligent person.
PizzaGate is controlled oppostion by CIA to destroy clinton by innuendo, ok they won, Trump won, AIPAC won, Israel won
              </p>
              <p>
               A recurring theme here is the 'children' but the real child fucking and killing is ran by FBI-AIPAC since 1960's and earlier, and nobody with a straight face can say we saved the children, until the DC swamp of child fuckers is gone. That means all FBI, CIA, AIPAC, MOSSAD, and MOST DC politicians, COPS all must be locked up and drawn and quartered in the public.
              </p>
              <p>
               At best this scenario will require pitch forks from the public.
              </p>

               Peaceful? Ok How do you explain to the people ( the cattle ) that they have been in the Matrix since 1930's that their only purpose is blood, organs, that their children are just sex toys for the elite, and now Trump is in, and everybody going to come out of the 80 year coma, and forgive all

                After an election that just showed how anti establishment the US is right now why would the elites/agencies want to incite more distrust for the government?  Unless this is a direct attack on the democrat party I don't see what this group would gain from such an act, especially if they would be indicting themselves

                 Also note that NSA CIA FBI all hate each other, DHS all are fucking each other with leaks.

                 What you are going to see is these teams kill each other to get total power.

                 CIA is wiki, NSA is tech, DHS is AIPAC, FBI is AIPAC, NSA has the data, CIA has the wet-ops, DHS has the fema-camps, ...
