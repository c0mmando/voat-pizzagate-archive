           <p>
            Guys, we're following up and adding findings / researching members over at the thread from yesterday re the SOBIB members list doc.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's leads galore and we've started listing members by state. A little research into a person brings up great info and will let us see patterns.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can lend a hand, even 15 mins to research one person and post a paragraph, it would be amazing. Thread -

             This is great.  Now we can do some real searching in many states.  None of us live in or near dC.  I will definitely work on leads in my state.  I'm near the Capitol city

              Thanks GWW, good to hear you'll be real-searching, you're one of the best :)
             </p>
             <p>
              And yes, isn't it really great. It gives us wide geographical scope as you say, and plenty to go on. Good luck and keep in touch!

            He who blackmails first wins.  The whole thing is about blackmail.  Think how easy it is, when you have a MK sex drones to follow and target anyone.  At some point they will get you if you are out and about.  Even if they have to drug you.  The local "secret order" probably has the resources to 'target" a local up and coming politican with ease.  And then bam - they own you.  Want to get a leg up and not be messed with?  You are "one of us now".  And that's how it works.  It's all in the cards, right?

             The reason for groups like this is to get everyone in a room and do something reprehensible together, thereby binding everyone together in their evil deeds.

            Yes this is the same guy. I posted about him yesterday. GreT work for your first post. It helps if you use illegal instead of alien people are confused right now about the misinformation on aliens. Also helps to refer to them as illegal child trafficking victims because that is what they are. They were not prostitutes they are young girls possibly boys being used by Rich powerful men.

              No problem. You can take it down and repost it. Yes Language has changed a lot and when someone says Aliens they don't think of immigrants anymore. Also the way they like to blame victims is by saying they were young prostitutes. They are young trafficked children is who they are. Your post is very important he is a main player in the SOBIB and was federal judge.
