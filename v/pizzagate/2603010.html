<p>[IS] MELANIA IS HINTING AT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AT ZARA[?]</p>
<p>So Melania\'s &quot;I really don\'t care&quot; jacket is a product made by ZARA. If you guys didn\'t know, which I didn\'t either, Zara is the world\'s largest Fashion Retailer. And the CEO Ortega is the world\'s 3rd Most Richest Man. So how come people haven\'t even heard of Zara or Ortega?</p>

            Lots of freemason symbolism in the pintrest link, including the kid with his feet on the basketball doing a freemason pyramid with his thumbs, the girl doing one eye symbol with the paddle on her face with CC on her shirt, and others. Freemasons rule all business and are the biggest kidfuckers on the planet. All major business is a front for illegal activities. All.

            He "retired" on the 18th of May. Not the 20th to coincide with the EO

           </p>
           <p>
            EO is only good for US citizens. This guy is Spanish. Has no Jurisdiction over his assets outside of US. IXD1 is not a US stock.
           </p>
           <p>
            However... I will say those images with ping pong, pizza and what not def are pedo related.

              Lol it certainly is scary. The clothing shop network is the name of a brownstoning scheme that Jeffery Epstein and a fashion designer lady perpetrate against us politicians and other high level people.
             </p>
             <p>
              Brownstoning is getting video or proof of crimes to hold over ones head to gain power over them.

            People seriously wondering if Melania is Q is proof that the dumbass is alive and well in the mentality of these Q followers. You guys make it too easy for the deceivers as you are willing to believe anything no matter how outrageous. Once you start believing the myth that Trump is secretly fighting child trafficking then anything becomes possible. I know that me posting this is going to make me real popular here so be sure to upvoat me.

             But I didn't think the fact that Trump is fighting child trafficking was a secret at all.  There have been more child trafficking and child exploitation arrests under the Trump administration than in Obama's two terms. In fact, Trump addressed the child trafficking issue, in relation to immigrant children, on camera in a meeting with his cabinet members just yesterday:

             As for those who follow Q, each to his own.  Frankly, I am amazed at the amount of Q Anon counter-coverage of late. To me, it defies logic that so much attention would be given to a mere LARP.  Yet, I personally don't care who
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/s/he">
              s/he
             </a>
             is, or even whether he/she/they is/ are contrived.
            </p>
            <p>
             To me, the beauty of the Q phenomenon is not about Q at all, but rather, the awakening of a collective group of citizens coming from all walks of life seeking the common goals of Truth, Justice and Freedom through collaborative, selfless and tenacious research.

              I used to be one of you, around the time of the 2016 election. Believe me, I am on the side that Q professes to be on, which is why I was such a sucker to keep following Q even though I knew the tales being told were too good to be true. It was me that made myself a perfect pasty for a state sponsored Psyop. But then Syria happened. I'm very passionate about Syria and I knew what was really happening there. And then I happened to read what Q said about the US attack in Syria. Oh noes. Q is suddenly exposed as a huge fucking liar, but you have to be in touch with reality on the ground to know it.  And then of coarse they said letter it was the fake Q telling all those lies, so it's all good. Listen to the real Q, Goyim. But the real reason I'm off of Q is because of Trump himself, who is a million miles away from being the deep state secret destroyer that Q makes him out to be.  So no, I don't think I'll be joining you any time soon.  If I want fairy tales, I'll go somewhere else to get them.

            Hi,
           </p>
           <p>
            This is pretty ridiculous.
           </p>
           <p>
            Armancio Ortega is 82 years old.  He announced his retirement in 2011 as the link you used showed in its very first sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            So let's look at the sequence.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             2011 74-year old Ortega announces his retirement and names his successor.
            </p>
            <p>
             2017 81 year old Ortega retires.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That's it that's the sequence.  None of this was affected by any American.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             he's doing pretty bad, financially
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Do you ever read what you link to ?   I hope I do so financially bad one day.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Ortega's net worth fell in lockstep, declining 6% to $68 billion
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So this theory about Ortega is just silly.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it gets flat out ridiculous when you apply it to Melania's message.
           </p>
           <p>
            So her message about human trafficking, is "I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?"
           </p>
           <p>
            OMG.  I just clicked on the PIZZAGATE Pictures.    This is flat out lunacy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "numerous Pizzagate looking pictures" are because ZARA sell clothes.  They sell clothes to adults and to children and these pictures are pictures of kid wearing those clothes and there's nothing sexual about it at all.  And if you think these pictures are sexual, there's something off with you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow.

             Yea, on points 1 &amp; 2 you are right to be skeptical, and I agree "he's doing pretty bad financially" is poor phrasing given the context. In fact, I had similar thoughts.
            </p>
            <p>
             But when you consider Melanie Trump's history as a fashion model and her impeccable taste in clothing, for her to wear a $39  jacket  to visit a holding facility for immigrant children, (the majority of whom are known to be trafficked by coyotes) with THOSE particular words emblazoned on the jacket (printed by the company, incidentally), it is not too big of a stretch to ponder a symbolic or coded meaning intended for a specific audience.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then to discover the company who made the clothing has a history of operating sweat shops, it is not without reason to say there is enough potential link for further research.  (Hence the word, "potential," twice in the heading.)
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the pics,  I don't find them especially alarming, either -- they just seem to have a focus on the kids more so than the clothes, but meh, waddiknow about today's kids' fashion marketing strategy?
            </p>
            <p>
             So if you're not sure yet, that's okay.  I'm not entirely, either.  Nevertheless, interest is piqued.  Dig or don't; fine by me.

              When i saw the words on the coat and how much it cost i had a fleeting thought of how thoughtful, she isn't going in there with a $25k christian dior gown on and a shit ton of diamonds and then i thought well most of the kids might not understand it because can they read English yet?

            Great post, Mammy! Love how the media is trying to spin it as Melania commenting on their marriage, all while stupidly becoming Trump's Red Pill delivery service, yet again. ROFLMA  I am giving this a "Potential Lead" flair to encourage investigation of Ortega and Co.

            We try to always include primary sources here, not just pics of them or videos based on them, so researchers can vet everything for themselves, and because our massive hoard of documentation of things is unique on the Internet and a place researchers come back to make connections and dig over and over again. That's why editing important material into the body of your post, not just leaving it in Comments, is so important. Comments aren't searchable on SearchVoat.co. :-)

            You can also right-click each picture individually, save to your device, and then upload them to an image host like imgs.fyi or catbox.moe, then paste in the resulting jpg url the host will create for you. If you want to add an image of the whole 8chan post for easy viewing in addition to the direct url to it, you can take a screenshot and upload that to the image host and paste in the url, like

               Ha.  Yes I caught the symbolism of the white hat for the Macron visit, but did not know about the other incidents.  I detect a smirk in her eye now and then, too.  Not so much the mouth, but then she is very poised and would have control of facial expression.  Just sometimes I see a smirk in her eyes and I think, hell yea, she's one of us for sure.

              Oretega is also the name of a brand of tacos. These people use food items as code words in wikileaks, and since the above mentions human tracking, it was my first thought. I did not mention the Jacket in my response.

               No they don't.   The food code list connected to pizzagate has no basis whatsoever.   And it doesn't matter whatsoever if it shows up in wikileaks.

               She wore a coat with a message.   Most folks would focus on the message of the coat, they would go to the Coat was made by Zara, a company started by a guy named Ortega.  Ortega is a brand of tacos.  Tacos are mentioned in wikileaks. What are we talking about again?

               There's no real thread here.  It's just connect the dots.  Our brains love to connect the dots, but that doesn't mean there's any actual connections between them.   It's a cognitive glitch we are share, but it actually leads away from real analysis.
