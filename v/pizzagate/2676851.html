<p>Pizzagate is about decoding the symbolism so we are no longer fooled.  After watching this, I am fairly certain shoes are another Masonic/luciferian symbol. Especially, in the vid, when you see a state dinner, in Israel, where Israel serves Japan dessert in a shoe. That seems disrespectful especially because the Japanese will not wear their shoes in any their house or any house as a sign of respect. Is dessert served in a shoe a sign of high disrespect? Intimidation? With strong cannabalism overtures?
After seeing this video I feel differently toward mr. Hanks and wonder if he is a cruel handler? Idk, but I\'m very suspicious.</p>',

            ; Big Fish when leaving the town of Spectre (aka ghost)a  little girl, in love with adult-man, takes his shoes and throws them on the power line, so he can't leave. 
The little girl who laments her crush is leaving, is also the old lady witch who tells the main character how he will die. 
They f' with her timeline. b/c ageless is modern progressive thinking? Like the finale of Twilight : to end the love triangle carried through 3 movies a werewolf marries his lover's baby, so the rest of the werewolves don't EAT the baby.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shoes on power line normally movie symbol of tenement project housing, "the projects" but here the exact opposite: depiction of picket fence cult (  my 90's teen existential crisis all about death by the tragically mundane suburban experience, where safety = boring = death. Totally bought in to the culture war during teen years)
           </p>
           <p>
            The town of Spectre, so safe &amp; boring that poetry can't be written...
 because art requires suffering and starvation,
 says the people living in the mansion 
that want buy your soul.

            could the red shoes symbolize how at a ritual killing blood covers their shoes?

             I think the red shoes are both used to terrorize, by making shoes out of the leather of these ritually killed children. A small pair to terrorize the child (who has witnessed other red-shoe-clad children killed...the happy faces of these red-shoes kids seem evidence of such knowledge) and an adult pair for the victimizer. A calling card to other luciferians into such deviant behaviour. so, yes I agree....it is symbolic of the blood on their hands and feet.

            There is a restaurant in DC with the same name as the restaurant that threw Sarah Sanders and family out of it. The DC one serves French fries in a red shoe if I can remember correctly.

            I’ve always believed the red shoes were used to camouflage blood on thier feet during rituals......Pedo Tom Hanks has a fascination with taking pictures of shoes on his twitter page....also if you think of it, sometimes when people are snatched or in an accident they are knocked out of thier shoes.....Hanks does gloves also...I saw one where he placed the shoe on a fence and in the back ground children were playing...he’s a creep!

            Here is a link to a red shoes sculpture at a college that looks like hot dogs with mustard. Hot dogs equal boys and red shoes supposedly are made of children's skin.

            Podesta's art of children in a pool doesn't look like they have blood on their hands and feet but instead dirt. Does these child images depict children that have been hunted, caught, sodomized and are ready to be tortured and killed in the pool? You have to wonder if these billionaire's islands have pools?

             Again with the misdirecting "conspiracy theory" about Paul McCartney dying in a car crash in 66.
            </p>
            <p>
             The real Paul was killed in June 1964 (likely on the solstice) along with the other three Beatles and were never seen again after their arrival in New Zealand. They were replaced by doubles who had been posing as them since at least October 1963.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Paul is Dead theory is classic deception to make people compare fake Paul with himself.

               That's what the PID theory is for, so people investigating look no further. If you want to see two different groups of Beatles, just watch the 1964 NME awards show then after that watch the 1965 NME awards show.

              There's so much now available online on this. Even more so than when I first began looking over two years ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also bought the book Billy's Back, condensed version of Memoirs of Billy Shears, which I am convinced was written by Sir Paul himself, whose real name is William Shepard (not Billy Shears, which was the name chosen for the Sgt. Pepper character). It is a tell all (the book).
             </p>
             <p>
              William 'Bill' Shepard is a Scottish session musician, and British MI6 was involved in James Paul McCartney's replacement after his death in 1966 in a car accident. He was riding with a girl named Donna (Lady Madonna). Etc. etc. Sailor Sam was a journalist paid off by certain sources to not write the story. William could not wait to get out on his own (Blackbird lyrics).
             </p>
             <p>
              Some of their songs, like PBack Writer were written by Paul's friend and roadie Mal Evans, murdered by police years ago (see Wikipedia). This is all a very deep rabbit hole, and it takes a lot to convince me of these type things. Fascinating, the whole story.
             </p>
             <p>

              Yes, you may hate them, but they all were traumatized by what happened, especially John. Sir Paul however, comes off as quite unlikable, in the book and in real life.

               Actually, I don't hate them.  They were my favorite band for years, I know all the lyrics, all the albums.  I just cannot believe that they got away with it.  A huge huge lie (but not surprising now that I find out that most things are lies).
It all makes sense too, why John could not stand him.  I have issues with him too now.
               <br/>
               I am very interested in this story and am going to search out the Memoirs book.
But the Blackbird lyrics was written after the death....I'm not sure I get that.
Unfortunately, it doesn't take much to convince me these days, of the lies and yes, it's fascinating.
I saw an interview with the remaining 3 and George said something to the fact that, "and then you came along".  Faul looked a bit uncomfortable with that one.
Have you read Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon.....another huuuuge eye opener.  RIP Dave McGowan
Do you have any links to where I can find out more about this?  Don't mean to put you to work btw.

                Couldn't not tell you this. Below is something new. It follows along the same line as "Memoirs." I'm just now watching it...it's well done, wouldn't be surprised if Sir Paul is behind this as well. Seems very accurate and gives the full story and timeline.

                I totally understand about the love / hate thing with them. I'm the same way. The replacement was supposed to be temporary but it dragged on.
               </p>
               <p>
                Blackbird lyrics speak of Sir Paul wanting out of the Beatles, it's from the White Album you may recall.
               </p>
               <p>
                I've only read bits and pieces of McGowan's work, I have a facebook friend who was in the middle of all that (Laurel Canyon) and knew all the players, his dad is Red Rodney (Wikipedia). He dodges, somewhat, my questions about Laurel Canyon and CIA but the guy is big into JFK killing.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yeah John hated him. The book "Memoirs" explains a lot. You could start with the condensed "Billy's Back." That's what I did. A lot of occult overtone but Sir Paul downplays it (unsurprisingly). The book explains all the lyrics, it's fascinating as you might imagine.
               </p>
               <p>
                I tell people start with The Winged Beatle, I am fairly certain Sir Paul was behind the production, lots of historical documentation and rare stuff.

                Then move on to interviews about it. Here's one of the latest, with Mike Williams who is quite knowledgeable.

                The Rotten Apple series is good as well. (Put 'Paul' in the search and google it, the series is long.)

                Yeah the truth was revealed to her after the marriage, and she's been attacked ever since because she wanted out. She's signed N/D's and fears for her life and for good reason. The best and most revealing interview is the one with Billy Bush if you can find it. He's gross, and I used to like him (Faul).

              That is my fan club. I said something about their God Q so they follow me around and down vote me. If i'm not careful the Q Bully Mod Patrol tries to arrest me.

               why do you suppose trump wrote in his book that his family was from Sweden when theyre actually from Germany?  same reason he married the jewess ivana, married maples who "studies kabblah and keeps kosher", all his kids married jews, and he grew up in a jewish neighborhood etc etc?  because trump is a FILTHY DEGENERATE CRYPTO KIKE?

             Been a while since I've been here, but I've been thinking about the red shoes. Today, looking at the paintings (very disturbing) I was reminded of an old Elvis Costello song. In the context of what's going on and recent Q drops, the lyrics are equally disturbing. Bargains with fallen angels, red shoes, etc...  "Oh, I used to be disgusted
Now I try to be amused
But since their wings have got rusted
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes
But when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older
Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes"

              Nice cinnextion! Elvis Costello is another creepy person. I'm too tired to look it up right now, but I'm certain he performed at a HRC rally.
