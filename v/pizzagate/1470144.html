            Figures there's been a hinky white van hanging out in our neighborhood for the past couple weeks. He has a trail vehicle,definitely with him..he rides about 5 min to 10 min behind him and he randomly parks. I do know of some law enforcement that is legit good and I think I'm tipping them off. I'm not sure I trust the police at all at this time. Just the police I do know and trust, they are aware and probably good county guys got it. I have seen police from the county around, and I'm working on plates, they're predictable and I'm reporting em once I have that information. Once I labeled it definitely hinky, I talked to neighbors. And we know who belongs. They don't belong. That's the good of talking and getting to know neighbors.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't have to study criminal justice to know they're most definitely casing out not only the neighborhood, but they make sure to be along the school bus route as well. I've just started seeing the van again. I'm one of THOSE neighbors, and watch my street. Now that other ones know they're working on pics too. I trust my gut, and think if it looks hinky it probably is 1000 x magnified. Given this it's worth it to report it, if they're ok..I guess they'll explain that, not my problem. Just looking out for the neighborhood.

            That is a heavy duty van.. Looks like a dodge sprinter or similar. Those are 1 ton trucks, it would t sag at all. You would never know that it was lined with cement board.
