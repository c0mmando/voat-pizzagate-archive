<p>Kudos to all who signed the petition!! The times, they are-a-changin\'!! :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A former US judge who gave a man convicted of child pornography just four days in jail, even though he possessed dozens of disgusting photos, including ones of a baby being raped, and who sentenced a man for a sexual assault to just six months in prison, has been fired from his new job as a school tennis coach following an outcry from pupils and parents.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Aaron Persky, who was ousted as a judge last year over his lenient sentencing of Stanford University student Brock Turner, had been hired over the summer to coach girls at Lynbrook High School in San Jose, California.</strong></p>

<p>The district schools authority said it terminated his employment this week after more than 1,200 people signed a petition condemning the appointment as “reprehensible”. Protests had also been planned.</p>

Campaigners said Turner\'s sentence helped to perpetuate a “culture of impunity for high-status perpetrators of sexual assault or domestic violence”.</h1>

<p>Incidentally <em>cough</em>, retired judge LaDoris Hazzard Cordell, who defends Persky in the video above, was assistant dean at Stanford Law School, and Stanford\'s vice provost, which might explain why she stands by a judge who gave a lenient sentence to a Stanford student.</p>
<p>She got numerous awards for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaDoris_Cordell">\'breaking race and gender barriers\'</a>. LOL.</p>
<p>I think \'hypocrite\' would be an appropriate term here. And her case is a friendly reminder that appointing female judges won\'t necessarily change things for the better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We just witnessed a huge moment in history. ...the people of Santa Clara County, California voted to recall Judge Aaron Persky. This result is an enormous victory for women’s rights, victims of sexual assault and American democracy. By recalling Persky, we’re sending a message that the fight to recall rape culture is real and the people will not be ignored.&quot; (Melissa Kirtley)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prosecutors had called a six-year jail term for the student, a star of the elite university\'s swimming team, after he was convicted of sexually assaulting and attempting to rape an unconscious woman on campus in 2015.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But the judge sentenced him to six months, of which he served only three. He ruled Turner bore “less moral culpability” because he was drunk at the time of the attack and said prison would have “a severe impact on him”.</strong></p>
<p>The case provoked widespread outrage after the survivor’s victim impact statement, which spoke of her lasting trauma, was published online and went viral.</p>
<p>The petition objecting to Mr Persky’s appointment as tennis coach accused the school of “explicitly and ignorantly allowing rape culture to ensue”. <strong>It said his role would mean schoolgirls being supervised by man who allowed sexual assault to be “brushed under the rug”.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a statement released to local media on Tuesday, Fremont Union High School District said the former judge was “a qualified applicant for the position” and was hired after completing a background check.</p>
<p>But the following day, amid a growing backlash, it said: “Mr Persky\'s employment with the district as the junior varsity girls tennis coach has ended. We believe this outcome is in the best interest of our students and school community.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A former Lynbrook student told NBC News the appointment was “a pretty big oversight”.</p>
<p>The row came a week after the woman attacked by Turner publicly revealed her identity for the first time. Chanel Miller, who was referred to in court papers as Emily Doe, is to release a memoir which her publisher said would “change the way we think about sexual assault forever”.</p>

             I agree. Why do men coach girls anyhow? What is up with that? I had some male coaches in school. They weren't creeps as far as I know, they just got stuck having to help out in girl's phys ed class. But when they go seeking it out, it's fishy to me. Like male gynecologists. Ugh.

            Don't know if anybody caught this.  Read in Hawaii news article.   Sounds super shady.  Likely the guy was connected to a major ring that went into the courts so they buried it.   This one seems really screwed up and the guy looks like MK type. They looked at his "medical records" and decided on probation.  Check out the article:

             LIHUE — A Waimea man facing child pornography charges has reached a plea bargain that will allow him to avoid spending any more time in jail.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jeffery Jack, 34, pleaded no contest Tuesday to one felony count of promoting child abuse in the third degree.
            </p>
            <p>
             The crime punishable by up to five years in jail and a $10,000 fine, but according to the plea bargain, county prosecutors agreed to seek only probation, due to confidential information contained in Jack’s medical records.
            </p>
            <p>
             Proceedings against Jack were put on hold earlier this year, when Fifth Circuit Judge Kathleen Watanabe granted his attorney’s request for a mental health assessment to be performed by a panel of psychiatrists, who eventually concluded he was fit to stand trial.
            </p>
            <p>
             The findings of the three-panel medical examination report, like all medical records, are confidential, but some detail contained in the report apparently prompted prosecutors to afford him some degree of leniency.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to charging documents, Jack originally faced two felony counts — one for each of the two devices he allegedly owned containing child porn.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Fifth Circuit grand jury indicted Jack in February 2018 on two counts of second-degree promoting child abuse, carrying maximum 10-year jail sentences, for possession of an iPhone and a Samsung tablet, each holding “thirty or more images” of child pornography, at least one of which was of a minor under the age of 12.
            </p>
            <p>
             One charge was dropped and another reduced in exchange for Jack’s no contest plea.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prosecutors also agreed to “recommend that the defendant serve no jail due to information received in the HRS Chapter 704 examination,” according to one of the stipulations in the plea bargain Jack signed Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p>
             The plea agreement also requires Jack to complete a “psychosexual examination,” register as a sex offender for the rest of his life and pay restitution in an amount to be determined later.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is scheduled to be sentenced to probation in December.
            </p>
            <p>
             The judge presiding over his case granted Jack permission on Tuesday to visit family on the mainland while he waits for his court date.

              I used to like Dylan as a kid. He learned everything from 'The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack (2000).', and that is when I started to put the pieces together. They Stole Americana, sold it back to us, and then Dylan turned on his own crowd and went electric. Sad, but true. Ramblin Jack was a folk hero of mine too. Now I realize he was a Hollywood funded POC the entire time.

                Growing up in the South, Elvis was still R&amp;R on the jukebox in the early 80s. King of the Elves he was. He also made it a regular habit to transport drugs/possible other on private and commercial flights. He collected badges, so he would ask any law enforcer available for an extra for his collection.

             Yeah, well he nearly right on that one. Two drunk kids make out and being drunk means she hasn't consented, but it was deemed no excuse for him? Only problem in that case was that Turner served any time at all.

              Asshole. He assaulted her when she was drunk, and raped her with his fingers. Two grad students who witnessed the scene had to pull him off of her, one of the guys broke down crying when he talked to the police because of what he had seen.

               God.......hope he goes to a regular prison and is in general population . Prisoners seem to have more of an aversion to child rape than the justice system.

               19 year old Brock Turner and the college age "victim" were making out heavily at the party as well as drinking.
              </p>
              <p>
               They decided to go outside for some privacy to fuck.
              </p>
              <p>
               While the girl was lying on her back making out, she passed out.
              </p>
              <p>
               To viciously attempt to incarcerste a young man for 10 years for something of this nature is just another indication of how fucked up this country's mores have become.

                Too bad that almost nobody buys your narrative. Time's up for rape apologists like you.
