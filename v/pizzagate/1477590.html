            As a Christian, and not one of the screwed up, brainwashed, worship the preacher, new age kind, #Jesus works or #revelations. It's my opinion that this entire scandal is interconnected with satanic cult activity that has origins all the way back to the Bible. My 2 cents.

            They know about this contingency plan and they have a lot of time to plan ahead. It could be a pizzagate suicide to go that route.

             Did try but...will try again.   The point is in a movement/marketing so to speak to increase awareness it makes sense to start with a reliable base.   The reliable base in this case, at least for the time being, is Christians.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are not going to get a more 'all-in' base to believe this crap is real and that it is going on than orthodox Christians.  We already get it.  We know that evil is real.  We already understand and believe that this satanism stuff is real too and so it will take very little convincing to alert other Christians to what is going on.  The problem is too many Christians are still following the mainstream media narrative.  I spoke with some people again this week who had not even HEARD of pizzagate.   As more Christians start hashtagging #Jesus and getting woke and spreading the word, esp. to people in their circles, you will see an upswing in people in general  --- from all backgrounds -- looking into this.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a Christian, I in NO WAY feel offended by the use of #Jesus and nor do I feel that my Lord and Savior Jesus is offended by this, since it is sin and evil and sickness which He came to die and pay for.  THis is what Jesus died for. Christians understand that.  Far from finding it offensive, most will understand that this is exactly the kind of cause/work they should be supporting since it supports Jesus' way of caring for 'the least of these'  ie - the most vulnerable  -- which is at the heart of Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
             As mentioned, if Twitter decides to ban the hashtag #Jesus -- they will have a firestorm like no other on their hands.  Remember when Christians went bananas last Christmas with Starbucks over a little red cup?
            </p>
            <p>
             Times that by 1000.
            </p>
            <p>
             Christians will go utterly bonkers (though not violently so, which is more than I can say for some Muslims, sorry) if #Jesus get banned.    This would add more attention and awareness to our cause.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hope this helps.

              Thank you. Unfortunately you're only answering two of the four questions, and even if I fully agree with your points (which I only partially do), I'm mostly worried about the second question that you're not addressing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm fairly sure this attempt would significantly distract and alienate non-believers, divide the community itself, and water down its image, so to speak, that is currently based on critical, evidence-based thinking. If I, as a non-believer, think that you as a Christian believe in something stupid, and that your beliefs in said something rely on no factual evidence whatsoever (which non-believers, by definition, do think), and I discover Pizzagate closely tied with your belief, then I may suspect that it's also something stupid and people believe it without any factual evidence.

               Your point is well-taken.
              </p>
              <p>
               People who are prone to believing that Christianity or religion in general means that a person cannot be 'scientific' or 'evidentiary' in their thinking will likely be put off by this.
              </p>
              <p>
               But is that more the fault of these religious communities than anything else -- for allowing that false belief to pervade the culture for so long?  I say it is.  Far from being anti-evidence or anti-science, for example, Christianity is actually the religion
               <em>
                from which
               </em>
               the scientific method sprang.   Most of the early Western scientients, were  Christian also.  Christian thinkers also codified Greek logic and Roman law and used them as the basis for the Magna Carta among other things.
              </p>
              <p>
               Somehow the cultural narrative has been skewed to downplay those facts.  That is the fault of our education system and of people who have allowed the truth to be sublimated.
              </p>
              <p>
               But you are correct:  many people nowadays believe that in order to be 'religious' one must be de facto anti-science.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know if that factual error can be corrected right now.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would hope, at least, if nonreligious people are claiming to be pro-science that  they would be open to ALL evidence therefore, regardless of whom it is coming from.  That would be the most scientific position to take.  And open-minded: Be open to the truth no matter what.  Perhaps we could take that angle:  be open minded.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, alas, you are quite right that many may not adopt even a truly scientific mindset about this and might reject it out of hand because it is associated with a religious source.
              </p>
              <p>
               (Although I believe there is a logical error embedded in that way of thinking, I do think it could happen.)
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know how to get around that right now.   This is just an immediate 'finger in the dyke' fix to try and buy us more time to raise just a little bit more awareness-- before they come for us on voat too.   The CTR ppl are already here in force distillling the threads into nonsensical and barren fake 'leads'.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a good chance this forum will be fully useless and corrupted within a few weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't have a better idea at the moment.   Sometimes just got to make do with what we have...  All the best.

            I think something Biblical would have a memorable effect, but maybe something involving a Saint would be better. Just my opinion, though. I'll follow you guys and girls.

            I agree, I agree, I agree. This is also a good strategy to simply get the word out anyway. To use others' platforms as soapboxes. It would be a great strategy to #islam for a few weeks, to #buddha for a few, #jesus, etc. Try to hit large crowds who already exist and are prone to believing in a-bit-of-a-stretch-reasoning. The hard part would be to NOT come off like Black Lives Matter (or more importantly not be compromised). When BLM first started they ended up pissing everyone off around them (business owners, etc) because of their tactics (Soros' Open Society and MoveOn, etc). Not to mention the FBI provocateurs.

            I think it might be wiser to post it under #islam because it is the protected religion right now.  Christianity is currently the only religion that you are allowed to hate and discriminate against.

             Do both #jesus and #islam. That way we will be able to see which one makes it. If we are just looking for a rally point the extra characters won't be that important.

             I would say you're playing with fire on that one.
            </p>
            <p>
             Censoring Jesus has a direct reference to the book of revelation. Aggravating Christians has a less violent track record than the group you propose.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also if they are Censoring Jesus, referred to as the way the TRUTH and the light, your censorship is on display.
            </p>
            <p>
             The number of ppl using #Jesus should be higher now.

                I agree, but you know what? The s might make it a unique rallying point. We are trying to reveal many new ideas.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't like these suggestions of connecting this with the Bible and its related concepts. The Bible and such things should be kept pure. Remember that a lot of shills will also start using these same hash tags, and it offends me that they would.

            the point is people who would otherwise help would skip right past things with such specifically religious overtones, especially considering that they appear christian specific. if you want to peg it to that nonsense thats on you but you will lose favor especially with those of us who have been trod upon by those who use that kind of language

             Then call it #christmas.  #Jesus is a bad idea then they get to ban two things that they hate at the same time, Christianity and pizzagate.

              No.  #Jesus is a great idea precisely because the chances of it being banned are very, very, very slim.   As I said most Americans would lose their pie over Twitter banning this hashtag.
             </p>
             <p>
              Americans are ferociously protective of First Amendment rights.  And many are religious.  People would go nuts and this would garner even more attention.

            ah no, this would isolate a bunch of people who balk at religious terms because of the historical ties between various religions and the pedo problem.

             AFAIK the pedo problem in religion is limited to the beliefs deriving from the Hadith and the Talmud, it doesn't affect the core Islamic beliefs or the Judeo-Christian ethos.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is also the advantage that theism is the Achilles heel of the civil system and there is a dichotomy between theism and satanism.

             said, try to ban #Jesus or #Muhammad and people will lose their shit. I think it's a good plan.

              yeah but by that same token a significant number of people wont bother with things under that tag because of the things theyd had to deal with because 'jesus' or 'muhammad' ... its entirely your call but if thats how it goes expect a rapid fall in support

               Using religious hashtags doesn't mean that we have to abandon the usual ones like #PizzaGate. Just go with whatever works for your target audience.

             THIS is the most brilliant plan that has been come up with so far.  Why?  Because if we can post all our info under this IT WILL STAND A CHANCE OF GETTING OUT TO THE PUBLIC FOR LONGER than if we use any other hashtag.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Twitter starts banning something named #Jesus people are going to lose their shit.   Especially with it being right before Christmas.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is the one good chance we've got to keep this going in the public eye for longer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Voat is loaded down with shills at this point and many crap posts so that the good ones are buried.   The mods are either too busy or too....?  to bring us where we need to be as a group.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is an excellent idea and I'M ON TOP OF IT.  Will go over their asap.

                  That's not negativity that's being a realist.  This investigation is not based on any religion nor to push one.  I don't want the christian world to be enlightened I want everyone to see.

                   I want everyone to see also.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But we've got to be practical as well.  And we've got to start somewhere decent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There are a TON of Christians in the U.S. And they are very interconnected.  I don't know if you are American or not? If you are, you should have a decent sense of what I'm talking about. A boatload of Christians in the States went bananas over a red Starbucks cup last year, for example.  Raised a big stink.  Over a Starbucks cup.  Why?  Because Starbucks had 'changed its design' to be 'less Christmas-y' and to be plain and 'holiday' looking rather than 'Christmas looking'.   Christians just went bananas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If we can harness even a 1/10 of that energy for something SOOOOO much more worthwhile...that gets a lot of buzz/momentum going.  Other folks will then pick up on that along the way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, by using #Jesus versus #mohommed, we have the added bonus of not running the risk of triggering a jihad or spate of terror attacks.  You start throwing Mohommed's name around loosely and you are gonna have some Muslims not just mad -- but trigger-happy.  Christians do not GENERALLY have that kind of track record or respond that kind of way when Jesus' name is used.  I truly don't think the Lord minds His name being used for this...this is what He is all about...helping the broken and vulnerable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So...with #Jesus, you get all the enthusiasm, none of the violence.   Word gets out.  Fans out to others, atheists, Jews, agnostics, etc. hopefully later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If you don't have a better idea, perhaps...let's move on from this and get to twitter and start saving some babies now!  Cheers.
