            It's weird but I doubt it's anything beyond a a clever distraction. Check out the tags in the page source:
           </p>
           <pre><code>    &lt;meta property="og:video:tag" content="mkultra"&gt;
    &lt;meta property="og:video:tag" content="mk ultra"&gt;
    &lt;meta property="og:video:tag" content="mind control"&gt;

            I'd be very very
            <em>
             very
            </em>
            disappointed if this was real. Using such stupid and obvious tags, a fucking caeser cipher, twitter, and unlisted Youtube videos? Really? Is that what we're up against? I doubt it. This is creepy and plays into what people investigating pizzagate would expect, and just cryptic enough that it can be solved fairly easily. Where does it lead though? My guess would be nowhere, at least nowhere much further, and with all the coded messages and quotes people could find all sorts of connections that don't actually mean anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators are trying to solve a large and complex puzzle, and what better way to distract them then give them a really interesting puzzle that isn't solvable but leads them down irrelevant rabbit holes? The fact this topic is being deleted on certain sites where they have operatives actually reaffirms this belief for me because that will just make people more suspicious and determined to find something.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now with that said, I wouldn't disregard it completely. If I've learned anything it's that these people are arrogant and love throwing little bits of "truth" in people's faces just because they can. There could be a few things that would be worth noting and looking into - like Mary Gorgan's decoded message - but I doubt it goes beyond that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could be completely wrong though and there is a lot of weird shit on youtube that I am legitimately suspicious of, but all this just strikes me as
            <em>
             too
            </em>
            convenient.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Been looking at other threads on other sites talking about this and it seems like a lot commonly used cyphers leading to other commonly used cyphers, all on common websites, and everything so far looks like it's relatively recent (everything created/added within the last couple months). Fucking non-deep state pedos use more secure and efficient methods than this for their "business". So far everything really looks like a giant puzzle within a puzzle designed to keep people per-occupied. Please don't take my word for it though, if you really think there's something there keep looking, or if I'm wrong about something then correct me.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In Act I of the 1885 Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Mikado, the Emperor of Japan, having learned that the town of Titipu is behind on its quota of executions, has decreed that at least one resident of the town must be executed immediately. Otherwise the town will be reduced to the status of a village. In the dialogue preceding the song, three characters, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush, discuss which of them should be beheaded in order to save the town from "irretrievable ruin". Although Pooh-Bah's enormous "family pride" would normally prompt him to volunteer for important civic duties, he has decided to "mortify" his pride, and so he declines this undertaking. He points out that since Ko-Ko is already under sentence of death for the capital crime of flirting, Ko-Ko is the obvious choice to be beheaded. Pish-Tush helpfully notes that he had heard that beheading is not all that painful (although he does not seem certain of this).
             </p>
             <p>
              The three characters then sing the song "I Am So Proud". In the last lines of the song, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush contemplate "the sensation" of a "short, sharp shock" caused by being beheaded:
             </p>
             <p>
              To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,
   In a pestilential prison, with a lifelong lock,
   Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,
   From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!
             </p>

            That picture with the scribbles aappears as if the paper was laid on top of something and then colored on. Can anyone remove the scribbles and enhance the background to see if there is something there?

             There were what looked like two lines of typed text that appeared briefly, fuzzy.  Wondered if there was anything there.

               This is the garage still and the 4Chan board it came from - can't find the video - I may have misconnected the two diagonal lines of text appearing to this pic.

               Maybe start from 50 and it appears.

              <p>
               I don't think this is the first video where I saw it. I remember it as diagonal bottom left to top right, but similar two lines of text.

              These videos are meant to be spliced into some other videos. they are a subliminal message, which means deep down subconsciously. You wouldn't know if it effected you, it's like hypnosis.

               I doubt it. You can subliminally influence people without all the theatrics. It's really a subtle process and there wouldn't be any reason for all the codes in the videos. If anything these kinds of videos are probably just messages for "programmers" telling them to give certain subjects certain triggers or something like that, but even than there's got to be more efficient methods of communication. I really don't think there's any point to them besides fucking with us.

            Strange stuff. Coincidentally I was watching almost identical YT color vids with my friends kids (one 2 year old) last night. If they
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            embedding triggers etc in childrens educational videos, are they programming children now, for the future ?  Nice find OP, super-intriguing.

             Training the young populace into a life of normalized degeneracy with the end result being a brick wall of stubborn disgrace that the parents won't be able to reason through. Turning the young against the righteous older generations that still remember forms of normalcy. I'm afraid the new youth and the arrested development of millenials and gen x are going to be used to try and destroy religion thus further crippling the family unit (the shred that's left)

            Other stuff - a building in a field with an image of a noose in the top corner, an image with butterflies, an image with some sort of glyphic text (not heiroglyphics) and it all reminds me of some sort of subliminal programming. It's sort of like the 'Blipverts' from the Max Headroom film, if anyone remembers that.

            Weird stuff, but there's something in there. In the last video clip, just after the red section and after the 'white noise' (0:12), I caught a flash of an image of a man in US military (possibly Air force) uniform. next to some scribblings that included the words 'punishment', 'come from', 'milling', what looks like 'smells' and some stuff my brain is still working on. The handwriting is very scrawly and hard to make out. These videos need to be played back a slow speed to see what other images are embedded. That Air Force man needs to be identified. What I don't get at the moment is the 'Terebithia' link (the graffiti on the wall) - Terebithia was a mythical place from the film/book 'Bridge to Terebithia'.

            It could equally be all bollox, but why would they delete investigation threads if it was nonsense?

            hadn't seen this yet, but there are a bunch of seemingly coded vids, some with kids, one I remember was at a pizza hut in NH,  at the end of clinton pizza part vids on ytube. Fictionally or actually, sounds like someone's activating the manchurian troops
