            I'm not the one who found you.  I suck at that shit. Actually I don't know that, Maybe I'm good... I've just assumed that I suck at that shit, so i've never bothered trying. But regardless,  I'm not stupid enough to put myself in a position that could potentially back fire on me.   If I tell the world you name, and you get killed. I'm the dude that got you killed.
           </p>
           <p>
            As much as the MSM would love for that to happen, I don't want that to happen. I don't want anyone to get killed, or be threatened with violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or maybe you still are anonymous, I could totally be lying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way,  once I'm done writing this comment, I'll have forgotten you ever existed... That is unless you reply again.  In which case this cycle will repeat.

             Site created mid 2016, no content till late 2016, MASS UPDATES since you guys found it. And new updates from someone updating the site. It's obviously bait. Stop feeding the trolls.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I haven't read past these two sentences.... But so far, You haven't answered the question, and Based on these two sentences, It is not obviously bait, and if anything... It gives it credibility that is NOT a hoax.  Wouldn't the hoax theory be more plausible if it were generated 2017?  One of the most plausible theories is that it's a whistle blowing site, so the dates you mentioned, make sense from the whistle blowing theory.   Ok, I'm going to keep reading...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I used the term hoax, because it is inauthentic content being peddled as real, IMO to: get people to waste time, to make the creator feel good about themselves, to feel powerful. Or just because they like to fool people.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So I agree with your reasoning as to why someone would post this, But again.... You haven't provided a practical reason to assume it's inauthentic.  So far it seems like you're taking the publishing and update, dates. and constructing a theory based on these dates alone. And again, the whistle blowing theory rationalizations the publication dates.  Alright, I'll keep reading...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Web is full of trolls and shills who do these things for money, sure, but I'd say most do it for the lulz.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Aint that a shame? It'd be hard to know one way or another though, as to whether there are more people being paid to spread misinformation, or doing it for the lulz.  I'm sure depending on the topic, You might get more paid people, or trolls. I mean, It's not a question that the majority of trolls on reddit, contributing political content, are being paid.  Voat? Well Voat too has more paid trolls, that those doing it for the lulz... But I don't think you're suggesting that the person who made the voat post is trolling... Rather the person behind world corp, and more specifically, this video.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             And generating the content on that site would take a day, including the Web design and development.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So because the site could have been created in a day, That's why you believe it's a hoax? I don't get what your point is for mentioning that? Especially after you said it was created mid 2016, WAAAY before this whole thing broke.... Again, this gives the whistle blowing theory some credence, since it would insinuate they knew this shit was going to come to light, and prepared in advance....
           </p>
           <p>
            I almost think the fact that it was made a long time ago, but not used until AFTER the scandal broke... Gives the whistle blowing theory even more credibility.. If the person had these tapes, and knew this was going to happen in the coming months, It makes sense that he would create the site before then... If only to make it clear that it was not created as a hoax, AFTER pizzzagate broke.
           </p>
           <p>
            **I'm interested to know what you think the hoaxers original motive was?  Create the site, and then use it to to hoax whatever scandal pops up? Because again, when this site was created, there was no pizzgate, and hillary was almost certainly going to be our next president.
           </p>
           <p>
            they could have spent as much time as they wanted to make this, It's not like they would have had to make it quickly.   Again, I have no gone to the website, and even if I did, I know nothing about web desgin or development, So I wouldn't know how much effort would be required.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             That being said, You agree that this is an actual video, correct? Regardless if you don't think that it iis actual child abuse, You don't think it's completely CGI... Right?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Because if it's not CGI(and I don't think CGI was ever a theory.... I thought we were dealing with, "Actual abuse of a child" OR   "Fake video of child abuse, attempting to come off as real"
Because even if the video is fake... It still would require a substantial amount of effort, and materials... More effort required, than materials, but still seems like a lot of work for the lulz.  I mean, and are we saying that There was a child acting in this video? Because I've watched a lot of T.V and movies... Never have I seen or heard acting as well as that.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             k yourself, who benefits from the video being updated to be longer.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I have asked myself that. that answer actually reinforces that it's a whistle blower....Rarely do whistle blowers leak everything they have, all at once.... It's released in increments intentionally, It gives them a bit of control over their situation. If you release everything, and you're identified, well then you're dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is fake, You and I both lose, because we are wasting time having this conversation... Well you win, Because you'd be right....And lets be honest, what's more important than being correct? Actually, you lose too because you have to read this... Or at least pretend to if you choose to reply ;).

            In an extremelly broad sense, We all get off on power... But people can hold power in many different ways.  If someones funny, that's power, and I'm sure they get off on that power.. .. Or if you're a hot chick, you have power over every straight dude with functioning dick... I'm sure they get off on that...  If you're smart have a shit ton of power that can be used in many ways...

            Are you saying my original reply to you was defensive, So maybe that mean's It could have been me behind the videos? Or are you asking if your reply to my comment, is coming off as defensive?

            If it's the latter... Not at all.  I guess it's a reflection of myself, but I didn't interpret  it defensive at all.

            If it's the former, you couldn't know it's me based on that defensive reply, as it was not a defensive reply... Look through my post history if you want some examples of me being" defensive" lol.

            Long story short, I have no clue whether or not this is fake, real, Real but not podesta, or real and podesta.... I'm not working to figure that out either.  However I just gave you more reasoning to assume it's a whistle blower, than you gave me to assue it's a hoax... Yet you're much more confident it's a hoax, than I am that it's a whistle blower.  Your two main reasons were;

           <p>
            "The site could have been created in a day"  And
           </p>
           <p>
            "the Site was created mid 2016 (before pizzagate), not content until AFTER pizzagate, mass updates since we found it."
           </p>
           <p>
            See how neither of the points rationalize .this is a hoax, IN addition to contradicting each other?
           </p>
           <h2>
            I forgot to to mention this part, So i'll make it Big in case you don't want to read all of this....Updates AFTER people discovered it, Might be the most convincing reason to assume it is a whistle blower... when including the date it was created(Before pizzagate), and when it was first used(after pizzagate)
           </h2>
           <p>
            Ironically, If this does end up being fake.... This reply will be a great example of how it wasted people's time... lol.

            Ok. It's definitely not a hoax... Actually I shouldn't say that, I have no fucking clue if it's real or not, and further more, If it is legit, I have no clue if it is podesta. He obviously doesn't say John Podesta, but It's pretty clear he says John and something else...
           </p>
           <p>
            But I'm wondering  Why would you think this is a hoax? like what is the alleged "hoaxers" motive? Motivate the people who were already extremely motivated, Plus motivate people who have been following but not contributing?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or do you have a more logical explanation, that I'm clearly missing? The way I see it, (Which could be completely blurred) if this Video ends up being a hoax, It still doesn't really hurt the research.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, It's not like people are wasting their time with this.... I mean, I'm sure there are dozens of people trying to figure it out... but in the scheme of things, it's not like It's an attempt to direct the investigation down a false path, Since this research is being conducted by thousands of people.
           </p>
           <p>
            If that's what you're assuming(And I don't think that it is, Because you used the word "Hoax" versus red herring or whatever) It doesn't make sense.. Because this isn't really path. It kinda just stops with WorldCorp. I Haven't even clicked the worldcorp website because I have no way to contribute in that area, and I've heard enough from the clips posted here.... But again, I'm just trying to figure out what you're insinuating the motives are, for who every you think is behind this hoax?
           </p>
           <p>
            Who loses If this ends up being a hoax? Further more, Who wins?  Who is gaining what, if this is a hoax.  Who is losing What, If this a hoax?
           </p>
           <p>
            I know who is gaining what, if this isn't  a hoax(Even if it's not podesta, and again, I have no clue if it is)  The researchers are gaining, and what they are gaining is a substantial piece of reinforcing evidence to support the allegations against the government and Ngo's through out the world....  And a Gain for researchers, Is a lose for the accused.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Maybe I'm looking at this too critically, I guess not everything has to be a "Move".... Fuck, that's depressing.  I'm so use to the current state of affairs, that I automatically assume everything is a "Play"...   It very well could be a random person, making specific hoax, but for random reasons that only make sense to the hoaxer himself.(Yes "him". If it's a hoax, a dude made it)
            </strong>
           </p>
           <h2>
            So I understand that It could be a random hoax from someone who gets off on hoaxing people... But Why do you think this is a hoax? Is there anything that leads you to that conclusion? Or are you formulating an opinion based on nothing?

            Did anyone else see the OTHER videos on the Worldcorp site? The ones with the naked, fat guy doing the following:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Urinating in toilet and then reaching down into toilet, getting a handful of his urine, and drinking it.
            </li>
            <li>
             Inserting his penis into a vacuum cleaner.
            </li>
            <li>
             Spraying his penis with Windex.
            </li>
            <li>
             Putting a matchstick inside his urethra and lighting it.
            </li>
            <li>
             (What looks like) A person dragging a heavy garbage bag out to dispose of it?
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>

            Hey, watch between :38 - :45 seconds in the video. You can see what appears to be the glare from the persons glasses (Podesta wears glasses). It also looks like he may be wearing a hat? I sent the pics to a friend who is trying to see what he can do with them

            I've been unable to view it myself.. though I saw a short clip on a YouTube video and immediately began to cry.  I cannot watch any more.. but this must be exposed :(. It totally sounds like podesta for sure.  I've been following that creepy fucker ever since he went public with interest in ufos.  It's definitely him.  I feel it in my gut

             and now with JP's recent interview that just came out with him squirming depending himself against PizzaGate, there is plenty more words for the professional voice analysis to compare.

            I'm not saying it is
            <strong>
             definitely
            </strong>
            JP; however from what I have heard from people who have done technical analysis of their voices, they conclude that they sure do sound like one another.  Obviously, it is up to the DOJ and FBI ultimately to determine.  It certainly has been turned over to them thousands of times no doubt by now.

            Yeah, the extended version shows the entire outline of the man &amp; even more of his voice. That's 100% John Podesta. Fuck Confirmation Bias, this shit is real

              I totally agree. I remember the NYPD promising they would release the videos if Comey or the DOJ did not.  I have a feeling that is exactly what they are doing.  Maybe Comey is a little bit into this now too, since we are rid of Lynch.  But I do believe the FBI has a hand in this.  Remember the Old Westerns?  The White Hats always won.

               Thanks.  I work from home and typically I am able to dive in to this stuff because of that luxury, but today my fiancée is home sick so I have to be a little more low key.  I want to protect her from this evil as long as I can.

                I am not all that great with computers/editing photos. I can get screenshots of it, but its still dark. We need someone who knows how to brighten up photos to do this. I'm going to call my friend to see if he can.

                But as far as protecting your fiancé, I'm sorry, but she NEEDS to know. EVERYONE needs to know. The reason this shit is able to go on is because we keep sheltering ourselves &amp; those we love from the real evil which walks, breathes, &amp; lives on this earth. The only way to fight this is by putting it out in the public for the world to see. We are doing a horrible injustice to these children around the world by sitting on our asses and protecting those we love from this knowledge.
