            Anyone remember Bernie's silence in front of the camera when Harry Reid was talking for him last summer? Let's definitely put that on a tshirt. Also, Robert Menendez is a scumbag POS.

            JeffGate sounds like a good idea, but Seth T-shirts sound even better, because no planning is needed. Everyone would know what to do with the t-shirts. Just sell them or buy them. But what would be a good caption? Actually, there could be many different captions, but let's think of some. Someone could start a contest for the best captions or something like that. How's this?

            One of the royal grandchildren took a ride on the Lolita express. All in all, taking a ride on an airplane is not proof of anything except an attempt to compromise famous people with rumors of what went on at an island. What if the whole thing was a rumor mill, and used to compromise otherwise innocent people into looking guilty. There just is no proof.

            This reeks of concern trolling and diversion. I'd even go so far as to say that the sign off actually seems sarcastic and/or as if it's patronizing/pandering, with it's wording and out of context/ambiguous hashtagging.

            Thanks for the input. You have some good ideas but you seem nervous a little bit. Don't be. Don't worry. The truth will out, it always does. I've been here since pretty much the beginning and it looks like the most efficient way to get this cluster fuck to collapse is find out who killed Seth Rich. And in a larger context Seth Rich is even better than your idea about exposing Jeffrey Epstein. Why? Because there are no sordid sexual details which people like to avoid in the same way they avoid a pool of vomit on the side walk at the intersection of Broadway and 42nd Street on July 4th weekend.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth Rich was fighting for all Bernie Sanders supporters who suspected the DNC was sabotaging his candidacy but couldn't prove it. Seth Rich and Bernie Sanders are at the heart of this story and unites us all on both sides of the aisle. Can I get an Amen?
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGUNPMPrxvA">
             I said can I get an Amennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnah?
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            What the DNC did to Bernie Sanders is unconscionable. And finally discovering who killed Seth will be the Coup de grâce. And it couldn't happen any sooner because I'm emotionally exhausted.
           </p>

             Thank you very much for the feedback, and I agree that Seth Rich and pizzgate must continue at all costs. I was just presenting #jeffgate as a way to initiate the masses, and encourage them to be awake so they can in turn start looking into issues that we are discussing now.

              The risk of attacking Jeffrey Epstein is you quickly open yourself up to charges of Anti-Semitism. Even mentioning Wall Street is problematic. These people love to play 5d chess.

              Seth Rich and Bernie Sanders are unassailable and enough to bring the Deep State down. It's all over but the cryin'.

            And this thread is the inherent problem with these topics.  Noone trusts anybody, and they end up imploding.  Divide and conquer, all of that.  Guys, I'm not saying to forget about pizzagate, or seth rich at all!!!!   By all means keep fighting the good fight!  What I'm saying is our efforts are futile unless we get this info out to more people, who will in turn get it out to others!!!  In terms of redpilling more people,  start with #jeffgate , as its proven , and more palatable.  Once they are initiated by Jeffgate, That will bring them into #pedogate, and then they will in turn be more open to pizzagate.

            Hi there. Yes I have a 2 hr account because I want to fight with you guys.  But I don't want to fight in futility.  By all means, please keep researching pizzagate...im not saying not to.  What I am saying is to initiate NEW PEOPLE with #Jeffgate, and they will find pizzagate and be more willing to accept it!

            Epstein is one of the MAIN players, and the key to bringing down a huge portion of this child sex trafficking ring.   Moreso, it's already been accepted by MSM, which means it's a great gateway for the brainwashed masses to get redpilled. A sleeping person, hearing about Epstein will first confirm that their beloved MSM sites have reported on it, and then will proceed to do some digging. This digging will make them much more open to understand how deep these pedophile rings go, and make pizzagate much more palatable.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end of the day, The main mission is to get information out TO THE MASSES. That s our most effective weapon,  And continuing on the #Jeffgate situation will help open people's minds to pizzagate and pedogate in general. In essence, #PEDOGATE is the general topic, with subtopics like #pizzagate and #jeffgate....#jeffgate being the more palatable of the 2 to the uninitiated.

            Just wanted to encourage everyone to not change tactics. There is nothing dying down. It is exploding right now in Washington DC. Keep pushing #SethRich. 
Research everything about him. Research the doctors involved, the hospitals, officers, congress, senate. Do compound searches such as 
Seth Rich + Panda + DNC
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis + Septimbre Webre + Ballet
           </p>
           <p>
            Send in FOIA requests to all. Get medical license #'s, names of on duty anesthesia, etc. etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Call your Senators &amp; congress. Call FBI in DC &amp; Capital Police. Keep the pressure on constantly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their are many things breaking as you read this including members of congress coming forward to turn in evidence. Just because you cannot see something new everyday do not lose focus. They want you to have multiple hashtags right now. They are panicked in DC.

             I'm not suggesting changing tactics on Seth Rich, more referring to #pizzagate/#pedogate......changing the focus to #jeffgate/#pedogate.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree with you that there's panic going on concerning Seth Rich, as the "conspiracy theory" narrative seems to be all over MSM today (front page CNN, MSN, etc)

              Exactly why it needs to stay on #SethRich. This is toxic to them &amp; they know it. Unravels everything including pizzagate.

             <p>
              They are desperate and making mistakes as well some are turning on each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              Keep up the pressure on every aspect of Seth Rich story. All involved as previously stated. Once that breaks all other research will be easier. There are journalists, researchers, an "others" in DC right now watching everyone.

            This is a good idea.  We need to find a way to get the average joe interested and angry and it has to be done in subtle steps that they can relate to.  Sadly,  the Epstein angle isn't as effective as a red-pill option here in the UK.  However, I've had some good success at getting reluctant ears to listen by starting with the ever creeping increasing agenda to normalise paedophilia, and then, when they ask why no one is doing anything about it, I introduce the facts about how prevalent paedophilia is within all walks of society before then inserting facts about how deep and high it goes and how it's kept covered up.  Stressing that the problem isn't just committed by the elites and celebrities you read about or only happening to girls in Rotherham and the other 'vulnerable' kids in society, but that it is very NEARBY and in places they'd least expect.  I've even considered postering and leafleting my local area,  inviting parents  to just come and listen to some truths along the "how to keep your children safe" and "do you know how prevalent paedophilia is" angle - something mysterious or even sensational to get backsides on seats then give a well prepared presentation with information giving them opportunities to go look for themselves.  "What I am about to tell you is the absolute truth....it's up to you to find out whether you should believe me or not....but can you afford to take the risk" kind of opening to get their attention.  Give them the stats quickly and then slowly give them some of what we here now know including some of the more horrific elements - it could be very cleverly designed and compiled for maximum impact.  I'd be prepared to do this.  Imagine if many of us did the same presentation at the same time?  Given the amount of censorship we are struggling against, it may be an option to prepare for a more grassroots approach for when the digital option is no longer working or available to us as an adequate tool
If communication.  I know we're all anxious to see the big fish go down, but average Joe or Jennifer really aren't going to be swayed by this as they will consider their children out of reach or outside of their target market - but start with letting them know that this applies to their children; the danger is there and we need to wake up to the fact that paedophilia is everywhere - and it's right there in plain sight, and how to spot the signs.  Methods of making sure their children are able to talk to them and be believed.  If the parents are more aware there's more likelihood that they will be....then,  when they've been introduced to the scale of it, they will be better prepared to get angry at the involvement of the higher-ups and police and judicial systems and join the fight along with the rest of us.  Just an idea. Thoughts?

             These are all great points, especially the grassroots effort, as that's how all huge movements start.  #pedogate is that movement, I think, and #Jeffgate is a great way to address 2 issues at once.... child sexual abuse, and our ineffective justice system.   Also, I'm not sure how #Jeffgate wouldn't be a great redpill option for the UK, as one of your very own (Prince Andrew) was implicated by multiple victims in the Jeff Epstein pedoisland situation?

              Oh, I so agree, and believe me, I would plan for this to be included - but to use this as an opener would be futile in the UK imo as the Royals are considered so untouchable and up on the "elusive" pedestal.  No amount of argument on this topic has worked at all for me personally, but yes, oh yes ...it would not be missed out if I'm doing the presenting!  I am seriously considering this route, nevertheless; borne of the frustration at the amount of absolute ignorance out there.

               As you stated yourself, Brits are well-aware just how powerful the Royals and the CityUK are. Also, if you try to push the "paedophilia is everywhere" angle in the UK, you end up playing into misandry. Remember the 'swirl' logos were quickly found in the charity of a famous British-Asian ex-boxer, a female physiotherapist, and a few masonic organisations. They are NOT "literally everywhere." The problem is that mistakenly-trusted, official-seeming entities are using them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Basically, there is nothing to be gained from convincing people who are not particularly bright, into thinking their innocent 70-year-old neighbour is a potential paedophile. That doesn't help to move things in a constructive direction..
              </p>
              <p>
               We need private investigators to get tangible evidence on these people, to directly incriminate them. Focus on busting culpable individuals, not encouraging people to be scared witless of their harmless neighbours.

            This is a sound plan, since the majority of the American people get news from the msm and most likely do not pursue alt news site forums like this.  However if this whole pizzagate/pedogate thing is true, we still have a hell of a fight on our hands.  The story is so horrific, and the freaks who are doing this, most likely counted on this angle..
