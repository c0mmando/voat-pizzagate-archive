            What white man with any pride at all in himself or his country or his race wouldn't hate the despicable Jews behind this with everything he has?  The Day of the Rope literally cannot come soon enough. Tactics like this being used against the white race call for the very worst kind of retribution to take some righteous revenge against these world  parasites who are changing this world into the kind of place they want to live in. Fuck what we want. Goyim have no say in a Jew controlled world.

            I couldn't even finish watching the drag queen video above I was so shocked. Obviously the U.K. Is much worse than the US in what they can get away with. U.K. Is much more of an open dictatorship, but this is quite shocking to see and makes me worried about where it will lead next. If it's already this bad then you can guarantee it's just a step along a road to the condition they really want to engineer.

            The idea the pedophilia is a sexual orientation, just like being gay, does not add up.  There are a plethora of reasons, but one main one is the idea of consent.  A child cannot give consent - their goal is to convince the public that children being manipulated are capable of giving consent.

             Sexual attraction does not rely on somebody else's consent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Modern logic does actually uphold the "pedophilia is a sexual orientation" argument.  The real problem here the entire concept of sexual orientation in the first place.  Everybody needs to remember, this is a very new concept that got formulated in the late Victorian era, the same time the rest of the seeds of modern progressive insanity were being planted in our culture.

              We are all imperfect, challenged by unhealthy desires. It behooves us to cultivate self control. Such effort is usually rewarded with a joyous, healthy lifestyle. Giving in to unhealthy or problematic desires is becoming more and more acceptable. One catchphrase is: “I was BORN this way!”.

              “Sexual Orientation” is just an excuse for losing self control and avoiding responsibility.

              I believe we were ALL born this way. In fact, biologically speaking, it’s possible for the bad habits of my father and grandfathers to have formed genes, which were passed on to influence me.

              I believe everyone should be treated with dignity and respect, and I am happy to support anyone that wishes to exert self-control over problematic inclinations, BUT a crime against a child is unacceptable NO MATTER WHAT.

             I'm going to disagree on the gay not being a sexual orientation. I have no problem with consensual sex between adults. What they do in the bedroom isn't my business. It's a fact that in nature (not just humans) that there is a percentage of the population born gay. From penguins to giraffes, it's rampant in the animal kingdom (and not only in those kept in captivity). It's not a choice; it's brain chemistry/wiring. General scientific consensus is that if the mother is stressed during a certain part of gestation, it alters the developing fetus' brain.

             Child molestors need lead therapy. They do not benefit society in any way, and by harming kids, they are actively destroying civilization, imho.

             Anyone assuming gay = pedo is a fucking disgrace. If gay = pedo were 100% undeniably true, I'd love to know why so many little girls are raped by heterosexual men. Gay = pedo would mean more Sandra Cantu type shit. Granted, there are some lowlife fuckfaces that are gay and rape boys (Hey Jimmy Comet, I'm lookin at you)... but they aren't the whole kit and caboodle and to state that all gays are pedos is to fucking ignore all those people raped by a person of the opposite sex.

              Nothing is ever 100% undeniably true dude! But what we can clearly see statistically speaking is that gay men, who are a very small percentage of the population, commit a disproportionately large percentage of pedophilia. Of course hetero men, and women also commit pedophilia, but that doesn't undo the fact that a large percentage of gay men commit pedophilia!

              I wish it were that easy. Take a breath, friend. You could turn yourself into the punisher and take a few out, but they’d catch you. Calm yourself and stick with us. When we turn the tables on ‘em... that’s when they’ll get their justice. With divine retribution.
