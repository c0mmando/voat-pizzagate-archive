<p>Hi Virginia - Cheese pizza is a family favorite though my dad now goes the vegan route. My children seem to thankfully &amp; hilariously share all their thoughts <strong>aloud</strong>. No plans for a pizza business. And, since you replied, hope you too oppose child abuse/conversion therapy.</p>

            <p>
             I stated the reason at the top of post on why I deleted it, did you miss it? I will quote the person.
            </p>
            <p>
             314592653 - “I know this might come across as too PC for some, but your title is triggering to some of us. Not only sexual abuse, but sexual torture. Its horrifying, but many of us here have been abused in awful ways. PTSD can cause some survivors to visualize and even physically feel specific pain when statements like those in your title are made. Please dont attack me for saying this.”
            </p>
            <p>
             I changed it because the title of post may offend people that are survivors of any type of abuse and out of courtesy as not to offend anyone.

            <p>
             Now I am going to ask you a few questions addressing your concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
             Are you a mod? If so, did I break a rule somehow on my topic? I will gladly fix it if there is an issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why does this feel like an interogation with the bright light shown in my face?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why are you questioning me as if you were a cop?
            </p>
            <p>
             Is this what you do to new people who want to post a topic on this board? If yes, is this some kind of initiation that is done to for first time posters here to feel them out?
            </p>
            <p>
             Can you comment on the substance of the topic for now on because It almost feels like you are paranoid or something.

              If that's true, you made a mistake picking a username so close to one belonging to a shill. Did you even bother to read the link I posted? That would answer your questions.

                I saw the reason you gabe for reposting this, however it just seemed odd since I commented to you on your original post and pointed out the concern I had about your user name. You didn't respond, and then you deleted the original post, and reposted this one. It seemed suspicious. If you were truly an innocent victim in the "wrong place at the wrong time" one would assume you would have expressed your innocence at the first round of accusations.

                If you think it's disrespect to not answer your questions, voat is going to be a really rough environment for you! Here's a tip: get used to it!

               <p>
                You don't "have to" read the post I linked to, but since you're expressing you don't understand why you're being so mistreated, reading that might help explain why your user name raised red flags.

                No I'm not a mod on pizzagate. Im a mod on the subverse that's been getting attacked by sock puppet accounts, one of which is

                Just calm down, you're over reacting! If you're truly innocent then there's no problem. I would never ever presume to tell someone where they can and can't post on a free speech site. You're free to post here. I'm not going to bother you!

                As for the tweet, pizzagaters have a tendency to interpret anything trough pizzagate lens, trough the suspicion that this people are guilty and rationalize it in a way that fits their narrative.

              I thought maybe it could be a way to get people warmed up on what is about to come out out. Deal or not, maybe this is a way to spare Chelsea by Bill and Hill somehow like they did with noname’s legacy.

              No, it's just a tendency that pizzagaters have to interpret anything trough pizzagate lens, trough the suspicion that this people are guilty and rationalize it in a way that fits their narrative.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's the same reasoning error used with the sick interpretations of Alefantis instagram pictures, many of them which were photoshopped also.

            And people are focusing on the misspelling of allowed instead of how she skated around the question about podesta the molesta ..I wonder if Chelsea will allow podest around her kids? Wow she admits that she knows that pizza is a code for cp. I was curious if she is oblivious to or just ignores conspiracies but I guess this isn't really a conspiracy per se..
