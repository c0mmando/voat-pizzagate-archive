<p>&quot;In December of 2005, the Respondent (Sheen) and I took a vacation in Barbados without our children.</p>
<p>&quot;It was my intention to discuss certain serious matters with the Respondent during this trip and to try and understand why the Respondent was participating in certain activities, which were repulsive to me and to convince him to seek help for the sake of our children.</p>
<p>&quot;Prior to our trip, I learned that the Respondent was accessing gay pornography sites which I found even more disturbing because I felt that the boys looked underage.&quot;</p>
<p>Yesterday fellow actor Dominick Brascia said that Haim - who died in 2010 as a result of drug induced pneumonia - confided in him about the pair\'s alleged sexual encounter.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;Haim told me he had sex with Sheen when they filmed Lucas. He told me they smoked pot and had sex.</p>
<p>&quot;Haim said after it happened Sheen became very cold and rejected him. When Corey wanted to fool around again, Charlie was not interested.&quot;</p>

               Isnt it sad and yet totally eye opening at the same time? Growing up my girlfriends church had a youth group on backmasking and rock n roll and some of my favorite bands were mentioned which at the time wasnt your standard fare (The Cure SexPistols ect) I naturally asked questions and stood up for my favs which only made the pastor tell my friends dad to "keep me away from her" I was so hurt and totally turned off by anything like this...Years later he had some sort of financial falling out with the church leaving on bad terms to which I say...keep me away why I cant hear you all the way in the unemployment line buddy....Nevertheless it was years later I fell down the red pill rabbit hole and I must be getting old as I see now that there is a Satanic element to this all no matter what I or anyone else believes...I hope that we can fight this fight and win but sometimes I wonder. Its you amazing voat hive minded people that give me hope...please God help us in this fight. LIVES DEPEND ON IT!!

               It's a bummer. It messes with your head, but I feel so much better not being an enabler for this scum. People can still idolize them, but not me. Plus, there hasn't been a good movie out in like ten years! There's nothing I want to see, and I used to want to see everything. This scum has no creativity, no brilliance, they are not inspired, nor are they artists. They copy and recycle, each reproduction less in quality and derivative. Even the evil men that ran things used to hire artists to come in to star and write scripts, but they don't even do that anymore. They don't let an outsider into the inner circle. They think FX are a replacement for stories with heart and with a soul. It's why they decided to set a new standard where ugly is beautiful and beautiful no good. It carries over into everything they do.

                   True. But we're not talking about good people who get hooked on drugs. We're talking about the cabal that gets people hooked and wills them not to survive past their usefulness.

                       My opinion? For what it's worth, most people are not born that way. Things happen -- horrible things. But a small percentage? Born that way. I don't think a "good" person becomes a serial killer. I think they harm themselves through ingesting alcohol, taking drugs, acting out, but that small percentage are evil.
