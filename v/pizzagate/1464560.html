<p>Talking of finding their inner-child!</p>
<p>&quot;lthough there might be people around you, you may feel lonely. You will not hear nor see. You will not be able to tell your needs to your environment, because you are actually not fully know. You would like to experience a deep sense of connection, but you can get a surface. You will experience that people are pretty nice but you can not, however, express yourself as you would like. Is wearing armor that protects you from showing yourself to the real world. Our basic emotions may be that you do not belong to any?&quot;</p>
<p>Look into these people for Finnish connections? Or is this coincidence? Keep in mind, two finnish journalists and a mayor were killed, and looking into pedophile rings in Finland.</p>
<p>Yes, this involves pizza.</p>',

            I created a thread on this, but then deleted it because I (and you) linked to a website that doesn't really source at all. I still think this website is bullshit, but it is very peculiar that two journalists and a mayor were
            <em>
             sniped
            </em>
            in Finland with no known motive.
