            We should be looking for connections to whomever may be involved.  That being said, I'm not convinced that something is going on, but I do think that the FBI/police and needs to look into the whole pizzagate thing with some very thorough congressional oversight.  If anything is there (which there may be.  Even though I'm not convinced, that doesn't mean I don't think it's weird as fuck how people are reacting) then we'll find it, and with congressional oversight, it's far less likely to be covered up if something is found.  If not, then we can put the thing to rest.

            If there were connections to Trump the DNC would of done all they could to make him the fall man and clean themselves of the situation while going into silence again. During the whole debate and campaign they had more than enough opportunities to turn Trump into a patsy but they never did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I doubt Trump is involved, cause if he was involved, I don't think Hillary would of had this fight against him the way they did, unless they are both very good actors.

             Yes but you have to take a second and contemplate the idea that maybe the elites on both "sides" of politics (since it seems in the end that this is a false dichotomy) are working together (look up on how close the Clintons and Trump are) for the overall political agenda which is the New World Order. Of course there are "conservative" puppets and "liberal" puppets, but their apparent differences have little value in the grand scheme of things, since the world is still being led towards the totalitarian government the elites seem to want. Not saying that if Hillary is involved in one scandal, that automatically Trump (or anyone else) is also involved, but that they may be working together in general, meaning that they wouldn't really try to criminalize each other.

             That's a possibility, but I can't help but feel like they wouldn't risk bringing it up even if he was involved because it could turn right back around on them.

            Part of me wonders if the reason the Dems made sure the game was rigged against him is because they didn't actually have anything on him?

Not to discourage you from digging, that is.  At this point, Is rather cast a wide net and narrow it down.

             I think this group would rather not go to the extremes of actually putting a member. Easier to rig a primary than risk a MAD event in case their lamb gets mouthy.

            Trump is a mixed bag, he is pushing for real reform but he's still an overt Zionist. In his defence he's most probably unaware of how Zionism is a aligned with Satanism. This is a difficult subject for most people and it's easy for to cloud the issue by conflating the Israel of Judaism with the Zionist state of Israel. The hard evidence here is the territorial ambition of the Oded Yinon plan vs the Abrahamic covenant of Genesis 15, which is more inclusive of Muslims as descendants of Ishmael.

              It's not common knowledge, typically people are either in the "stand by Israel no matter what" camp or the "Jews are the devil" camp. Israel as a nation was established with the Patriarchs, but Israel as a state was established with Theodore Herzl, the British Mandate, and the League of Nations. The Satanism angle becomes more relevant as the connection between paedophilia and SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse) becomes evident.

            Oh that's a really good point actually.  I always assumed they threatened him with something, but I never made the connection to a pizzagate possibility.  Even reading all this crap, I'm still so naive.

            I thought of this after I posted my question.  Did it ever get established exactly what Trump's connection to Epstein was?  I'm googling it now and there are a lot of conflicting stories/opinions out there.  Especially considering the mainstream news sites are dog shit now.
