            Critical issue here RE: the Hillary/Huma tape....
HOW did the authorities come into possession of this video?
Huma sent it to home computer, Anthony Weiner saved it in a file named "Life Insurance".
The way the tape was obtained really matters.
NYPD (sex crimes against children unit, no less) discovered it, hidden in Weiner's file during their search related to his dick pics....DOJ took copies immediately.
           </p>
           <p>
            How likely is it that Huma or Weiner had a fake tape made, to be stored somewhere they thought was "safe", when the obvious expectation was that no one would ever see it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, the media and reflexive Hillary defenders will go with the brain-addled "its a fake because technology" routine.
Real scrutiny of the circumstances of how the tape was originally obtained makes a strong case for authenticity.
Larpers would have shown their work without the compulsion.....

            Give it up already. You guys look like fools. Some anonymous spook tells you that there will be a Hillary child sex tape revealed and you guys believe it. So when do you give up on this? Still waiting for arrest? When is the expiration date for this bullshit? Just indefinately? A bunch of David Seamans. He said arrest are happenign secretley over a week ago, guy still has fans. The cabal is defeated, child traficking stopped, no more chemtrails. Everybody go home. If you want to play make believe, go big like him.

            Maybe it's not a coincidence that they want to be so close to those in Hollyweird. Horror films are suddenly the big thing right now hitting the theaters, so what if they created a video with say, Trump, or some popular conservative who's for guns, molesting a child. Look how well they made Charlize Theron look like Eileen Wuornos. I'm thinking it would be pretty difficult to tell a production from the real thing. Then, there's McKamey Manor (MK &amp; MM anyone?). If you don't know what that place is, it's a whole 'nother rabbit hole where the guy who runs it is ex-military and it's balls to the wall crazy ass shit.

            Yup, I noticed Theresa May elude to fake pics/videos months ago and I thought 'oh yes you are tying to plant seeds of doubt for when they eventually come out!'  This was in a talk she gave and it did not even tie in with what she was saying at the time. Just slipped it in there.  I have searched and searched since then but cannot find the clip to share!

            Thanks for posting this. I had a question: How expensive is the hardware/software to fake a video? I would think it would be cost prohibitive of an average joe that they are trying to cast as an alt right fake newser. That would be another big pointy finger at who is really faking the news. They are supposed to have "just come out" with this technology, so it's not going to be affordable for anybody but the MSM anyway.

Anyone with patience, a good eye for effects and a decent gaming computer could produce a convincing fake of a celebrity (someone for whom a lot of reference video/pictures exist). There are other more sophisticated ways of doing body/face doubles. The kind of stuff that companies win Academy awards for but the gap between the two in terms of convincing quality is shrinking.

            I have no doubt a real video exists, but yes things can be faked which is why I never supported those stills as evidence to it being HRC and Huma. Geeta, possibly since it was a similar image of a known photograph shared.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although I have had a year training in digital film and editing even I admit I'm no sleuth at spotting good fakes. Usually because most are so good I can't tell.

            Hat's off to those who saw those stills as fakes.

            Video is made with code. For an expert, finding an artifact in the code that applies to alterations shouldn’t be a big deal. Any minute now, an app will likely become available that let’s us separate the add ons  from the original video. It probably exists already. Fakes will still be easy to spot. They are just clinging to the same old hope: that we are dumb and lazy.

            I turn to news articles about people getting caught with cp that has gore and torture in it, because that proves SOMEONE is making this type of video. Horrorshow cp exists and elitist fucks are getting busted making, viewing, and hoarding it.  The question remains if the perpetrators are identifiable as hrc, Podesta,  etc. But at least norms can understand that this type of sadism/snuff video exists, we are not the ones inventing the disgusting concept.
           </p>
           <p>
            I appreciate the video experts among us who can help identify real from fake. Thank you for your service.

             Q mention a "raw HRC video" once. There are also rumors about a deep web video where a masked person sacrifices a child (have not seen it and couldnt find the link, two /x/ threads 404'ed). There was also some talk about a Tarmac video. I think both the tarmac video and sacrifice video are psyops, those theories started coming up after Q mentioned strange traffic on the site, very plausible three letter agency psyop.

            Running time code on the video, including frame count will help to prove it's real.  The video will likely have been captured from 1080p cameras (I doubt Epstein upgraded to 4k).  Also, the lighting will be marginal at best.  Even at 1080p, details (including color) are significantly reduced in low-light scenarios, even with IR emitters.
           </p>
           <p>
            The glowing eyes are indicative of some form of non-visible light being reflected by the retinas and picked up by the CCD sensors within the camera which are sensitive to that frequency of light.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as determining a fake video, the better the image quality, the easier it is to identify a video faked through editing or more importantly image mapping.  Under high-def enlargement, aliasing and rasterization will occur around the stitched images - usually the face.
           </p>
           <p>
            My understanding that IF there is a video and IF it gets released, it will have a "certified by NSA" bug on the video.  NSA has all of the analysis tools to determine if a video is authentic or not.

              Add a para to the effect of: "Relates to pizzagate as there is a rumored video of HRC and Huma Abedin torturing and murdering a child.  Videos of such actions are central to Pizzagate as they are used for initiation and blackmail of subjects".  Or something like that.

            This would only soften the blow, but not counter it. If the video is real, experts will be able to tell it's real, then all shit breaks loose. Thankfully we're not at a point where we can make videos that are indistinguishable from the real thing.

             I agree with you - and I think you'll be disheartened to see the amount of people who still dismiss it because current Hollywood House Negro Peele said it could be fake.

              The future of criminal justice will forever change if video evidence is deemed to be inconclusive because we cannot tell if it's fake or not.  How would juries ever be sure that the video they are seeing isn't fake?  Defense lawyers are going to love this.

             True, but I think the idea is to get the uneducated (on the topic or tech) to just shrug and say "videos can be faked". I'm unwilling to watch a video of molestation or mutilation. If I'm also uneducated on the topic, I'd be psychologically happier to just shrug and say "Sounds far fetched and gross and outrageous. Plus videos can be faked". When it comes to the dark dark evil actions I've read about and heard about during SRA research, most people would willingly feed themselves the comfortable lie. This would be easier if people already have been primed with the thought "videos can be faked". I am certain there will be plenty of video experts saying "the video is fake". I am certain of that. If there are also video experts saying "it's real" which experts will more people listen to?

              Can they fake the terror of a child screaming in agonising pain while watching it? I saw this video today and cannot get the little girls cries out of my mind. I wish I had not watched it.  - Post by GreenDell144 -

                Yes that is just higher on my scale of deeply disturbing because you actually see the little girl and them positioning the tray underneath her, cannot describe how truely awful that was to watch.
