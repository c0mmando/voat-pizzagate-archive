            Holy fuck.  So, can I ask what your role in this pizzagate investigation has been?  Are you one of the diggers, do you post frequently, have you posted any discoveries or just commented on others?
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, that's terrifying.  Hopefully the dude was just being an asshole or something...  Did you get a license plate?
