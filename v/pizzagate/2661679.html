<p>A lawsuit filed alleges that Paul Pressler, a former state judge, lawmaker and leader on the religious right, repeatedly sexually assaulted a young man over a period of decades, beginning when the boy was just 14. </p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that Paul Pressler, a former justice on the 14th Court of Appeals who served in the Texas state house sexually assaulted Duane Rollins, his former bible study student, several times per month over a period of years. According to the filing, the abuse started in the late 1970s and continued less frequently after Rollins left Houston for college.
Pressler denied allegation.</p>
<p>The abuse, which consisted of anal penetration, took place in Pressler’s master bedroom study, the suit alleges. Pressler told Rollins he was “special” and that the sexual contact was their God-sanctioned secret.</p>
<p>Pressler is a leading figure on the religious right in Texas and was a key player in the “conservative resurgence” of Southern Baptism.  Pressler’s wife his former law partner Jared Woodfill, Woodfill Law Firm, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary President Paige Patterson, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and First Baptist Church of Houston are also named as defendants in the suit.</p>
<p>Rollins seeks damages.</p>
<p>When asked about the suit, Ted Tredennick, Pressler’s attorney, pointed to Rollins\' record, which is peppered with arrests on DUIs and other charges over the last several decades. </p>
<p>“Mr. Rollins is clearly a deeply troubled man, with a track record of multiple felonies and incarceration, and it is the height of irresponsibility that anyone would present such a bizarre and frivolous case — much less report on it,” Tredennick said.</p>
<p>Rollins and his lawyer, Daniel Shea, say his past legal troubles stemmed from behavior fueled by alcohol and drug addictions sparked by the childhood sexual abuse. In 1998, Rollins was jailed for 10 years on burglary charges. Pressler advocated for Rollins to receive parole in 2000, when he was first eligible, and then again in 2002. In his letter to the parole board, Pressler pledged to employ Rollins and be “personally involved in every bit of Duane’s life with supervision and control.”</p>
<p>Pressler previously settled with Rollins over a battery charge for an incident in a Dallas hotel room. That settlement is not public, Shea said, but reference is made to such an agreement in recent court filings.</p>
<p>Shea said that though Rollins filed that assault charge more than a decade ago, he had a “suppressed memory” of the sexual abuse until he made an outcry statement to a prison psychologist.  A psychiatrist who has been working with Rollins wrote in a letter included in the suit that Rollins is a “reliable historian for the childhood sexual trauma to which he was repeatedly and chronically subjected.”</p>
<p>Pressler was President George H.W. Bush’s pick to lead the Office of Government Ethics  but the administration ultimately ruled Pressler out after an FBI background investigation. News reports from the time suggest that Pressler was dismissed due to unspecified ethics issues.</p>
<p>Our legal system is raping our children and manipulating their minds making them the victimizer.   Words cannot describe how We All feel regarding a legal and religious leader victimizing children. ....</p>

            A period of decades?  This shows what a hold abusers have over their victims.  He went off to college but turned to crime.  Why?  Because years of abuse can have traumatic results.  Many suffer PTSD.  And while he was living his troubled life, this pervert  judge was making decisions on the court.  What decisions was he making?  We can well imagine he was not in favor of the victim.  And yes, why would Bush want to put Pressler in such a valued position.  ETHICS?  He himself did not have Ethics.  He would evidently use his skewed views in that Office, which I am sure had everything to do with the appointment.  Bush could have easily had him investigated before he put him up for the job.  This shows how we get those judges infiltrated into their positions.  This guy needs to be locked up and punished.  Not molly coddled like he has been for decades.  Bush surely will be pulling strings like he always does.

            In separate court affidavits filed this month, two men say Paul Pressler molested or solicited them for sex in a pair of incidents that span nearly 40 years. Those accusations were filed as part of a lawsuit filed last year by another man who says he was regularly raped by Pressler.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pressler’s newest accusers are another former member of a church youth group and a lawyer who worked for Pressler’s former law firm.
           </p>
           <p>
            At that time, Pressler was a youth pastor at Bethel Church in Houston; he was ousted from that position in 1978 after church officials received information about “an alleged incident,” according to a letter introduced into the court file.
