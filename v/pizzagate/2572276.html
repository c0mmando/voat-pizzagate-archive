<p><strong>An anon at the chans dropped a hint regarding a woman who met with Laura Silsby in Haiti the day before Silsby was arrested in 2010 for kidnapping children, Anne-Christine d\'Adesky.</strong> </p>
<p><em>NeonRevolt now published an article about the anons\' findings (see below).</em></p>
<p>Most of you are familiar with the Silsby case, since it has been frequently discussed here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case"><em>from Wikipedia:</em></a></p>
<p><em>On January 29, 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children, most of whom were not orphans and had families. The group (..) did not have proper authorization for transporting the children and were arrested on kidnapping charges.</em> </p>
<p><em>Nine of the ten missionaries were later released but (...) Laura Silsby remained incarcerated in Haiti. By the time she went to trial on May 13 the charges had been reduced to &quot;arranging irregular travel&quot; and the prosecution sought a 6-month prison term. On May 17, she was found guilty and sentenced to the time served in jail prior to the trial.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What made the case interesting for our investigation was Silsby\'s connection to the Clintons. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-25/clinton-silsby-trafficking-scandal-and-how-media-attempted-ignorecover-it">They intervened on her behalf</a>, and both the charges and her sentence were reduced.</p>

<h2><strong>So who is Anne-Christine d\'Adesky?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.neonrevolt.com/2018/06/01/the-morally-repugnant-elite-and-their-bad-juju-haiti-dr-humantrafficking-qanon-greatawakening/">This NeonRevolt article</a> discusses the findings of the chan anons.</p>
<p><em>Most interesting finds:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Her family, an elite Haitian family, owns a shipping company in Haiti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They also own Wahoo Bay Beach Club and Resort. Wahoo is mentioned in a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40647">Podesta email</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NeonRevolt asks whether they might have been involved in trafficking. Also, they point out that Laura Silsby might have 
met d\'Adesky in order to find a way of shipping children out of Haiti (which is, of course, mere speculation at this point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The article also discusses a recent child trafficking case in Haiti - with 33 children as victims. Remember, Silsby also smuggled 33 children. A coincidence? </p>

<p>Reposting, since <a href="https://voat.co/user/Are_we__sure">@Are_we__sure</a> found out that the anons and NeonRevolt were wrong. LOL. D\'Adesky didn\'t meet with Silsby <em>the day before</em> Silsby was arrested but <em>a couple of days</em> before Silsby was arrested. 🤓</p>

            Today was a historic day for Haiti and for the groups in the One Billion Rising for Revolution movement in and outside Haiti. We hosted The Vagina Monologues in Kreyol and French by the talented performance group Theatre Atelier Ecolosion, led by Florence Jean-Louis and the superstar actors Cynthia Jean-Louis and Ange Bellie Andou — great talents and sexy performers — and also Fabienne Colimon, et Huguette Saint Fleur. Eve Ensler was the special guest of this event hosted by Senators from the Parliament and joined by Deputys. We had a packed house, and a very appreciative audience. For many, it was the first time they had heard such positive, open discussions of women’s sexuality and desire, and it was a most welcome one. The men of the Parliament warmly embraced the play, the themes and the cause of the One Billion Rising Revolution, and have proclaimed themselves strong allies ready to do their part.

From Wiki: In 2010, d'Adesky flew to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of the January 10th earthquake, where she has longtime family roots. She began reporting for World Pulse and the Global Post, and launched a blog on the post-quake humanitarian response, Haiti Vox. She also founded a feminist coalition with Haitian and diaspora women activists, PotoFanm+Fi (Women and Girls Pillar, in Haitian Creole), to promote the role, needs and voice of Haitian women in the rebuilding effort. In 2011, she launched the offshoot Haiti-based group, PotoFi (Girls Pillar) and worked to document the gender dimensions of the earthquake and its impact on adolescent girls. She released a report in 2011 with PotoFi showing the teenage Haitian girls bore a disproportionate brunt of the disaster, evidenced by a tide of unplanned, early pregnancies linked to sexual violence, and a survival-based entry into prostitution, and displacement. In 2010, she published a comprehensive review of Haiti's cross-sectorial progress fighting gender violence and rape in a book, Beyond Shock: Charting the Landscape of Sexual Violence in Post-Quake Haiti, published by the UC Santa Barbara Center for Black Studies Research.

             What is interesting is that she actually published a book about sexual violence in Haiti after the earthquake:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Beyond Shock: Charting the Landscape of Sexual Violence in Post-Quake Haiti, published by the UC Santa Barbara Center
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             IMO she could be a genuine advocate against sexual violence, or her story that she met Silsby by chance isn't true, and she could have been somehow involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             That Podesta mentions Wahoo [beach] in an email is most interesting imo. From what I understood when researching it, the entire beach is owned by the D'Adesky family, where the resort is situated.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would be interesting to do some further digging.

               I guess just reading as many articles about the Wahoo Beach and the D'Ardeskys as possible. When we recently researched David Matthews, Pippa Middleton's father-in-law, who was arrested for raping a teenager, and owns a luxury resort on St. Barths, I found a DM article where they interviewed some of the locals - who talked about the family and other elite families on that island.

              Going over the post again.  Do you remember the set up in Haiti on a beach?  It involved Underground Railroad, the group that was suppose to capture Child Traffickers.  Well they are Fakes and probably the kids for the raid they set up, they were probably passed off. I wonder if they were on Wahoo Beach.  Just a thought.

                Well I found this info about it being a Bogus Fake Operation.  In this article in Steemit they mention Glenn Beck and Dyncorp and HHS and that the operators are Military.  Possibly Seals.  Wow.

            I also pointed that the speculation makes no sense and doesn't match up with the facts.

           <p>
            Jan 24  Anne-Christine d'Adesky meets Laura Silsby for the first time ever by chance because they are in the same hotel in the Dominican Republic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jan 29th Silsby is arrested close the Haitian border.
           </p>
           <p>
            Feb 2  Anne-Christine d'Adesky comes forward and talks to the press about meeting Silsby and the story she tells undermines Silsby's argument.  She tells the press that she told Silsby if she didn't have the proper permissions from Haitian authorities she could be arrested for child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout February d'Adesky who is a journalist and a blogger goes on to write critically about the whole Silsby affair.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Americans have defended their actions, saying the paperwork was confusing and that they did not know the rules. But Anne-Christine d'Adesky, a journalist who was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting in Haiti, said she told the missionaries they could be regarded as traffickers if they tried to cross the border without the proper documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I really have to let you know that you are very likely to be stopped at the border, and you may even be in trouble," d'Adesky said she told the Americans.
...
D'Adesky said she warned the missionaries the night before they entered Haiti. But, she said, Silsby and her colleagues chose to ignore that warning.
            </p>
            <p>
             "They really felt like it was the Lord's intention they would be successful," d'Adesky said.
            </p>
            <p>
             D'Adesky has since been in touch with United Nations authorities who are working with the Haitian government to protect children after the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the region on Jan. 12.

            What's the point of mentioning this? Are you claiming that this beach club and resort is mentioned in a Podesta email?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             They also own Wahoo Bay Beach Club and Resort. Wahoo is mentioned in a Podesta email.

            ...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             What made the case interesting for our investigation was Silsby's connection to the Clintons. They intervened on her behalf, and both the charges and her sentence were reduced.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is completely false as I have shown several times.  There's no connection between Silsby and the Clintons.  The Clinton's did not know who this woman was when she was arrested.  After that, the State Department go involved because helping Americans arrested overseas is one of the core duties of the consular services the State Department provides.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silsby was sentenced by a Haitian court.  Her sentence was never reduced, she was tried on reduced charges.  She was originally charged with kidnapping, but these charges were reduced when it was found that the the parents of the children on her bus gave their permission to Silsby to take them.
