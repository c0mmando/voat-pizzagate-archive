<p>Having said that, I want to ensure we don\'t forget about Caris James. </p>
<p>We want to make sure that this child is safe and with the biologically related parents. </p>
<p>Before I provide photos of what appear to be signs of abuse or neglect, there is something odd that hasn\'t been mentioned yet. </p>
<p>It is that there are three separate references in the Instagram photos to Caris James being born as a male. </p>
<p>First, James Alefantis directly refers to Caris as &quot;he.&quot; Why would James do this? He does not appear to be joking. </p>
<p>Second, a commenter tacitly affirms that Caris is a boy by stating, in reply to James, that Caris is a &quot;shebaby.&quot; Again they do not appear to be joking here. In many ordinary contexts when you call someone a &quot;shemale&quot; you are tacitly affirming that they were born a male.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/paHbf2.png">https://i.sli.mg/paHbf2.png</a></p>
<p>Third, Alefantis uses the &quot;chickenlovers&quot; hashtag when he is referring to an older gentleman hugging Caris. Chickenlovers means an older male who is attracted to a younger <em>male</em>. So it would only make sense to use chickenlovers if Caris is indeed a boy. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/X6Utso.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/X6Utso.jpg</a></p>
<p>We also must ask, is this gentleman biologically related to Caris? </p>
<p>Some have remarked that Caris looks like a boy as well, though this is subjective so I will not include it here. </p>
<p>Of course this wouldn\'t be entirely new, if true, given the reports of the other child, Elliot, who was made to recite a &quot;positive review&quot; of Comet Ping Pong and the man claiming to be his father (also an associate with Comet Ping Pong) apparently made him start dressing and passing as a female -- that video was unfortunately deleted, but you might be able to find a copy of it floating around still. </p>
<p>Now regardless of what Caris\'s true gender is, the main observation that needs to be made is that almost all of these pictures of Caris are indoors, and he or she does not appear to be particularly happy. </p>
<p>If you have any experience with reading the emotions that children are experiencing, and you look at Caris\'s eyes, you can see something is amiss. </p>
<p>An example is the photo of foreign currency.  Caris seems confused and frightened, as if James was forcing him/her to insert foreign currency orally, moments before taking the photo. It looks like the child was acting under force or possibly the threat of punishment, rather than voluntarily. And given that the infant\'s mouth is so small, it is troubling to note how deeply the currency is penetrating. </p>
<p>Did Alefantis forcefully push this money into the infant\'s mouth to take a photo?</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/paHbf2.png">https://i.sli.mg/paHbf2.png</a></p>
<p>Regardless, what was the point of him taking a photo of an infant with currency in its mouth in the first place? Who does that? Would you put cash inside of your baby\'s mouth, knowing all of the germs that are on money? And why was the infant with Alefantis is a foreign country in the first place? What were they doing there?</p>
<p>The photo of Caris\'s little arms being taped down to the table is deeply troubling. </p>
<p>Alefantis says in an interview (in a manner suggesting that he was rehearsing the line for days) that it\'s a picture of children &quot;playing.&quot;Eerily, there are no other children seen in the photo besides Caris. </p>
<p>And it seems preposterous that another child could tape down Caris\'s hands so firmly and uniformly. The taping appears to have been done by someone with the strength and competence of an adult, and indeed there appears to be a grown man just inches behind Caris when the photo is taken. </p>
<p>Again, Caris does not look happy, but puzzled as to what is occurring. The child seems visibly fatigued as well. </p>

<p>If you look closely, you can also see strange bruises or marks on his/her face:</p>
<p>Another poster provided close-up imagery and some important questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photos of Caris James from the instagrams, in chronological order: <a href="http://sli.mg/dkpNmv">http://sli.mg/dkpNmv</a></p>
<p>James/Christopher Alefantis claims in the recent video to be Caris\'s godfather. Someone also refers to him as grandpa Jimmy.</p>
<p>Where is this child? Nobody has found a trace of her. The last known photo of her (playing with PVC tape) is from early 2015. There do not appear to be any photos of her outdoors, and there are signs of abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>Why did godfather Jimmy take Caris to Europe when she was an infant, and why does the only travel photo show her chewing on $1000 stacks of euros?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our intention here is only to ensure that Caris\'s parents are both biologically related to her, and that she is in safe hands. I think I speak for everybody when I say we would be very relieved to be shown that nothing sinister is being done with this child. </p>
<p>Remember, we are justified in being concerned about this, given all the photos that James Alefantis himself posted. Yes he himself is the one using an explicit icon of pedophilia as his instagram avatar, and making references to romantic relations with &quot;pizza&quot;, etc. We are not prying or making up &quot;fake news&quot; about him, only responding with natural curiosity to what we have been shown by him, and hoping for the best.</p>',

            Red marks on a young baby don't mean much, they always rub their faces when tired and whatnot. I do agree about the bags under her eyes, that don't look good on a child.

            As a father of a kid of similar age, a few red marks don't mean a lot. They hurt themselves all the time. Having said that, yes that kid is in danger, because their entire circle of friends are fucked in the head.
