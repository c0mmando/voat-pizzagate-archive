<blockquote>
<p>Legal expert and timeshare cancellation <strong>Attorney Susan Budowski</strong> has added a total cost of ownership calculator to her timeshare website www.mytimeshareattorney.com. &quot;The importance of this calculator is that it shows timeshare owners or perspective buyers what the true cost of ownership will be for the next 5, 10, 20 even 30 years. I have not seen or heard of a timeshare company that conveys this during their sales presentations,&quot; Budowski says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The state with the highest number of consumer complaints and victims of timeshare scams is Florida. The Attorney General\'s office in this state continues to prosecute numerous timeshare companies that have attempted to operate illegally. <strong>In Orlando, Attorney Susan Budowski, a Child Advocate for Abused and Neglected Children</strong>, recently added Timeshare Advocacy to her law practice, after “…listening to the heartbreak and sadness of couples and individuals who agreed to a “sales presentation” and ended up timeshare owners, although they had no intention, plans and or even the financial-where-with-all to complete the transaction.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Ms. Budowski previously worked at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, Virginia</strong> where she received multiple Exceptional Performance Awards from high-ranking members of the CIA, including former CIA Director William Gates, who also served as Secretary of Defense for both President Bush and President Obama.</p>

<p>From the comments section of the above article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Susan Budowski was retained by Timeshare Advocacy International and as their attorney reviewed all of their documents and TAI assisted Susan in developing a strategy to assist TAI clients. Since then Susan issued TAI a disengagement letter. Prior to her speaking with TAI Susan had no insight into the timeshare industry and is now calling herself an expert in the field. Is it ethical for an attorney to take her clients business model and go into business for herself within 2 weeks?</em></p>
