            thats not true. I am saying people keep looking for the organization responsible to punish itself. I think this is a battle that needs to be waged by us citizens not by presidents congress or government.

            God I hope we are not all being had.  I am hoping it is for real.  We are giving up our fresh water and hope for clean air and also less help for the poor to help our children.  If it is all fake, we will be even worse off than before.  I am praying and hoping.

            I'm sorry I'm just not that naive trump has to many kids and family that could me murdered killed etc to send him a message. THE fact that he's getting to do all of this makes mee feel like this is being done to pacify us. SOMETHING isn't right pepole are being to naive when it comes to trump. EXCUSE my skepticism and apprehension but something gs not right that he's getting to do all this unchallenged.

             I voted for him, reregistering after a long hiatus. Now I'm quite skeptical.

             Here is a painful FACT that people don't want to hear:  EVERY U.S. presidential "election" -- 1789 on -- has been "won" by the candidate who had the most royal genes.  That is 100% so NO ACCIDENT.  Burke's Peerage, who does the genealogy for the House of Windsor, researched this years ago.  Unfortunately, the original article has been removed from their website, but copies exist on other sites.

             I believe that this is nothing but a BIG SHOW.  The recent revelation about his involvement with those islands really bothers me.

              We all have royal genes if you dig enough. Learn some history, maybe watch brace heart if books are too hard. Royals used to get first crack at the virgins. Their seed has been propagated pretty much everywhere.

            Did you notice the kid had on red shoes? Remember pic with Tony Podesta and everybody had on red shoes?  The Pope wears red shoes.  What does this mean? I don't know maybe I am reading too much in the shoes and hand signal which does signify 6. I would rather wish for what OP is saying.

            There have been no "pizza arrests" there have been human trafficking arrests, the same ones that have been happening for years. As for Sessions "firing" all Obama attorneys, every time a new administration takes office it is standard procedure for them to ask the previous admins political appointees to resign.

             It reminds me of the "war on drug" arrests right now. Bust a bunch of little guys so the masses are placated and everyone shuts up. I'm hoping it's the real deal, but I have my doubts.
