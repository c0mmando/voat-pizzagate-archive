            That is what this is all really about: Satanic Ritual Abuse. We are all subjected to this, to one degree or another. It's time to wake up and fight back.

             There is no Satan, nor a Devil -- nor a Hell.  These are all inventions of Elites and their male-supremacist religions to control members and all of society.  In the end, they will not give up until they have total control over every living human being and enslave them mentally and physically.
            </p>
            <p>
             That doesn't mean that there isn't violence used against children and adults which is described to them as "Satanic" ... it simply means that these are evil people acting in evil ways for their own purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are some very important questions we can't necessarily answer right now -- 
First is whether this violence and sadistic behavior is in any way natural to humankind or whether it has been instilled in some way in some human beings?
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, is what we are seeing behavior "produced" by Mind Control methods?

            Thank you for this.  I have gone through some and will make sure to read it all.  This is a valuable Trove of Treasures in regards to the Brain Washing of the American Citizens by our Alphabet Agencies, Corrupt Leaders and the CIA.  I have not yet read about Operation Mockingbird and am not looking forward to it, but I know it is a necessary.

             You should read it -- it simply covers the program drafted two years before the end of WWII to take over our free press and the free press of the world.  Drafted by Cord Meyer, later CIA and run out of CIA by Allen Dulles.  Phil Graham of the Washington Post was selected to move the program in the US and by the time that Carl Bernstein wrote his article more than 30 years later our free press was pretty much gone.
Today we have a CIA/Corporate press.

              Thanks for reminding me.  I get so caught up, there is so much on here and I of course feel I need to see it all (impossible, but I like a fool still try).  What you just wrote is so very disappointing.  I had not known it was that long ago.  Do you think it is ALL of our news, meaning local stations as well, or just national news.  Ugh.  Did you get my message on St. Louis Info?

               PLEASE believe me ... it is simple and quick to look at the three programs begun before the end of WWII ... they are Mockingbird, Paperclip which actually involved 200,000 ex-Nazis brought into US to found our CIA, to be funneled into our FBI and other government organizations -- Gladio which was intended to keep ONLY right wing government in place in Japan, Germany, Italy, France -- the nations we had great influence and control over at end of WWII.  And the US actually resurrected the MAFIA in Italy in order to ensure that program was carried out there.  And Gladio was successfully carried out in all of those nations.
              </p>
              <p>
               And similar programs of course were carried out here -- VOTESCAM -- "The Stealing of America" via hack-able voting computers and large computers used by MSM which gave them the ability to remotely control and switch our votes.
              </p>
              <p>
               And, for MSM to have these new powers to call winners and losers of our election based on 1% or even 0% of the vote count -- HOWEVER previous to the large computers coming in our networks were only permitted to report
               <strong>
                ACTUAL
               </strong>
               vote tallies.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's essential to understand these 3 programs -- but we don't know whether there were hundreds of these programs or thousands.  You have to keep searching.  If you're looking for EVIL it can certainly be found in the CIA which betrayed our presidents, as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               John Stockwell, former CIA, has reported on their "doings" for decades now.
I originally saw him on C-span and since then I've tried to follow him on YouTube, for one.
I only recently noticed that he calls the CIA ... "Catholic Church In Action."
              </p>
              <p>
               Everything is corrupted -- though I think you can recognize those outlets still trying to tell some truth, independent journalists, etc.  Certainly all of our networks, including PBS and NPR, as well are co-opted by these influences.  Both of our national political parties are totally taken over.  I think the History/Discovery Channel continues to try to tell us truth, but they were very seriously attacked in 2000 when one of their programs was confiscated and all copies destroyed.
              </p>
              <p>
               That was a program which reported on the results of the 1993 JFK Classified Records Act which was headed up by John Tunheim and a panel of four others who got to look at all of the remaining records on the assassination ... which, of course, included Oswald's employment records which had long been denied to our reporters and journalists who had been asking for those records since 11/22/63 and they were always denied access to them.
              </p>
              <p>
               The conclusion of the Tunheim Panel was ...
              </p>
              <p>
               "OSWALD WAS EMPLOYED BY THE CIA WORKING ON HIGH LEVEL ASSIGNMENTS
AND PROBABLY ALSO FOR THE FBI."
              </p>
              <p>
               Oswald was exactly what he said -- a "patsy" -- however, he had likely tried to save JFK with his cables to the FBI reporting on the coming assassination attempt and it is believed that Oswald also caused them to abort an attempt on JFK in Chicago as word did reached the Secret Service of an assassination attempt which many believe came also from Oswald.
              </p>

               In Florida, about 1967, two brothers who were journalists and quite familiar with
politics there and how machines could be rigged decided that one of them should
run for public office and write a story about the experience .. which they did.
              </p>
              <p>
               On election night they saw what we frequently see -- their numbers would rise to a high
level and then suddenly there'd be an interruption in the counting and when the numbers
were shown again all of their gains had been lost.  And, finally, the results being show were
generally very odd and unbelievable.  They began an investigation of the machines and saw
that they could be remotely controlled.  They wrote a book and had a publishing contract, but
when after the books were delivered to books stores and put up on shelves they were quickly
taken down again and returned to the publisher.
              </p>
              <p>
               The book does exist -- it did finally get published long afterwards.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's available for $3.00 here in there -- it was always in paperback.
              </p>

               I'm giving this info for anyone who wants to follow VOTESCAM -- but ensure that all the pages are intact.  One library copy that I had eliminated one of the most important pages.

               Believe I've read all of the links and info you've given me.  :)

                Whoa.  That is a lot of info to take into my brain.  I read it all and will order the book ( I love real books).  I will read up on Operation Mockingbird and Paperclip and Gladio.  Votescam.  I had no idea it started that early, although I know there is a large operation going on.  This must be exposed.  This is all scary stuff, but I have always believed that the truth shall set us free.  Thank You Again.

             Carl Bernstein wrote this in '77 for Rolling Stone. It's long, but very enlightening about Operation Mockingbird.
