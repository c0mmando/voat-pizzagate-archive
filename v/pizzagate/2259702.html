            I recommend not reading this right before you go to bed.  This is so sinister and manipulative.  He is an ogre and monster.  Many officials refused to investigate which speaks volumes.  Who is he?  Is he involved in other things. Are they protecting him, it seems so.  Branding? What century is he living in anyway?

             also the chat out there is Diana Jenkins was heavily involved in Haiti relief efforts in 2010. Connects to Barclay's bank Arab investors, runs call girl/party-girl ring for Arabs, Wall Street, DC, Royals, and Hollywood elites. oan Collins...years ago was offered 400 million dollars for her services as a Madam from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. She was almost sold to him almost thirty years ago by her third husband. Starting out her career as a high class prostitute in Hollywood at the age of 17 Joan learned the business from the ground floor up. She started the Heidi Fliess Hollywood Hooker ring. Sheen would connect a lot of dots... back in the 70s, 80s and 1990s they were no mobile cell phones everywhere, no computers...so its possible some of this stuff could be kept quiet and buried by their minders...or kept in quiet circles...now everything is getting exposed... Also Brett Ratner/Serena Williams/ Polanski /Charlie Sheen...there is a connection through work and social circles, ...later reddit censors pizzagate... Armenian middleeast German Co-founder of Reddit &amp; Serena Williams couple. Serena Williams and Brett Ratner accused rapist are all directly connected or were in the same social circles? ...also kevin spacey flew to private islands, flew an island off africa : conspiracy

              I just commented on Sheen.  He has been on my radar for a while.  He is a real sicko.  His ex has claimed she found CP on his laptop and he tried to poison her reputation to cover up his dirty habits.  He probably has many connections with LE.  I just learned of this Diane Jenkins recently.  She thinks she is still under cover and untouchable, but her hame is popping up more often.  We should delve into her background and someone should do a post just on her.  People are joining us on here day by day their are more and more and we can Open Their Eyes Wide Shut.  Diana Jenkins, A Name To Be Reckoned With.  Post It Now.

               Yeah I've seen that interview with Denise Richards, where she recalls the time she caught him looking at CP on his laptop while on a plane. And when he noticed her looking, he told her to "fuck off."

                Not surprised at Sheen's response.  Probably one of his favorite words. On an airplane no less. Oh, I forgot, they were probably in a private cabin withe his money.

                 Most likely. Ms. Richards said that he was looking at it "right in the open" and wasn't hiding it. He got angry not because she saw it, but because she told him to turn it off. I hope he dies painfully of AIDS.

            Can confirm. I was kind of waiting to say this but I think it's a chicken or egg thing, they could have been groomed to a point where they seemed trained enough for a role or abused after. Either way the parents are facilitating it. One of the most important things is just teach them secrets are wrong, otherwise it's hard to tell exactly what's going on. Think of it, a young kid gets offered a role he has to tell his parents how he got it. Unless the relationship isn't that close. This connects with child protective services but also the parents are to blame - they can't tell what's going on but it's their fault for being so invested in social media to the point their kids aren't properly socialized.
