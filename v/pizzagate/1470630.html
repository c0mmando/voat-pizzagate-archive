            I can't remember right but I know some 7th floor group/shadow government stuff was mentioned in some FBI docs a few months back.

            And I think FBI Anon said check into the Bill and Mellinda Gates foundation or at least check on them, These both were from the 5th AMA. I used a pdf version of all the AMAs because it is easier to search through.

            Very interesting actually. I know the movie and TV industry is used for covert communications and they also use numbers and symbolism to communicate in plain sight and agenda 2030 reminds me of a movie about a chaotic 2016 election. You would have to watch it to know what I mean. But I don't remember what its called, it may actually be "Election 2016" which would make it extremely difficult to find right about now. It was a si-fi involving an addictive electronic VR device, rape and murder. But pay attention to the "news" in the back ground and other odd little things.

            Also your regard to coincidence reminds me of 9/11 building number 7 that was so far away and undamaged collapsed for no reason.
