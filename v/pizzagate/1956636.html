<p>Victim Claims Sandusky Sex Scandal Connected to Philadelphia Pedophile Network -</p>
<p>Pennsylvania radio talk show host Mark Madden dropped a bombshell during an appearance on  WEEI when he told
 radio talk show hosts John Dennis and Gerry Callahan, “I hear there’s a rumor that there will be a more shocking
 development from the The Second Mile (TSM)—and hold on to your stomachs, boys, this is gross—that 
Jerry Sandusky and the Second Mile were pimping out young boys to rich donors</p>
<p>Now, further evidence that Jerry Sandusky’s TSM was being used to traffic underage boys to wealthy donors
 took a major step forward via a July 19 interview with Greg Bucceroni, currently employed as a school police 
officer in the Philadelphia, Pa. school district while also volunteering with the District Attorney’s office.</p>
<p>Bucceroni told this reporter, “—when I was 13 and 14 years old—a well-connected pedophile named Edward Savitz took 
me on trips from Philadelphia to TSM fundraisers. I knew the minute I got there it was a breeding ground because of
 Savitz’s involvement. While [Jerry] Sandusky interacted with wealthy donors, the other men were sizing-up kids. I felt
 like a cheap whore because I was in these naked pictures that Savitz was passing around.”
When asked how certain he was in regard to these claims, Bucceroni replied, “I’m sure of it. Savitz talked about taking kids 
from Philly to TSM and introducing them to men—soliciting them to ‘his friends.’ They exchanged and swapped kids like baseball
 cards. It was a feeding frenzy. . I felt dirty, used and cheap.”
When it came to TSM’s founder, Bucceroni didn’t overplay what happened. “Savitz introduced me to Sandusky on two separate occasions, but he didn’t come across like a pedophile. The other guys at these functions, though, were different. I could tell from their body language what they had in mind. When I met him, Jerry was a like a movie star. Everyone called him ‘Coach.’ 
After Savitz hand-delivered my enrollment forms to him, Jerry grabbed me by the shoulder—not in a sexual way—and said, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll take care of you.’ Savitz told me that Jerry would take kids to football games.”
Sexually abused victims who testified at the Sandusky trial in Bellefonte, Pa. confirmed this point.</p>
<p>As questioning turned to other individuals at these get-togethers, Bucceroni remarked, “They were obviously 
wealthy—like doctors, attorneys, politicians and businessmen—and I could tell some were married from their wedding 
rings. But their body language gave away their intentions. On my second trip to TSM, I went with Savitz, another pedophile,
 and a boy my age. Savitz mingled with the other adults, discreetly showing them child porn pictures that he’d brought 
along. These are the kinds of places where guys from New York, Jersey and Pa. interact. Plus, with all the Penn State
 hoopla, TSM promoted itself as an alternative to jail or juvenile hall. They said it was the best thing since peanut butter
 and jelly. But Sandusky is just one in a handful of them. I hope you shine a light on this society of pedophiles.”
 nearly a month after Jerry Sandusky’s conviction on 45 counts  Sara Ganim of Harrisburg’s Patriot-News revealed,
 “Sources close to the Jerry Sandusky case say that three men have come forward and told police that they were 
abused in the 1970s or 1980s by the convicted pedophile.” She continued, “If found to be credible, [they] would directly 
attack the 68-year-old’s defense argument that a person doesn’t become a pedophile in his or her 50s.”</p>',

            So right, they don't become pedophiles that late in life.  The do it all their lives, usually already when they are 17 or 18 , that is when some get started, sometimes some teens as young as 15 abuse their sisters or cousins.  it is disgusting at any age.
