I call him HLI, but he has used many &quot;sockpuppet&quot; identities including HighLevelInsider, Senate Anon, and Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt. He is also the YouTuber &quot;Tory Smith&quot;. In this installment, I revisit <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2218774">my Day 8 post</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1770744">a post I made in April</a>. See <a href="https://voat.co/user/SoberSecondThought/submissions">my submission history</a> for all reports to date.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>In this series, I have admitted to some minor mistakes. For instance:</p>
<p>I thought HLI deleted two posts <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2223859/10961447">but Millenial_Falcon did</a>.</p>
<p>I assumed Susan Sanders was Herb Sanders\' wife, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2236529/11038441">but she is his daughter</a>.</p>
<p>I\'m now admitting to a <strong>deliberate</strong> and major misstatement. In my Day 8 post, I said Paul Ryan was the Speaker in June 2013. But John Boehner was. He beat Nancy Pelosi in the election of Jan 2011, and again in 2013, resigning as Speaker on Oct 29, 2015. Ryan took over, after Boehner\'s first choice, Kevin McCarthy, was rejected by the rank and file.</p>
<p>Credibility is essential to this project. So why take the risk of giving wrong info? I had a theory about the cover-up. Things that Brock and HLI <em>don\'t</em> talk about, can be far more important than things they do. I needed proof. What they chose to do about my &quot;mistake&quot; would tell me if I was right.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2211222">On Day 3</a>, I gave an example of this pattern. Obama\'s mentor, Frank Davis, almost certainly molested him as a boy. As a state senator, Obama hung out in gay clubs. A witness, Larry Sinclair, says he performed oral sex on Obama, twice. Two other gay men linked to Obama were killed execution-style in 2007, when he was about to run for President. </p>
<p>No sockpuppet operated by HLI has ever gone anywhere near this very credible story. Instead, when it comes to Obama, they talk about anything else. Now, some stories that HLI chooses to tell about Obama may be true. But the main goal here is misdirection. If people are talking about &quot;Michelle is a tranny,&quot; or Obama being CIA from birth, then true or not, they aren\'t tying him to pedophilia.</p>
<p>Another example: Neither WIC nor ESOTERICshade have ever acknowledged the anomalies in the Milwaukee recount. They won\'t debate me about it, not even uttering the word &quot;Milwaukee&quot;. When challenged, they invariably change the subject. Strange since it\'s a provable crime by the Clinton gang <strong>in Wisconsin</strong>.</p>
<p>Here\'s why that pattern matters today: None of HLI\'s sockpuppets <em>ever</em> mention John Boehner, for any reason. &quot;Tory Smith&quot; accused practically every employee or agency of the federal government, including 70 Senators, Dick Cheney, Bernie Sanders, the Air Force, ICE, FBI, CIA, etc. But no Boehner. He may have mentioned Boehner in early deleted videos, but his remaining videos date back only to November 2015, <strong>a week after Boehner resigned</strong>.</p>
<p>You can check the saved texts of HighLevelInsider, both here and on /pol/, and see that he never mentioned Boehner. Senate Anon never did either. Most surprising of all, <a href="https://voat.co/user/Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt">@Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt</a> has never mentioned Boehner. This is the shocking one. It doesn\'t matter whether you view WIC as a sockpuppet, or as genuine. Either way, WIC\'s silence about Boehner is very strange.</p>
<p>It is strange (a) because WIC casts a huge net of vague accusations centered on Paul Ryan, yet never mentions the man who asked him to take over as Speaker. But even stranger, (b) WIC and I were engaged in a nasty confrontation for five days before I made my Day 8 claim that Ryan was Speaker in 2013. Our fights continued until Day 12, and have re-erupted several times since.<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2218774/10952064"> WIC called me &quot;a lying evil piece of garbage,&quot;</a> among other names. So why would he not humiliate me for getting this wrong? &quot;Hey genius, nice theory about Paul Ryan, except he wasn\'t Speaker in 2013!&quot; Zing!</p>
<p>Only one reason makes sense. Comments here are accessible to Google, easy for any investigator to find. If HLI/WIC said nothing <strong>it must be massively damaging for Boehner\'s name to even get mentioned along with the Glenn Beck whistleblower incident</strong>. That\'s why Brock and HLI let me get away with saying Ryan was Speaker, rather than correct me. Ryan and Pence remain important, but Boehner emerges as the real key. <strong>I believe that Boehner was the weak link in executing the plan.</strong></p>
<p>If you haven\'t already, please read my two previous submissions (links above). Then bring up<a href="https://youtu.be/7K0JqC6T-wM"> the Beck video</a> once more, to see the clues relating to Boehner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BECK: We talked about the NSA whistleblower, and I think -- am I like really one of the only ones? Am I really alone on the right?</p>
<p>GRAY: You\'re not alone. There are some.</p>
<p>3RD VOICE OFFSCREEN: It is divided, though. I would say it is divided, yeah.</p>
<p>GRAY: It is, definitely. And as we talked to the Congressmen yesterday -- I talked to several of them about the whistleblower -- a lot of them believe that it\'s a good thing it\'s out, [but] they don\'t like the way he did it. They wanted him to come to some committee, they wanted him to go to Congress. </p>
<p>BECK: Yeah, well, whatever.</p>
<p>GRAY: And like I said to one of these Congressmen, he\'s probably doing this in part for his safety, because if it was me, I\'d want it out there, so I\'ve got some protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all has new meaning when we put Boehner into the story. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/nsa-leak-edward-snowden-john-boehner-092562">He was quoted the day before (Jun 11), calling Snowden a traitor</a>. So when Beck and Gray say those &quot;on the right&quot; want whistleblowers before Congress, they are talking about Boehner. Beck himself did not see Snowden as a traitor; he would have broadcast this new whistleblower live on his show. But that wasn\'t possible. The end result is still the same as I said on Day 8: Beck had to believe that the Speaker (Boehner, not Ryan) would invite the whistleblower to address Congress, or he never would have mentioned him or the document.</p>
<p>The revised sequence of events goes like this: The whistleblower reached out to Paul Ryan (the &quot;ally&quot; Beck mentioned), asking for security (using Pence), release of documents online and on TV (using Beck), and an address to Congress (through Boehner). Ryan remains the only logical choice for this role. He had the personal relationships to make all three things happen. After maybe 24-48 hours of working with Pence and Boehner, the plan looked like a &quot;go,&quot; so on the 11th, Ryan told Beck of the plan and gave him the document. Then sometime on the 12th (perhaps during Beck\'s broadcast), the plan fell apart.</p>
<p>Before we examine Boehner\'s role, there\'s a loose end here, an unnamed Senator who may have played a part. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>BECK: I was talking to a Senator yesterday, and he said, &quot;What\'s it about?&quot; And I said, &quot;Senator, I\'m not going to tell you what it\'s about. I\'ll just tell you that it will take down the GOP, it will take down the Democrats, it will take down many members of Congress, it will take all of them down, and outside of Congress. It will take them down.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Beck confided in the wrong Senator, that could have wrecked the plan. But my guess is that this was Rand Paul, another favorite of Beck\'s. I doubt Beck would be dumb enough to say this to, say, Chuck Schumer, or to any Democrat or Republican he didn\'t trust implicitly. But he would trust Rand Paul. The Senator from Kentucky is very unlikely to be tied into the Clinton child sex trafficking operation. Nothing is guaranteed, but I would suspect <em>at least</em> 95 other Senators before I\'d suspect him.</p>
<p>So far I haven\'t found a disinfo/punishment campaign aimed at Rand Paul. Or rather, since he is the subject of many rumors, I should say I haven\'t found any <em>new</em> campaign. But since he never saw the document, or knew just what the big story was, perhaps no campaign was needed.</p>
<p>Now, what went wrong? What did Boehner do? We still don\'t know. I think he was bullied or blackmailed, rather than being bribed or a pedo himself. (It seems very unlikely that he is a pedo. The whistleblower would have known from intelligence intercepts, and not bothered asking to address Congress.) Boehner isn\'t necessarily a traitor in the strict sense; it might have been duress, or speaking to the wrong person. But the evidence says he was the weak link. Pence and Ryan were targeted by major, prolonged disinfo, implying that HLI/Brock did not trust them to stay quiet. Boehner seems to have suffered no punishment (at least since he resigned), and yet HLI/Brock are still unwilling, four years later, to even say his name.</p>
<p>There is other evidence too. If you had to pick someone who would fold under pressure, Boehner would be a top choice. First, he is known as a &quot;go along to get along&quot; guy, not a hardliner. He took a lot of money from lobbyists, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boehner">when he retired, he became a lobbyist himself <em>and</em> took a board seat with Big Tobacco</a>.</p>
<p>Second, Boehner is reportedly an alcoholic, &quot;hammered&quot; by early evening every day. In Sep 2015, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/02/glenn-beck-wanted-to-stake-out-bars-to-prove-john-boehner-is-an-alcoholic/">Beck wanted to do a story on Boehner\'s alcoholism</a>, as well as his complete lack of principle, but his staff vetoed the idea. Boehner resigned within weeks even though they did not run the story.</p>
<p>Finally, Boehner is a Catholic. He said he stayed on until he could get Pope Francis to address Congress, in Sep 2015. He wept openly while Francis spoke. He then resigned a few weeks later. Perhaps a gesture of contrition? Worth considering anyway.</p>
<p>So that\'s my revised view of the Glenn Beck whistleblower episode. Sorry for misleading people, but it did work. Comments?</p>',

I doubt Beck would be dumb enough to say this to, say, Chuck Schumer, or to any Democrat or Republican he didn't trust implicitly. But he would trust Rand Paul. The Senator from Kentucky is very unlikely to be tied into the Clinton child sex trafficking operation. Nothing is guaranteed, but I would suspect
           <em>
            at least
           </em>
           95 other Senators before I'd suspect him.
          </p>
          <p>
           So far I haven't found a disinfo/punishment campaign aimed at Rand Paul. Or rather, since he is the subject of many rumors, I should say I haven't found any
           <em>
            new
           </em>
           campaign. But since he never saw the document, or knew just what the big story was, perhaps no campaign was needed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, what went wrong? What did Boehner do? We still don't know. I think he was bullied or blackmailed, rather than being bribed or a pedo himself. (It seems very unlikely that he is a pedo. The whistleblower would have known from intelligence intercepts, and not bothered asking to address Congress.) Boehner isn't necessarily a traitor in the strict sense; it might have been duress, or speaking to the wrong person. But the evidence says he was the weak link. Pence and Ryan were targeted by major, prolonged disinfo, implying that HLI/Brock did not trust them to stay quiet. Boehner seems to have suffered no punishment (at least since he resigned), and yet HLI/Brock are still unwilling, four years later, to even say his name.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is other evidence too. If you had to pick someone who would fold under pressure, Boehner would be a top choice. First, he is known as a "go along to get along" guy, not a hardliner. He took a lot of money from lobbyists, and
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boehner">
            when he retired, he became a lobbyist himself
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            took a board seat with Big Tobacco
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Second, Boehner is reportedly an alcoholic, "hammered" by early evening every day. In Sep 2015,
           <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/02/glenn-beck-wanted-to-stake-out-bars-to-prove-john-boehner-is-an-alcoholic/">
            Beck wanted to do a story on Boehner's alcoholism
           </a>
           , as well as his complete lack of principle, but his staff vetoed the idea. Boehner resigned within weeks even though they did not run the story.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally, Boehner is a Catholic. He said he stayed on until he could get Pope Francis to address Congress, in Sep 2015. He wept openly while Francis spoke. He then resigned a few weeks later. Perhaps a gesture of contrition? Worth considering anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
           So that's my revised view of the Glenn Beck whistleblower episode. Sorry for misleading people, but it did work. Comments?

The evidence of rigging and the evidence of pedosadism are intertwined in the same set of emails and financial transactions. The cover-up engineered by Brock and paid for by Sandler is supposed to cover both. If

             You're getting confused about who "we" are. That is a recurring problem of yours. I started posting here 8 months ago, and you started four months ago. Unless you want to confess that you were here earlier, under one or more alternative names? Plus, Jem777 already tried that argument, and failed completely. I invited her to show where anyone had connected Sandler to the Media Matters slush fund, or the slush fund to the disinfo campaign going on here. She put up four old posts, I explained why none of them did these things,
             <a href="https://www.voat.co/v/pizzagate/2236529/11037543">
              and then ASolo, the original author of two of those posts, agreed with me
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Research is only useful if it is specific. What I have been working on has not been worked on before, on Voat or anywhere else that I can discover. Now, do you want to try telling me how (a) you don't give a crap about John Boehner, plus (b) everyone knew all about him before I arrived, plus (c) he's not relevant to the work "we" do here either?

              What you are failing to understand, or refuse to acknowledge, that almost nobody is going to read all your complex dribble because it does not apply to what we do. It shows your desperation to cover Ryan's ass. It could not be anymore obvious that you have an agenda to divide and conquer. Now fuck off.

                Done with your disassociated BS. You just need to tell us why Racine is not neck deep in child trafficking instead of playing in the woods. That is why you are here. Your focus is crystal clear. You don't really care about all the filler in your dribble, its just a cover for your focus on child trafficking in Racine. But your attempts are so clumsy that I can clearly see you hiding.

            This time you said HLI removed two of your posts. Last time you said somebody named polwarrior removed two of your posts.

               It doesn't matter. You already blew it. What makes you think that people who are obsessed with stopping pedophiles are going to stroke out about a voting fraud problem in Milwaukee?
              </p>
              <p>
               And the fact that WIC ignores this voting problem makes WIC a liar according to you? You write a lot but but you don't understand pizzagate well enough to shill in this sub.

             Exactly as I said, he refuses to even type "Boehner" or "Milwaukee," much less refute my claims.

           <h1>
           </h1>
           <p>
            I am going to repeat this one more time. What I am about to say PROVES this person is lying.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those of you who do not know Tory Smith, he was a YouTuber that started posting in 2015. I think some of his earliest videos got deleted. Supposedly he was abused as a child and it continued into adulthood.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you were to watch his videos, you would clearly see that he was mentally ill. Possibly from past mind control or something of that nature. I will explain why. He made videos regularly exposing child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            He would name names, agencies, politicians, military officials, bases, Milabs, everything and everyone he knew to be involved in child trafficking. The White House, Congress, Pentagon, Military, Air Force, SOCOM, AFRICOM, NORTHCOM, FBI, CIA, NSA, DARPA, Obama's, Bush's, Clinton's, and the Pence's...
           </p>
           <p>
            He focused a lot on Mike Pence because Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana and Tory Smith lived in Indiana.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason I say I think he was mentally ill, is because he would also make other claims. SoberSecondThought posted this himself so knows this.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He uses these gifts to make a mind-boggling number of accusations. His core claim is that there are 41 secret trafficking centers around the world, created by the Bush family and run jointly by the CIA, FBI, DARPA, NSA, and various alien reptilians, insectoids, 'tall whites,' non-physical spirits, dark entities, Nazi war criminals, and so on. In these centers, high-ranking people can pay to rape and murder children (he cites a price of $41,000 per child). These are abducted in the tens of thousands from all over the world, by the Chinese, Queen Elizabeth, the Air Force, NATO, the Rand Corporation, the Vatican, the Los Angeles city council, and countless others. Tory has named hundreds of people as guilty of child rape and murder, including the Bushes, the Clintons, Obama, Rahm Emanuel, James Comey, Dick Cheney, 70 U.S. Senators, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
             John Brennan (former head of the CIA) is a shape-shifting alien who has personally assassinated Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Whitney Houston's daughter, Paul Walker, Antonin Scalia, and Robin Williams, using a stun gun. He had to shoot Michael Jackson 42 times with the stun gun to give him a fatal heart attack.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tory is also a martyr of the first order. First, there is the torment of him psychically viewing and relaying the details of countless thousands of child murders, often including the names, ages, and favorite foods of the kids. He is "injected with weapons-grade anthrax daily" by DARPA. He has been raped in 14 of the 41 centers, including three times by Rand Paul(!), but has somehow managed to survive. The government also continually interferes with his computer, supposedly making it hard to upload his videos on a regular schedule (although 202 videos in eight months seems pretty regular).
            </p>
            <p>
             This is pretty exhausting and loopy stuff to watch, and I have not by any means viewed all 202 of his videos.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I used to watch some of his videos because he tripped me out. I felt bad for him. I watched the poor man slowly deteriorating physically. He thought he was being poisoned for exposing everything. I think it was probably cancer or something.

            Wow. Whatever. These aren't even comparable. So I gathered some pictures to prove that Tory Smith was seriously dying and that it wasn't an act. His health declined very rapidly the last 3 months of his life. Here are 3 images.

I know people who do more elaborate looks just for Hallowe'en.

            This person continues to tarnish the name of a man that died. The poster even says he has no proof that Tory Smith didn't die. So he is basing his claims (this ridiculous series that he investigated for a year) on something he can't prove. On something he ADMITS HE CANNOT PROVE! On something that anyone with a brain can look at and see that the man was clearly dying. It wasn't an act. It wasn't makeup. He clearly lost a lot of weight and was getting weaker and weaker every week.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have stated over and over that I don't have an opinion on rather or not HLI, WIC, and everyone else is the same person. I am not defending them. What I do know is that what this poster bases his claims on is a LIE. He's working very hard to discredit posters from here, reddit and 4 Chan I believe. This is DISINFO and a limited hangout. This person has lost all credibility. He continues to write me trying to prove he's right and tries to use his manipulation tactics taught to him like I'm stupid. Analyzing me and my thought process. It didn't work. It won't work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm tired of wasting my time having to repeat myself because this PAID SHILL won't accept defeat. He fucked this project up. His gig is up. He isn't getting his October bonus check. He needs to put in some applications somewhere else because he SUCKS. He didn't expect someone to know all about Tory Smith. Well, he FAILED.
           </p>
           <p>
            I encourage anyone believing this "series" to not base your opinion off of anything to do with Tory Smith because he may have talked about some of the same topics as HLI and the others. Tory talked about MANY things like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I find it sick that he continues to slander the name of someone who died and cannot defend himself. Tory Smith had loved ones. The shill poster is so disrespectful and heartless.
           </p>
           <p>
            If he doesn't have solid proof, like he admits, he should STFU and not post this crap here. Go back to the drawing board. I think this person needs to be banned from the Pizzagate sub. I can't believe that this has gone on now for what? 11 days?!
           </p>
           <p>
            So that I don't have to waste all my time continuing to repeat myself every time this shill pings me, I am just going to save this and paste it every time. I have better things to do. The only reason I'm commenting right now is that I don't want you guys fooled by a deceptive shill that disrespects the dead and cannot accept defeat.

             obviously disagrees with me, I do not think she is one of the numerous sockpuppet accounts operated by HLI/Senate Anon/WIC. She has made something like 6,000 comments and/or submissions during her time here, and that is way beyond what anyone would do to create a sockpuppet.

             This is not fair or reasonable. Even if you believe I am wrong about Tory Smith, you don't get a free pass on all the other work I did. It's not just that they're the same person, it's that they work for David Brock, and are funded by Herb Sandler, and are in regular contact with James Alefantis. That matters, to you and to everyone who comes here. You don't get to pick one part of a large project and throw out everything else.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't like arguing with you because you're sincere and passionate and you've put in a lot of time on Voat. I have been polite, and have not accused you of anything worse than letting a criminal gang trick you. But you don't get to dismiss my project by picking one thing you don't like, concluding from that one point that I'm a liar, and dodging off with "I don't have an opinion" for everything else. These other questions are why we are here. If I show the financing trail from Sandler to Brock to HLI,

              You were building us up for the big reveal. Tory Smith wasn't just one little theory or mistake. That was your big aww haw moment. That made the whole theory crumble. The more I looked, the more I saw that most of what you said was based on your opinion and not on fact. Then, you started to defend Paul Ryan and and discredit WIC which makes me think that there is more to Racine than I thought because you were pushing it so hard. I appreciate you being nice. But I don't want anyone duped. It's not fair to discredit other people here without hard facts.

               Let's talk about HighLevelInsider. He started operations on /pol/ the day after Seth Rich was murdered. For ten months, he told an astounding number of bizarre lies, about everything from having a cure for cancer to the British Royal Family secretly controlling Saudi Arabia. He told everyone that Trump was as bad as Hillary and wouldn't win. Then he told everyone that 80 percent of Washington was controlled by blackmail and the swamp would never be drained. Then I posted about the Milwaukee recount, and
               <strong>
                exactly one week later,
               </strong>
               he set up shop here with a completely new, toned-down persona, and tried to take control of research by "revealing" that James Alefantis had a connection to the Jesters, and the Jesters had a connection to Adams Morgan.
              </p>
              <p>
               I proved that he wasn't revealing insider information, he was passing off the work of Voaters as his own. I proved that he was using sockpuppets here, like ababcb. None of that is opinion. As a result, HighLevelInsider has stopped posting, and ababcb has stopped posting, and Voaters no longer bother researching the Jesters.
              </p>
              <p>
               It doesn't take a genius to figure out that getting rid of one or two sockpuppets isn't going to stop a determined disinfo campaign. So then I showed where the money and resources and planning were coming from -- David Brock's Media Matters. I also showed Brock's emails arranging funding from Herb Sandler, who is literally the absolute center of Pizzagate. He's the one who asked John Podesta if he'd do better "playing dominoes" with pizza or pasta. I showed that he is paying someone to come here and manipulate you. No one had done that before I did it.
              </p>
              <p>
               You don't get to dismiss all that by parroting ESOTERICshade and WIC, saying that I "started to defend Paul Ryan," as though the 10,000 words of logic and evidence that came
               <em>
                before
               </em>
               Paul Ryan were nothing. If Wisconsin really
               <em>
                is
               </em>
               corrupt, then
               <strong>
                a massive, provable voting fraud in Milwaukee is something you should care about
               </strong>
               . You should be pissed off that WIC and ESOTERICshade keep dodging that subject. You should be confronting them as liars.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again, you have a responsibility to the other people in this community, to acknowledge obvious facts. You don't get to say that my whole theory crumbled, without ever once acknowledging what my theory actually says.

                Saudia Arabia is a puppet and a tool of the western banking oligarchs. Its true. Just because even shill HLI said it does not change reality. There are many cures for cancer, cannabis oil being one of the best. You're not very bright.

                Pizzagaters are not stupid enough to believe that since we don't focus on Milwaukee's voting fraud problems that it somehow makes WIC a liar and that Racine is clean. I think the problem is that you know so little about pizzagate that you think we are stupid enough not to notice that you make no sense.

                You don't even have a theory. You just write a bunch of distraction about Milwaukee voting fraud and a shill named HLI that pizzagaters ran off by themselves.

                Maybe HLI is a shill. I haven't dealt with him. You know that in the beginning I was paying attention. But using Tory Smith and how you reacted about it made you lose credibility in my eyes. I still don't have an opinion about WIC. But seeing you supposedly investigating something like this for a year and using evidence that is false doesn't lead me to believe that anything you said is believable. We need facts. It's strange that you put your time and effort doing this instead of investigating pizzagate.

            P.S.: I don't agree with WIC that Wisconsin is the root of corruption / pizzagate. But why should anyone put so much effort to show they disagree with him? This sub is about elite child rape, not about your (or your employer's) problems with WIC.

             You joined the pizzagate sub later on the same day that I posted the first part of this series. Quite the coincidence! We both know you're just a sockpuppet, spouting misdirection and lies, and being upvoated by other sockpuppets.

                Thats pretty funny coming from the person that said in order to do a raid in enemy territory a person has to spend months developing alt accounts so that voaters won't "scream shill at it."

                Funny how you thought all that out, 8 months account with only 386 CPP points. I notice you didn't drag your other alts along for the ride this time huh? You burned those last time.

                 I get that you have to say something, even if it's only "fuck you". But it's so agonizingly pointless when you (a) tell me people won't read my submissions because they're too long, and then (b) misrepresent something buried in a comment on a submission I made weeks ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's a bit of math for you. The view count for this post is made up of two kinds of people. First, there are those who have the patience to read several long submissions plus all the associated comments before arriving at a conclusion. They won't be fooled by this. Second, there are the people with short attention spans who gave up after the paragraph where I said, yet again, that David Brock pays a guy to come here and spread disinformation. They won't be reading this. Who are you writing for, at this point?
                </p>
                <p>
                 You're desperately hoping that if you just fling random accusations at me, there will be someone with the patience to read what I said, then read your accusation, and somehow get hypnotized or bullied into agreeing with you. Not likely.

            Hey bot brain, HLI does not moderate in this forum and cannot delete posts unless you are saying that Mil Falcon is also HLI which would bring your total to what now? About 8 or 10 people?

            I knew you're schtick was to cover Paul Ryan's ass all along. You are running out of shit to write and this time you went straight at protecting Paul Ryan by smearing WIC and it is so non pizzagate related, nonsensical, that it looks like it was written by a bot.
