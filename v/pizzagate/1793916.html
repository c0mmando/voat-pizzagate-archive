            SINCE YOU ARE POSTING ON THIS FORUM, LET"S JUST GO BY THIS FORUM'S DEFINITION OF PIZZAGATE, YOU DENSE MORON:
           </p>
           <p>
            Current Definition of "Pizzagate"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Pizzagate" refers to the independent investigation of pedophilia and child trafficking by the certain members of the global elite. The leaked John Podesta Emails hint at deeply entrenched and protected pedophile networks operating with impunity at the top levels of government and politics in and through Washington, DC and the world at large. The investigation initially focused on a group of businesses on Connecticut Avenue in Washington DC and their potential connection to a child trafficking ring. While this investigation began and centers around Comet Ping Pong, it involves multiple businesses and numerous connections around the globe. The name pizzagate is simply an easy to remember convenience, referring to what has been called "Pedocracy" which is the suspected, likely informal, association of elite individuals that use pedophilia to organize, manage and discipline their efforts to dominate or disproportionately influence outcomes in matters of interest. That includes government as well as politics -- executive, legislative, judicial, lobbying, military, intelligence -- as well as media, business, finance, law, medicine, accounting, technology, academia, think tanks, philanthropy, endowments, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is exactly what I have told you over and over, and that is also this forum's official stance on it. If certain specific members think otherwise and you want to argue with them, just take it the fuck offline and message them directly to get your kicks. You have no reason to come here whatsoever - you don't even know what Pizzagate is.

            wrong again. there was a photo hashtagged #chickenlover. A chicken lover is an adult male who is sexually interested in young boys. The photo shows an adult male and an infant in his arms, both of them wearing a shared necklace. "Chicken lover" is in many English dictionaries ffs.

            nope, you're totally wrong buddy. "Cheese pizza" is a well known dark web euphemism for child pornography. THAT'S why it's called pizzagate. The emails are extremely obviously in code - and my assertion that you are a fool when it comes to logic is only further validated by your disbelief in this. Once the investigation started, an absurd amount of information pointing to child exploitation was uncovered - nothing was cherry picked - those images were ALL over Alefantis' instagram - I saw this myself before it had been scrubbed. The pedophile references were impossible to miss.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one is "jumping to conclusions" regarding the involvement of people in power. That assertion comes from the fact that numerous victims of trafficking rings (such as that run by Epstein) have claimed they were forced into sexual acts with elites of all kinds from politicians to powerful businesspeople to lobbyists to law enforcement. Sibel Edmonds testimony also points to this - she in fact states specifically that it is a systemic problem involving both democrats and republicans. How you don't see a connection is further testament that you are the blatantly illogical one.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're dumb, flat out. Disprove me by telling me where you went to college, or what you studied, or anything that points to you having even a shred of intelligence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will not be responding hereafter as I have a job which demands my attention. It's an arrangement whereby someone pays you to work (usually during the day) - they're for people who don't spend all day making multiple accounts on forums they're constantly banned from for spamming. You wouldn't understand.

            no, you clearly don't. People have said from the very beginning (at least last October) that this is a global phenomenon, and while there may or may not be something illegal going on at CPP, there is most certainly a human/child trafficking problem worldwide, in which many powerful elites are involved. Do you dispute the existence of this worldwide phenomenon? If not, why exactly do you have a problem with those who are against it?

            what do you not understand? YOU do not define "what" Pizzagate is. The reasonable folks on this forum (and I readily admit some members are not) all recognize this is not an issue about one pizza parlor. why do you find that so hard to grasp?! I have told you this numerous times. I have also been present when others have reminded you of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            if anyone has the authority to define what circumstances and phenomena are part of "Pizzagate" - a term which didn't exist a year ago - it's the people who have actually contributed to investigative work, not you.
           </p>
           <p>
            re: the Sibel Edmonds testimony if you had done even a modicum of research you would know that she testified about the intelligence agencies knowing about ongoing sexual blackmail while under oath in front of congress. Additionally, she was presented with a Sam Adams award for her whistleblowing. Is that not proof enough to you?! You would know this if you were capable of actually looking up and absorbing information.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLEASE TELL ME, because I am genuinely curious due to how dumb you are, exactly what level of educational degrees you actually hold. Then let's compare SAT scores. Or salaries. Personally, I don't believe any of those things are actually indicative of intelligence, however, in your case I'm willing to bet they're so absurdly low that I won't feel bad for schooling and generally mocking someone who is A LOT stupider than I.

            You very clearly don't know anything about pedogate and you just reveal your ignorance every time you come here. I asked you to comment on the testimony of FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds yesterday (among many other times, check my comment history) and you never have. I have told you who she is repeatedly. I have pasted videos of her repeatedly (to you directly in threads, I feel it's important to specify this because it's not like you read this forum for the actual informational posts). That said, the fact that you come on here acting like an asshole is not an excuse for your ignorance. You spend time more time on this forum than I do yet somehow you've never run across the name Sibel Edmonds... but somehow you are convinced you have all the evidence and "superior critical thinking and logic skills" (which you most certainly do not, you've repeatedly refused to list any actual qualifications in the field of logic, which I have a doctorate in - mathematical logic specifically, but it's not like you know the fucking difference).

            Sibel Edmonds is an FBI whistleblower, she has repeatedly testified that federal appointees are often selected because of the fact that they have skeletons in their closets, often pedophilia, for the purposes of blackmail. This is one where she talks about Hastert specifically:

            and here's another that talks about the blackmail in depth:
