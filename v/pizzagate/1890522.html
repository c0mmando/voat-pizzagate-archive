            All the PPL in this seth-rich game that aren't going to JAIL have quit,
           </p>
           <p>
            The only PPL who remain are people that are going to JAIL, that be DOT-CON  &amp; Julian they're going to jail, unless they can become informants.
           </p>
           <p>
            They don't want to pass real INTEL to the public, then they have no assets.
           </p>
           <p>
            IMHO Kim-fat-ass ain't got shit, but there is a chance the Julian may have hardcore proof that Seth was the leaker, but he waits for the GOV to give him a deal that includes immunity for past crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fat-Ass ain't got shit, he just inserted himself to play the same game, and his extradition is coming quicker, than Julian having to leave the embassy.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Seth Rich is the Hockey Puk in all this and nothing more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Long ago when Julian was asked the source of DNC email's he said NOT-Russia, but high level US-GOV INTEL sources, well fuck SR is just a young kid in a DNC office, Julian at no time early on during the DNC leaks ever eluded that the leaker was just so low level new hire stealing private email.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears that Julian too, is just playing the game we see fat-ass playing, acting like you got something, that FBI wants, and holding off giving it to them to make your deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem here is all the PLAYERS are compromised they all got 'life in prison' hanging over their heads, that doesn't make an objective investigation for Seth Rich.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Probably all this explains why Seth's parents ain't playing the "FOX" game, nothing will bring their son back, and the parents are DNC people, thus given their son ain't coming back, why would they want to go down as the benedict arnold family that destoryed the DNC, and also there is probably some retirement &amp; pension funds involved, and ALSO if Seth Rich has committed a FELONY during his tenure, the family would get NO MONEY, so its NOT in their interest to cover that story.
           </p>

             WikiLeaks can't release info because they don't know it themselves, all there sources are anonymous so even WikiLeaks doesn't know their identity and compromise the source incase WikiLeaks themselves are compromised.  So supposedly they don't even want to know their sources for the sources own safety, it's for anonymity. That's why people feel safe leaking info to WikiLeaks. It sounds like they think Seth rich is the source but they can't even 100% prove it themselves.

              Thanks, but IMHO I think there is more too it, they're the recipient, not a man in the middle, and not a man across the street also communication does go on long before the dump to insure trust.

              I really think in this case they should make an exception, and get this over with before it dies.
