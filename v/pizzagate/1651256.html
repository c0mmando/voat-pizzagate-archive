<a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/fatherhood.webm">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/fatherhood.webm</a></p>
<p>As others have pointed out correctly - it is clear the child is inside a bath, behind a glass door, screaming out of panic and pain:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651045">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651045</a></p>
<p>This is the same monster &amp; child as displayed in the video &quot;Each&quot;:
<a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/each.mp4">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/each.mp4</a></p>
<p>In this video, the man is ordering the child, who is still inside the bath, to sing along with the opening song of the Canadian Kids Show Caillou:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEAI4Dsb82A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEAI4Dsb82A</a></p>
<p>There was a video a couple of days ago on the worldcorpo library that was taken down today when i re-entered this. anyone else seen it? it is a video of a child standing inside a bath with a glass door, child shaking out of cold (this is why he was screaming before? because of the cold water)? there black things allover the walls... probably feces.
that\'s the same child from the first video.</p>
<p>So, how do we know it\'s feces?
because the pervert is rapping about how he loves &quot;scat porn&quot; at 1:00 in this video:
<a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/malarkey.mp4">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/malarkey.mp4</a></p>
<p>It\'s also the same feces covered bathroom walls in this video (shampoo bottle helps place where we are):
<a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/oops.mp4">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/oops.mp4</a></p>
<p>If we needed further proof this is about child trafficking and abduction, this song and video make it clear:
<a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/midlife.mp4">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/midlife.mp4</a></p>
<p>Now where is this all happening? I believe this video explains that this is not someone\'s private house, but an isolated hotel (pizza-related handkerchief maps point the way to places like these maybe?) - that offers services of giving you abducted children to abuse and rape:
<a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/Worldcorpo\'s%20International%20Room%20&amp;%20Board%20Advertisment.mp4">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/Worldcorpo\'s%20International%20Room%20&amp;%20Board%20Advertisment.mp4</a></p>

            ("track from the basement mix tape" - shows a little girl playing hopscotch when a man approaches her; he 
offer her candy; she shares with a second girl; they follow him to his car and leave with him; he drives to a 
secluded area; one girl gets out and runs; he pulls the other girl out and drags her along trying to find the 
other girl; when he find her the other girls escapes and runs...video ends)
.
During the video there is a rap song being "sung" - the lyrics are posted (and in my screen shots) He's 
talking about how his wife hates him and won't have sex with him.  He speaks of f'd a Pringles can, living in 
his basement and not going outside; don't know what the outside of his house looks like any more.

shows his entire body and left side of his face. Note: same watch as in other videos; he appears to be in a 
basement or shed; notice concrete floor, wooden shed-like door; lots of yellow plastic tool bins, fishing 
poles, heavy yellow electrical cord on floor appears to be plugged in.)

            Worldcorpo is this guy's personal project, the guy who runs the page is a depressed married pedophile with kids. The videos he's uploading aren't all necessarily his. He's not being serious about actual locations etc, he's just completely depressed and maniacal. This website is his sick depraved joke of a project. If anyone could go through and listen to the guys voice in these videos and then compare it to the Fatherhood one we could have a lead and a possible conclusion. I can't listen to that video again i'm done with it
