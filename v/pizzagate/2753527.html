<p>Listen up Meme Warriors (many of you from reddit) I need all your help with a meme war operation. I intend this operation to be a joint operation between <a href="https://voat.co/v/thegreatawakening">v/thegreatawakening</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>. <a href="https://voat.co/user/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> can the mods sticky this and put a meme flair.</p>
<p>Operation Name: Operation Yep Yep Yep</p>
<p>Objective: Red Pill the masses about Pedowood by correlating Pedowood to one of the most tragic child actress deaths in America. Spread awareness to a case first seen on CDAN (crazy days and nights), but gets MUCH less attention from truthers and patriots than it rightly deserves.</p>
<p>This is the case that has potential to be the “Kill Shot” that brings down Pedowood, and thus pull off the shield protecting “them” from having pizzagate exposed.</p>
<p>Scope of Operation: This operation will operate in two teams if possible.
Meme Warriors: The Meme Warriors will be the primary strike force. Their mission is to Carpet bomb all social media (twitter, youtube, gab, etc) with memes conveying truth bombs regarding said incidents. Given the Mr Gunk Assault Incident, I say Spielberg is scared of “the goats”.</p>
<p>Black Watch (optional): Black Watch is essentially a hacker team. Their mission is on the day before the OP to go into the code of twitter and other pro censorship platforms -&gt; identify the coding for any hashtag censorship algorithims and shadow ban coding -&gt; disable it or destroy it. This will give the Meme Warriors the cyber warfare equivilant of “Aerial Superiority” for the Meme Warriors to go and meme completely unopposed. <a href="https://voat.co/user/Honey_Bee">@Honey_Bee</a> we could use some of your contacts for this.</p>
<p>Date of Operation: Either on 10/16/2018 or 11/8/2018 (30th anniversery of The Land Before Time). 4 AM EST for both cases.</p>
<p>Hashtags to use: #Pedowood #JudithBarsi #JusticeForJudithBarsi #Pizzagate #Pedogate #MeToo (yes, we’re HIJACKING the left’s hastags as part of this). Use the usual two scoops method normally used for Kekistani meme strikes.</p>
<p>Ammunition for this meme Op: The rest of this thread shall be dedicated to gathering memetic ammo for the op.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2738053">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2738053</a> The ENTIRE investigation into the Judith Barsi pedowood case. Identifies culprits, Spielberg’s ties to Bilderberg, his ties to the Bronfman Crime Family, exposes further pedowood web connections, and tears down the official narrative. The murder suicide narrative is bull shit.</p>
<p>Delve into the case and use its contents to create memes.</p>
<p>I have found some template images we can use for this op. Just need text (I have provided some sample text to go with the images). I do need stuff on Grand Climax, since that was the date when she was actually killed given other research.</p>

              Grand Climax - following your analysis - here is another post with more details of notable sacrifices during the Grand Climax (i.e.: names of children.) - Apologies if this was already posted in pizzagate.

             If you want, there’s some meme images right here in this thread that just need text on them to create finished memes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once we have some finished memes, this OP can do some serious flying.

             What I need are some cyber pedohunter groups like Anon Hive to act as “Black Watch” (ie hacker) to go into the code of pro censorship social media like twitter -&gt; identify any coding for hash tag suppression, censorship algorithms, and any shadow bans -&gt; destroy it so they’ll be completely defenseless when its time for the op.

              There is a setting -- it asks you if you want to consider your posts to come with a potential warning for others. You can unclick that, then it needs to wait for someone to complain about first.

             Daly said she had encouraged Maria several times to move out. But she said the woman would reply that she had worked too hard helping her daughter's acting career to give up her family and home. On Friday, Daly said, there appeared to be a more pressing reason not to leave.

             Maria Barsi must have been one heck of a energetic stage mother.  She must have ad some contact with SS.    She claims also to have had an apt. for decompressing.  That costs money. Wonder what happened to that 12K check.  I would wager that LE was more than happy to alter their report.

             It gives us a definite time stamp for the fire.

             Note that no date of the murders was indicated (the bang is the explosion), yet detective Palmer believes the deaths happened on 9/25 based on the account given by Judith Barsi’s agent.

             I suspect “Mocking Bird” is involved in the media around this time.

            They were not that smart stacking the family as they did.  You were smart enough to figure it out.  Those that have strong stomachs should really read the back threads on Judith and Heather.  Gut wrenching but so necessary if we want to get revenge for their murders.  :(

            Upvoat.  You are Amazing!  That picture of Caine with Judith on his lap is Powerful.  Now I know why I have disliked Caine all of my life.  Just starting to think of Judith and Heather makes me so  ready for this to finally expose these Little Girl Rapist Murderers  to the World.
