            These are all the kids in every state up for adoption through CPS, I remember reading a thesis paper about the benefits of having children's pics on their profiles for everyone to see....I do believe the paper was written by someone that was tied into this whole pizzagate investigation(I'll see if I can find it in my history and post it). If you check states websites they also have pics of the children and profiles, but this website just pulls all the states CPS kids that are up for adoption together.

             I highly doubt that.  That organization is put in place to protect kids.  It's literally their middle Name; "Child Protective Services."  If they were called "Child Abductor services" then maybe I'd believe you.

             You know what's extremely fucked up? The notion that I even need to clarify that I'm being facetious....That's not a knock on you by any means.  It's a knock on the people who are so retarded, you think they must be kidding.  In all of my posts I've had to deal with at least one person who would say something similar to what I just said...  For example, my "secret company" post
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1467564">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1467564

            </p>
            <p>
             OR maybe they were just trolling the fuck out of me.  In which case they succeeded, as my post clearly illustrates... Lol. I just couldn't believe what I was dealing with;

             </sub>
             .... Which is why it makes absolute zero sense to have it public. There isn't a single fucking thing you could say, that would justify it being public.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only attempt you could make at justifying it is, "Its for those that aren't sure if they are ready or not to adopt (AKA: BUY)"
            </p>
            <p>
             The key word there Is "ATTEMPT"  because that's still a horrible justification.  If you're not sure whether or not you want to adopt a kid, FUCKING WINDOW SHOPPING, shouldn't be the deciding factor.  This isn't black friday shopping... You can't just buy a kid on a whim, because a certain kid just happened to catch your eye....  The bigger point i could make is, If you are the kind of person to just go window shopping for kids, and a picture and a blurb about about a specific kid is enough to convince you into buying a kid... YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED FUCKING KIDS!... Whoops, No pun intended... You shouldn't be allowed to fuck kids, let alone be their guardian.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no fucking justifying this shit.  I hope that O'Keeffe dude has already infiltrated this service and caught them doing what we know they are doing. Because I'm sure this will be changed soon.

              As of right now, based on what I know, I'm certain there's no rational explanation for this.... That being said, there's a lot of things I don't know, so I welcome a rational answer if someone has one. Maybe I'm just looking it at in the wrong way. (I really don't think I am)

            That adoption site is legit they have to show the kids faces and their profiles to get parents interested in adopting them. There must be dark web sites where Alefantis and the Podestas shop for kids to rape or advertise kids for sale and Comet Pizza had a secure log-in page where you could definitely buy kids and child porn plus there were huge downloads from that site very large data downloads that had to be child porn. Funny how Megyn Kelly never asked James about that or any of the other evidence.

            We were interested in adopting and still are and I too was shocked that you could just look at the kids get their ages and their profile I mean anyone can see them whether your intentions are good or bad this really shocked me

            I have this Facebook ad that shows up a lot, a couple begging for money to adopt a child and have some stay at home time with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gives me the creeps.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also have a friend who's son and new wife had a miscarriage. Next thing you know they are begging for $50,000 on Facebook to go adopted a water head baby in Nepal.
           </p>
           <p>
            This went on for months. Then, opps, the "Lord closed that door" and "any money we collected was spent on the home study."
           </p>
           <p>
            The baby was so disabled she would never have known she was adopted. Sad, but in the end I was glad to see that end.

            OP, can you please throw one line into your post about how this potentially connects to the Pizzagate investigation (Rule 1)?
A link to that lady that died researching CPS would be awesome, too, but not necessary. Thanks.

            So it's not weird to expose these kids to anyone who has a computer and wants to look? Shouldn't it be a bit more private, for those serious about adopting? LIke, they aren't puppies.  It's like just going to pet store cuz you like puppies.

             I think it's legit, your issues with it are issues with the way things currently on.    People shop for everything online, including people.   They shop for casual sex with people via their profiles on various sites all the way through shopping for marriage material on websites with personal profiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't see an issue with these kids having their profiles up there.    It's not like they have any super personal stuff about them, including on what happened to them to put them in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only thing that confuses me is the "kids" over 18 up for adoption.    At first I thought they were probably mentally retarded or something and needed special assistance, but most of them looked pretty normal.... so maybe they just want a family?

              I'm kidding. But come on... You don;t think this would be weird if pizza gate didn't exist? I mean, you're correct in saying that I will never know FOR SURE, if that would look sketch to me with out pizzagate context.... But I pretty fucking certain I would have a problem with this regardless of context.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your defense of this site, Is like the worse defense possible. Lol. I'm still not saying that there isn't a justifiable answer to this question... There might be. But I gotta say yours is pretty bad.

             <p>
              Brosif... Come on. I don't even know how to answer that. People don't shop for casual sex on line.... If they do, it's illegal. (depending on what state/country)  Secondly, maybe don't compare buying a hooker so you can fuck her for 20 minutes, to buying a child's life? OR how about not using anything sexual related, as justification for things having to do with 5 year old children?
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, Not saying anything wrong with getting a hooker, just saying it doesn't compare...And actually, In light of everything, even getting hookers seems way less innocent.

             <p>
              It's exactly like they have personal stuff about them, because they provide personal stuff about them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, dude. Come on.  Again, The point of the matter is it shouldn't be available to ANYONE THAT IS NOT ACTIVELY TRYING TO ADOPT KIDS. Even if you're thinking about it... Fine, go to the adoption agency, get some information, and think about it...What is your rational justification for them being allowed to do this? Forget about how it should or shouldn't be perceived, forget about the pizzagate context.  What is the single rational answer you would give, to defend them doing this?
             </p>
             <p>
              But to address your point specifically... They do give a lot of personal information.
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               <p>
                First off, These kids are advertising they do not have parents... well the kids aren't but you know what I mean.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                So anyone who goes looking through that site, knows that everyone of those kids is helpless, Doesn't have single god damn adult that would give an arm and a leg to protect them. At least if kids pictures are plastered somewhere else (I'm sure I'll get a comment saying "there are elemantry school soccer teams that post their team picture in the paper" Or some bullshit.) you;re not going to assume they are completely defenseless, lacking a single relative who can care for them.
                <em>
                 But what about the social workers?
                </em>
                I know there are good social workers.... and we all know there are just as many horrible ones.... Even the good ones are limited to as what they can actually do to benefit the child... BUt for starters, not selling them like puppies is a good start.

              The next step? What does that mean? To me, It means they found a kid, and want that kid...
             </p>
             <p>
              That's not how adoption is suppose to work.   The first step IS NOT looking at  THOUSANDS OF MINORS THAT HAVE ZERO PARENTAL OR EVEN FAMILY PROTECTION... And Honestly, I do not know how adoption works,but if you're allowed to shop like this for kids, regardless of whether or not you're legitimately looking to adopt.... Then that needs to be changed immediately.
             </p>
             <p>
              If that's how it's always been done? Then find the people who allowed that in the first place, do some research, and I promise you... I promise, you'll soon learn that person is pedophile, or did the bidding for someone that was a pedo. This was not implemented by someone with innocent intentions. This is how the pedophile works. We've seen a million examples since this began.
