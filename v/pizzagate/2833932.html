<p>Edit: even Good Guys will be annoyed with my arrogance.... But I get to do this shit- Regardless Of how it plays out, I still win. You\'re a pathetic sub- Run by pathetic Moderators. You hurt the movement- More then you\'ve ever helped it. </p>
<p>I can post 1/1000 of my work- and it will surpass Everything This sub has ever accomplished- Which honestly, Isn\'t saying much. You had a good run- About a month. Since then- You\'ve become an asset to the deepstate. Just saying.</p>

<p>And please don\'t equate my actions, To the actions of  the users over at the  <a href="https://voat.co/v/greatawakening">v/greatawakening</a>.... I\'m an asshole. And I play dirty.

            Passive aggressive gets you nowhere. Read the 48 Laws of Power. If you want to be heard and enact change, you have to speak in a way that gets your point across. Otherwise, it will fall on deaf ears.
           </p>

            We want to hear what you have to say, but we have to be able to understand. Regroup, try again, and let us know what you think!

             I like your answer and I am going to read 48 Laws of Power.  Stay tuned for the post about your loosh post.  We are working on it. Keep your eyes peeled for it.  It will take a bit.

            What in the fuck are you babbling about? People at a political rally started singing Amazing Grace because a woman fainted and you think this is interesting enough to be shared across multiple subs, all of which exist for completely unrelated and much more serious topics?

            Usually I don’t care if a post is slightly off topic but this is the most obnoxious boomer-tier Facebook bullshit I’ve seen in a minute.
