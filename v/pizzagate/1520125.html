            Its telling to call offices IF reporting govt fraud that they are on govt and corp contracts. For by law they must address and mandate report.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, to even have staff, budget, supplies, access, connections is way more than mass citizens that have to desperately try to advocate for their lives ag govt frauds. It is very costly, entire life consuming to try to advocate the RATMAZE to no avail.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, they are paid by us, to be public servants. Yes, they are busy, but so are citizens and victims who are on way lower pay and poverty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not making time to address govt fraud that they are on the contract is huge. And the public health laws and govt fed/state/corp contracts, all have excessive, specified laws and mandates they must adhere to, or they are in violations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shows why trump is getting involved with govt contracts, right now. And the corrupt, boy are scared, and media propoganda it, and media propoganda that Trump and citizens could never understand these contracts. Yes, ones can. I've been reading them for years and could dance circles around mass govt corp staff that I have documented, doing violations. 
Politico, Dec 22, 2016, "Trumps $440 Billion Dollar Weapon," article. Links also to Federal Contract Acquisition Handbook, the base, of ALL govt contracts. A must read.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rick Scott, gov of Fl, was able to easily and boldly get away with huge medicaid/ medicare fraud in Texas, by fact that no one documented his AWARENESS of the fraud, so he pleaded the fifth, 75 times, got off, is now governor of fl for way too long.
           </p>
           <p>
            He continues mass obamacare and VA fraud, and abuses in medical institutions and profiteering. He even touched, possibly destroyed ballots, was in same room; major vote fraud for a candidate, and gets away with being governor AGAIN!
           </p>
           <p>
            It does not matter the budget, staff, schedule of any govt staff, even the lowest call ops on way let as than Gowdy. Laws, contracts, job role requirements MUSt be timy adhered to in full or ARE state and federal violations, that oig, DEP, and others must penalize and investigate, IF they are adhering to the laws, mandates, job role requirements.
           </p>
           <p>
            So yes, contacting any govt staff on govt contracts and laws that must investigate and protect beneficiaries is very useful to document and necessary for investigations to be done, carried out and brought to court.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've run these tracks all my life. There is no justification and excuses and huge factors of how govt and corp corruption have gotten so out of hand.
           </p>
           <p>
            And nothing is harder than citizen victims and advocates. Takes way more time, effort, huge freaking costs, huge impacts on daily needs/jobs/health.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gowdy spends a lot of time, catering to news like a celeb. Sure, I'd like heroes, also, but I'm not going to fall for the pony donkey shows or excuses. Law is law. Contracts are contracts. Joby duty requiremebts are also contract signed. Its our tax dollars paying. There lives and schedule and income is not low compared to majority american, but higher than even a whole street block will ever have. They have assistants at office and home, we don't. They are to be public servants. No excuse no justifications. Accountability and adherence, parallel to law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maas calks to Gowdy by many victim advocates for mass months of CLEARCUT, govt corp frauds ON TAPE, and paper trail AND MASSdesths and ones suffer/rot at home as medical.illegal blocked...and trey not give a minute? Nope..not buying his ACT.
           </p>
           <p>
            AND as he is a Drs son, suty he knows that blocking dialysis kills as horrid suffer, die. Maost are media suppressed, but here's one of our friends, DEAD. Wisconsin Voice, Dialysis man dies after Logisticare Medical Transport ( nemt) fails, refuses his rides to dialysis many times. His last desperate words repeated as desperate advocate to govt, corps on contract and media "I think they are trying to kill me."
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry, but govt staff on the laws and contract, not time for mass medical illegal block, suffering and deaths..no excuse..way more important priority mail han gowdys next fox, CNN, ABC etc SHOWS..
           </p>
           <p>
            I won't lower my ethics or awareness..six more funerals this week...gowdys office, just like all of them, more time consuming excessive demeaning mindgames on the phone...all waste more time being asswipes..citizens don't call for mind game abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            All calls by our nationwide..RECORDED AND INFORMED.
           </p>
           <p>
            all lives do matter and out time and money. 
Sorry, but I don't compromise life RTS, crimes ag humanity.

            So I've been listening to most of George's videos on YT "where is Eric braverman?"  I like his thought process and presentation.  I'm concerned because just like Steve piechenik the question is who the hell is this guy?  That said, shy should we trust what George webb says?  Who is he and what are his credentials?  I'm ignorant on this so please advise.  I hate to follow ppl blindly.

            Has anyone archived? Does web want it mirrored?? Thx for posting. Comey and Beau Biden seem to have similar track record.
Was it satanic that broke into Comets house when he and bro were kids? And Comet as a past contractor for Boeing?, then made FBI director should be conflict of interest, same w his bro job w Clinton, and wife getting million via Clinton.
Anyone know data on Comet or Podesta kids? 
Trey Gowdy, want to trust, but have you ever tried to call his office about a corruption for I know advocates that have, and citizens are blocked with a mind game, just like any office. Is he legit or playing a role? Calling directly, can learn if care of citizen inclusion, esp victims of govt frauds. 
I found a blog today that has a lot of underground tunnel and camp info,and a bunch more. Need to find it..Buddy is tx tunnel house, BTW for ones who asked. Safety needs to be a factor ..))

             Gowdy has his hands full, if you're looking for someone to dump evidence on,  i'd ony trust Preet Bharara, the guy in NY going after weiner. I'm fairly certain he's seen what the NYPD has seen on Huma's laptop. he may even be deeper into this than anyone knows, or will likely find out.

              Gowdy is on the obamacare state fed nemt contract. Hands full, no excuse. Please see my detailed comment about this, same subverse, just wrote before commenting to you...))) Gowdy also prioritizes main media over adhere to the law and contracts he is on.
             </p>
             <p>
              People are dying ..way more important than the next media pony donkey show.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd love to believe in Gowdy or any, but not only law, contract, job role titles as public servants must be timely adhered to; I'm also quite aware that ones in govt are a narrative of hero. Another one, Cory booker, and watch out for he is planning and being groomed to be president next election.

            Excellent. I have read elsewhere about conspiratorial connections between Scalia's death and threats made against him regarding another SC justice. Definitely something to look into.

            I don't think Webb was talking about Waco, considering he said West Texas....Waco is nowhere close.  I distinctly remember a thread on r pizzagate (RIP)  where someone was digging into some hinky stuff in Odessa, but I don't remember what it was.  The Podesta emails were dropping fast then and it was info overload.
           </p>
           <p>
            Isn't the old PG site archived somewhere?  Like I said 95% sure Odessa, maybe 5% Lubbock as far as my memory of the thread....I have friends from both towns, hence the confusion.

             I think he just mentions a town in Texas, not necessarily West Texas, but regardless when I asked if it was Waco, he replied with a "yes". SO I am guessing that's a direction to go

              Yeah, that is crazy that he responded....but saying Waco is west Texas is kind of a party foul.  Not as bad as putting beans in your chili, but it's definitely awkward.

            Ugg I don't know how to post pictures but I remember running across this on 4chan /po/ and saved it:
           </p>
           <p>
            Waco was a cover up in relation to child trafficking/sex rings, but not in the way you immediately think.
The Waco Compound &amp; the "cult" that was in it was part of a "underground railroad" type network that was saving children from Elite child sex rings in the US and getting them to safety.
With that being said, that explains the significant response(to the point of sending in tanks &amp; burning the place down &amp; shooting everyone one inside to death) against the "cult"/Compound &amp; the following coverup.
Many, many more children died in that compound then what was officially reported.(Shot,burn't,crushed) It was a clean up operation. Waco was televised so much inorder to send a message to similar child saving networks.

            I think what really happened in Waco and what the government told us that happened in Waco is going to be completely different. There was a wrongful death lawsuit filed but as is typical, people involved in the suit kept dying

            Possible, but some aspects don't seem consistent with that theory. Waco isn't in West Texas and it seems that the Branch Davidians were abusing their own children--not trafficking.   Web talks about a CIA lawyer residing in the Southwest. This should be the biggest clue.

             I did some more research on Waco. According to a report, allegedly by attorney Paul Wilcher to Janet Reno, the operation was to kill MK Ultra sleepers who were members of the Davidian group.

             You're definitely on to something
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In 1993, Epstein purchased a 7,500-acre ranch in Stanley, New Mexico, from the late former New Mexico governor Bruce King. He named the ranch "Zorro," and proceeded to build a 26,700-square-foot hilltop mansion that was once said to be the largest home in the state, and has been described as a "
              <strong>
               stone fortress
              </strong>
              ."
             </p>
             <p>
              A 1995 article in The New Mexican said that Epstein's initial plans for the residence described a main house that "will be similar to a Mexican hacienda, with an open-air entry into a courtyard with high-ceiling hallways, stone columns and a central fountain. The living room will measure about 2,100-square-feet, larger than the average house in Santa Fe County. The home will have an elevator, eight bathrooms, four fireplaces and three bedrooms." According to more recent report, Epstein recieved a county
              <strong>
               permit to build a small airplane hangar and air strip on the ranch.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Epstein has been reported as saying his New Mexico home "makes the town house look like a shack." According to records accessed on Property Shark, the structures on the property were last appraised in 2013 at $18,186,406.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the recent court filing in Florida,
              <strong>
               Roberts names Zorro Ranch as one of the place she was sexually abused by Epstein, as well as forced to have sex with Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz.
              </strong>
              The Last time Epstein made news in New Mexico, it was when it was revealed that he attempted to contribute to the reelection campaign of former Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Gary King in 2006.

              "Epstein made news previously in New Mexico. He twice attempted to contribute to King’s campaigns, but King returned the money. King received $15,000 from Epstein in 2006 when King first ran for attorney general and $35,000 from companies connected to Epstein for his gubernatorial campaign this year. Also in 2006, Epstein gave $50,000 to the re-election campaign of then-Gov. Bill Richardson. Richardson said then he’d give the money he received from an Epstein-affiliated company, Zorro Trust, to local charities."
             </p>
             <p>
              It has something to do with the lottery and Trust funds like Zorro that help keep the winner anonymous from media etc.

             </p>
             <p>
              I looked into Zorro Trust briefly and only managed to find this which is most likely of no importance:

             <p>
              Also, I know this even more of a stretch but I want to include it. Doesn't New Mexico have a ton of underground military bases? Admittedly I hear of them mostly in the more fringey circles of UFO study, but I wonder if that is something worth looking into given the seeming propensity they have for tunnels.
             </p>
             <p>
              I looked up a list and found this blurb:
             </p>
             <p>
              "
The New Mexico area has basically four underground system out.
             </p>
             <p>
              One goes to the Four Corners area and then to Groom Lake (Area 51).
One goes north toward Delta, CO and Colorado Springs.
The Taos facilities goes north approximately along Interstate 25 and eventually ties in NORAD."
             </p>
             <p>
              The last bit about interstate 25 caught my eye because Santa Fe is right along the interstate and this alleged tunnel stretches north along the interstate as well. There's also this:
             </p>
             <p>
              "The southern bases connect to Texas and Mexico."
             </p>
             <p>
              Just interesting. Bit of a stretch but curious nonetheless

              In a map, Zorro Ranch is these co-ordinates - 35.266599, -105.969340
             </p>
             <p>
              It's completely in the middle of nowhere. There are some odd looking structures dotted around if you zoom out and follow the roads. There's also another complex nearby with what looks like a few houses and gardens and a huge warehouse type looking building. Maybe for staff? Or for keeping kids?

            Webb is clearly talking about that underground West Texas facility underneath the man's home. I don't remember the Youtube video. Can someone post more information about that?
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds like Webb is saying that, after Boys Town, they moved to Texas. And now they have moved again (e.g., after the guy discovered it under his house).
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if this has anything to do with that absolutely massive fertilizer explosion in west Texas a couple of years back.

              Thank you. This is exactly what I was thinking about. I had no idea that he had so many videos. I also have no idea whether he is crazy or not. And I also have no idea whether George Webb was referring to him. My guess is that, 70% odds, the last name Webb is just a coincidence, and George was talking about Waco. But I could be wrong. I asked George about it on Youtube, and he usually replies to my comments, one way or another.

               Right, see above about George W. There is a man who posted videos (can't find at the moment) about buying a house in Crawford, Texas a few years ago and after hearing weird activity under the house and in his attic, he discovered a tunnel on his  property. He made a complaint to police and shortly after was shot from under the house while he was sitting in his living room or bedroom. He came to find that the previous owner was shot and killed in the house. 
There is a theory that the Bush family has run a cartel for decades of drugs and arms (and probably people) via the CIA, according to a MKUltra and or trafficking victim, Cathy O'Brien, that was a forced prostitute in the 80's and 90's. It sounds crazy I know, but it has to be considered. I don't have time to cite the articles but they're on voat and google if you do some digging. The MKUltra victim also said she was passed around and Hillary was one of the people that used her for sex. Again, crazy sounding I know.

                You're trying to link too much and there's no evidence. Also, it's not Crawford - Bush lived in Midland, TX - as does the guy who has been talking about activity under his house. I think there is some smuggling going on in Midland but I don't think it's THE relocation Webb is referencing - Webb indicates it was moved and the Midland guy has talked about recent activity.

                 Is it Midland? Okay thanks for correcting. I'm just relaying what I heard, as pastiche as it may be. I'm not connecting, just pointing out coincidenes. Webb could mean any of those bordering states, yes of course, you're absolutely correct.

                 He survived. Still at the house as far as i know. It's sad, he said he saved all his life to buy a house and he ended up with this nightmare. The last post I saw was a few months ago, so I'm not sure his status.

                But is this near the alleged underground human trafficking facility in Texas? I remember watching a homemade video from a man who thought he discovered one underneath his house. But I cannot find it now.

                  This is the gentleman's channel. He was allegedly shot by someone "under his house," and his outside security camera shows him crawling for help post-incident. His 911 call for assistance is also on his channel.

                 <p>
                  After being hospitalized and reporting to the local PD, the cops said they found nothing and there was no corroborating proof of his story (they say he accidentally shot himself cleaning his gun), but his hidden home security cameras caught unknown police officers going through his things, "looking to destroy evidence" (which the local PD denies, and the individuals in the film are not local PD despite wearing local uniforms). All this video evidence is online.

                   He's talking about the guy in Midland, TX (home of Bush Jr) who clearly has something going on under his house and next door and I would not doubt at all that it is tied to some smuggling of various sorts----but it is very doubtful that the Franklin-related trafficking has been relocated to a set up like is being described by this guy. The older trafficking case is way too big an operation and the location is wrong. Plus, Webb mentioned the operation has been moved to "a state nearby", and the Midland guy has recently indicated current activity. Unrelated issues.

              Yes fort Polk is in Vernon parish Louisiana which is a parish bordering east Texas.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The post encompasses approximately 198,000 acres—100,000 acres are owned by the Department of the Army—98,125 acres by the U.S. Forest Service, mostly in the Kisatchie National Forest. "
             </p>
             <p>
              The land that is now Fort Polk is part of a region of cultural resources, including archaeological sites, historic houses and structures, and other sites of historical value. The U.S. Army has spent considerable time, effort, and money on locating, identifying, and inventorying THOUSANDS OF ARCHAELOGICAL SITES on Fort Polk and the property owned by the U.S. Forest Service where the army trains.[2][3]
             </p>
             <p>
              Are archaeological sites underground?

             Now this slide everyone saying well you keep dropping these hints on this three year gap now this is the sex trafficking piece I don't want to be a part of this investigation but I will try to follow it from a distance and I will and this is the conspiracy theory part that I don't want any part of and I'll let everybody else run with it but there was a case in 1989 that I was involved in which was the Franklin Scandal and there was kids being taken from middle west America to being flown to the White House a lot of people have died in this so I really don't want to talk about it too much but if you are an aspiring CIA lawyer okay living in the southwest and this boys town in Omaha have been exposed you could no longer have a spot because of the increased attention to boys town you might pick another place like maybe a city in Texas and that's all I'll say about that and you might keep the kids there and then you might have to stringers the people who are finding kids bringing those kids to that Texas town and that's why you have a lot of people with automatic weapons there and that's why you have this kind of Harem situation now if a couple of people living there like a couple of the beta males not the alpha males that are stringers and going and getting these kids but a couple of the beta males start saying hey this is sex trafficking then you have a problem you need to shut it down and then you need to move it if you have a lot of kids need to move somewhere else maybe a neighboring state so that's all I'm going to say about that I’m just going to drop those bread crumbs for those people doing that investigation I don't want to push any of that but I thought I would pass that along from some of the things I know okay thanks

             TL;DR:
George Webb was investigating the Franklin Scandal, and is suggesting that:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              after increased attention on boys town due to the Franklin Scandal, they moved the operation to a town in texas, where there were people with a lot of automatic weapons and a harem situation.
             </li>
             <li>
              and then there were reports of sex trafficking there, and they moved again maybe to a neighboring state
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Anyone know of an alleged sex trafficking operation in texas since 1990 that he might be referring to?  We should follow any leads from that.  He seems to be connecting Franklin Scandal to John Podesta, and this texas thing might be the link we need.  The Franklin Scandal is a
             <strong>
              huge

             coverup, lots of wikipedia content scrubbed about it (huge page history and talk pages deleted), hard to find any information on it on the internet other than this documentary:

               No - he's not talking about the guy from Midland, TX who has posted several videos about activity going on under/near his house. I think there is definitely something going on/around this guy's property - but it's likely unrelated to Franklin. First, the scale of the Franklin-associated ring is too large and the underground mechanism of the Midland property isn't logical. Also, Webb indicates the operation moved to an adjacent state, yet the Midland guy has referenced recent activity. There is definitely some smuggling or trafficking going on under that guy's house, but doubtful it's related. Don't make broad assumptions like this without any reference - it's sloppy and not good for the PG cause.

               This is the gentleman's channel. He was allegedly shot by someone "under his house," and his outside security camera shows him crawling for help post-incident. His 911 call for assistance is also on his channel.

               After being hospitalized and reporting to the local PD, the cops said they found nothing and there was no corroborating proof of his story (they say he accidentally shot himself cleaning his gun), but his hidden home security cameras caught unknown police officers going through his things, "looking to destroy evidence" (which the local PD denies, and the individuals in the film are not local PD despite wearing local uniforms). All this video evidence is online.

            Webb is clearly nervous talking about this. He implies that Texas and a neighboring state is a hub.
