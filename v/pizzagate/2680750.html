<p>Kevin Spacey\'s \'Billionaire Boys Club\' Bombs With $287 in First Two Days at Box Office </p>
<p>Kevin Spacey\'s latest film, &quot;Billionaire Boys Club,&quot; has earned the lowest box office opening of the year, making just $287 from 10 screens in its first two days in theaters, according to an individual with knowledge of the numbers.</p>
<p>To break it down, it brought in $126 on its opening day and an additional $162 on Saturday. If the current national ticket price average of $9.27 is used, that means that no more than 31 people bought tickets to see the crime drama.</p>
<p>Filmed in 2015 and released with no publicity following a VOD release last month, &quot;Billionaire Boys Club&quot; was one of Spacey\'s final projects before he was hit with over two dozen sexual misconduct accusations. Actor Anthony Rapp was the first to come forward, others followed, including members of the crew of the Netflix show &quot;House of Cards&quot; and by anonymous accusers who called a hotline set up by London\'s Old Vic Theatre, where Spacey was artistic director for 11 years. Spacey is now under investigation by Scotland Yard for six of those accusations.</p>
<p>As for &quot;Billionaire Boys Club,&quot; Vertical Entertainment said in a statement in June that they would move forward with the film\'s release, noting that Spacey\'s role is a supporting one.</p>
<p>The film tells the true story of a group of trust fund boys in \'80s Los Angeles who run a Ponzi scheme to make their own money and create a lavish lifestyle for themselves. But when a con artist named Ron Levin — played by Spacey — swindles them out of $4 million, the club soon turns to murder to get their money back.</p>
<p>&quot;We don\'t condone sexual harassment on any level and we fully support victims of it. At the same time, this is neither an easy nor insensitive decision to release this film in theatres, but we believe in giving the cast, as well as hundreds of crew members who worked hard on the film, the chance to see their final product reach audiences,&quot; Vertical said in their statement.</p>
<p>The film has been panned by critics with a 13 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, and none of the 10 screens the film was released on are located in Los Angeles or New York. It\'s by far the worst opening of Spacey\'s box office career, which peaked in 2006 with the $52.5 million start of &quot;Superman Returns.&quot;</p>

             I is a win, isn't it.  I told a friend today and she was shocked and floored.  She is a real movie hound always telling me about this guy or that guy.  She is shocked I know none of them.  I really don't.  I feel out of the loop sometimes, but glad I missed all of them.

            Great demonstration that, once people know about a pedophile actor's crimes, they won't go to see a movie with them in it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just the thought of watching Kevin Spacey in a movie just seems gross now. Even in the situation of one of his old movies where he actually was a good actor (like, say, Pay It Forward) all I would be able to think of whenever he would be on-screen would be how horrible the things he did to kids were.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also know people who say they are squicked out by the thought of going to see a Woody Allen film now too.

             So glad to hear that about Kevin and Woody (what a name)  I too get sick now when a movie comes on with someone we have researched on here.  I have to turn it off.  Although I don't have cable or netflix.  No movies anymore for me.  Better that way.

             Exactly.  And that's why we have to keep posting here.  We have made a difference, I believe it.  All of us.  Together.  Not Divided.  Together.

            I'm so glad you made this thread Carmencita!  I wanted to but I've been busy.  I experienced such schadenfreude when I heard this.  NOONE wants to see Spacey in anything. It doesn't matter how good an actor he is, people are revolted by the fact that he's a violent rapist of children.  People are voting with their feet, and telling him and Hollywood they won't support their disgusting habits.

             I know.  It's exhilarating.  Someday I hope it happens to his friend Bill C too.  He sold plenty of books.  People haven't gotten the message yet. But the sad thing about all of this is that he is still walking around free.  Those poor children he raped are without justice.  But yes, presently we should rejoice.  He thought he could keep pulling in the Big Bucks.  NOT.

            Lol, i thought it was like 287 thousand or something, holy shit literally $287. How is that even possible? I wasn't aware that all the normies would catch on so fast to Spacey.

             Yeah, seems strange - most of them wouldn't even know anything about Spacey or remember anything longer than a week.. Perhaps there is something else going on like a poor title and content.

             Evidently it hit home.  They have been pretty quiet, making it hard to figure out how all this stuff affected them.  I guess they want to send him a message.  Yeah, me too.  My husband kept saying, You are reading it wrong, No, you can't be right.  Yep.  I was. lol is right.

             Yes! - So glad too. It's a fucking degeneracy and shouldn't be tolerated at all. These people are sick. I don't think the Pedo agenda will ever take hold. We as a species at least still know well enough to protect our young. We have to remember that although these fucks are powerful - or at least were, - They are few and we are many. That being said, - like any poisonous serpent they should be dispatched as soon as they are outed. Fucking so glad to be alive right now. Hope all these pedo mother fuckers hang. Haven't heard much about old Dan from Nickelodeon lately. Hope that mother fucker burns as well. Been enjoying the Pedowood meltdown as of late. Couldn't be happier these fuckers are being exposed and ruined.

             This made me so happy when I finally realized the number was real.  I kept thinking I read it wrong.  Like Million maybe?  No.  $287.  Something is sinking in.

              Yeah... admittedly I haven't paid attention to box office "hits" and their opening day earnings aside from big headlines for a VERY long time. That number seemed absolutely unbelievable. I too thought it had to be millions, which would still be considered very low for a Spacey film I guess.
             </p>
             <p>
              Curious... any MSM outlets talkin' about Spacey's "BIG FLUB"? Looooooool.

           <p>
            The two-time Oscar winner has essentially been excommunicated from Hollywood after more than a dozen men and teen boys came forward last fall with accusations of sexual harassment and assault, including "Star Trek: Discovery" actor Anthony Rapp, who says Spacey made sexual advances on him when he was just 14.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since then, Spacey has been fired from his hit Netflix series "House of Cards," which will end with a sixth and final season starring Robin Wright this fall. He also was wiped entirely from "All the Money in the World" after director Ridley Scott made the bold decision to recast him with Christopher Plummer and reshoot scenes just seven weeks before the film's release in December. The move paid off for Plummer, who netted an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his portrayal of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Netflix similarly dropped "Gore," a Spacey-led Gore Vidal biopic that was set for release this year, which could make the new "Billionaire Boys Club" the actor's last big- or small-screen outing.

             This was made quite a while ago.  AND only 31 people went.  If that keeps up NO  he  WONT be making any more movies.  This is Good News, imo.  You can read it however you like.

             I love it too.  At first I thought Whoa!  That is Really Low, but then I saw they did the Math.  Only 31 tickets sold!  31 Dummies parted with their money to see a Pedophile.  Well, that's a lot more than before he was outed.

              Hmm, doing some more math:
             </p>
             <p>
              The movie played in 10 theaters. This means there was an average audience of 3 people per theater.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some theaters might have even had no-one show up, if some theaters had more than 3 people!
             </p>
             <p>
              This is basically a boycott.

               I forget the exact amount but they said the tickets were $9 and something.   I would also call it a Boycott of Kevin Spacey.

                Oh yes, it has to be Spacey that was keeping people out of the theaters.

               <p>
                I mean, who would want to drive to a theater and spend $9 to be creeped out by one of the actors in a movie?

                 Exactly  This really says so much that people are waking up, and when they find out they will let him know.  They are pretty much sending a Sharp Message.
