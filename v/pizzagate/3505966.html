<p>Four counts of lewd acts to a child and one count of oral sodomy were filed in Cleveland County on Thursday.</p>

<p>&quot;It\'s every parent\'s nightmare to hear that something\'s happened to their child,” Wareham, a good friend of the victim’s parents, said.</p>
<p>The six-year-old victim was “visibly upset and crying when her mother brought her in to be interviewed,” according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Wareham said once the church learned of the allegations against Hack, he was removed from his position on the church’s high counsel.</p>
<p>“It’s my understanding that they also filed a third party lawsuit to go along with it,” Wareham said.</p>
<p>News 4 went to the church to get more information on the alleged lawsuit, but the doors were locked and no one answered.</p>
<p>Hack denied touching the victim and told investigators he doesn’t know where the allegations are coming from, according to the affidavit.</p>

            Well this guy is the scum at the bottom of the barrel. Looked him up and it looks like he has a son 41 and he lives right near him. Also it implies he may have sex charges in his past. This is systemic in these families. It said Cleveland Co. is this the area that sits right at the 3 states including Co. Ar. and Ut.  We had a CDAN post about that area. Very bad things going on there. Tell me if this is not the area. Other than what you have linked not much other info. Just that he is a High Priest. I hope they strip him of all titles STAT.

             Hey carmencita, it's Cleveland County Oklahoma.
            </p>
            <p>
             Co = county, CO = Colorado. I liked it better when we used 3-letter abbreviations for the states, less confusion.

              I liked it that way too but they are always in a hurry to shorten things. Also they don’t mention the state in the story anymore. People outside of that area or state just don’t know all the little towns and cities. TY.

               I have read so many articles in recent years, where if you don't already know what the hell is going on, it ain't going to be explained. I used to love going to the library and reading newspapers from around the world, journalists were pretty good about writing an intro that would inform on the basic details. It made their articles readable to those outside the community.  Now days, they don't even bother to to identify the details.

                I agree. That art is part of the past. So sad. Wiring has amen a back seat as well. Children no longer are taught how to write and diagram sentences so that they understand grammar etc. How to do a book report etc. All gone to the dogs.

                    No. Not yours. I am sure they are well taught and cared for. The ones that are clueless because of parents that don’t realize how important these things are. What we have lost. Things they will never know about.

                     It's weird, the more rules we make, the more kids we have hanging around waiting to be told what to do.  Except our own. They say too many rules, and horrible parents we are.
