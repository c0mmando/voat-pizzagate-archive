<p>Update: In addition to the Cultural Marxist/SJW outlets previously mentioned which support child rape, namely The Huffington Post and Salon, I wish to add Buzzfeed to the list, as they have attempted to dismiss child sex trafficking as a myth (pay attention to the areas of expertise of the authors).</p>

<p>I wish to illustrate further examples of academia/media attempting to normalise paedophilia and, indeed, to influence government policy accodrdingly, with some success, I\'m very sorry to say.  The London School of Economics (LSE) called upon then British Home Secretary (now Prime Minister) Theresa May to relax rules prohibiting registered sex offenders, including paedophiles, from working with or adopting children on the basis that it may be, &quot;...a breach of their human rights&quot; and, &quot;...the numbers of child sex murders are very low&quot; (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/8201521/Sex-offenders-including-paedophiles-should-be-allowed-to-adopt-Theresa-May-told.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/8201521/Sex-offenders-including-paedophiles-should-be-allowed-to-adopt-Theresa-May-told.html</a></p>
<p>As I previously mentioned  in a comment in the \'Normalisation of Paedophilia has gone Mainstream\' post (though it does bear repeating), the British National Council for Civil Liberties (the NCCL, known today simply as Liberty), led by Patricia Hewitt at the time (who would later become deputy leader of the British Labour Party), lobbied Parliament on behalf of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) to lower the age of consent to 10 years of age, the decriminalisation of incest, as well as asserting that there is no evidence that raping a child does them harm (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/462604/We-can-t-prove-sex-with-children-does-them-harm-says-Labour-linked-NCCL">https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/462604/We-can-t-prove-sex-with-children-does-them-harm-says-Labour-linked-NCCL</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, Hewitt\'s NCCL/Labour colleague Harriet Harman, lobbied Parliament on behalf of PIE to decriminalise child pornography unless it could be proven that the child(ren) in the images had been harmed in some way (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/4949555/Harriet-Harman-under-attack-over-bid-to-water-down-child-pornography-law.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/4949555/Harriet-Harman-under-attack-over-bid-to-water-down-child-pornography-law.html</a></p>
<p>On that note, in addition to the examples of The Guardian\'s pro child rape leanings given in the \'Normalisation of Paedophilia has gone Mainstream\' post, I found yet another paedophile apologia in The Guardian attempting to defend Hewitt\'s &amp; Harman\'s reprehensible behaviour (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/02/how-paedophiles-infiltrated-the-left-harriet-harman-patricia-hewitt">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/02/how-paedophiles-infiltrated-the-left-harriet-harman-patricia-hewitt</a></p>
<p>It should be noted that, although Hewitt and Harman are no longer Labour luminaries, the British Labour Party\'s pro child rape stance does not seem to have changed, given Labour MP for Bradford West and staunch ally of current Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Naz Shah\'s assertion that victims of Muslim paedophile gangs in Britain, &quot;...just need to shut their mouths.  For the good of diversity.&quot; (see below).</p>

<p>Moreover, Mr. Corbyn\'s consistent refusal to address the child abuse which occurred within children\'s homes within his own constituency (Islington North) as well as his denunciation of fellow MP Geoffrey Dickens for raising awareness of said abuse is very strange, to say the least (see below).</p>

<p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) in its fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) initially classified paedophilia as a sexual orientation, but in response to a report by the American Family Association (AFA) and subsequent queries, the APA admitted they had done so, &quot;in error&quot; and said error would be corrected.  One has to wonder, given that the APA claimed that, &quot;Sexual orientation is not a term used in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder...&quot; how it appeared there at all.  Testing the waters, mayhap.  Would it have been corrected if nobody had kicked up a fuss (see below)?</p>

<p>Well, the DSM now states that not all paedophiles have a mental disorder, only thosr who act on their desire to rape a child (see below).</p>

            This will be part of our victory: while they simultaneously deny its reality AND advocate for its acceptance, they will continue to redpill the sleeping masses of people in western society that have some semblance of family values. We can uncover, report and expose all we want, but let’s face it; the enemy does a lot of work for us by talking out of both sides of their mouths.
