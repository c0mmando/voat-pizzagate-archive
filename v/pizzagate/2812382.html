            Trump just tweeted about Tom Steyer a little while ago. I have been gathering info about him and his brother Jim.  Something definitely afoot :

            It was my thought too that the whole bomb story was a way to garner sympathy. You have done a great job connecting everyone.

            I wanted to bring to your attention this CNN interview of the employer of a Pizzeria who hired Cesar as a delivery driver.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dHyITt1Uws">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dHyITt1Uws
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I found it very strange that the employer (Debra Gureghian) would keep him as an employee after all the negative things she said of him. Anyways, I did a quick google check and found that she had a federal grand larceny charge against her a few years ago.
            <a href="https://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Florida/Broward-County-FL/Debra-Gureghian.124802165.html">
             https://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Florida/Broward-County-FL/Debra-Gureghian.124802165.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Btw, google had this link popup yesterday in the search, but it is now gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore, I checked the pizzeria's trip advisor/yelp pages and there are those pizzagate symbols (spiral, hearts).
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe you can look more into it.

             TOM STEYER: BILLIONAIRE DEMOCRATIC DONOR AND FUSION GPS CLIENT
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Years before Fusion GPS became famous for its work on the Trump dossier, the opposition research firm worked for Tom Steyer, the billionaire Democratic donor currently waging a $20 million TV campaign to impeach President Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Daily Caller investigation reveals that in 2012, Steyer, a hedge fund chieftain and environmental activist, hired Fusion GPS and its founding partner, Glenn Simpson, to conduct an investigation to help pass a ballot initiative aimed at closing a tax loophole for California businesses and funneling money to clean energy projects.

            This is the first I heard of a bomb being sent to Kamala Harris.  Trying to gain sympathy Kamala?  You will need it when they find out you covered for priests going back 80 years.  You had the files in your office and refused to release the info.  What a farce.

            News of the arrest emerged as investigators recovered explosive devices sent to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.).

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/letsdothis2">
             @letsdothis2

            . Very interesting thread! However, it needs a clear statement at the beginning that will allow us to leave it up as being relevant to child sex abuse by the global elite (Rule 1). If you phrase that statement as a question, it's less likely to create problem with Rule 2.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you thinking that the fake bombs are relevant to the sexual abuse of kids by the global elite because they show the level of election desperation and collusion happening between the corrupt media, the NYPF, and lobbysts desperate to cover up PG related crimes like those outlined in swordfish's Ukraine thread?
           </p>
           <p>
            Please add a statement to that effect. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair. Thanks!

            How did 12 “bombs” get sent and not one detonated? How come all the bombs were sent through USPS and no post marks were made on the packages? How did all the bombs arrive at the locations at the same time? All the so-called bombs were sent to well known Globalists to discredit the truth community whether or not they are Trump supporters. So narrative is so obvious...

              Unfortunately, because of the highly coordinated cover-up by the mainstream media (MSM), the true extent of Soros’s perfidy is not well known.  Were the electorate to be aware of the treacherous acts carried out by Soros &amp; Company against the American people, the perps would have been taken off the streets by law enforcement—

                  oopsie .... I guess the reverse is true too ....  I will edit the post if I find out it's fake.
 -  oh, it does look fake as it was only archived today, probably AFTER he was arrested. 
I took my blog post down.  But I think this guy is someone with a prior serious charge arrest, like the fellow who   shot a gun in Comet Pizza. Then they dismiss charges in exchange for a "favor" and arrange light sentance for the "favor".

                   I saw the perp's picture and he didn't look the least bit upset, he didn't look worried, he didn't appear guilty or scared, he didn't even look like he was on drugs. What he looks like to me is someone that they brought in to pose for a photograph who is already going to be released back to the wild to continue working the ratlines. Worst case scenario is that he knew he was going to eventually get blamed for something because he wasn't kidnapping enough people or molesting enough kids.

                    recall Timothy McVeigh pix of him looking serene at crowds who wanted his head? I believe those who say he was  whisked away and given a new identity (based on no autopsy after execution as demanded by law).

             Jo Gibbons, who is one of Tony Blair's longest-serving members of staff, has stepped down as the former prime minister's director of corporate affairs amid great mystery.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gibbons, 47, has also left her position as the director of corporate affairs of "Blair Inc.", the growing network of private companies generating millions for the former prime minister.
            </p>
            <p>
             This month, she quit as a director of Firerush Ventures No 1, Firerush Ventures, Windrush Ventures and Windrush Ventures No 1, all of which Blair set up after leaving No 10.
