<p>I posted links to 2 calendars along with an excerpt from each.  
1st Calendar: </p>
<p>http://www.theopenscroll.com/hosting/SatanicCalendar.htm</p>
<p>Jan 1	New Year\'s Day	 	Druid Feast Day	15-33
Jan 7	St. Winebald Day	blood	animal and/or human sacrifice and dismemberment	(male, if human)</p>
<p>Below the calendar:
"A.  The highest ritual holiday is the member\'s birthday. It usually involves the member or a victim of the member\'s choice and someone in authority, usually the coven\'s leader.</p>
<p>B.  The first and third of every month. Put 1 and 3 together and it makes 13, though ritual/worship can occur at anytime, frequently coinciding with times of stress.</p>
<p>C.  All Friday the 13th\'s are high satanic days.</p>
<p>D.  All full-moon nights provide reason for major occult activity (easiest to move around without difficulty and without being detected).</p>
<p>E.  Holy week (Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday). Some groups are thought to sacrifice, cook and eat a human baby on Easter Sunday."</p>
<p>
2nd Calendar:

            its soooooo BIG!!!!!   I thought about making a physical "war room" in a spare room in my home.. not virtual but literally on a chalkboard wall!  (my hub would not be happy) So many fake companies and cover businesses its almost hard to believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            IN spite of all the shills and ppl deleting threads...we are still winning and we will not stop till al these fucking freaks are taken down!
            <br/>
            Happy New Year!  2017 , we are taking back America!

            haha... me either.(technically advanced) . I cant do any of that shit on the computer.  I am so freaking impressed with what some of the "investigators" are able to do.  I just pray pray pray someone leaks the mother load later this month.  There's so much that needs to come out.
