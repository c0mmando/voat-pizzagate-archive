<p>1.  Should we or has anyone cross referenced any of the dates from the calendar with the dates in the Wikileaks emails to see if there was travel or strange talk/conversations on these dates or day(s) before?  </p>
<p>2. What about cross referencing Satanic dates with any of these POS travel dates, including Bill and Killlary (flight logs or in emails). Birth dates as well.  When is Podesta\'s  or Hillarys birthdays and where were they at the time?  (Might give us a better understanding of where these kill rooms are located) </p>

<p>I posted links to 2 calendars along with an excerpt from each.  
1st Calendar: </p>
<p>http://www.theopenscroll.com/hosting/SatanicCalendar.htm</p>
<p>Jan 1	New Year\'s Day	 	Druid Feast Day	15-33
Jan 7	St. Winebald Day	blood	animal and/or human sacrifice and dismemberment	(male, if human)</p>
<p>Below the calendar:
"A.  The highest ritual holiday is the member\'s birthday. It usually involves the member or a victim of the member\'s choice and someone in authority, usually the coven\'s leader.</p>
<p>B.  The first and third of every month. Put 1 and 3 together and it makes 13, though ritual/worship can occur at anytime, frequently coinciding with times of stress.</p>
<p>C.  All Friday the 13th\'s are high satanic days.</p>
<p>D.  All full-moon nights provide reason for major occult activity (easiest to move around without difficulty and without being detected).</p>
<p>E.  Holy week (Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday). Some groups are thought to sacrifice, cook and eat a human baby on Easter Sunday."</p>
<p>
2nd Calendar:

            its soooooo BIG!!!!!   I thought about making a physical "war room" in a spare room in my home.. not virtual but literally on a chalkboard wall!  (my hub would not be happy) So many fake companies and cover businesses its almost hard to believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            IN spite of all the shills and ppl deleting threads...we are still winning and we will not stop till al these fucking freaks are taken down!
            <br/>
            Happy New Year!  2017 , we are taking back America!

            haha... me either.(technically advanced) . I cant do any of that shit on the computer.  I am so freaking impressed with what some of the "investigators" are able to do.  I just pray pray pray someone leaks the mother load later this month.  There's so much that needs to come out.
