<p>IMPORTANT: There is a short chinese story that warns us about (((them)))</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: There is a short chinese story that warns us about (((them)))</p>
<p>THIS RELATES TO PIZZAGATE BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE PODESTA BELONG TO AN ELITE CLASS (THE CABAL) WHICH PRACTICE CANNIBALISM AND THAT AUTHORS HAVE BEEN WRITING BETWEEN THE LINES ABOUT THEM SINCE FOREVER AND THAT THEY ARE NOT AN ISOLATED GROUP OF A PEOPLE BUT HIDDEN SOCIAL CLASS AMONG THE ELITE. PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THIS POST AGAIN.</p>
<p>The story is very short and i stress everybody should read it. There is a real reason why this story exists.</p>

<p>According to wikipedia A Madman\'s Diary is a short story published in 1918 by Lu Xun, a Chinese writer. It was the first and most influential modern work written in vernacular Chinese in the republican era, and would become a cornerstone piece of the New Culture Movement. It is placed first in Call to Arms, a collection of short stories by Lu Xun. The story was often referred to as &quot;China\'s first modern short story&quot;.[1] This book was selected as one of the 100 best books in history by the Bokklubben World Library.</p>
<p>The story is the diary of man who finds out his own whole village is populated by CANNIBALS and he is being stigmatized as paranoid or crazy by them. Take note that it is explained in the preface that the character has recovered from his craziness and has gone elswhere to take an official post. So, strangely the paranoid man, was promoted to a job right after his paranoid episode?</p>
<p>I believe that there is a hidden message inside this story. The author is urging us to read between the lines much like the main character.</p>
<p>*I read intently half the night, until I began to see words between the lines, the whole book being filled with the two words—&quot;Eat people. * In the story, the main character little sister was killed to be eaten to aid his mother sickness.</p>
<p>Take a look at this. Exactly what they do to us everytime. They label us as crazy or conspiracy theorists. Remember yesterday Podesta\'s &quot;pizza gate crazies&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;Then I realized part of their cunning. They would never be willing to change their stand, and their plans were all laid; they had stigmatized me as a madman. In future when I was eaten, not only would there be no trouble, but people would probably be grateful to them. When our tenant spoke of the villagers eating a bad character, it was exactly the same device. This is their old trick&quot;</p>
<p>Take a look at this dialogue. It speaks about secrecy as a main directive in (((them))). In the story it states they have been doing this for 4,000 years.</p>
<p>What am I talking about? They are eating men now in Wolf Cub Village, and you can see it written all over the books, in fresh red ink. **His expression changed, and he grew ghastly pale. &quot;It may be so,&quot; he said, staring at me. &quot;It has always been like that. . . **</p>
<p>&quot;Is it right because it has always been like that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I refuse to discuss these things with you. Anyway, you shouldn\'t talk about it. Whoever talks about it is in the wrong!*</p>
<p>And then it continues to state how they are taught from a very young age to cannibalism</p>
<p>&quot;He was much younger than my elder brother, but even so he was in it. He must have been taught by his parents. And I am afraid he has already taught his son: that is why even the children look at me so fiercely.&quot;</p>
<p>A portent of the future.Take note that the village where they live is called Wolf Cub Village.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don\'t change, you may all be eaten by each other. Although so many are born, they will be wiped out by the real men, just like wolves killed by hunters. Just like reptiles!..You should change at once, change from the bottom of your hearts! You must know that in future there will be no place for man-eaters in the world . . .&quot;</p>
<p>The last line of the story will send shivers to each of us in this forum. This is why we must persist in our cause.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are still children who have not eaten men? Save the children. . . .</p>
<p>I have found that both history and literature is full of references both to (((them))) and to their practices. I have also found that there is always an intention to keep the truth hidden &quot;between the lines&quot; in these texts. As if it was only right to expose the truth to some selected few. I have not only seen this done by (((them))) but also by writers which i deem good guys so i can only presume there is a good reason to share this knowledge to the common public.</p>
<p>I have even seen this bluntly written in the Dead Sea Scrolls. At this moment i am bit agitated by so much information but i am willing to share some of my findings if there is any interest. I feel that giving everything away might be counterproductive at the moment. I ask everyone to please share this story and relate it to Pizzagate and the cannibal pedo elite.</p>
<p>As a sidenote Lu Xun was born in the elite and attended Western education. AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN WIKIPEDIA Imagine an iron house: without windows or doors, utterly indestructible, and full of sound sleepers – all about to suffocate to death. Let them die in their sleep, and they will feel nothing. Is it right to cry out, to rouse the light sleepers among them, causing them inconsolable agony before they die?&quot; Qian replied that it was, because if the sleepers were awoken, &quot;there was still hope – hope that the iron house may one day be destroyed&quot;. Shortly afterwards, in 1918 Lu wrote the first short story published in his name, Diary of a Madman, for the magazine.</p>
<p>Relates to pizzagate because it is about the cannibal elite and their procedures.</p>',

            The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow a very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people a sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of debate. Choam Nomsky

            Do you think it might be because you post crazy conspiracy stuff like this?  Like seriously crazy conspiracy stuff  For example you think a short story written in China a hundred years ago can tell you specific details about an American born 30 years after the the story came out.

             A short story written by a chinese aristocrat with western education speaking openly about the Elite "Wolves of Society" and calling them Cannibals can speak a lot of what is going on todays world elite, specially if have HiGH evidence that they are cannibals
Do you believe societies sprout suddenly like Mushrooms? Grab a book, most secret societies are several centuries old.

               That is why your user name seems like a well thought sceptic exercise made by a 12 year old. And that is why you, an sceptic, are here in the Pizzagate subverse to show us the folly of our deductions. What an inmense, idiotic, low life wanker you are who cannot even make his pathetic job worthwhile to his masters. Away you pitiful dog.

            People should really question the timing of Podesta's tweets, John McCain's cry for help against propaganda and conspiracy theories, today's Verge article about the Russian narrative as an avenue to end aonymous online comments, and the year-long Planned hit piece on us to hide the truth about Racine, Wisconsin and the real global agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind where are the Podestas are from. who Hillary Clinton:a father is, and how the Podestas got their big break and politics and art through Connections in Racine and Kenosha.

           <p>
            The city in this story sounds eerily familiar to Racine, Wisconsin.

             Yes. And interesting is the fact the author had a western education and studied medicine. Wolf Cub Village is clearly an special place for the Wolves of society. 
Could you provide a link explaining Racine?

                 is just one alt/sockpuppet of a very busy guy who works for David Brock. He has been running a disinfo campaign protecting the Clinton machine for several years now. Two of his long-term targets are Mike Pence and Paul Ryan.

                  an exchange I had with @Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt
                 </a>
                 where I challenged him to post or point to one solid fact that he had researched, showing that Paul Ryan was actually corrupt, much less involved with the pedosadists we are hunting. He eventually admitted that he will never tell us how he knows Paul Ryan is a bad guy, or how he knows Racine is a global hub of evil. Ask him to show proof that the Johnson family is bad, and he'll try to spin a 13-year-old report about them donating money to a hospital. Trace back any actual crime that he cites, and you'll find either that he didn't research it, or that it has nothing to do with Racine. Usually both.

            A short story in Lu Xun's
            <em>
             Diary of a Mad Man

            is his account of Chinese sick with tuberculosis dipping

             mantou
            </em>
            (steamed buns) into the blood of an executed man, in the belief that consuming the blood would heal tuberculosis.

            Kuru is a disease that you can get by eating the flesh of other humans. Symptoms of the disease are similar to those shown by a prominent female politician.

             Yup, it has been noted numrous times, and I know (jus know) that the PG main players are all involved in cannibalism - 100%, not 99, but 100%. In fact I read an article how Black Nobles were involved in dark rituals which included cannibalism. We have to remember that blood sacrifice, blood rituals and cannibalism were an open thing in the past - and it has stayed till the present - except it went underground

                He mentions in an interview he worked on a pig farm and that the correct way to kill a pig is a with a bullet in the head (does not make any sense) also see that alefantis instagram is full of pig references, heads, etc
Pig = human slave food

                 Why does this not make sense?  This is how pigs are killed for butchering.  In the commercial meat industry they use what is known as a cattle gun.  It's properly know as a captive bolt gun or stunner.   It's connected by tube to tank of high-pressure compressed air and it "shoots" a bolt.  The difference is unlike a bullet, the bolt is captive, so it stays in the chamber only coming out as far as it needs.   The captive bolt gun is place against the animals head and compressed air is released.   In No Country for Old Men, the bad guy used a cattle gun to kill people.

                  A cattle gun is not a firearm. I live in the countryside and have traveled around the world visiting many ranches. You dont kill farm animals with bullets. You use a big knife and a rope. Bullets waste meat, if you shoot the forehead the bullet will come out from behind making a mess of all the internal organs and making it messier for degutting the animal, also if it hits any muscle it will waste/burn the meat (which is what happens with game animals, you throw away the meat hit by the bullet)
The bullet between the eyes comment was a warning to all his team. Nobody should betray him.
