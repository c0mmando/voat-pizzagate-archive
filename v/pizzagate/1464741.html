<p>The &quot;young blood stops aging&quot; idea is 100% real.  I did a quick Pubmed search (medical literature), and there are multiple high-level papers on this.  They are even planning an ongoing clinical trial where people get transfusions from children (gross).
Proof: <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/527.long">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/527.long</a></p>

<p>For blood transfusions to work, you need to have compatible blood types (known as cross matching).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-matching">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-matching</a>
The safest transfusion is being transfused with your own blood, or that of your genetically identical twin.  Next safest is someone related to you who has YOUR blood type (ABO type, Rh type, other antigens matched, etc.)
Therefore, it makes perfect sense that if Soros needs young blood, he grows &quot;children&quot; with that genetically related to him &amp; harvests their blood.  Best case scenario for him would be to make a bunch of clones, but currently, we don\'t really have the technology for that/it\'s way too expensive.  So, he would be a sperm donor instead (matched with an appropriate mother of similar blood type).  AND of course, all his children would have colobromas ...
I\'m not sure how to archive this stuff - but these are science-y links so I doubt they will be taken down.  Please save if you think it\'s useful.</p>',

            It would be useful to check out pictures of missing children.  I am sure they are under lock and key now.  I am going to really check them out when reported.  But there probably many that are not, those are the ones that will completely disappear like Maddy.

            At first I didn't think there was much to the eye deformities, but research like this shows how important it is to keep an open mind. Thank you for your work, OP!
