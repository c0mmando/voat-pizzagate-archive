<p>Profiles a cookbook writer named Joan Nathan whose mother was a famous feminist/political figure in Rhode Island particularly known for leading children\'s tours for decades at the RISD Museum.  (I found a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/68/cd/c0/68cdc0fb6f663abe016f4fb711c7a520.jpg">recent RISD graduate’s</a> <a href="http://www.volume-1.org/blog/2017/3/10/what-can-artists-and-designers-learn-from-pizzagate">article</a> on PG; shes glad it\'s fake since she grew up hanging around there.)</p>
<p>Cursory look confirms PG relation (“Jewish cooking show” with wife of Gov. Lichter, an “active freemason” per wiki; “close friend”of Alice Waters, who gave Alefantis the Moloch handkerchief; father has <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Allan_Gerson">wikispooks page</a>)</p>
<p>Mentions PG in quoting &quot;those who know her best&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before his life became consumed by the madness of Pizzagate, restaurateur James Alefantis, the man behind Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing and Camping, took a trip to Cuba last year <strong>with the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art. He invited Nathan to join him, even though they would have different aims. Alefantis had art business to attend to.</strong> Nathan was there to visit “like all the Jews in Havana,” Alefantis jokes. “We met all these young Jewish Cubans.”</p>
<p><strong>But they also met Paolo Titolo, husband of Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban president Raúl Castro and director of the country’s National Center for Sex Education. Titolo is an Italian photographer known for shooting members of Cuba’s transgender communities. Titolo took Nathan and Alefantis to a shantytown where they stopped at a shack with a corrugated metal roof, home to a local drag queen who makes dresses for young girls to wear to their quinceañera celebrations. Titolo told the Americans they would have to be discreet at the home.</strong></p>

<p>LOL WTF</p>
<p>My point is this: the article typically mentions her parents fleeing the Holocaust, how Jews’ eternal persecution has shaped the cuisine, etc, yet when it NAME-DROPS PIZZAGATE AND THAT GAY JEW CHEF ALEFANTIS THEY DON’T LABEL IT A “FAR-RIGHT ANTI-SEMITIC THEORY” OR ANYTHING AT ALL.</p>
<p>WHAT BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT YOU DIPSHITS WHO CRY “AGENT PROVOCATEUR!” PREDICT?</p>
<p>This is the danger of your faggoty “4-D chess” larping.  You give them a heckler’s veto for no reason -- the honest MPs admit <a href="https://youtu.be/9DKeLLlaws8">it\'s a trick; we always use it</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe you should sit the next few plays out.</p>
<p>Whitney Museum I didn\'t look at, except to confirm the Jewish presence, since I previously have proven that <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1952567">the “art angle” is 100% Jewish</a>. Here\'s a co-chair who also co-founded the Child Mind Institute, remember that place, which was discovered entirely due to my posting the Bill Nye comedienne because she\'s...Jewish?

               You didn't destroy me. I don't give 2 shits about the useless crap that you spew for I know you don't have any actual concern for people other than yourself and your own beliefs, so I'll just happily ignore you from now on, because that's how to inflict the most pain on narracistic types like you.

               Yea that's fair enough, typing in caps makes you look like a schizophrenic with a jewish obsession. I know what you're saying. We all know know the players. If you weren't so autistic you might realise that like in a trial, the facts don't always matter, but how how they are presented to the audience/jury. You need to be able to think like a normal person, and let them find the facts out themselves. People are naturally disinclined to tke other peoples arguments on for theseleves, they are far more likely to take our side if they come to it naturally, because the facts were laid out without GAS THE JEWS COMMENTARY.

                 Jesus Christ mate, you need to sort your head out, you are mentally abnormal, which makes you a liability. So maybe you should take one for the team, yea? I mean that sincerely as well, get some help or help yourself, if you are capable of it.... thats not an insult, you just are fucked up mate, to the point where it is likely interfering with your life, impact on society and those around you, I'd hazard to guess . Good luck.

               Donkey, since I don’t know which profile you will use today, I’m going to post this to a couple of them...

                Actually there's a vast amount of evidence to prove that being molested is FAR LESS HARMFUL than being raised with no father. I bet you know people personally that demonstate this. Ever hear of CRIMINALITY, ADDICTION? Thanks for proving my point further: you literally couldn't hurt a fly. That's female leadership, Merkel would be proud.
               </p>
               <p>
                You don't know a FUCKING THING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS. I would bet money you haven't read a book cover to cover without using FUCKING CRAYONS
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               You did NOT just say that being molested is far less harmful than growing up without a father. Oh Geez. In a Pizzagate forum no less. Have you ever heard of kids that are fucked up because they grew up living in foster care? Most of the time they are passed around. Siblings are separated! Foster parents aren’t going to love a child like their own parents would. We aren’t even talking about a single mother who’s strung out on drugs. You’re talking about a single woman who has to work!
              </p>
              <p>
               Does your retarded ass know that our tax dollars go towards paying foster parents monthly? I’ll use myself as an example. That will make it easier for your little brain to comprehend it and show you that I know what I’m talking about.
              </p>
              <p>
               We had to raise our nephew for over a year. When that happens, you have to have a case worker. You then become the guardian. You receive a monthly check to help pay for food, clothing, school supplies, etc... They are put on Medicaid to pay for their doctors visits and dental visits. Our tax dollars pay for that!
              </p>
              <p>
               He had been being raised by my husbands half brother and grandmother. He was being abused. We had never even met him until the day we got him. I had to take pictures of his body and document all of his bruises. I really hoped that by raising him in a loving family would turn him around. I had to take him to therapy every single week because of the abuse he lived thru. I planned on adopting him. No matter how hard I tried, he wouldn’t get better. He started abusing our dog. I was afraid to walk out of the room for a minute because he would go punch or kick our dog. He tried to hurt my baby. He kicked me while I was pregnant. I had no choice but to give him up. I couldn’t let my baby grow up this way.
              </p>
              <p>
               So guess what happened? His new family were JEWS! Thank God at that time in my life, I didn’t have Donkey saying Jews are evil alll day long. I had never even met Jewish people. I had to stay in touch with that family so we could talk to our nephew. We had to go to their house so that we could take him on outings or just to visit him. Guess who paid that Jewish family monthly to take care of him? Our tax dollars!
              </p>
              <p>
               I think someone that lacks empathy like you do, is the most dangerous type of person there is. You’re a narcissist. I don’t know you in real life to say for sure. But, you could very well be a psychopath.
              </p>
              <p>
               You are so narrow minded. Every single person has a different story. No matter what race or religion. You haven’t walked in their shoes. You don’t ever think of the whole picture. You talk about how the kids should be forcibly removed from their mothers because she has to work and raise them on her own. So your solution is to rip a family apart. Most of the time, be separated from siblings. Unless the child were lucky enough to find a good family, they would be moved from home to home. Especially if that kid had behavior issues.
              </p>
              <p>
               You could say that none of that affects YOU. But it does. Instead of that mother who worked her butt off to raise her kids, because maybe their dad was a loser, or dead, your solution is to take the kids, put them in some strangers home, and our tax dollars pay to raise them. Wow!
              </p>
              <p>
               You use the example of how messed up kids end up by growing up without a father. Have you not heard of how messed up kids can end up by growing up in foster homes? Since you like studies, go look it up. I’m sure you will see that it messes kids up for life.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let’s say a kid is passed around 4 times while being in foster care, (they have to make room for new ones), the chance of being molested by having new families and friends is pretty high. So then you end up with a kid raised in foster care AND molested. What are the chances that kid grows up and ends up a criminal and/or a drug addict? After growing up like that, they haven’t formed attachments. They don’t have support of close family and friends to lean on. Many times they grow up never able to form attachments or be in a relationship. Think about how equine (maybe you) ended up. In his 50’s, never married, lonely and bitter. What happens if someone like that had a child? Maybe they won’t give a shit and they just walk away. Then the cycle begins again.
              </p>
              <p>
               It amazes me how you think everyone here is stupid. How you group everyone by race, religion or gender. You focus on how WHITES are a dying race. I’m white! Of course I don’t want that. But I am not going to put all of my focus on that one thing. There are several things ruining our society today. I’m not going to be a hateful bitter person. That helps nobody.
              </p>
              <p>
               There comes a time when you have to think, hmmm almost everyone thinks I’m a heartless piece of shit. Maybe I am. Am I happy? Maybe I should work on myself first because I’m not doing anyone any good right now. How do you think our world would be if everyone thought like you and had no empathy? Think about it!  Use that narrow minded brain and reach deep down into your soul and think about how FUCKED UP your way of thinking is.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know I wasted all this time writing and my comment from you will just be hateful. I will just be told how I’m a stupid cunt who doesn’t know how to vet sources, that I’m too emotional and I shouldn’t even vote. I will be bashed because of how you view white American women, because in your mind, we are all the same.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yeah yeah yeah. I know. You say it daily. But, maybe a little bit will sink in subconsciously because you need help. I actually have some empathy for you. I have empathy for equine because I know more about his life. I can’t imagine what happened to make you this messed up. But, some people are so mean and hateful that it’s just a waste of time. Our whole society is messed up and being on a forum telling everyone how stupid they are and how they are unfit to research does NOTHING to help. You can’t even try to give us your opinions in a controlled constructive manner. So nobody listens to you! If you do all of this so you can be paid by George Soros, then you should be ashamed of yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
               You say I couldn’t hurt a fly. Well, I don’t like anything to suffer. Not a bug, bird, animal, person, and especially an innocent child. That is how the world SHOULD be. It’s really sad that you don’t get that.

                You're wasting your time on this. There's no fixing sub humans (narcacists, sociopaths, psychopaths). The only thing that ever works on these degenerate, evil "garbage" is to give them "the rabid dog treatment" if you know what I mean.

               You make no sense. Sometimes you hate white people. Especially white women. Other times you act like you’re out to save the white race.

                    This is how you show your retardation. My statement proves the point that you can’t judge everybody based on your little narrow minded stereo types and study results. Everybody is different! You lump all individuals into groups. You hate me and i’m Not even the type of woman you describe. Your only excuse is that I’m dumb then? That’s what you tell everyone here except your alts! LOL. You DO NOT make me emotional. If anything, I laugh because you’re a psycho with severe anger issues. Should I go all psychiatrist on your ass again? Lol

                       Hey crayzie, how's your day been.  You are really great for doing your part and having 2.2 kids and staying married, when you had the option of partying and being independent.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So why do you defend those women who DONT resist that temptation even though it will result in our extinction? Are they not selfish and morally inferior to you?  They have more fun and can buy whatever they want with their own money.  You chose to honor your forefathers by ensuring their genes survive to enjoy the country they built. Why do you owe those sluts your loyalty?

                           So their opinion means precisely nothing, like yours.  Worse, you are ACTIVELY IMPEDING PROGRESS.  Your kids will thank you for it, since I'm sure they're as ignorant as you to their own plight.

                        LOL 😂 Are we cuddling by the fire?

                       <p>
                        I’m not defending those women. They don’t have more fun than me. I made the choice to break the chain and NOT be like how I was raised. The party life is fun for a season. In the long run that kind of life would suck. But many women choose family over careers. That’s my point. Not everyone is what you describe! I’m not defending the ones that choose career over family. Or putting your kids in childcare all day. I wouldn’t even send my kids to public school if I were them.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        But, some women have no choice and have to work. Maybe they don’t have a husband. Maybe their husband was a piece of crap. Isn’t that woman going to work better than being on welfare? Do you want your tax dollars to pay for someone else’s kids to eat? Not every woman has the priveledged of having a partner to help. You don’t know their stories.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I am soooo not a feminist. When I hear the woman card played, it makes me sick. I am NOT pro choice. So I am not giving loyalty to these women. I defend the ones that you lump into a group where they don’t belong. That applies to anybody. You automatically hate women and assume they are dumb slutty vain cunts. Just like you lump ALL Jews. I’m not going to hate anybody when I have no reason to believe they are bad people.

                          You’re really sick. So that’s how you think a situation should be handled? Confiscate someones kids by force? Put them in foster care to be sexually abused? Do you not see how stupid you sound? You don’t have compassion for anyone. I would MUCH rather be loving and caring than to be a sick psychopath like you. Your mindset is so fucked.

                           Actually there's a vast amount of evidence to prove that being molested is FAR LESS HARMFUL than being raised with no father.  I bet you know people personally that demonstate this.  Ever hear of CRIMINALITY, ADDICTION? Thanks for proving my point further: you literally couldn't hurt a fly.  That's female leadership, Merkel would be proud.

                              That’s not what I asked idiot. We all know life is worse without both parents. I want to see the vast evidence you have where it proves that having a single mom is worse than being molested! Foster kids are molested far more often! Not to mention fucking their head up by tearing the family apart.

                            You did NOT just say that being molested is far less harmful than growing up without a father. Oh Geez. In a Pizzagate forum no less. Have you ever heard of kids that are fucked up because they grew up living in foster care? Most of the time they are passed around. Siblings are separated! Foster parents aren’t going to love a child like their own parents would. We aren’t even talking about a single mother who’s strung out on drugs. You’re talking about a single woman who has to work!
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Does your retarded ass know that our tax dollars go towards paying foster parents monthly? I’ll use myself as an example. That will make it easier for your little brain to comprehend it and show you that I know what I’m talking about.
                           </p>

                            We had to raise our nephew for over a year. When that happens, you have to have a case worker. You then become the guardian. You receive a monthly check to help pay for food, clothing, school supplies, etc... They are put on Medicaid to pay for their doctors visits and dental visits. Our tax dollars pay for that!
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            He had been being raised by my husbands half brother and grandmother. He was being abused. We had never even met him until the day we got him. I had to take pictures of his body and document all of his bruises. I really hoped that by raising him in a loving family would turn him around. I had to take him to therapy every single week because of the abuse he lived thru. I planned on adopting him. No matter how hard I tried, he wouldn’t get better. He started abusing our dog. I was afraid to walk out of the room for a minute because he would go punch or kick our dog. He tried to hurt my baby. He kicked me while I was pregnant. I had no choice but to give him up. I couldn’t let my baby grow up this way.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            So guess what happened? His new family were JEWS! Thank God at that time in my life, I didn’t have Donkey saying Jews are evil alll day long. I had never even met Jewish people. I had to stay in touch with that family so we could talk to our nephew. We had to go to their house so that we could take him on outings or just to visit him. Guess who paid that Jewish family monthly to take care of him? Our tax dollars!
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I think someone that lacks empathy like you do, is the most dangerous type of person there is. You’re a narcissist. I don’t know you in real life to say for sure. But, you could very well be a psychopath.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            You are so narrow minded. Every single person has a different story. No matter what race or religion. You haven’t walked in their shoes. You don’t ever think of the whole picture. You talk about how the kids should be forcibly removed from their mothers because she has to work and raise them on her own. So your solution is to rip a family apart. Most of the time, be separated from siblings. Unless the child were lucky enough to find a good family, they would be moved from home to home. Especially if that kid had behavior issues.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            You could say that none of that affects YOU. But it does. Instead of that mother who worked her butt off to raise her kids, because maybe their dad was a loser, or dead, your solution is to take the kids, put them in some strangers home, and our tax dollars pay to raise them. Wow!
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            You use the example of how messed up kids end up by growing up without a father. Have you not heard of how messed up kids can end up by growing up in foster homes? Since you like studies, go look it up. I’m sure you will see that it messes kids up for life.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Let’s say a kid is passed around 4 times while being in foster care, (they have to make room for new ones), the chance of being molested by having new families and friends is pretty high. So then you end up with a kid raised in foster care AND molested. What are the chances that kid grows up and ends up a criminal and/or a drug addict? After growing up like that, they haven’t formed attachments. They don’t have support of close family and friends to lean on. Many times they grow up never able to form attachments or be in a relationship. Think about how equine (maybe you) ended up. In his 50’s, never married, lonely and bitter. What happens if someone like that had a child? Maybe they won’t give a shit and they just walk away. Then the cycle begins again.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            It amazes me how you think everyone here is stupid. How you group everyone by race, religion or gender. You focus on how WHITES are a dying race. I’m white! Of course I don’t want that. But I am not going to put all of my focus on that one thing. There are several things ruining our society today. I’m not going to be a hateful bitter person. That helps nobody.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            There comes a time when you have to think, hmmm almost everyone thinks I’m a heartless piece of shit. Maybe I am. Am I happy? Maybe I should work on myself first because I’m not doing anyone any good right now. How do you think our world would be if everyone thought like you and had no empathy? Think about it!  Use that narrow minded brain and reach deep down into your soul and think about how FUCKED UP your way of thinking is.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I know I wasted all this time writing and my comment from you will just be hateful. I will just be told how I’m a stupid cunt who doesn’t know how to vet sources, that I’m too emotional and I shouldn’t even vote. I will be bashed because of how you view white American women, because in your mind, we are all the same.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Yeah yeah yeah. I know. You say it daily. But, maybe a little bit will sink in subconsciously because you need help. I actually have some empathy for you. I have empathy for equine because I know more about his life. I can’t imagine what happened to make you this messed up. But, some people are so mean and hateful that it’s just a waste of time. Our whole society is messed up and being on a forum telling everyone how stupid they are and how they are unfit to research does NOTHING to help. You can’t even try to give us your opinions in a controlled constructive manner. So nobody listens to you! If you do all of this so you can be paid by George Soros, then you should be ashamed of yourself.
                           </p>

                            You say I couldn’t hurt a fly. Well, I don’t like anything to suffer. Not a bug, bird, animal, person, and especially an innocent child. That is how the world SHOULD be. It’s really sad that you don’t get that.

                              If that’s true, prove it. Show me where it’s not disputed. Show me what study you are referring to.

                              You won’t. You will either reply with some stupid insult, tell me to go find it myself, or you won’t even reply. Why? Because you’re a fuckin idiot. No legitimate study would ever say that! Where the hell do you get these ideas?

             Whatever. When you are right you are right. Like they need a national center for sex education. If 5 million Puerto Ricans went home to Puerto Rico right now we would have a real catastrophe. Cubans are Taino and Carib too.  These children are closer to USA, and are worth more money as slaves.

                        Actually there's a vast amount of evidence to prove that being molested is FAR LESS HARMFUL than being raised with no father. I bet you know people personally that demonstate this. Ever hear of CRIMINALITY, ADDICTION? Thanks for proving my point further: you literally couldn't hurt a fly. That's female leadership, Merkel would be proud.

                       You did NOT just say that being molested is far less harmful than growing up without a father. Oh Geez. In a Pizzagate forum no less. Have you ever heard of kids that are fucked up because they grew up living in foster care? Most of the time they are passed around. Siblings are separated! Foster parents aren’t going to love a child like their own parents would. We aren’t even talking about a single mother who’s strung out on drugs. You’re talking about a single woman who has to work!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Does your retarded ass know that our tax dollars go towards paying foster parents monthly? I’ll use myself as an example. That will make it easier for your little brain to comprehend it and show you that I know what I’m talking about.
                      </p>

                       We had to raise our nephew for over a year. When that happens, you have to have a case worker. You then become the guardian. You receive a monthly check to help pay for food, clothing, school supplies, etc... They are put on Medicaid to pay for their doctors visits and dental visits. Our tax dollars pay for that!
                      </p>

                       He had been being raised by my husbands half brother and grandmother. He was being abused. We had never even met him until the day we got him. I had to take pictures of his body and document all of his bruises. I really hoped that by raising him in a loving family would turn him around. I had to take him to therapy every single week because of the abuse he lived thru. I planned on adopting him. No matter how hard I tried, he wouldn’t get better. He started abusing our dog. I was afraid to walk out of the room for a minute because he would go punch or kick our dog. He tried to hurt my baby. He kicked me while I was pregnant. I had no choice but to give him up. I couldn’t let my baby grow up this way.

                      <p>
                       So guess what happened? His new family were JEWS! Thank God at that time in my life, I didn’t have Donkey saying Jews are evil alll day long. I had never even met Jewish people. I had to stay in touch with that family so we could talk to our nephew. We had to go to their house so that we could take him on outings or just to visit him. Guess who paid that Jewish family monthly to take care of him? Our tax dollars!

                       I think someone that lacks empathy like you do, is the most dangerous type of person there is. You’re a narcissist. I don’t know you in real life to say for sure. But, you could very well be a psychopath.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       You are so narrow minded. Every single person has a different story. No matter what race or religion. You haven’t walked in their shoes. You don’t ever think of the whole picture. You talk about how the kids should be forcibly removed from their mothers because she has to work and raise them on her own. So your solution is to rip a family apart. Most of the time, be separated from siblings. Unless the child were lucky enough to find a good family, they would be moved from home to home. Especially if that kid had behavior issues.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       You could say that none of that affects YOU. But it does. Instead of that mother who worked her butt off to raise her kids, because maybe their dad was a loser, or dead, your solution is to take the kids, put them in some strangers home, and our tax dollars pay to raise them. Wow!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       You use the example of how messed up kids end up by growing up without a father. Have you not heard of how messed up kids can end up by growing up in foster homes? Since you like studies, go look it up. I’m sure you will see that it messes kids up for life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Let’s say a kid is passed around 4 times while being in foster care, (they have to make room for new ones), the chance of being molested by having new families and friends is pretty high. So then you end up with a kid raised in foster care AND molested. What are the chances that kid grows up and ends up a criminal and/or a drug addict? After growing up like that, they haven’t formed attachments. They don’t have support of close family and friends to lean on. Many times they grow up never able to form attachments or be in a relationship. Think about how equine (maybe you) ended up. In his 50’s, never married, lonely and bitter. What happens if someone like that had a child? Maybe they won’t give a shit and they just walk away. Then the cycle begins again.

                       It amazes me how you think everyone here is stupid. How you group everyone by race, religion or gender. You focus on how WHITES are a dying race. I’m white! Of course I don’t want that. But I am not going to put all of my focus on that one thing. There are several things ruining our society today. I’m not going to be a hateful bitter person. That helps nobody.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       There comes a time when you have to think, hmmm almost everyone thinks I’m a heartless piece of shit. Maybe I am. Am I happy? Maybe I should work on myself first because I’m not doing anyone any good right now. How do you think our world would be if everyone thought like you and had no empathy? Think about it!  Use that narrow minded brain and reach deep down into your soul and think about how FUCKED UP your way of thinking is.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I know I wasted all this time writing and my comment from you will just be hateful. I will just be told how I’m a stupid cunt who doesn’t know how to vet sources, that I’m too emotional and I shouldn’t even vote. I will be bashed because of how you view white American women, because in your mind, we are all the same.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Yeah yeah yeah. I know. You say it daily. But, maybe a little bit will sink in subconsciously because you need help. I actually have some empathy for you. I have empathy for equine because I know more about his life. I can’t imagine what happened to make you this messed up. But, some people are so mean and hateful that it’s just a waste of time. Our whole society is messed up and being on a forum telling everyone how stupid they are and how they are unfit to research does NOTHING to help. You can’t even try to give us your opinions in a controlled constructive manner. So nobody listens to you! If you do all of this so you can be paid by George Soros, then you should be ashamed of yourself.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       You say I couldn’t hurt a fly. Well, I don’t like anything to suffer. Not a bug, bird, animal, person, and especially an innocent child. That is how the world SHOULD be. It’s really sad that you don’t get that.
