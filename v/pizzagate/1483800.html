            Anyway, this is 100% sure this is going on in France for decades.
Previous affairs have been completely covered up : Dutroux case : not less than 30 testimonies were killed (
            <a href="https://fr.sott.net/article/8090-Affaire-Dutroux-30-temoins-morts">
             https://fr.sott.net/article/8090-Affaire-Dutroux-30-temoins-morts)
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            Zandvoort case, Outreau case (which had sinister judicial consequences).
           </p>
           <p>
            There is an institutionalised pedo ring here, we know they use orphanages, it's also impossible to get statistics in France on the missing children. Most people that know about it are just afraid to death (and they are right to be) to say anything, or course they should not stay silent. But people that dig in there are systematically killed...

            I believe you, still it's strange to put a inversed pentagram on your logo, I mean a reversed pentagram is nothing but a satanic symbol, it has no other meaning, if you open a restaurant would you palce a reversed pentagram on your door ? Gets stranger when the name of your restaurant is "les enfants terribles" in the light of the last discoveries.
Make a google search with "les enfants terribles restaurant" and look around the pictures and decoration, looks a bit creepy in my opinion, deserves to dig i think.

            I am french, and i'm not aware that "enfant terrible" is known the mean what you say. 
At least it's not used like that at all nowadays, for me it just means terrible children.

            if you are a french native, you could google our persons of interest for past appearances in french media.
Do a date range search limited to french language. remove pizzagate form search (add  "-pizzagate" to query)

              Thats a pretty good reason, thought something might have popped up that we didnt know about, heres what I know of. The Clinton Foundation just had their donations from France stopped

              . There is currently in investigation on the allocation of money

              HRC was director of LaFarge whom is now implicated with funding ISIS

             <p>
              Interestingly I believe that John Podesta was in Paris the night of the bataclan but I have no source for this currently, perhaps his own twitter might confirm.
             </p>
             <p>
              People are looking into shipping ports as a method of transport so given Frances location and naval capacity I presume these paths will cross.

               EDF being owned by the government by more than 80 % and the previous donations that suddenly stopped on the 30th of November came directly from the government as well if i understand. 
Why would two "differents" governments give millions to them for years ? and stop when this email affair gets so dirty ?
From what i saw the french government is not the only one that stopped the donation at the end of last month, its almost all Europe.

               1 So we have this lead, to move further we would have to get the very names of the people that started the donations.
              </p>
              <p>
               2 We have Lafarge that financed Isis that made strong donations to the CF. Can't we make a list organized by countries of all the organizations that gave the clinton foundation ?

                Just to examine the funding for a moment if you look at Norway, they had to parcel up the donations into smaller transactions in order to send over the required amounts of money. Normal Norwegian legislation would not allow for the amount of money that was sent to the CF. Perhaps there is a similar circumstance in France whereby the CF would not have been eligible for such large amounts so it was passed through companies like EDF etc.
               </p>
               <p>
                On a side note Australia and New Zealand also stopped funding and they were VERY large contributors.

                  I completely agree we need to know all the people involved as we can then start to review their motivations for making the donations. Was it A.) Pay to play or B.) Protection money. The second option protection money is becoming more and more likely as this progresses. Think of the mafia if they know you are selling X on the street corner they will want their cut or 'protection' money. Perhaps the CF became aware of a large drug/arms/people smuggling ring and this money was needed in order to keep a lid on the situation.

                  As with point one yes this is imperative to understand the mechanics of the Clinton foundation machine - however given the problems with the filings for the foundation I am not sure an accurate list of this exists outside of a select few computers in Clinton's home.

                   Your point is that governments would pay CF for their "part" on the illegal activities these governments would be at the head of ? Like prostitution, drug selling, and worse .. ? Why the CF would be this "protection entity" ? The amounts of money we talk about must be way bigger than the millions that are donated, maybe CF is just one of the ones that need to be paid. All of this is just suppositions of course.
This seems to be bigger than we all can think it might be. We just have to follow the money, i don't know how this can be done without some very good informatician trying to find this infos.

                   Simple, or we get the infos at the sources, or we accumulate and note everything we learn, then one post should be dedicated to building such a list. With sources ofc.

                  1.) I accept that my opinion here is a stretch but two things keep coming to mind the more we find out about the money a.) this has been going on much longer than the Clintons have been in power b.) The amounts of money and the lengths some countries have gone to, to pass money forward raises alarm bells.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I live in a country where pay for play is very common, but usually money is passed from person to person, or person to institute. What would be the motivation for a government to collude on this level, implicating many people within the government itself. Cash donations from individuals is easier to deal with in the context of pay for play.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  2.) Start a new thread for this and we will contribute making a list off all donors - another great resource here is

                  &lt;- this subreddit was repurposed many times and contains a treasure trove of info from the clinton emails / DNC leaks / podesta emails from some of the finest centipedes on the net. During the elections some of the brightest autists were in there making connections we're still catching up with.

                   1) There is obsviously a reason of all this donations and the one of pure donation is unacceptable as well as the pay to play one. I agree.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2) I create it, lets hope it will be what we expect, then it will make the global image clearer, we will just have to draw the lines. We also have to be very careful with checking the sources because i think they will try to mislead us.

                It looks like the hole thing was some kind of satanic related event, anyway Islam is satanic, the group that was playing this night was called Eagles of Death if my memory is good, and they began the killing spree when the song "kiss the devil" was playing. Maybe that's just all coincidences ...

               There is a creepy Instagram picture of one of the restaurant owners in a French restaurant called Le Enfants i think. It should be in the archice. I can find it if you dont know what Im takling about.
              </p>
              <p>
               Les Enfants translates to "the Child" if my french isnt to rusty?

                 Found this look, restaurant in Paris called "Les enfants terribles" = "The terrible children" 
What about the inversed pentagram and the logo next to it ? Some one has an idea of the significance of this logo ?
