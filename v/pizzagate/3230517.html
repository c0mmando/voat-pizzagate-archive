<p>The Perot family has a long history of starting and growing successful companies as well as investing in great companies founded by others. For nearly three decades, Perot Investments has provided equity and debt capital to scores of public and private businesses. Through Perot Holdings, we are focused on acquiring majority stakes in private companies managed by others in which we can play an active role in creating long-term value.</p>
<p><strong>A Legacy of Success</strong></p>
<p>Our legacy dates back to the Perot family’s simple beginnings in Texarkana, Texas. Ross Perot began his entrepreneurial journey in 1962 by founding Electronic Data Systems (EDS). His vision essentially created the Information Technology (IT) services sector, which today has become an almost $300 billion global industry. Mr. Perot took EDS public in 1968 and later merged the company with General Motors. Subsequently, Mr. Perot and his son, Ross Perot, Jr. started and led Perot Systems, an IT services company. Perot Systems went public in 1999 and was acquired by Dell Inc. in 2009. Ross Perot, Jr., is also the founder and chairman of Hillwood, a real estate investment and development company ranked among the top 10 residential land developers in the United States.</p>

             A Legacy of Success
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Our legacy dates back to the Perot family’s simple beginnings in Texarkana, Texas. Ross Perot began his entrepreneurial journey in 1962 by founding Electronic Data Systems (EDS). His vision essentially created the Information Technology (IT) services sector, which today has become an almost $300 billion global industry. Mr. Perot took EDS public in 1968 and later merged the company with General Motors. Subsequently, Mr. Perot and his son, Ross Perot, Jr. started and led Perot Systems, an IT services company. Perot Systems went public in 1999 and was acquired by Dell Inc. in 2009. Ross Perot, Jr., is also the founder and chairman of Hillwood, a real estate investment and development company ranked among the top 10 residential land developers in the United States.

               web.archive.org allows more scripts to run when taking snapshots, than does archive.is(etc); therefore web.archive.org properly displays the "Network Visualizer" on corporationwiki.com because it is generated using a script which the other archive service does not allow to run.
