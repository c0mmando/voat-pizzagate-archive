<li>Acting Director of Cyber Security at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), <strong>Timothy DeFoggi</strong>, age 56, was sentenced, January 2015, to 25 years in federal prison for “participating in a child pornography ring that sources say was so depraved, it even shocked veteran investigators.” DeFoggi was a registered user of an on-line child rape and torture, aka child porn, trading site. DeFoggi “expressed an interest in the violent rape and murder of children. He suggested meeting one member in person to fulfill their mutual fantasies to violently rape and murder children.”</li>
<li>Former Undersecretary of the Navy, 70 year old <strong>James Daniel Howard</strong>, arrested on child porn possession and reproduction charges in 2013. Howard served as special assistant to Ronald Reagan. He plead guilty to ten child porn counts and served only seven months in jail.</li>
<li>Joint Strike Fighter Program Navy officer, <strong>Bruce Babchyck</strong>, arrested in 2014 for downloading “hundreds of gigabytes” of young girls and bestiality on government computers. He received a one year sentence.</li>
<li><strong>Anthony Mangione</strong>, 50 year old Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for South Florida, was arrested on “extreme child abuse” charges on 28 September 2011. He was sentenced, November 2012, to nearly six years in prison. Mangione is a 1982 graduate of the University of Maine Orono (UMO) where former Senior Child Protection Services (CPS) Cynthia Wellman claimed, at the time, CPS was operating a child sex ring, on campus, with UMO’s involvement. “Little is known about Mangione’s time at UMaine. Originally from Rhode Island, he arrived in Orono in August 1978.”</li>
<li>David Bourque, formerly the 51 year old Police Captain of Granby, Connecticut, was sentenced to ten years for child porn possession and distribution. He had more than 328,528 images and 4,000 videos on his police department computer including “sadistic and violent acts” against infants and toddlers. His “collection” was organized into more than 300 sub-folders named “photos — babies — men” and “6–10yo boys pics.” In this excerpt Bourque is D for defendant. Prosecutors said the images were “extremely disturbing; some are especially horrific” including: (1) a boy between 1 and 3 years old being raped by an adult male penis in the child’s anus, (2) a boy between 3 and 6 years old with a “penis of what appears to be an adult male pressed against the child’s anus” and (3) a child, less than a year old, “performing oral sex on an adult male.” Bourque showed “callous disregard” for the children being abused telling people to “enjoy” themselves and “have fun.” Samples of his on-line chats include extensive discussions of rape and bondage of children. Bourque was a decorated officer with more than 31 years in law enforcement.</li>
<li>Army prosecutor and judge advocate, <strong>Daniel Wollverton</strong>, father of two, convicted in 2011 for infant sodomy and possession of over 30,000 images and 1,000 videos of brutal child sex abuse including that of a three month old infant.</li>
<li>Maine Assistant Attorney General, 52 year old <strong>James Cameron</strong>, was sentenced to just over 15 years in federal prison, December 2014, for seven counts of child porn possession, receipt and transmission. Cameron, widely recognized as Maine’s “top drug prosecutor,” had been trading in PTHC - pre-teen hard core. Images/videos that investigators seized included “images depicted prepubescent children, sadistic and other violent conduct.”</li>
<li>Army Colonel, 55 year old <strong>Robert Joel Rice</strong>, a war game developer at Army War College, was charged with 130 child porn counts. He had more than 30,000 images/videos of child sex abuse when his wife discovered the files and notified local police. The Army War College had continued to employ Rice, and allow him supervised access to Army computers, while on bail pending trial. Col. Rice had been scheduled for a July 2013 arraignment; however, Rice’s federal hearing was delayed until February 2015. Rice’s preliminary county hearing had been set for April 2013.</li>
<li><strong>David O’Brien</strong>, America’s chief scientist responsible for monitoring global nuclear activity at Patrick Air Force Base’s Technical Applications Center, which operates our Atomic Energy Detection System, was arrested May 2013 and charged with ten counts of child porn possession and distribution. O’Brien had a large child porn collection on his home and Air Force computers. On 17 October 2014 he was sentenced to five years in federal prison in exchange for a guilty plea to one child porn count. O’Brien had download videos of the sex abuse of children as young as three years old. He had taken pictures of his granddaughter and placed images of her head over images of children being sexually abused. He also had pictures of Air Force employees transposed over sex abuse images.</li>
</ul>
<h1>US Department of State</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carl Carey</strong>, a 54 year Senior Project Manager in Information Technology (IT) at the US State Department, was arrested on ten counts of child porn possession, April 2012, by the Fairfax County Police.</li>
<li><strong>Gons Nachman</strong>, a 42 year old former US diplomat “admitted taping his sexual encounters with teenage girls while stationed in Brazil and the Congo” was sentenced, August 2008, to 20 years in prison. Nachman also plead guilty to child porn possession. One of his videos was titled “Congo 2004 Sexual Adventures.” His law degree is from the University of Pennsylvania, where he was president of the Naturist Student Association and “led demonstrations involving public nudity in 1995.”</li>
<li><strong>James Cafferty</strong>, 45 year old Special Agent with the US State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, pleaded guilty, 5 January 2012, to child porn charges and was sentenced, 26 April 2012, to 7 years in federal prison. Upon his arrest he had more than 30,000 images of child sex abuse. He “had shipped computer equipment containing many of those images from London to the United States when he returned home from his last official government assignment.”</li>
<li><strong>Timothy Towell</strong>, 75 year old former US Ambassador to Paraguay, was charged with “sex crimes” against an 18 year old in 2009.</li>
<li><strong>Howard Gutman</strong>, former US Ambassador to Belgium was accused of “routinely… soliciting sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children” according to an Office Inspector General (OIG) investigation. Aurelia Fedenisn, a now former OIG investigator said her unit had found widespread evidence of “sex and drug scandals” but “were told not to look into it.” Fedenisn said “investigations into the allegations were called off by senior officials to avoid political embarrassment.”</li>
</ul>
<h1>Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrew Warren</strong>, a 42 year old former CIA Chief of Station in Algeria, was arrested April 2010. Warren’s neighbors called Norfolk police when Warren exposed himself in public. “He had his genitals hanging out of his pants, over the top of ‘em,” said one witness. Warren reportedly said “Excuse me. I’ve had minor surgery so I get a little horny sometimes.” He had been terminated from employment with the CIA in May 2009, after he drugged the drink of a woman in Algiers and raped her. Warren plead guilty and, June 2009, was indicted on sexual assault charges. Diplomatic Security Service agents also found child pornography on Warren’s laptop computer in 2008. When he was the CIA’s Chief of Station in Algeria, he allegedly “drugged and raped multiple women before getting recalled home.” Warren was sentenced, on sex assault charges, among others, to more than five years in federal prison in March 2011. It appears Warren was not charged for the child pornography on his government computer.
Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI)</li>
<li><strong>Donald Sachtleben</strong>, a 54 year old former FBI Agent was arrested, 14 May 2012, and charged on child pornography charges. He plead guilty to distribution and possession and was sentenced, 14 November 2013, to eight years in prison. He was also sentenced to unrelated charges of one count of disclosing and one count of possessing classified information. At the time of his arrest Sachtleben was Director of Training at the Center for Improvised Explosives at Oklahoma State University. He served the FBI from 1983 to 2008 as a bomb technician and counter terrorism investigator. Sachtleben had been using the handle pedodave69@yahoo.com when he was caught sending images of child sex abuse in an on-line forum. He wrote, “Saw your profile on (a file sharing network). Hope you like these and can send me some of ours (sic). I have even better ones if you like.”</li>
<li><strong>Keith Dietterle</strong>, a 28 year old FBI Analyst, was arrested, 23 November 2012, on child porn charges. He plead guilty to child porn possession and was sentenced, September 2013, to more than three years in prison. Dietterle was caught when he sent child sex abuse images/videos to an undercover Metro DC Detective. The detective was posing as a man sexually abusing his 3 year old nephew and 12 year old daughter. Dietterle described the rape of the children as “So hot man … how’d it start?” and discussed meeting the detective with the intention of sexually abusing the three year old boy. Upon his arrest, the FBI terminated Dietterle’s employment.</li>

            </strong>
            , a 42 year old former CIA Chief of Station in Algeria, was arrested April 2010. Warren’s neighbors called Norfolk police when Warren exposed himself in public. “He had his genitals hanging out of his pants, over the top of ‘em,” said one witness. Warren reportedly said “Excuse me. I’ve had minor surgery so I get a little horny sometimes.” He had been terminated from employment with the CIA in May 2009, after he drugged the drink of a woman in Algiers and raped her. Warren plead guilty and, June 2009, was indicted on sexual assault charges. Diplomatic Security Service agents also found child pornography on Warren’s laptop computer in 2008. When he was the CIA’s Chief of Station in Algeria, he allegedly “drugged and raped multiple women before getting recalled home.” Warren was sentenced, on sex assault charges, among others, to more than five years in federal prison in March 2011. It appears Warren was not charged for the child pornography on his government computer.

Upon his arrest, the FBI terminated Dietterle’s employment.
