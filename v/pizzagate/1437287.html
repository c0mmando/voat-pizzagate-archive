<p>What kind of a man would be friends with epstein for 15 years, dine with him at his house,  travel with him and invite him to use his own property and resorts? Particularly if he knew of the man\'s proclivities for underage girls:</p>
<p>&quot;I\'ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,\'\' Trump booms from a speakerphone. &quot;He\'s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>

<p>Why would the Obama administration file foia requests to obtain  photos and administrative documents regarding Donald Trump at the Clinton Whitehouse during the 90s,  and  also the Bush Whitehouse? in particular documents related to Donald Trump with additional guests? Why would photos of Donald Trump at the Whitehouse be restricted in the first place,  as well as Whitehouse admittance records that would show the names of who these additional guest were?  why were many of them withheld from the Obama administration?</p>

<p>Why is it not considered a conflict of interest that trump considered his opponent to be a close friend, that he gave over 100k to his opponents Foundation more if you count his donations to Bill and hillary\'s various campaigns, and that they are indeed even related.    Why is it not considered a conflict of interest that both bill and Trump are compromised in the same scandal with Epstein and that both Trump and Clinton benefit from the suppression of the Epstein case and the pizzagate scandal?</p>

<p>why would Epstein plead the 5th when asked about trump and  underage girls? Why would Epstein have all of Trumps phone numbers including car phones, and household staff and security in a black book along with the names of underage girls and and other rich powerful men who for some odd reason just had to fly on Epsteins plane and hang out at his house?</p>

<p>Why would the prosecution lawyers representing the government in Epstein\'s trial work directly with Epstein\'s lawyers to keep the judge and court in the dark regarding the full known extent of Epstein\'s crimes including co conspirators known to investigators?</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Marie Villafana wrote to Epstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz in a Sept. 19, 2007, email. &quot;I will include our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and I will mention \'co-conspirators,\' but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge ... maybe we can set a time to meet, if you want to meet \'off campus\' somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have all the necessary decision makers present or \'on call\' as well.&quot;</p>

            Perhaps the most disgusting thing I took away from all that was that he encouraged (or at least didn't stop) his daughter to enter the modeling world, where he knew very well how managers sexually took advantage of young women.

             Trump was asked on the Wendy Williams show what he had most in common with Ivanka.  His reply:
            </p>
            <p>
             “Well, I was going to say sex, but I can’t relate that to her,” Trump told Williams while pointing to Ivanka.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Yeah, she’s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father . . . ”  Trump in Rolling Stone
            </p>
            <p>
             “You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her? Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She’s six feet tall, she’s got the best body. "  Trump on Howard Stern
            </p>
            <p>
             “Although she does have a very nice figure. I’ve said that if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps, I would be dating her.”

            I checked on this, too. Several scandal papers tried really hard to make a case against Trump and none of them had any evidence. There was no name on Epstein's flight logs, when Clinton's name appeared 26 times. The woman who accused Trump was 13 in 1998, 20 years ago. No proof there. Then they mentioned a woman who worked at Trump's golf course who was recruited by Epstein and passed around to other men. No mention of Trump in that one. --- They try really really hard - but there is no evidence. Epstein's brother testified that Trump flew "at least once" on Epstein's plane. Trump's lawyers said that they did not socialize. Epstein did go to Trump's home for fundraisers, and that's it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump lawyer Alan Garten told FoxNews.com in a statement Trump and Epstein are not pals.
           </p>
           <p>
            “There was no relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump,” he said. “They were not friends and they did not socialize together.”

             Both Epstein himself and his brother both testified that Jeffery did in fact socialize with Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prior to Epstein's exposure as a pederast Trump made no effort to hide his relationship with Epstein and his public comments regarding Epstein show that he not only knew Epstein but also knew of his wild social life and proclivities for young women.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump dined at Epstein's house and not in the context of fund raisers.  In the depositions from the Epstein trial it was said that trump regularly ate at Epstein's with the kitchen staff.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump was familiar enough at Epstein's house that he could go where he pleased and eat with the staff in the kitchen as opposed to in the dining room where Epstein entertained his regular guests (if they can be called regular)
            </p>
            <p>
             Why was trump in Epstein's little black book along with his car phones security guards and household staff in a special category alongside the names of victims and other wealthy powerful men implicated with epstein?
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't really take the claims of someone's lawyer at face value.  Their job is to defend their client even if they are guilty.
            </p>
            <p>
             The evidence that implicates trump is of the same variety that implicates Clinton:  circumstantial.   Why is circumstancial evidence valid against Clinton but not trump?  There is no explicit evidence again bill either as the evidence against all Epstein's Co conspirators was kept secret.
            </p>
            <p>
             Clinton made the same categorical denials that trump has.  Do you believe Clinton lawyers?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why did trump change his story about his relationship with Epstein?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why did trump and his lawyers lie about receiving subpoenas in the Epstein case?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why has the government kept the content of its investigation into Epstein's Co conspirators secret?

            Id have to agree here, Trump was on that plane just like the Clintons and Steve Bing. We know why people go on Epstein's plane, so why arent people asking why the Donald boarded the plane multiple times?

             I definitely want to see Trump investigated as well. I'm sure he's guilty of, at the least, sexual assault, but also most likely rape, and probably sexual acts with minors, too. Who knows if there's even more?
            </p>
            <p>
             Right now everyone has a LOT of leads with the whole trafficking network, but not much on Trump. I'm fine with everyone focusing on whatever they need to do right now to take this thing down. We can get to Trump another day, but eventually he deserves as much scrutiny as everyone else.

              It is my opinion that we should focus on Trump.  He is the president elect and in the best position to make moves to cover for the network.  If he gets the chance he will stop all investigation into the Clintons and pizzagate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump is now the pizza gate keeper and he will be the barrier to any thing that comes of pizzagate in the future.
             </p>
             <p>
              Scrutinize him now.  Hold his feet to the fire now.  He is part of the Clinton network and he is in very close proximity to tremendous power now.
             </p>
             <p>
              He is now a bigger problem than Clinton.  when he becomes president he can squash all of this.  Trump-Clinton for prison.
