             Same with gangs, the mafia, Freemasons, Boy Scouts, and terrorist organizations. There is no exit through the gift shop.

             He is very intelligent, and also annoying and suspicious. He also referred to himself as the God of Open Source, and keeps threatening to run away to Norway if Trump won't meet with him. He was featured on Alex Jones, and that alone should raise some eyebrows. This guy is a professional liar. After all, that was what his entire career was based on - including 'knowing all about Lolita Island operations including Chuck Schumer and others involved', yet only says to connect the dots. If he knows about Chuck and Lolita Island, he must know all about the Knights of Pythias.
            </p>
            <p>
             The DHS insider popped back up at just the right time to steer the momentum saying to call Robert Steele for more information, and magically Bob was on with Alex Jones almost instantly, as if it wasn't planned. He claims to know everything about Chuck Schumer and others who have been compromised through Lolita Island, yet all they say is connect the dots, and no one asks them to lay out any evidence or name any other names, whereas here on voat if you lay out the entire network of connections and how they link to Racine, Wisconsin everyone comes out the woodwork demanding the murder weapons and frame by frame photos of the crimes. Something is very wrong with that picture.
            </p>
            <p>
             Believe this long-time CIA guy who refers to himself as a God, and his DHS insider friend if you want, as they make loose references to areas where the DOJ has limited jurisdiction without any new information, and remember they are the deep state, or look into the real facts from real people who know the real truth about Racine, Wisconsin and how it links a lot more to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption than anything these guys say.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob - if you know everything about Lolita Island and other CIA operations, why won't you name names, and what do you know about Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, Scott Walker, the Knights of Pythias, Pilgrim's Society, Agenda 2030, and how Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption are linked with Racine and Wisconsin? Tell us something we don't already know. Who cares about justice, right Bob? Let's pretend it never happened, forgive everyone involved, and talk about 3d tractor printing instead. Ask him if he supports Agenda 2030, and if he supported Gary Johnson since he was going to run as a Libertarian.
            </p>

               Correct. The people on the other side generally are much smarter than those on our side. They also have power and control of money and information. That is exactly how they have gotten away with this for so long.

               Either that or very closely connected. Robert Steele knows a lot, but when asked to provide more details, he won't.

               The links between DHS and trafficking in Denver and Racine which are both hubs for Freemasons are very important. It also links to viruses, vaccines, Agenda 2030 and the bigger picture of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

               You may complain about the repetitive nature, but it's not a shill tactic. It is extremely real and shocking. People just want to write it off. Or you know it is true and you are involved. If not kindly help support this different approach or get out of the way. This is scary and they are stalking and threatening witnesses to it.
              </p>
              <p>
               The district attorney there was involved in a scandal and cover up, and the attorney general is in the same inner circles, Freemason etc., and they blocked investigations. The locals are owned and controlled, have been directly involved, and this is way beyond them. Many people have met with the FBI and much more information has been sent to law enforcement at all levels. Loretta Lynch stopped all investigations. Locals are all corrupt and in Freemasons and other groups together. It needs a spotlight, and what they are hiding is much bigger. Robert Steele just stated tonight that Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker were soon to be "road kill". Not 100% sure he can be trusted, but if he is openly saying that, it is important and relevant.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you want to just make an enemy for no reason without knowing what you are talking about, then you don't care about other people's lives, and that makes you no better than the people who are involved in this mess. Please recant your statements and understand that this is very real for some of the victims to these crimes at many different degrees. If you are not a victim or working with victims of the various parts of these crimes, consider empathy, and before you stalk and attack, why don't you at least investigate and verify some of the easiest and publicly accessible information. Some of it cannot be provided here, but if you want to just start at the surface and look into the recent RICO lawsuit, if nothing else you see a beginning pattern with direct evidence of racketeering and how things work in Racine.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is a system of racketeering, collusion, cover ups, and any imaginable levels of brazen crimes and abuse - they mock the law and threaten people's lives and gain pleasure and power. Look up what happened with the last district attorney who blocked investigations, or watch Pattern or Practice and see what they did in downtown, or watch Talking Racine, or look at Racine Exposed and News the JT Can't Use, or just search a bit. The bigger picture will all be revealed in a different format as it is very complicated, but if something is not done soon, we will know Trump is doomed, and hence America and the world are in serious trouble.

             Agreed. I've been listening to and watching this guy and he seems fake as hell. A lot of what he says makes absolutely no sense too. He wants no arrests when the pedo stuff is revealed. He thinks arresting the scumbag politicians would cause too many problems. I think this guy is damage control.

             Can somebody see if he's related to the British intel agent Christopher Steele, responsible for the "pissgate" "dossier"?
