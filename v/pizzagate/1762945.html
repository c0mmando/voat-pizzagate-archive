<p>TOO MUCH MORE TO LIST&gt; PERUSE THE ARTWORK ON GAGOSIAN. Its hardcore. He is also connected. There is more....</p>
<p>1: SEX TRAFFICKING FOR ART BOOM. 
Larry Gagosian indicted on human trafficking charges. For Buying sex slaves from Russia <a href="https://unknownjournal.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/%E2%96%BC-report-larry-gagosian-to-be-indicted/">https://unknownjournal.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/%E2%96%BC-report-larry-gagosian-to-be-indicted/</a></p>
<p>&quot;New York art dealer Larry Gagosian will be indicted next month in Moscow on multiple charges of buying sex slaves from a well known Russian collector. The charges of human trafficking span a decade. Gagosian could face life in prison, although experts in the Russian judicial system express doubt he will be convicted. The Russian judicial system is notorious for its corruption including alleged pay offs to drop previous charges brought against the collector who will be indicted along with Gagosian.It’s reminiscent of stories about 1980s New York art dealer Andrew Crispo.&quot;</p>
<p>2: ITS EVEN BIGGER FOLKS: ABROMOVICH, LUCIEN FREUD, GAGOSIAN &amp; CHILD SEX SLAVES TRADED FOR ARTWORK:</p>
<p><a href="https://unknownjournal.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/%E2%96%BC-update-gagosians-co-conspirator/#more-1324">https://unknownjournal.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/%E2%96%BC-update-gagosians-co-conspirator/#more-1324</a></p>
<p>Update: Gagosian’s Co-Conspirator 05/04/2010 tags: human trafficking, Larry Gagosian, Roman Abramovich</p>
<p>Roman Abramovich is the Russian oligarch and serious art collector named in connection with human trafficking charges brought against New York art dealer Larry Gagosian. Abramovich is accused of both selling countless sex slaves to Gagosian, as well as exchanging slaves for pieces from Gagosian’s private art collection.</p>
<p>Abramovich , born 24 October 1966, is a Russian business- man and the main owner of the private investment company Millhouse LLC. In 2003, Abramovich was named Person of the Year by Expert, a Russian business magazine. He is known outside Russia as the owner of Chelsea Football Club, an English Premier League football team, and for his wider involvement in European football. Abramovich is currently the 3rd richest man in Russia and the 50th richest man in the world according to the 2010 Forbes list with an estimated fortune of $11.2 billion. Abramovich has recently boosted his security staff to a 40-person “private army”, making him one of the best protected businessmen in the world.</p>
<p>In May 2008 Abramovich emerged as a major buyer in the international art auction market. He purchased Francis Bacon’s Triptych for US $86.3 million (a record price for a post-war work of art) and Lucian Freud’s Benefits Supervisor Sleeping for US$33.6 million (a record price for a work by a living artist).</p>
<p>Chris Hutchins, a biographer of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, claims that the relationship between the former Russian president and Abramovich is like that between a father and a favorite son.</p>
<p>Boris Berezovsky (his one-time business partner) alleged in 2008 that Abramovich harassed him with “threats and intimidation” to cheat him to sell his valuable shares at less than their true worth. Abramovich has been sued for US $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>On 5 July 2008, The Times reported that Abramovich admitted he paid billions of dollars for political favours and protection fees to obtain a big share of Russia’s oil and aluminium assets as was shown by court papers The Times obtained. Yugraneft, an affiliate of Sibir Energy, is seeking billions of dollars in damages in a lawsuit in London against Roman Abramovich and his investment company Millhouse Capital, alleging that it was cheated out of its Russian assets.</p>
<p>In 1992 he was arrested in a case of theft of government property: AVEKS-Komi sent a train containing 55 tankers of diesel fuel, worth 3.8 million (Roubles), from the Ukhtinsk Oil Production Factory. Abramovich co-operated with the investigation, and the charges were dropped after the oil production factory was compensated by the diesel’s buyer, the Latvian-US concern, Chikora International. An allegation emerging from a Swiss investigation links Abramovich, through a former company, and numerous other Russian politicians, industrialists and bankers to using a US$4.8 billion loan from International Monetary Fund as personal slush fund.</p>
<p>The Times said that Abramovich “famously emerged triumphant after the “aluminum wars”, in which more than 100 people are believed to have been killed in gangland feuds over control of the lucrative smelters. He avoided the fate of a rival oligarch who annoyed the Kremlin and ended up being transported to jail in Siberia for ten years,” and “Numerous officials and executives are said to have lost their lives”.</p>

           Update: Gagosian’s Co-Conspirator 05/04/2010 tags: human trafficking, Larry Gagosian, Roman Abramovich
          </p>
          <p>
           Roman Abramovich is the Russian oligarch and serious art collector named in connection with human trafficking charges brought against New York art dealer Larry Gagosian. Abramovich is accused of both selling countless sex slaves to Gagosian, as well as exchanging slaves for pieces from Gagosian’s private art collection.
          </p>
          <p>
           Abramovich , born 24 October 1966, is a Russian business- man and the main owner of the private investment company Millhouse LLC. In 2003, Abramovich was named Person of the Year by Expert, a Russian business magazine. He is known outside Russia as the owner of Chelsea Football Club, an English Premier League football team, and for his wider involvement in European football. Abramovich is currently the 3rd richest man in Russia and the 50th richest man in the world according to the 2010 Forbes list with an estimated fortune of $11.2 billion. Abramovich has recently boosted his security staff to a 40-person “private army”, making him one of the best protected businessmen in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           In May 2008 Abramovich emerged as a major buyer in the international art auction market. He purchased Francis Bacon’s Triptych for US $86.3 million (a record price for a post-war work of art) and Lucian Freud’s Benefits Supervisor Sleeping for US$33.6 million (a record price for a work by a living artist).
          </p>
          <p>
           Chris Hutchins, a biographer of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, claims that the relationship between the former Russian president and Abramovich is like that between a father and a favorite son.
          </p>
          <p>
           Boris Berezovsky (his one-time business partner) alleged in 2008 that Abramovich harassed him with “threats and intimidation” to cheat him to sell his valuable shares at less than their true worth. Abramovich has been sued for US $3.3 billion.
          </p>
          <p>
           On 5 July 2008, The Times reported that Abramovich admitted he paid billions of dollars for political favours and protection fees to obtain a big share of Russia’s oil and aluminium assets as was shown by court papers The Times obtained. Yugraneft, an affiliate of Sibir Energy, is seeking billions of dollars in damages in a lawsuit in London against Roman Abramovich and his investment company Millhouse Capital, alleging that it was cheated out of its Russian assets.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 1992 he was arrested in a case of theft of government property: AVEKS-Komi sent a train containing 55 tankers of diesel fuel, worth 3.8 million (Roubles), from the Ukhtinsk Oil Production Factory. Abramovich co-operated with the investigation, and the charges were dropped after the oil production factory was compensated by the diesel’s buyer, the Latvian-US concern, Chikora International. An allegation emerging from a Swiss investigation links Abramovich, through a former company, and numerous other Russian politicians, industrialists and bankers to using a US$4.8 billion loan from International Monetary Fund as personal slush fund.
          </p>

           The Times said that Abramovich “famously emerged triumphant after the “aluminum wars”, in which more than 100 people are believed to have been killed in gangland feuds over control of the lucrative smelters. He avoided the fate of a rival oligarch who annoyed the Kremlin and ended up being transported to jail in Siberia for ten years,” and “Numerous officials and executives are said to have lost their lives”.

            Still crypto brah, in the long run it is all pagan/nephilim god/goddess blood letting babylonian cults, and you're right, the papacy and jesuits pull all their strings. Ain't no back down the rabbit hole for me bro I know what's up. The Muslim Brotherhood is just one more faction toward the NWO goal.

            It's fun to feel that first hand perspective from your stories about Jean-Michel. That feeling was my favorite part about the breakout role Jeffrey Wright played in that 1996 movie of the same name. Although the movie seems to use that poetic license relatively freely with an ominous cast of characters that one feeling was what attracted me to Basquiat. Thank you for that it is perhaps one more gift he could pass on that could inspire other artists to create that innocently.

            The Nicholson stories, although never boring to hear, seem to be quite prevalent, who
            <em>
             hasn't
            </em>
            got one? I would like to hear more though lol.

            Kevin Spacey huh, yeah, we know about him, he likes 'english restrooms' if you know what I mean, is in Epstein's little black book, and is great friends with X-mens Bryan Singer. Speaking of Hollywood pedophilia, and as an artist yourself, what would you say about the pedophilic/hebo/bestial/homosexual undertones as an subliminal tool employed in his films? Not to mention the real life legal struggles Mr Singer has encountered over the years. Any additional tea spil't here?

            I think your words are wise about most of what you say, I'm intrigued and would thoroughly enjoy opening up an alternative line of communication.

            It seems to me also that part of the sneaky leftist platform is a very duplicitous hegelian dialectic. First, they promote and fund liberal/left programs, LGBTQ, or politically correct gender confusion issues to stir up the pot, cause a number of socio-economic catalysts, withdraw their support for those organizations in favor of the hard line wahhabi islam, which has been proven to be an old testament law observing crypto-jew creation in and of itself which is all truly only an extension of the babylonian blood letting cult of baal/enki.

            SLAVERY, HUMAN TRAFFICKING &amp; PERSECUTION IN QATAR, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, KUWAIT, SAUDI ARABIA &amp; BAHRAIN
            <a href="https://www.lexandermag.org/about/human-rights/">
             https://www.lexandermag.org/about/human-rights/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            One of our principal efforts in our advocacy of human rights has revolved around the ever worsening violations &amp; crimes against humanity under the feudal Salafi Arab emirates of the Persian Gulf. For those who aren’t familiar with Salafism, it is the brand of Islam practiced &amp; advocated by the Taliban &amp; Al-Qaeda terrorist networks.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is important for people to understand that these genocidal Safalist regimes are state-sponsors of terror &amp; have enabled the mass slaughter &amp; butchery of countless Muslims—both Shi’a &amp; Sunni—as well as Christians, Kurds, Yezidi, Turkmen &amp; many other ethnic groups of the region.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even worse, the ruling Salafist families of these murderous regimes engage in all manner of sexual perversions &amp; crimes, from violent, state-sanctioned rape of women, men &amp; children, forced prostitution of women &amp; children in secret brothels, and other such evil behavior that in any civil society would not be tolerated. Yet the United States, United Kingdom, France &amp; Germany grant the bloodthirsty rulers of these regimes carte blanche to do whatever they want due to their spending tens of billions of dollars &amp; pounds on high-value (blue chip) Western art, billions more each year on arms, aircraft &amp; naval purchases, as well as another few billion for the hiring of private armies consisting mostly of Mexican &amp; Columbian soldiers of international drug cartels. If you already thought these terrorist-sponsoring tyrants were bad, they are infinitely worse than anyone could possibly imagine.
           </p>
           <p>
            We strive to keep our business dealings clean &amp; free of the blood money that flows out of the terrorist-sponsoring feudal Arab regimes of the Persian Gulf. Likewise, we refuse to do business with any artist, gallery or museum that has financial or trade connections to such regimes, and we encourage you not to patronize these establishments either.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among the artists &amp; institutions that help enable the Salafi barbarism, migrant slavery &amp; terrorist atrocities of the Persian Gulf region are:

            What does the CIA care about art? Nothing, clearly. But that is not the point. The point is that I do not wish to work for the CIA, helping them to sell their newspapers and magazines.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, the corporate/government squid does have some interest in the art market, as I have shown in
recent papers. Art is a big unregulated business, worth billions a year, and so you would not expect it
to be free of the corporate/government mobsters. Like everything else, the art market is controlled
from the top down, and it is controlled to benefit a few rich people. It is not set up to benefit art
history, much less the artist or the art lover. It is set up to benefit the speculators and the swindlers.
That is why you see the obscenely inflated trade in objects of no intrinsic value or worth: it is the art
analogue to the derivatives market. Modern art is not really art, it is an art derivative, a manufactured
“art market instrument.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Which leads us to an interesting diversion, and my title here. If Modern art is a derivative, what is the
underlying asset? In other words, a derivative in the financial markets is defined as a contract (or bet)
based on the performance of an underlying asset with real value, such as gold. But what real asset is a
Modern art derivative based on? Since a work of Modern art is a big nothing, there must be something
of value that is underlying the trade. What is it? It is the prestige attached to the name “art,” and the
prestige attached to spending a large sum of money on something you can point to as “art.” So the real
commodity in art is no longer the artifact, it is the perceived prestige attached to the sale. In a way, this
is what Robert Hughes meant when he said art had become “monetized.” But I am taking the idea a lot
further than Hughes did, since I am showing you that art is not just monetized, it is now based on a
psychological state. Prestige is not a “tangible” asset, in the sense that you cannot touch it. Prestige is
simply a feeling that a buyer has. The underlying asset in the art derivatives market is a feeling. Art
has not just been monetized, it has been psychologized.
           </p>
           <p>
            But of course this makes art like a fiat currency, since it is based on nothing but consumer confidence.
Art, like a fiat currency, depends entirely upon the emotional states of those involved. Modern art is
again like a fiat currency, in that it is backed by nothing but an empty guarantee. The paper dollar is
backed by the guarantee of the Federal Reserve, but since the Federal Reserve is bankrupt, that
guarantee is worth nothing. Likewise, the guarantee of the art market is worth nothing, since it is also
bankrupt (and has been since about 1910). The art market has been existing on nothing but
credit/default swaps—the art being the default—since before the First World War, and only crushing
ignorance about everything to do with both art and economics has kept confidence high.

            <em>
             “Money laundering in the art world should be considered a big problem,” says Judge Fausto Martin De Sanctis, a
federal judge who is releasing a book on the subject this month. In Money Laundering through Art: a Criminal
Justice Perspective, he argues that international justice systems, regulatory bodies and police forces are
inadequately equipped to detect and investigate such criminal activity. “Proceeds from various crimes can be
easily laundered through the purchase of works of art thanks to a big loophole—a lack of awareness and
regulation,” he says."

work. They also assured us that the problem was limited. Both these things are false.
Modernism has been a money laundering scheme of one sort or another since the beginning. And I
mean all of it. In other words, it is a manufactured market, manufactured to move large sums of money
around without regulation and without suspicion."

            391, very interesting and believable testimony. Not often we get to meet those who have been in the periphery of fame, and not even know it at the time. Its great fun to experience and view history first hand instead of through the rose colored glasses Hollywood would like us to see it through. Do you have any more interesting nuggets for us. Spill some tea.

             I think that about sums it up. And once again, yeah we are getting a clearer picture of how it all works. But what the hell can we do about it? Clearly these guys get off free and nothing sticks. This will never be about pizzagate so I tried to follow a thread that would break down and expose another aspect perhaps a more realistic prosecutable offense. NOw that I have seen this its around every corner, its been going on 4ever and it lurks in every shadow, out in the open, and everywhere in between. It doesnt really matter to itslef because it KNOWS  IT LIVES. And "IT" would rather take us down a path of total destruction that expose itself. What else is there to do is my main question in all this. What ACTIONABLE thing would make a bit of difference. Wheel spinning at its finest.

            Greetings,
My number is XXX and I do not use Skype but I think you can contact me with that and we can talk. I am almost always home except for an errand or two.
The problem is not with XXX. As you said, “XXX is the best” and I have found XXX to be a real breath of fresh air in a profession where that is all too rare. I am the skunk at the garden party and am very sorry it turned out that way. The unedited version of the transcript of the conversation was not really a problem for me. Where the difficulty lies is that in the place I live free speech is simply not an option, in particular the type of speech I engage in — and what you read is exactly the way that I talk, no attempt to prettify it, because truth to tell, the situation is absolutely rotten as is most of the politics and the political elites in the XXX world. Ditto for XXX and his minions though it must be said that XXX brings a lot more sophistication with his game… How else could he be shredding the constitution with assassinations at whim and obliterating XXX without what I always thought was the sacred secular right of a trial by a jury of one’s peers. Enough of that.
My reason for pulling back is quite simple: high tension in the region, XXX being on a war footing, XXX, the authorities here — in addition to their deep-seated paranoia — are fully aware that the XXX for XXX is regime change in one form or another and in that they are absolutely correct, XXX being bent on baiting the XXX into blitzing XXX. I don’t think he will succeed in that, but it is very possible that the XXX on Thursday could be a riposte to the ill-chosen words of XXX making plain that an attack on XXX would be considered an attack on XXX.
I am already at odds with things the way they stand here. As one example, I have been without a passport and any form of identification since the incident involving XXX and my telling the XXX he was in government custody which he was and still is, XXX protestations notwithstanding. The list is longer and the consequences for me have been far more profound but not subject for this missive. My dilemma is this: appearing in any foreign publication, no matter how benign or sanitized, would be sufficient pretext for my being incarcerated and possibly more than that — as I have history of not going quietly into the night, so to speak — the odds are heavily stacked against me but even at this advanced age I simply do not respond well to unjust force, regardless of who the perpetrators may be. Frankly, officialdom does not mean a damn thing to me, in particular when it comes in the form of tyranny.
If you want to send me an edited version of the conversations I had with XXX, I would be happy to read the same. But the issue is that anything printed related to me, however innocuous, would be sufficient pretext for XXX to come poking around or even ask me to show up in their offices which I would reflexively refuse to do and then the real would commence. By all means send it and by all means do call me because somehow I am intrigued by the premise of the Bidoun phenomenon and if it does not work this time around, perhaps there will be other occasions. At the moment however, I am of the opinion that something very much like war is going to take place between XXX and XXX. The obvious truth is that XXX has for long months been engaged in acts of war against XXX but the corporate media is sanitizing all that, knowing full well that XXX is an act of war. Being stuck between two very different types of tyranny tends to make one keep his/her head down and that is what I am into at the moment. Still I would like to hear what you say and read what you edit but it is more than likely that I would still have to decline because I have a life to live, however truncated, and am not inclined to risk what small freedoms I enjoy for a magazine piece that could turn my small world upside down at warp speed. But I do sincerely appreciate your concern. And again the fault is mine alone and not XXX’s. Thank you for taking the time to read this and you are free to call anytime.
—XXX

            Gagosian Opens New Outpost in Athens
This fall Gagosian Gallery opens an eighth selling outpost with the launch of a new Greek gallery at 3 Merlin Street in Athens, reports Lindsay Pollock. The inaugural show, “Leaving Paphos Ringed with Waves,” features Cy Twombly paintings. Gagosian has evidently pulled out of Moscow for the time being, according to the gallery website, but has opened an office in Hong Kong. Pollock reports that shipping heiress Marina Livanos will be running Gagosian’s Greek venture.

            INSTEAD OF GETTING TRULY BUSTED, THEY GIVE HIM THE POWER TO SET UP HIS OWN UNREGULATED SHPPING AND AVOID TAX ALTOGETHER. THIS GUY NEVER GETS IN ANY TROUBLE. HE JUST SLIMES RIGHT ON THROUGH.
"As part of Gagosian’s settlement, it agreed to introduce a new code of conduct that  requires it  to establish a wholly-owned division to facilitate the shipment of art from the gallery's New York locations to out-of-state clients. The shipping division will arrange for shipping by selecting a carrier and entering into a principal-agent contract with such carrier for the shipment of art outside of New York. Unless an out-of-state buyer agrees to use Gagosian's shipping division, the gallery will collect New York sales tax when it ships art out-of-state."

            Historical Investigations by the DA’s Office and Other State Law Enforcement
In 2003, the Manhattan DA’s Office launched an investigation into fine art galleries, dealers,
and private collectors violating New York State and City sales tax regulations. The probe
focused on high-end art sellers who skirted charging their New York customers sales tax by
shipping empty containers to out-of-state locations such as New Jersey and Connecticut.

            "To me, that makes the most significant part of the settlement one that Randy Kennedy's Times story only mentions in passing: To insure full compliance going forward, Gagosian "has agreed to set up a new shipping company of its own." True, plenty of galleries already pack/crate works and make local deliveries via their preparators. But the decision to set up a dedicated in-house shipping company would be unprecedented, to my knowledge. More importantly, it would slide a new component into elite galleries' increasingly "full stack" approach to client services. If you thought the high end of the sector was already feeling corporate, the trend lines point us toward a future where its members become fully autonomous, vertically integrated megaliths, with no need to hire out for anything. And by giving Gagosian another nudge in that direction, Schneiderman probably deserves to have his likeness printed on every urinal screen in the art-services sector."
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect we will find connections to human &amp; organ trafficking, money laundering and inflated "art" deals of stolen or faked art. coming together. just trying to map this component as i believe it is the key to the pizzgate ring in how they move money and use it for political and sick aims.

            MORE ON SHPPING CONTAINERS. HE SEEMS TO FOCUS ON ART DEPENDING UPON WHAT HE IS UP TO
 (See earlier Gargosian artists moving from Guns, Pills/Drugs, Children, Money and now Shipping Containers. (my observation) you can actually track it.

Here, she talks to Gagosian's Derek Blasberg about her MFA Houston exhibition, using a shipping container as a camera, and her place in photography as we enter a digital age."

           </p>
           <p>
            How did this show in Houston come about?
The chief curator of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Malcolm Daniel, was formerly the chief curator of photography at the Met in New York, so I’ve known him for twenty years. We met soon after my graduate show—I attended the School of Visual Arts in New York—in 1994. He had heard about my work but the show was down, so he came to my apartment, because at the time I didn’t have a studio. I guess he liked what he saw because he became a big champion of my work and the Met became one of my greatest supporters. In fact, it was through the Met that I was introduced to Larry Gagosian. So, when Malcolm moved to Houston and had an opening in his programming schedule, he invited me to collaborate with him again, and of course I was elated.
           </p>
           <p>
            I’m often drawn to your more industrial images, were any of these selected for the show?
Yes, there’s an oilrig that I photographed in a German shipyard, and it’s one of my favorite pieces. It’s from 2000 and it’s called Kvaerner Shipyard, Rostock Warnemünde, IX: December 5, 2000. I used to title my works according to the place where they were photographed, but I was forced to stop doing that when I discovered that another photographer was traveling to those locations in an attempt to duplicate my work.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of your most iconic series, and one of my favorites, is your work from the Pepsi Cola factory.
Yes, that’s in the show as well. I photographed these works in 1998, so it’s one of my earliest series. I discovered the Pepsi Cola sign one night when I was out with my friends and we were driving down the east side of Manhattan, and there it was across the river in Long Island City. The factory allowed me to use their roof to set up my equipment for the picture, and then they let me photograph the inside of their factory too, which lead to many more conceptual images, such as Pepsi Cola Interior, XXIII: July 1–31, 2003.
           </p>
           <p>
            Talk to me a little bit about your process. How do you find a location?
Most often things start with an idea in my head, and many times I don’t even know the location. I get an image in my head and then I look for it in the world and for a space to realize it. Sometimes people will make suggestions to me. There’s an image of a massive mining machine in the show, that my mother told me about. She said this would be a great subject for me, so I went and saw it, and she was totally right.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first “camera obscura” that you ever created was in your apartment. You turned your entire apartment into a camera. How has your technique evolved?
Well, I don’t have a studio apartment anymore. That’s the good news! But the process is the same. I still work with a camera obscura, which can be a room, it can be my studio, it can be a cabin I build or a shipping container that I rent. I always take the easiest route. If there’s nothing, I’ll build a little house or rent a shipping container. At the Pepsi Cola bottling factory in Long Island City, it wasn’t possible to crane a shipping container onto the roof, so my friends and I built a little cabin, and that became my camera.

            MOCA Gala raises $2.5 million with Marina Abramovic's "An Artist's Life Manifesto"
           </p>
           <p>
            An Artist's Life Manifesto, hosted by Gala Chairs Maria Arena Bell and Eli Broad, Honorary Gala Chairs Larry Gagosian and Dasha Zhukova, who was also in attendance, together with MOCA Director Jeffrey Deitch, began with cocktails in the MOCA galleries, including a private preview of the exhibition Naked Hollywood: Weegee in Los Angeles, which opened to the public on November 13. Curated by art historian Richard Meyer, the exhibition is the first museum survey devoted to the body of work that the tabloid photographer known as Weegee produced in Southern California. Guests also previewed the work of Kenneth Anger, also in attendance that night, in the exhibition Kenneth Anger: ICONS, which showcases the films, books, and artwork of one of the most original filmmakers of American cinema. Guests were offered what Abramović called Post-Human Cocktails, provided by Purity Vodka. After previewing the exhibitions, guests proceeded to the gala tent, where they were fitted with crisp, white lab coats before entering the main event.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Marina Abramović choreographed an extraordinary art performance in which all of our guests were participants," commented MOCA Director Jeffrey Deitch "It fused an art experience with a social experience."
           </p>
           <p>
            "We at MOCA are honored to have had Marina Abramović serve as this year's gala artistic director," said Gala Chair Maria Arena Bell. "We are very grateful for her time and talent in presenting a brand new work at the museum. This continues MOCA's tradition of transforming the museum gala into an experiential, once-in-a-lifetime artwork created by a leading contemporary artist."
           </p>
           <p>
            MOCA trustees in attendance included Co-Chair David G. Johnson and wife Suzanne Nora Johnson, Board President Jeffrey Soros and wife Catherine Soros, Board Vice-Chair Fred Sands and wife Carla Sands, Chair Emeritus Clifford J. Einstein and wife Mandy Einstein, President Emeritus Dallas Price-Van Breda and husband Bob Van Breda, along with trustees Wallis Annenberg, Charles L. Conlan II, Gary Cypres, Kathi Cypres, Laurent Degryse, Gil Friesen, Susan Gersh, NancyJane Goldston, Richard J. Grad, Lilly Tartikoff Karatz and husband Bruce Karatz, Lauren King, Daniel S. Loeb, Edward J. Minskoff and wife Julie Minskoff, Steven T. Mnuchin and wife Heather Mnuchin, Peter Morton, Carolyn Powers, Steven F. Roth, Darren Star, and Jamie Tisch. Also in attendance were Life Trustees Blake Byrne and Frederick M. Nicholas.
           </p>

            STAR ARRIVALS 
MOCA's gala drew hundreds of international guests from the worlds of art, politics, design, fashion, and music. In addition to guests noted above, other attendees included MOCA Chief Curator Paul Schimmel; Hedi Slimane, whose exhibition Hedi Slimane: California Song is currently on view at MOCA Pacific Design Center; Tim Blum and Jeff Poe, who hosted a dinner for MOCA donors the evening prior; actors Devon Aoki, Rosanna Arquette, Albert Brooks and his wife the artist Kimberly Brooks; Lisa Eisner, Alice Eve, Linda Ramone, Abigail Spencer, Sela Ward, and Sean Young. Fashion world icons, such as Rodarte's Kate &amp; Laura Mulleavy, Maurice Marciano, Jeremy Scott, Phoebe and Annette Stephens of Anndra Neen, Cameron Silver, Pamela Skaist-Levy and Gela Nash-Taylor of Juicy, and stylists George Kotsiopoulos and Rachel Zoe were also in attendance, as well as violinist Hahn-Bin; Creative Time's Anne Pasternak; collectors Eugene Sadovoy, Nicolas Berggruen, Eva Chow, Amy Phelan and husband John Phelan, and Liz Swig; Jacqui Getty; and Liz Goldwyn. Other noteworthy artists in attendance included, Amy Bessone, Mark Bradford, Brian Butler, Rosson Crow, Piero Golia, Mark Grotjahn, Thomas Houseago, Nate Lowman, Adam McEwen, Ed Moses, Ryan Trecartin, and Francesco Vezzoli.
           </p>
           <p>
            An Artist's Life Manifesto continued in the main tent, decorated in black box fashion with mirrors and dark walls, a concept and design realized by Carleen Cappelletti, president of Bounce-AEG, who also produced the event. Inside the tent, everyone wore lab coats over their evening attire—a detail of Abramović's setting for artistic experimentation. Performers were stationed under black-cloaked dinner tables as live centerpieces, their heads popping out from holes cut into the tables and slowly rotating around. The centerpieces engaged in non-verbal exchanges with guests who chose to interact with them, meeting the gazes of the diners as they ate and drank. Other guests sat down to a reenactment of Abramović's Nude with Skeleton (2002, 2005, 2010) work in which female performers were situated under skeletons on rotating platforms at the center of round dinner tables.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maria Arena Bell and Eli Broad welcomed the crowd, followed by remarks by Deitch and then Abramović, who thanked guests for their participation in the experiment, pointed out the cards at everyone's place setting that instructed guests to "look, but do not touch," and invited guests to silently communicate with the performers: "The centerpiece will observe you. You may observe the centerpiece...please respect the rules." As she left the stage, two sets of shirtless male performers acted as pallbearers, carrying two shrouded bodies across and off the stage, a foreshadowing of what was to come. Suddenly, singer Svetlana Spajic entered and began performing selections from Robert Wilson's The Life and Death of Marina Abramović, capturing the attention of guests. After Spajic left the stage, Abramović appeared and began reciting portions from her Artist's Manifesto. As she recited lines, responses came booming from performers lining the tent’s periphery, who then began to filter onto the stage, single file, and engage in a spirited call and response with Abramović.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the Artist's Manifesto, guests continued to engage with the performers as they dined on their first course of what Abramović called The Survival MOCA Dinner, consisting of three plated courses prepared by Along Came Mary: Super Human Cocktails provided by Purity Vodka and Rauschenberg Spirit. Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon from Summerfield Wines accompanied the first course, the John Cage Symphony, a tower of frisée, endive, quinoa, tomato concasse and dates, with roasted shallot vinaigrette and topped with crispy onions, along with various amuse bouches and assortment of breads. The main course, the De Kooning Power Mix, was a roasted filet of beef, sautéed kale and mushrooms, baked root vegetables, roasted artichokes with a rouille, demi glace sauce. A vegetarian and fresh fish dish were also available.
           </p>
           <p>
            While guests dined, the pallbearers returned to the stage carrying a cloaked Deborah Harry, who emerged in white lab coat, which she promptly stripped off to reveal a tight blood-red cocktail dress. Harry treated guests to a rousing performance of "China Shoes," "Heart of Glass," "One Way or Another," "What I Heard," and "Mother," bringing the crowd to its feet. Guests danced around the stage, relishing an intimate, once-in-a-lifetime experience with the pop icon and legend.
           </p>
           <p>
            The evening concluded with a surprise finale, dessert prepared by Kreëmart, the Manhattan-based creative entity founded by Raphael Castoriano, which pairs artists with pastry chefs to give the former the opportunity to create via the ephemeral, unique medium of dessert. Guests watched as the pallbearers reappeared carrying "bodies," which were unveiled by Harry and Abramović to reveal naked figures of themselves, decorated with white chocolate fondant. Wielding carving knives, Harry and Abramović, then sliced open their likenesses to reveal red velvet (Harry) and rich chocolate (Abramović) cake inside. Two performers then took over, cutting apart their edible body parts to serve gala guests, who enjoyed the Kreëmart creation along with illy coffee, and Andy Warhol Addictions—pear tarte tatin, brown-sugar-cane wafers, chocolate-espresso molten cakes, pecan bites, and roasted red grapes.
           </p>
           <p>
            As guests fanned out into downtown L.A. and beyond, lab coats still on or in hand, it was clear that all in attendance had experienced a new kind of gala, which transformed them from spectators into participants in an interactive performance art piece.

            This 4 chan i believe i posted above earlier, but in review it is loaded with ties of how this money trade moves and the connections. Of course Gagosian featured prominently along with Koons, Clinton, Abramovich and the Oligarchs and Quitar royal family. Need to look into shipping business further. Drug and Arms trade appears to be prevalent.

            Qatar, a nation known for funneling oil money to ISIS through clandestine banking channels, has taken a keen interest in Jeff Koons, and not just his artwork either. A frequent guest of the Qatari royal family, Jeff Koons has played a major role in the development of their billion dollar Museum of Modern Art.
In January of 2015, Jeff Koons and Marina Abramovic headlined a high profile invitation only event in Doha, Qatar hosted by Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, chairwoman, Qatar Museums, and Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr., chairman and publisher, The New York Times Company.
Sotheby’s and QNB are the headline sponsors for the Art for Tomorrow conference.
“The hostess of the evening (Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani) sat laughing with the pony-tailed Japanese artist on her right. On her left was Dakis Joannou, a Greek-Cypriot industrialist and avid collector of the work of Jeff Koons, an American sculptor. Larry Gagosian, whom many regard as the most powerful art dealer in the world, was placed at a table nearby, with the other art dealers”
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS THE SISTER OF THE EMIR OF QATAR. THIS IS THE WOMAN IN CHARGE OF QATAR’S $1BILLION / YEAR ART ACQUISITION. THIS WAS A BIG EVENT W/ HUNDREDS PROMINENT FIGURES IN THE WORLD ART SCENE IN ATTENDANCE. DOZENS OF BILLIONAIRES IN ATTENDENCE.

Anonymous ID:rR/2o8vo Sun 20 Nov 2016 23:45:31 No.99543967  Report
Koons acted as curator of an Ed Paschke exhibition at Gagosian Gallery, New York, in 2009. In 2010 he curated an exhibition of works from the private collection of Greek billionaire Dakis Joannou at the New Museum in New York City. The exhibition, Skin Fruit: Selections from the Dakis Joannou Collection, generated debate concerning cronyism within the art world as Koons is heavily collected by Joannou and had previously designed the exterior of Joannou's yacht Guilty.
"I love it here," said Jeff Koons. "This is my sixth time in Doha since 2000." Koons denied that he had a project in Qatar, saying rather that he liked taking his kids for buggy rides in the sand dunes."
"Doha: Plastic and ready-made, it’s a city built for Jeff Koons... A frequent guest of the Qatari royal family, the artist is in the desert peninsula’s capital to headline the New York Times Art for Tomorrow conference. For a cool $1,995, attendees from around the globe enjoy a three-day confab, which also features Marina Abramović, Jeffrey Deitch, Marc Spiegler, and Hans Ulrich Obrist, as well as cyborg artists, sheikhs, and corporate philanthropists, all in conversation with Times journalists Roger Cohen, Robin Pogrebin, and Farah Nayeri."
His work is widely collected in the US &amp; Europe, where some collectors acquire his work in depth. Eli Broad has 24 pieces, and Dakis Joannou owns 38.
Dakis Joannou
He is considered to be one of the leading collectors of European and American contemporary art in the world, and is famous for acquisitions such as the Jeff Koons-designed yacht ‘Guilty’. Joannou is active in the hospitality sector, with holdings in the Inter-Continental Hotel in Athens and through Yes! Hotels
Joannou is also involved in several other industries including bottling, shipping, aviation, and real estate.
Primary areas of business located in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeastern Europe.

            Does the art market need more regulation?
Henry Little 29 JUNE 2015

           <p>
            As the art market becomes ever more international, does the trade need to be more carefully supervised, and whose interests are in need of the greatest protection?
 (exerpts below)
           </p>
           <p>
            Recent art market commentary presents a new and unusual crisis: too much money. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2015, the American economist Nouriel Roubini made a well-publicised plea for greater regulation of the art market. Roubini’s argument is straightforward enough: as ‘a new and separate asset class’, traded in what he argues is an opaque market with ‘serious distortions’ and ‘shady behaviour’, reform and regulation are needed. Roubini is not a lone voice in this. In the Deloitte Art and Finance Report 2014, the American lawyer Steven Schindler argues that the market ‘still falls short of meeting the investing class, in terms of regulatory structure, information availability and clear title’.
           </p>
           <p>
            In such a large global market, worth just over €51 billion in 2014, according to the TEFAF Art Market Report 2015, Roubini points out that private banks and financial institutions are lending money with art as collateral. Art investment funds proliferate, trading in a market with greater price transparency but without fundamental pricing models, creating a market subject to ‘fads, fashions, manias – and potentially bubbles’, which may or may not be about to burst catastrophically. So far, so familiar.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the point of reform and regulation, Roubini stresses that the market remains opaque, despite relative improvement, with art ‘used for both tax evasion and tax avoidance in the United States and abroad’. It similarly presents a readily accessible ‘conduit for money laundering’, with price opacity facilitating insider trading and outright manipulation, and few checks on the origins of payments for private treaty sales. The apparent contradiction regarding increasing price transparency requires some explanation. Looking at the availability of information over the past 20 years, there has been an exponential increase in both the amount of sale records accessible online and the volume of analysts examining art market data with increasingly scientific rigour. Anyone with an internet connection can trawl the artnet sales database, or similar resources, to check the auction price for a work, or prices for comparable pieces. In contrast, prices in the dealer segment of the market, which accounts for just over half, can be kept private and there is no legal obligation for a seller to reveal his or her financial interests in the work, or indeed the price paid for it. This has historically been the location of profit for dealers: buy low, sell high. It is true to say there is greater price transparency, relatively speaking, but that much still remains hidden.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whichever way you look at it, there appears to be a growing consensus that the market is in a new phase of consolidation and escalation, with an unprecedented surplus of wealth at the top tier meriting special attention. Clare McAndrew’s TEFAF report, The International Art Market in 2011: Observations on the Art Trade Over 25 Years, concludes that the market doubled during the period in question, growing over 575 per cent from its lowest point in 1991 to its peak in 2007. In January 2013 journalists Robin Pogrebin and Kevin Flynn penned an anxious article, ‘As Art Values Rise, So Do Concerns About Market’s Oversight’, for the New York Times, focusing on calls for the New York State legislature to increase regulation of both gallery and auction sales. In more recent months, Cynthia O’Murchu offered a summary in the Financial Times of the circumstances surrounding Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier’s arrest in Monaco this February on charges of price fixing and money laundering. Like many journalists writing in the wake of Roubini’s Davos intervention,
           </p>
           <p>
            O’Murchu highlights the use of freeports (storage facilities in tax-free zones) for discreet transactions, as well as quoting one anonymous dealer: ‘If I think that the guy in front of me sells drugs or has blood on his hands that is where I draw the line…As long as art is not regulated why should I be the one to fix the rules?’
           </p>
           <p>
            If we can agree there is greater price transparency than ever, thanks largely to the internet, what else has changed in the modern era? Secrets of an Art Dealer (1938), an autobiographical account of the trade by James Henry Duveen (cousin of Lord Duveen), contains many endearing tales of art market criminality that might seem rather parochial in comparison to the global scale and girth of purported art-related crimes today. Describing the early decades of the 20th century, Duveen presents a market overrun with forgeries and outright fakes, overt criminal acts, profit-driven ethos and rampant smuggling. However familiar this may sound, the swashbuckling approach to quick profit was on a scale that seems modest by today’s standards, restricted to a small number of dealers and clients in only a handful of cities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The auction houses have, in some cases, been quick to address the need for consumer confidence, and the price fixing scandal of the 1990s still casts a long shadow. They have had to be far more assertive about their propriety, demonstrating best practice at every possible moment. Sotheby’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics pamphlet, which is easily accessible on the company website, asks employees to be aware of phrases such as ‘Everybody in the art world does it’ or ‘No one will find out’. And to think accordingly: ‘What would this look like if reported on the front page of a major news publication?’ Sotheby’s maintains a 24-hour company hotline so that any concerned employee can report ‘potentially illegal, unethical or questionable conduct’.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sotheby’s code of ethics makes for interesting reading – not least because it signals to shareholder, buyer and consigner alike that the auction house is acutely aware of the myriad opportunities for criminality available. It offers guidance to employees for navigating situations as diverse as conflicts of interest, giving or accepting gifts and entertainment, social media, securities and insider trading, antitrust and unfair competition, anti-money laundering/terrorist financing, and anti-corruption. While Christie’s does not publish its code of conduct online, employees are bound by one that has a comparable reach to that of its major rival.
           </p>
           <p>
            With so many potential pitfalls, how savvy does a buyer need to be? And does caveat emptor abide? The recent lawsuit brought by Ronald Perelman against Larry Gagosian, heard in the State Supreme Court in New York, established that buyers operating in the top price brackets should do their homework when spending $4 million on a Jeff Koons. Perelman alleged that Gagosian had exploited his position of trust as a long-time advisor to the billionaire, withholding information and hard-selling the work at an inflated price. Associate Justice David Friedman ruled in December 2014 that ‘as a matter of law, these sophisticated plaintiffs cannot demonstrate reasonable reliance because they conducted no due diligence. They did not ask defendants, “Show us your market data.”’
           </p>
           <p>
            If anything, this shows that accusations of unfair knowledge ‘asymmetry’ are beginning to lose water. Yet we should view the top end of the market in perspective. The industry at large is still comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, with only 3 per cent of dealers reporting 2014 sales in excess of €25 million, and the bulk (68 per cent) with turnover of less than €2 million (according to the TEFAF Art Market Report 2015). Most glaring of all, the top 1,530 lots sold at auction in 2014 represent 48 per cent of the value of the fine art market, but less than 0.5 per cent of the transactions. Such numbers present the disproportional weighting of the market in sharp relief, forming an irresistible argument for a tier-by-tier assessment of the case for greater regulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The outlandish top end of the market, in which vast sums of money change hands between a wide range of international players, is ripe for confusion between different tax regimes and responsibilities. New buyers and fledgling collectors must surely be thinking twice before entering the market, when the mainstream media is dominated by reports of high prices and legal cases surrounding title (such as Nazi-related restitution claims) and authenticity – especially now many authentication bodies such as the Keith Haring Foundation have ceased to offer this service. All the same, while a bad reputation for the industry is damaging all round, it is difficult to quantify how far any law suit contested between two billionaires might affect the sale of a £20,000 painting.
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of a regulatory body, perhaps notable trades at auction should be subject to spot-checking by a board of impartial legal and tax experts. Of course, implementing the same for private treaty sales would be much harder. The trade ultimately wants an easy life, and a fair profit. What nobody knows yet is how busy the courts might become once the feast is over, and speculator-collectors have assets with crashing values dropped on their toes.

ART OR IDIOCY? SCREAM REPORT 2004
            <a href="https://artoridiocy.blogspot.com/2004_10_01_artoridiocy_archive.html">
             http://artoridiocy.blogspot.com/2004_10_01_artoridiocy_archive.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1994, the first Scream (1893, oil, tempera &amp; pastel on cardboard) was stolen from its home in Norway's National Gallery. It was the opening day of the Olympics in Lillehammer. Thieves broke in at night by climbing up a ladder and in a window before snatching it off the wall. The painting was not secured in any substantial way and not connected to an alarm system. A psychic was called in and had a vision of pieces of wood tangled in wire in a body of water. Authorities found the remnants of the painting's frame and "security device" on the edge of a pond, just as the psychic had divined. The painting was eventually recovered three months later when the crooks were unable to secure a ransom for it. Could they be at it again?
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, many news reports failed to make the distinction between the two versions of The Scream, if they even realized there was more than one. Some even reproduced the wrong one, including a notable British news organization. Gasp! Scandal! I know... Perhaps it is crass, but I am glad that the iconic famous one is not the one stolen two months ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are four versions of The Scream. According to Ulrich Bischoff, in his monograph on Munch, fifty versions exist. He can only be including the various lithographs and prints which exist of this image in addition to the four paintings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, inaccuracies riddle this story. A definitive breakdown of the numbers and natures of the works was found at The Munch Museum's website (www.munch.museum.no). There are two paintings, the National Gallery owns the afore-mentioned one, The Munch Museum owns the other. There are also two pastels, The Munch Museum owns one and the other is in a private collection. It is The Munch Museum's painting of The Scream which was most recently stolen. Both the paintings are executed on cardboard, with a sketched version on the reverse of the one in the National gallery. The Munch Museum also has a sheet of paper with several sketches relating to The Scream doodled on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a cold comfort, but at least the other one is still out there. Could the recently stolen Scream now be in private hands as well? There is no way the art thieves could sell or auction the piece off through any normal channels. Experts feel that the crime was committed in order to extract a ransom. This seems like a dumb idea. Have you ever heard of a ransom being successful? But maybe we never hear about successful ransomings because the authorities don't want to encourage anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            *Is it possible this is a Thomas Crown affair? Where someone so wants a work of art that they hire armed thugs to steal it in order to possess it. *Who could be so unscrupulous? Larry Gagosian?
            <em>
             In all seriousness, it is entirely possible that there is network of black market art collecting. From all the lawsuits and court cases that Artnews so diligently reports on, it isn't hard to believe that all sorts of underhanded dealings go on in the art world. Such things go on in every other aspect of the world, so it is entirely possible here too.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Experts in the field of giving disappointing statistics about stolen art say that the higher profile the piece, the harder it is to sell. If they can't ransom it, or turn it in for a reward, the Munch marauders would probably trade it for drugs. This was the gist of what Tony Russell of Art Recovery Ltd had to say.
           </p>
           <p>
            About 5 billion dollars of art gets stolen every year. About 5% is recovered. But the more high profile the art, the more likely it will be returned for a ransom. So I guess ransoming does work. And there is a secret web of clandestine art traders. Apparently the real money is in stealing less valuable works and selling them unnoticed. Most of the art is stolen from homes and sold on the internet. So that is why art auctioning online has failed, there's a better way!
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes you wonder how much of the art on Ebay is stolen. It is the only online auctioning of art left and it groups its art by color. "Green paintings," for instance. I once had a conversation with a businesswoman from South Africa who was posative she saw an Utrillo (Maurice Utrillo, French, 1883 - 1955) on Ebay, and that it was going for very cheap. Very suspicious. I told her she'd better snatch it up then and cash in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Galleries and museums each have about 12% of the loss that makes up the yummy pie graph of art purloinery. For those of you who think art doesn't matter to the rest of the world, art crime is fourth behind drugs, money laundering and gun running. The experts feel that this type of crime isn't linked to an artlover with masterpieces on their walls. It's part of organized crime and connected with the other three top crimes being committed. Well fuck you, I like my theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other expert was Sarah Jackson of the Art Loss Register.
           </p>
           <p>
            But don't forget that Madonna was also stolen. Again, in his text, Bischoff mentions that five versions of this painting exist. This image is also in lithograph form, so that number is higher, like the 50 Screams. Both paintings were part of Munch's opus work The Frieze of Life. Which was a tour de force of the human experience, but mainly the sad bits. When discussing the Madonna, and when it was displayed as part of the Frieze of Life in 1903 in Leipzig, Bischoff notes that it is "impossible to be certain which of the five versions Munch painted of this picture it was." The Munch Museum Madonna is oil on canvas, and there are four other versions done in paint. Two are in private collections. The National Gallery owns one and so does the Hamburger Kunsthalle. Now, after consulting the information on The Munch Museum's website, I thought I had finalized the details. But I am still confused. In Bischoff's book on Munch, the reproduction of the Madonna is credited to the National Gallery, not The Munch Museum. This is so in other publications I looked at as well. Now the Bischoff Munch book is from 1995, so it is possible in the meantime, that one could have come to the Munch Museum. It is not possible that the reproductions are of two different paintings. I compared the reproduction in the Bischoff book to the one on The Munch Museum's website, and located several nuances that showed up in both images, eccentricities such as drips, gestural marks, and stains, which would not be possible for Munch to have created twice by hand. The National Gallery's website provided no insights. So is this the Madonna that was stolen or not? I don't know.

            Definitely a big upvoat for this thread. Amazing research.

            More than a few very interesting dots to connect in this debacle. Looks like that Richard Prince pissing off that Sera Fina was a big mistake. Now she's showing the world how the elite's ringmasters operate. Those agencies, artists and photographer's that are nothing more than drug dealers and pimps that are into the most egregious practices known to man.

            A tormented artist’s life and death.
           </p>
           <p>
            An interlock search, explains reporter Goldstone (Aaronsohn's Maps: The Untold Story of the Man Who Might Have Created Peace in the Middle East, 2007, etc.), is “a type of flowchart used in anti-trust litigation and accounting that involves graphing the relationships between interlocking boards of directors.” That construction formed the basis of works by conceptual artist Mark Lombardi (1951-2000), a paranoid, opinionated conspiracy theorist whose mission in life and art was “to connect all the scandals of his generation into one huge interlock,” from the Kennedy assassination to the bombing of the World Trade Center. Described by his family as “a hellion and a chronic envelope-pusher,” Lombardi earned the nickname “Mighty Mouth” because of his endless harangues. “He not only grabbed your ear, he bent and twisted it,” a friend said. The author speculates that Lombardi’s obsession with interlocks of banking, politics, the CIA, the FBI, the Mafia, and foreign potentates stemmed from his being fired from his first job at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston. “Forbidden knowledge of the clandestine alliances between master class and underworld gave him a giddy rush of power,” writes the author, and “a weapon against the fraternity that had disadvantaged him.” Despite his difficult personality, Lombardi found champions: for example, the Texas lawyer and legislator Sissy Farenthold, a “glamorously melancholy society rebel” who pitted herself against Gov. John Connally and his “Gorgon’s nest of allied business interests.” With Farenthold’s help, Lombardi became a fixture of the Houston art scene, and his work came to the attention of the prestigious Drawing Center in New York, which invited him to participate in a group show. Interest from other galleries and museums soon followed. Goldstone has impressively mined the artist’s archives and interviewed many who knew him, dutifully recording all their contradictory gossip, but readers may have a difficult time finding sympathy for the author’s subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            An exhausting deluge of information about a man many remember as a “natural-born hustler.”

            GOLDSTONE REVEIW Interlock: Art, Conspiracy, and the Shadow Worlds of Mark Lombardi

            MORE BY AND ABOUT THIS AUTHOR
The question of who murdered New York artist Mark Lombardi (1951–2000)—if, in fact, he was murdered—is clearly an intriguing one, but journalist Goldstone (Aaronsohn’s Maps) never really gets around to answering it in this meandering, overwritten biography of the controversial artist. Lombardi struggled in near obscurity until achieving some success in his 40s, but he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment in March 2000, having apparently hanged himself. His best-known creations were intricate maps illustrating how one entity influenced or interacted with another, which he used to artfully illustrate the shady banking practices of BCCI and its connections with high-profile banks in Texas as well as the Bush family. It’s debatable whether Lombardi truthfully exposed collusion and conspiracies, though Goldstone points out that more than 20,000 of Lombardi’s notes and citations were seized by the FBI, and the revelation of the CIA’s connection to the Whitney Museum and MoMA—two prominent buyers of Lombardi’s work—is certainly enough to give one pause. Unfortunately Goldstone spends far too much time telling the Rashomon-like tale of the artist, particularly in his later years, as she pursues thread after thread with little analysis or conclusion, resulting in a tangled narrative as interlocked as its subject’s art.

            Thanks for this. I posted  a thread on this same subject yesterday that was met with disdain and off topic responses. The problem was that I tied the information to the Madeleine McCann case. There were TWO HUGE RECORD-SETTING ART AUCTIONS by both Sotheby's and Christie's on May 15th and 16th of 2007 that raised over FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS!!! The artwork? Trash and garbage. The question is why did elites throw money away on trash and garbage at that precise time? Seems people only wanted to rehash the case rather than following up on a new lead, but I'm happy that you made headway in advancing the idea that I failed to get across.

            You are so right. I went to Larry's and saw Jean Michel holed up in Larry basement. I knew Larry from being around the scene in Venice Beach and what you are saying is true.Gagosian was upstairs selling small drawings by Jean-Michel Basquiat. Don't know if Jean Michel knew.If it is Jean Michel you are talking about he died in Hawaiii

            2010 Gagosian Gallery Makes Play For $3M Stanford Bullion

            </a>
            With $3 million of gold for an exhibition caught up in Stanford International Bank Ltd.'s alleged Ponzi scheme, the Gagosian Gallery Inc. has gotten permission to pursue its own lawsuit over the bullion, gaining ground against the receiver's claims that the gold belongs to the Stanford estate. 
Judge David C. Godbey cleared the way Friday for the gallery to pursue its lawsuit over 101 gold bars it acquired for exhibition from Stanford Coins &amp; Bullion Inc., days before federal regulators accused infamous financier Robert Allen Stanford of operating a $7 billion fraud scheme and froze his assets.

            In the most recent case, New York’s Helly Nahmad has been indicted for allegedly running illegal gambling dens at the family art gallery and money laundering. Although Nahmad’s lawyers strongly reject the accusations, the affair has led to renewed calls for the art market to be better regulated. In my experience, a former client of mine, David Dwek, Executive Director at Morgan Stanley Investment Banking responsible for Private Sponsor coverage, introduced me to Nahmad and offered to introduce me to Mugrabi to do business with him saying that both of them ‘control the market’. The moment I hesitated not only he poisoned my relationship with friends and clients but pushed me into depression and deciding to stop art dealing

            If you can't see the connection between Pizzagate and the art world, I'm not sure what to tell you. Maybe read the wiki and see how much is archived on this.

            You are absolutely describing the kind of person that would traffick a child and launder the money with a piece of "art". I'd also like to mention that lots of pedos completely despise children.

Unsettling ‘Desire’ showcases sex in the Design District
           </p>

           <p>
            Call me old-fashioned, but sex can still be startling. At least the many iterations of sex showcased in “Desire,” the second Miami Art Week show produced by art-world stars Larry Gagosian and Jeffrey Deitch (last year’s version, also in the Moore Building in the Design District, was “Unreal”), and curated by Diana Widmaier-Picasso. Walking through it is unnerving, titillating, thought-provoking and occasionally gut- and emotion-wrenching (art will do that to you).
           </p>
           <p>
            Why an erotic show? “Because it is the essential subject of the artist,” Deitch said Thursday afternoon at the Moore space. “Go back to the ancient world. Greek sculptures and vases. Baroque paintings. Matisse, Picasso. It’s one of the great subjects of art. I asked Jeff Koons, and he said ‘this is what life’s all about.’”
           </p>
           <p>
            Architect Kulapat Yantrasast, sweeping by on his way out, confirmed that conclusion. “It’s great,” he told Deitch. “It gives you hope for humanity. This is the perfect time for this.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The show is wildly varied: 50 artists, from Picasso and Lichtenstein to R. Crumb and Tom of Finland, Diego Rivera to Richard Prince, Keith Haring and Kenny Scharf to Martin Wong — with painting, photography, sculpture, cartoons, video and, yes, a live nude model. She was lounging on a blue divan on the second floor in Urs Fischer and Georg Herold’s Necrophonia, stifling a yawn and startling a couple of guys who thought she was another sculpture.
           </p>
           <p>
            A giant, shiny, cartoon-realistic Jeff Koons sculpture of a couple coupling dominates the first floor — people walk around it, nervously eying its oversized and anatomically exact details. A “cool” conceptual wall includes Richard Prince’s (in)famous “Spiritual America.” His photograph of another infamous photo, a nude 10-year-old Brooke Shields, her gaze unnerving, still challenges us. In the window is Allen Jones’ “Chair, Hatstand and Table” — three mannequin sculptures dressed in S&amp;M gear in masochistic poses as furniture — a comment, perhaps, on the Design District’s history selling furniture? On the high-fashion mannequins there now?
           </p>
           <p>
            Upstairs, there’s a long R. Crumb strip (the revolutionary underground comic artist, specifically included by Widmaeir-Picasso) illustrating, and using the language of, a bizarre 1906 account of sexual fetishes by a Viennese doctor. (Oh Freud.) Some students from Design and Architecture Senior High (DASH) across the street shrugged at explicit Tom of Finland gay drawings. “It’s art,” shrugged one girl. “At this point I’ve seen it all,” said another. Indeed, another Prince photo of a photo, this one a blow-up of an Instagram post of a couple of teen girls, is the kind of provocative thing teens post all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s a lot of photography, from Man Ray’s mid-20th century women softly touching their throats, to Nobuyoshi Araki’s giant picture of a dreaming (or ecstatic?) Asian woman on the second-floor landing, to Helmut Newton’s “Big Nude,” gazing defiantly out at us. One of the most unsettling works is Noritoshi Hirakawa’s “Dreams of Tokyo,” with 20 portraits of attractive young Japanese women, prettily and demurely dressed in skirts or dresses, squatting. It takes a few seconds before you realize that none of them are wearing underwear. Their direct gaze and solid stance challenges ideas of vulnerability, exposure, strength and control.
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s a Kenny Scharf painting where figures and genitalia cycle in a glittery, slithery tangle. Martin Wong’s enigmatic “Heaven” is a circle showing a brick wall, with a small black hole in the middle, beckoning and enigmatic. Is it an orifice? Escape? Eyehole into darkness? (Wong died of AIDS.) In Eric Fischl’s “First Sex,” a nude woman confronts three boys in a night landscape — which of them is in control?
           </p>
           <p>
            Hard to imagine walking through this show without being unsettled; however sophisticated we may be, this is sex, after all. Yet each piece is also layered with so many other things — ideas, cultural references, our own response, the drama of the action, the intention of the subject (what do those perpetually subjugated mannequins feel?). Essential subject, indeed.

            Hacked campaign documents published by Wikileaks this October appeared to show the extent of that co-ordination, involving senior Clinton aides including John Podesta, the campaign chairman.

            any Ready for Hillary co-chairs hail from outside the world of Clinton
loyalists. They include New York art dealer Larry Gagosian, who gave money
to support Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, and
Northern California philanthropists John and Marcia Goldman, major
Democratic benefactors who have given thousands to the party’s
congressional super PACs.

            My next stop was Vanessa Beecroft’s “South Sudan” show of photographs in which the figures assume classic Christian poses at Galleria Lia Rumma. When I introduced myself, Beecroft immediately took me aside. “My dealer in the US refuses to show this work!” she said stridently. I confirmed that she was referring to Larry Gagosian, then she continued: “Images of black people are too loaded in the US, but this work is based on a true story. I went to the Sudan and nursed three newborn babies in the orphanage. They were malnourished, and I fed them. They thought I was their mother. But my husband said there was no way we could adopt them . . . so I am thinking of leaving him!”

            I am not suggesting he is a pedophile. I am suggesting he is a sicko that peddles sick art as a cover for a very complicated money laundering ring. He also has been indighted in MOscow for buying 'thousands' of sex slaves. I think he trafficks. I think he does anything for money. He is a key to this pedo network because he is an insider tool. I do see from the Abromovich parties he does prefer very young girls. He is the money man, trafficker, deal maker... IMO. Understanding him, helps us understand how this ring operates.

            We Call it ART!
There are so many marvelous exhibits on view at the moment (or about to be unveiled) that I’m devoting a post to art in The Big Red Apple!
           </p>
           <p>
            A startling outdoor exhibit that explores the horrors of sex trafficking is on view in Washington Sq. Park until Sunday. The exhibit, titled Journey, is designed to take “viewers through a range of emotions that sex slaves feel throughout their journey, ranging from hope to desperation.”

            LARRY GARGOSIAN ROASTS A PIG FOR NIGHTLIFE ROYALTY
            <a href="http://brantwatch.com/post/38383777358/this-family-portrait-of-nightlife-royalty-was">

            </a>
            This ‘family portrait’ of nightlife royalty was snapped at the beachside barbeque during Art Basel hosted by Halliburton, in honor of Dick Cheney and the late Serbian arms dealer Sviclo Prvvv. Harry wears a black sweater that no one told him is from the bargain rack at UNIQLO. He’s seated next to Demi Moore, a one-time Brat Pack actress now known as an anti-sex trafficking activist and world-famous “sad cougar.” Peter II poses in a Timo Weiland “Zig-Zag Fantasia” shearling sweater, his arm around Princess Lalaloki, the supreme ruler of Swaziland, who wears a native doilee-dress stained with the pulp of laumai berries. (The individuals seated between Demi and Peter II are 'Sarah’ and 'Eddie,’ two reps from Red Bull, on hand to promote the new and ill-fated 'Red Bull Gives Those Who Already Have Wings Even Better Wings’ campaign. “Sarah and Eddie would not leave us the fuck alone,” Harry reportedly said. “Plus I know they’re hiding calories somewhere in that 'sugar-free’ swill.”) 
Later in the evening the group decamped to the beach where a 322-pound pig was roasted on a spit after being hand-rubbed with Dirty South barbeque sauce by Larry Gagosian. 
Harry ate thirteen breath mints during the course of the evening. Demi Moore was sighted crying, quietly and alone, behind a dune.

            2013 The Trials of Art Superdealer Larry Gagosian

            Gagosian and Mugrabi are among the richest and most powerful figures in the art world, though the two function differently. Working primarily as a gallerist, Gagosian puts on exhibitions for several dozen artists and is responsible for building their careers—or, in the case of the deceased artists he also shows, representing their estates. Mugrabi, along with his father and brother, operates a private art dealership and trades with other collectors behind a cloak of relative obscurity.
            <em>
             When collectors and dealers describe Gagosian as “brash,” “shameless,” and “ruthless”—his own publicist lauds him as “a real killer”

            Why Wouldn't Marc Jacobs Have a Shirtless Wedding Cake?

            </a>
            ?
We're starting to fall in love with Marc Jacobs' unabashed faggotry, including the shirtless wedding cake topper at his marriage ceremony in St. Bart's. That's why he and Lorenzo Martone have been on the beach so long, it's a honeymoon!
Details are sketchy, but it seems the couple, engaged since March, were joined earlier this week, according to Stylexperts (via Guest of a Guest), at a private location and then had a dinner party hosted by art dealer Larry Gagosian. The only detail we really need is that on top of the cake is dashing Lorenzo in a tux and Jacobs shirtless, in all his tattooed glory. This is everything that conservatives fear about gay weddings, and we fucking love it! Congrats to the couple. Now, if only their "marriage" could become a legal marriage State-side.

            It's a part of the art business that remains a point of near-constant speculation, if only because it occurs largely behind the scenes and thus encourages debate as to who is selling what and why. But it's an area in which Gagosian—with his extensive network of contacts, deep well of resources, and uncanny ability to source and deliver hard-to-get pieces—has long been a dominant player, brokering deals that have been reported to reach nine figures for a single work.

            International Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children has a board of directors filled primarily by Pharmaceutical &amp; tech executives. Most of these companies contributed millions to the Clinton Foundation, or paid millions in lobbying fees to the Podestas.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also have at least two former ambassadors appointed by Clinton who served in geographical locations which are critical to trafficiking. Harty was Amb to Romania, Bagley was Ambassador to Portugal. Bagley now works with charity groups in Morocco. She gave between $1,000,000 – $5,000,000 to the Clintons. They have been close for a very long time.

           <p>
            Then we’ve got Jeff Koons. His ties to Qatar are deep, to say the least. He is also an investor in Correct the Record.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among others are several Bilderberg Group members, Goldman Sachs execs, Julius Baer execs, President of the Aspen Institute in Romania. A lot of these people have strange ties to the Clintons.

            The International Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children held its first Board of Directors meeting in May 1998.

            Qatar, a nation known for funneling oil money to ISIS through clandestine banking channels, has taken a keen interest in Jeff Koons, and not just his artwork either. A frequent guest of the Qatari royal family, Jeff Koons has played a major role in the development of their billion dollar Museum of Modern Art.

           <p>
            In January of 2015, Jeff Koons and Marina Abramovic headlined a high profile invitation only event in Doha, Qatar hosted by Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, chairwoman, Qatar Museums, and Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr., chairman and publisher, The New York Times Company.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sotheby’s and QNB are the headline sponsors for the Art for Tomorrow conference.
“The hostess of the evening (Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani) sat laughing with the pony-tailed Japanese artist on her right. On her left was Dakis Joannou, a Greek-Cypriot industrialist and avid collector of the work of Jeff Koons, an American sculptor. Larry Gagosian, whom many regard as the most powerful art dealer in the world, was placed at a table nearby, with the other art dealers”

            ARTnews has learned that on September 12, Larry Gagosian will host “Art for Hillary Auction 2016” at the Gagosian Gallery space on West 21st Street in Chelsea, presiding over a benefit sale that will raise money for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            Artists who have donated works to the show, according to sources, include Jeff Koons, Sarah Sze, Chuck Close, Barbara Kruger, Elisabeth Kley, Joyce Pensato, Deborah Kass, and the identical-twin duo of Ryan and Trevor Oakes.

            The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to an email asking for information regarding ticket pricing and availability. [UPDATE: tickets range from $1,000 to $50,000, the latter of which comes with a print by Jeff Koons, “Gazing Ball (da Vinci Mona Lisa)”, 2016.] There will be a 6 p.m. reception for “host committee, artists &amp; special guests,” followed by the auction from 7 to 9 p.m. (A representative at Gagosian Gallery did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment.)
           </p>
           <p>
            While art galleries occasionally host fundraisers for political candidates at their spaces, this appears to be a first for Larry Gagosian. In 2012, he gave $5,000 to the Mitt Romney campaign, but did not go as far as to throw a fundraiser for the Republican nominee in his gallery. (He also contributed $2,700 to the Chris Christie campaign during the Republican primary.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The Democratic Presidential nominee will not be in attendance during the auction, sources said, though her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, will be there in her place. Clinton will apparently be in Paris.

            To thank the artists for their contributions, and to make up for her inability to attend in person, Clinton made time during a busy fundraising weekend in the Hamptons to host a meet-and-greet Sunday at the home of collectors Lisa and Richard Perry in Sag Harbor. Though this reporter was not in attendance—Clinton has not been allowing the press to attend ticketed campaign events—sources said that each attendee had to be vetted by the Secret Service ahead of time, and arrive during a very specific time window in order to be let in. There was airport-style security at the entrance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Around 3 p.m., the Secret Service surveyed the room, and once it was clear, Clinton came into the garden area, being led through by Lisa Perry. After saying a quick hello to Jeff Koons (she bestowed upon him a U.S. State Department Medal of Arts in 2012, when she was Secretary of State), she spoke to the crowd for about seven minutes, touching upon the importance of the arts and reminding them that her opponent, Donald J. Trump, does not really care for their profession. After that, she spoke with each of the artists in attendance, and managed to take a few selfies with admirers.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, as evidenced by a picture that was shared on one attendee’s Instagram Story feed, Larry Gagosian was standing in the room, watching it all, wearing a canary yellow jacket.

Jeff Koons Correct the Record
According to FEC filings, Jeff Koons donated $50,000 USD to correct the record, a political hit squad founded by David Brock, a close associate of John Podesta and James Alefantis.FEC

           <p>
            Jeff Koons has donated more than $50,000 in cash and through his work to support the US presidential candidate
           </p>
           <p>
            ICMEC held its first Board of Directors meeting in May 1998. It was officially launched in April 1999 at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., by Hillary Clinton, then-First Lady of the United States, and Cherie Blair, wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
           </p>
           <p>
            Koons is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), a global nonprofit organization that combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction. In 2007, Koons, along with his wife Justine, founded the ICMEC Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy. It is the International Centre's research arm. They research child porn.

           <p>
            Qatar, a nation known for funneling oil money to ISIS through clandestine banking channels, has taken a keen interest in Jeff Koons, and not just his artwork either. A frequent guest of the Qatari royal family,Jeff Koons has played a major role in the development of their billion dollar Museum of Modern Art.
           </p>
           <p>
            In January of 2015, Jeff Koons and Marina Abramovic headlined a high profile invitation only event in Doha, Qatar hosted by Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, chairwoman, Qatar Museums, and Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr., chairman and publisher, The New York Times Company. Sotheby’s and QNB are the headline sponsors for the Art for Tomorrow conference.

            “The hostess of the evening (Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani) sat laughing with the pony-tailed Japanese artist on her right. On her left was Dakis Joannou, a Greek-Cypriot industrialist and avid collector of the work of Jeff Koons, an American sculptor.

           <p>
            "I love it here," said Jeff Koons. "This is my sixth time in Doha since 2000." Koons denied that he had a project in Qatar, saying rather that he liked taking his kids for buggy rides in the sand dunes."

            BRINGING BACK SEXY
excerpt:
           </p>
           <p>
            "While going to art school in Berlin, Bieterling formed a band [Soundpool] to help pay for living expenses. He soon discovered that groupies could serve him as excellent models as well as sex slaves. His photographic vision is soft but often brittle in its subject treatment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of the paintings and photographs in the exhibition aren't so much about sex or sex acts as about a display of craft, but of course such display is in itself a sex act. The sex act in which art is grounded to eroticism, and, thereby, cleverly avoids the label of pornography. But pornography it often is, and John Currin and Hans Bieterling are the art world's new sex professionals. There is no lack of champions in this category -- Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Richard Kern, Balthus, Hans Bellmer -- but no other recent attempts in this new millennium have so clearly lionized sexual transgression to such an elegant degree."

            Is Abramovich related to Marina Abramovich. She has ties to Serbian royalty I believe. Odd that this name is brought up regarding Art &amp; politics using occult and Satanic reference.

             Roman Abramovich is 100% jewish, just like 99% of so-called "russian oligarchs". Same with Marina. Just look at her face.

             They HAVE to have some more of a prurient connection to each other, but if they do, it's well hidden on the internet. Those Russians are all very wary of public exposure, I notice this abramovich is not an exception.

             He is referred to as Lithuanian and Armenian in others... he has brought her in for private swanky "shows" along with Koons and all the other names we know making sick art. They go way back. I am still trying to determine relations but they have collaborated many times and run in the same "art" circles.I have so much more on this whole thing but i need to verify some of it. Definately a money laundering aspect here. Also rumors he was caught up in the weapons trade in the 80's and perhaps 90's. Still verifying. He is a high flyer and still active in the art world. And likely child trafficking as well. I think the money aspect is perhaps the key...he has been sued many many times but somehow he keeps rebuilding and growing. His latest was being a big Clinton insider. So much on this network and its ties. Verifying...

            "Anthony Haden-Guest—who, and, really, I'm not going to explain—was roasting artist Damien Hirst (who is an Important Artist right now selling Expensive Art to Fancy People) at The Standard in Miami (where Art Basel is wrapping up) and he did it with this fairly crafty poem, entitled "A Brilliant But Inexplicably Underappreciated Artist Contemplates Some Figures in the Landscape."
           </p>
           <p>
            It went:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Why would I want to see him immersed / In formaldehyde next to his putrid shark / And sold as a set to an oligarch?"
           </p>
           <p>
            " This was in reference to a Hirst piece sold to a billionaire. What I like about thinking about artists who only sell paintings for bazillions of dollars because they all blew Larry Gagosian is that they're a fine lesson in exactly what kind of art sells in this world: theirs, and their poster reprints at the MoMA. And that's really all you need to know! [Page Six]"

             DIRECT LINK TO CLINTON CAMPAIGN (Koons, Clinton, Abromovich...) - Larry Gagosian
             <a href="https://idraintheswamp.com/home/justice-is-coming/">

           <p>
            NEWSPAPER | NOV 3, 2016 “Jeff Koons has donated more than $50,000 in cash and through his work to support the US presidential candidate”
“Jeff Koons’s donation of $50,000 to Correct the Record, a “Super Pac” (Public Action Committee) backing Hillary Clinton, is the biggest cash donation by an artist to this year’s US presidential campaign. According to reports from the Federal Election Committee, Koons made the donation on 17 June this year.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “But the artist has potentially donated significantly more in kind: he created a print in an edition of 40, Gazing Ball (da Vinci Mona Lisa), which was given to those who bought a $50,000 ticket to an auction hosted by Larry Gagosian in September.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “If all 40 of those prints sold, it would raise $2m for the Hillary Victory Fund, however a spokesman for the campaign said it could not release such donor information.”
           </p>

            4: GAGOSIAN TIED TO BANKINIG CRASH
Artists' Dreams Imploded Along With Bankers'

            "The economic meltdown is supposed to "reenergize [the] creative economy" of New York by breaking the city's expensive obsession with finance. Instead, it's wrecking artists' best shot at wealth: Through Larry Gagosian. The top-tier art dealer, who bridges the worlds of art and finance, seems panicked by the recession, turning into even more of a workaholic jerk than he was before the crash. Gagosian won't talk, but the New York Times surmises he's in trouble along with the rest of the art industry:
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone is vulnerable. Especially Larry Gagosian...
           </p>
           <p>
            The prices of work by the young artists he has been luring into his galleries... are falling like bank stocks. Christie's and Sotheby's are in trouble, too, but Gagosian's bread and butter is brokering private deals between rich people. Since the wealthy have lost much of their taste for art acquisition, Gagosian is especially vulnerable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why should anyone care about Gagosian's fortunes? Because this was the guy who, through his access to the filthy rich, could make a young artist. That's why most in his stable were poached from rivals: Gagosian could pluck the best. As the Times put it, "the postwar art world is basically a stock market with a couple of thousand really valuable shares." Gagosian was the gateway to being listed on that market. "His apparent decline indicates that artists have seen their own bubble burst along with Wall Street's other false economies. The vast majority of artists won't have to adjust their lives to that, but they will have to adjust their professional fantasies."
