            With all the Alice in Wonderland references, this explains the Five of Spades from the other screengrab from that Darkweb pedo site posted earlier today. It's definitely a reference to the Playing Card who paints roses red. It's a "deflowering" euphemism.

            Poe was not a pedophile - there is absolutely nothing in any of his copius writings that would indicate anything of the sort.  His young cousin died quite young of tuberculosis.  His mother in law pushed for the marriage thinking it would bring some stability to their little family, knowing her daughter was already ill. There is evidence their marriage was never consumated and the only other objects of Poe's affection, offers of marriage or love poetry were grown women.  Poe was 14 years senior to his young wife, not completely unusual back in the day, it was early 1800's remember.   If the marriage ever was consumated, it was probably after Virginia was of age.

            Can't speak for Carroll - indeed he seems suspect.  Yes I know about Alice Day and MK Ultra uses it for programming, but millions of people manage to read Alice in Wonderland without being pedos.

            They are also infantile and childish names, maybe that are stuck in a sexual time loop. From about when they were about five, arrested development?

             Yes. Such a misappropriation of "phobe." A phobia is an "irrational" fear. It is actually the rational thing to be disgusted by these freaks. Anyone who does not think a pedo should be feared as a monster around children...as someone who makes you sick...must himself be a pedo.
