            There are so many ways he could prove he's still alive. Unfortunately, he's not doing any of them.

            's post is pretty damning, there's been tampering of that video.  Maybe it was CGI or maybe it was a real interview and the MSM just screwed with the video a little in order to screw with everyone.

            All he has to do is come to the balcony.  Or show the PGP.  Or take a picture.  A number of things really.

              I really agree with your other points.  Those all sound plausible.  But Putin isn't the only one who hates Julian.  Clinton also hates him, as we know.  Now with this whole pedophile ring thing coming to light, I assume they have went for the jugular aka controlled opposition.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is purely fantasy on my part and 100% speculation. 0% facts on my part.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just wish they would give something as actual proof he was a live, the video proved to be tampered with.  If Russia altered the video to make people think Wikileaks has been compromised, then good on wikileaks for not playing into anything vile and laying low.

               Well Julian hacked the Pentagon and Department of Defense when he was 16 so I'd say he's more skilled than they are.

            Disappeared a month ago; deadman switch posted before; his lawyer wasn't allowed into the embassy; no proof of life despite people screaming for it; change in tone of the posts on Wikileaks; reneging on promises to post information that would weaken governments.

            The feed was cut during the November FCM conference, so people had to get the audio from Facebook. Facebbok has partnered with Google (Alphabet) over the move to suppress intependent media sources as fake news.

              's post is pretty damning, there's been tampering of that video. Maybe it was CGI or maybe it was a real interview and the MSM just screwed with the video a little in order to screw with everyone.
