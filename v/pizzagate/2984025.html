<p>One of the goals of the German 1968 movement was the sexual liberation of children.  Sexual liberation was at the top of the agenda of the young revolutionaries who, in 1967, began turning society upside down.  Pedophilia was considered progressive and schools throughout Germany took it upon themselves to \'instruct\' the children in their care on sexuality. </p>
<p>For example, at the Rote Freiheit kindergarten children had to take off their clothes, read pornographic magazines together and pantomime intercourse. There were \'sex exercises\' and \'fuck hour\'. The Psychology Institute at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_University_of_Berlin">Free University of Berlin</a>  had established the facility and provided the educators who worked there. Free University of Berlin is considered an elite university and was initially funded by the US government. The basement of Berlin University\'s Psychology Institute was used \'to study sexual behaviour of children\'.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odenwaldschule">Odenwald School</a> in the western state of Hesse was one of the schools at the forefront of this movement. It sought to remove children\'s \'inhibitions\'--that is, violate their natural boundaries.  Odenwald school has a long history of child abuse:</p>
<p>In 1998 reports from former students were made public. Headmaster Gerold Becker had sexually abused multiple students from the 1970s to the 1980s.  
</p>
<p>In 1998 the victims of sexual abuse met with the former headteacher Harder and the former SPD-MP Peter Conradi as the vice-president of the sponsoring organisation and agreed on reviewing the abuse cases, but this did not take place. The \'sponsoring organidation (SPD) is the Social Democratic Party of Germany).</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, and again in 2010, the school became the center of national attention, when an investigation revealed the sexual abuse of more than 130 pupils by at least 8 teachers in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>One year later the case review was dismissed by the prosecution due to statutory limitation.</p>
<p>In 2010 Margarita Kaufmann, who since 2007 was headmistress, called for a new enquiry into the sex abuse cases. Kaufmann spoke of 33 victims that she knew of and eight teachers  guilty of sexual assault between 1966 and 1991. In the meantime it was assumed that more than ten teachers were perpetrators. The music teacher Wolfgang Held, who died in 2006, was the main perpetrator alongside Becker. A newspaper reported that there is between 50 and 100 sex abuse victims.</p>
<p>The prosecution once more dismissed six of the 13 preliminary proceedings until 2 May 2010. At the end of May 2010 the prosecution investigated against six former teachers and one student. There was no court ruling until the end of 2012.   Becker died on 7 July 2010 having escaped any justice.</p>
<p>In 2010 lawyers found that at least 132 students were victims of attack by teachers between 1965 and 1998.  Official school letters show that there claims of child sex abuse had been made against Paul and Edith Geheeb. However no one contacted the police.</p>
<p>Odenwald school was referred to as &quot;reformed education paradise with a torture chamber in the basement&quot; based on the model of a &quot;aristocratic patriarchy&quot;. It was said that paedophiles and &quot;robbers of childhood&quot;, which had systematically taken over the part of the school.</p>
<p>On 9 April 2014 a teacher, who taught and lived there from 2011, had their room searched through by the authorities. The teacher admitted to having downloaded from the internet child pornography before his appointment at the Odenwaldschule. </p>
<p>Victim survivors groups have now formed and the school has now been shut down.</p>

            Berlin is still a degenerate place to this day. We went two years ago, I had been before when I was yiunger. This time I was able to see the degeneracy ie. Gaya, trannies at every corner.

            Thank you for more info on the subject!  I read this:

            which makes one wonder the degree to which pedos ran free pre WWII Germany.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an old boy love related mag there's a 1981 interview with a renowned pedo Hajo Ortil (Hans Joachim Oertel, 1905–1983). This tells a little about him:
            <a href="http://archive.is/93rq1#selection-191.0-191.43">
             http://archive.is/93rq1#selection-191.0-191.43
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It was in Bremen where he founded in 1949 the Hansische Piraten Seefahrende Kanujugend Bemen e.V. (Hanseatic Pirates), a naturist group of boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18.
            </p>
            <p>
             Based on Bremen, Ortil accompanied the group when they put their canoes to sea for long adventurous voyages visiting solitary places from the artic territories of Finland to Greece and shed their clothes whenever possible....
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            In the pedo mag (Pan) he tells the account of going through the German countryside with a group of teens 16 to 20 years old.  After the war he continued to have sex with boys (his adventure clubbing/canoeing), concluding that most all boys want it, because for the 800 he had relations with, there were only about 7 that refused.  Even the PAN interviewer (who I believe may be Francis Sheldon, I'd have to check when he stopped contributing) said 'You must have been psychic'.

             Interesting that the first MtF surgery performed on the young boy was reversed when he fell in love with a woman.  Had it been done today, they would not have been able to reverse it.

             On Orti:

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Based on Bremen, Ortil accompanied the group when they put their canoes to sea for long adventurous voyages visiting solitary places from the artic territories of Finland to Greece and shed their clothes whenever possible. Ortil encouraged both boys and girls to be open with their sexual needs. It was not uncommon for boys to masturbate in groups and play with each other during the group's canoe trips. It was not uncommon for "Big Old Joe" (as the boys called him) to participate in the boy's games either (Ortil never failed to show his special preference for boys)...

             In other words, he invented an excuse to see naked boys for his own sexual pleasure.

             I went to school with a girl who'd recently moved from Germany. She would talk openly how her father left porn all over the house and encouraged the sexuality of his children. This girl, still a child, would masturbate during class and bring herself to orgasm.  She did it ALL the time, in front of everyone, at any time of the day.  I dread to think what went on at home.  I hope she grew up to realise how messed up her dad was.

              I thought it interesting too, the thing about the MtF surgery.  Today, no reversal, and his lifespan would probably be half the normal expectancy due to medical reasons and/or suicide.  How many sex changes are going to be done (shortened life expectancy) and how many of them will change their mind, but no one is allowed to report on it really.  Probably considered a hate crime to report info that even remotely calls into question the sanity of it.

              Regarding your school mate, that's awful, poor girl.  How many kids have been screwed up by these ideological freaks and pedophiles?
