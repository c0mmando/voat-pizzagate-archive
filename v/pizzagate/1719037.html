<p>Minutes from Washington, DC is the well-to-do Virginia city of Falls Church.  In 2011, John Gardner, political activist and his wife Robin, former Falls Church City mayor and then Council Member, held a 10th birthday sleepover for their daughter and her friends, ages 9, 10, and 11.  After the sleep over three of the young guests complained to their parents that John Gardner had molested them.  Each family immediately reported it to the police.  Rape kits and exams were performed.  The &quot;smoking gun&quot; was John Gardner\'s DNA match to the semen on one girl\'s pajama bottoms.<br />

<p>John Gardner claimed he was innocent and so there was a jury trial held at which the children, his accusers, testified.  The jury found him guilty on several counts, yet despite the verdict and the DNA evidence Gardner maintained his innocence.  In May, 2012 Gardner was sentenced to serve 22 years.  He began serving his term.</p>
<h2>Conviction Overturned</h2>
<p>Gardner appealed his conviction to the Virginia State Supreme Court.  On June 5th, 2014, the Supreme Court overturned the conviction on the grounds that the judge had not allowed the introduction of two character references.

<blockquote>
<p>Gardner was released on a $50,000 secure bond until the trial, which will take place in February 2015. The case is in Arlington Circuit Court but being handled by prosecutors from Loudoun, because Arlington’s commonwealth attorney has a personal relationship with the Gardners.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Kill the Witnesses</h2>
<p>But before he was released on bond and with a new trial pending, Gardner tried to arrange for his accusers to be killed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A former Falls Church Democratic Party chairman, charged with molesting two young girls, talked about hiring a hit man to kill them before they could be witnesses at his March 4 trial, according to court documents.
Loudoun County prosecutors said Michael Gardner, who is scheduled to stand trial for allegedly molesting the girls, approached an inmate about finding someone to kill the girls. The inmate reached out to authorities last month.
In a letter, received by authorities last month, the inmate told Gardner that he knew someone who could “help with . . . the ‘3 problems’ you have pre-trial,” according to a motion filed by the prosecution on Thursday, allegedly referring to the two girls and a unspecified third issue. The letter was sent from the inmate in response to “multiple and specific conversations” Gardner allegedly had with the inmate, according to court papers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Another Victim Steps Up</h2>
<p>Gardner\'s now 18 year-old niece accused Gardner of sexually abusing her in 2009 when she was just 12.  Gardner, who was out on bail for the retrial, was arrested again and held without bond.</p>

<h2>Gardner Pleads Guilty to Everything</h2>
<p>On September 24, 2015, the second day of trial in the case of abusing his niece, Gardner entered guilty pleas to everything, including the accusations from the retrial now scheduled for November, 2015. Gardner plead to one count of object sexual penetration and four counts of aggravated sexual battery.  He was sentenced to 20 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gardner was sentenced to 40 years, 20 of those suspended and supervised probation for life. Once released, he will be required to register as a Sex Offender and will not be permitted to unsupervised contact with minors, the victims, or their families.

            Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Everyone can take away one thing from this case - pedos will deny guilt till their dying day, even when the facts are undeniable. They're dangerous as fck!
           </p>
           <p>
            Btw, what about the Pedo judge who overturned the case based on lack of 'character' witnesses?....what's character witnesses got to do with raping minors?....ffs, I HATE these pedo judges even more.
           </p>
           <p>
            We had a massive case here in Australia back in the 2000s around the disappearence of a little boy Daniel Morcombe from a Sunshine Coast bus stop (close to Australia Zoo)....massive public attention and massive police case then went cold case for years.....the parents were incredible in their never dying efforts to find out what happened to their boy....very sad....this case was in the main paper yearly even monthly...biggest story since Lindi Chamberlain in the 1980s...they had a few suspects but no real leads...a decade later they caught the guy - Brett Cowan - via an ingenious undercover sting (followed him halfway around Australia)....only during the court case did we learn he was a known pedophile with multiple henious past crimes (sadistically raped a little 5yr old boy in Darwin and threw him in a bin to die). Blood is boiling just thinking about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess what - he was out after 3 yrs for that!!!!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            We are infested with pedo judges sadly....they are a danger to society themselves.

             That was the State Supreme Court so it would have been a panel of judges, not a single judge.

             It is said that here in the U.S., being a Freemason is a REQUIREMENT to becoming a  judge.  Also, the Federal Society (see Scalia) has been implicated in pedophilia.

            Falls Church is basically Moonies.  Everything is owned by members of the Church and the people all seemed to be affiliated be way or another. People have said everybody acts weird there. Not weird, but brainwashed.

            This is from 2007 After collecting $1.9 million for his two-bedroom, stone-and-stucco Contemporary in Falls Church, lobbyist Tony Podesta spent $3.9 million on an eight-bedroom, seven-bath house in Kalorama. Although the old house has views of Lake Barcroft, his new place has a pool and twelve-zone stereo. *** There is a lot of stuff happening in Church Falls.  There was some really suspicious stuff reported on here about the school being in Church Falls and the taxes being charged to another area.  Really funny stuff about the school too.  Might have been a couple mos. ago.  Bet Tony and Wife had a lot of interesting times there.  But just think about that new pool.

            Look at what it takes to actually put a pedophile in jail.  Unbelievable carnage on so many innocent children.  I so hope Trump can make this quicker and easier for our society, but it may take all of us pushing for better laws.

             This case is of a CONNECTED pedophile.  Gardner is not your average Joe; the Commonwealth Attorney had to recuse himself because of their "friendship."

             I just keep thinking about the three girls having to think about testifying a second time.  And the fact he said he plead guilty not because he is guilty but to spare his wife and children!

             I haven't seen evidence of an organizational tie, yet.  At least the crimes he was accused and convicted of were crimes of opportunity, all in the basement of his own home if I'm not mistaken.
