            MJ was likely abused himself but I don't think he was an abuser.   Ive long looked at his case and watched his court cases.  The man was being taken down by the powers that be in Hollywood.  The green light was given for the media to descend on him starting in the mid eighties. The media aren't allowed to go after just any Hollywood star.  These music stars get too "uppity" and their handlers will try to get them back under control through manipulation coercion or other means.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Michael knew of the massive child abuse problem in Hollywood because he was abused.  I think he made efforts to try to give some safety to kids.  Cory Fieldsman had a sort of close relationship with MJ and he always stood by MJ even while he was at trial.  And Cory didn't accuse Michael in his book.
           </p>
           <p>
            So all evidence I can see shows Michael was being set up by people within Hollywood to ultimately bring him down and take his money.

             There are so many weird and strange things surrounding MJ and the lawsuit and whether he was an abuser, or had been abused, we may never really know.  We can bet that none of the Jacksons would want the real truth to come out.  I can't really blame any of the kids of Joe and Katherine, for their parents were the abusers, imo.  Joe was some sick perverted parent that I believe sold Michael and who knows maybe the other ones as well.  He abused Michael maybe because Michael was gay.  He was more sensitive I believe and Joe did NOT like that, I remember reading that years ago.  As far as Cory goes, I would not blame him to lie about MJ for there are many people that would want his head for coming out with that info.  Cory has been forthcoming enough with others, but I don't think he has really named any really BIG names like MJ. I truthfully believe that he is too scared of someone. As far as Joe is concerned, he has not suffered enough for what he did to Michael and the rest of his children.  Neither has Katherine, their Mother.

              Yeah, I don't believe it either.  They don't want anymore MJ stuff dragged through the Media, no matter what.  Notice the son keeping a very low profile.  If he is smart, he will keep his mouth shut and spend the money wisely.  He would not have to work for the rest of his life if he makes smart investments.  I don't know if he was really abused or not by MJ but his father surely did by  dragging him through that lawsuit and the grueling questions.

            MJ wasn't a pedo. This was extortion.

             I don't think Wade Robson would ruin his life and career and allow himself to be filmed by Matt Lauer by making something up. Wade has plenty of his own money.
