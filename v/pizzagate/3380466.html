<p>Unbelievably, the NYT did a recent pre-death article on the wacky scientific transhumanist world of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>It also covers his Brave New World dream: </p>
<p>&quot;He hoped to seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico (Zoro) ranch.</p>
<p>Mr. Epstein over the years confided to scientists and others about his scheme, according to four people familiar with his thinking, although there is no evidence that it ever came to fruition.</p>
<p>Mr. Epstein’s vision reflected his longstanding fascination with what has become known as transhumanism: the science of improving the human population through technologies like genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern-day version of eugenics, the discredited field of improving the human race through controlled breeding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and wealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it.&quot;</p>

<p>A SHOCKINGLY SIMILAR IDEA WAS PUBLISHED IN THE GUARDIAN, ALSO IN 2000:</p>
<p>Scientist \'killed Amazon indians to test race theory\'</p>
<p>Geneticist accused of letting thousands die in rainforest</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;Thousands of South American indians were infected with measles, killing hundreds, in order to for US scientists to study the effects on primitive societies of natural selection, according to a book out next month.</p>
<p>The astonishing story of genetic research on humans, which took 10 years to uncover, is likely to shake the world of anthropology to its core, according to Professor Terry Turner of Cornell University, who has read the proofs.</p>
<p>&quot;In its scale, ramifications, and sheer criminality and corruption it is unparalleled in the history of anthropology,&quot; Prof Turner says in a warning letter to Louise Lamphere, the president of the American Anthropology Association (AAA).</p>
<p>The book accuses James Neel, the geneticist who headed a long-term project to study the Yanomami people of Venezuela in the mid-60s, of using a virulent measles vaccine to spark off an epidemic which killed hundreds and probably thousands.</p>
<p>Once the epidemic was under way, according to the book, the research team &quot;refused to provide any medical assistance to the sick and dying Yanomami, on explicit order from Neel. He insisted to his colleagues that they were only there to observe and record the epidemic, and that they must stick strictly to their roles as scientists, not provide medical help&quot;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One of the most controversial aspects of the research which allegedly culminated in the epidemic is that it was funded by the US atomic energy commission, which was anxious to discover what might happen to communities when large numbers were wiped out by nuclear war.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prof Turner believes the only explanation is that he was trying to test controversial eugenic theories like the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prof Turner says Neel and his group used a virulent vaccine called Edmonson B on the Yanomani, which was known to produce symptoms virtually indistinguishable from cases of measles.&quot;</p>
<p>KEY:</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;The political implication of this fascistic eugenics is clearly that society should be reorganised into small breeding isolates in which genetically superior males could emerge into dominance, eliminating or subordinating the male losers in the competition for leadership and women, and amassing harems of brood females.&quot; Prof Turner adds.&quot;</p>

<p>So there you have it. A connection with Epstein\'s human breeding ideas, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and eugenics experiments. </p>
<p>EPSTEIN AND FORMER ENERGY SECRETARY UNDER BILL CLINTON:</p>
<p>&quot;Richardson—a former Energy Secretary in the Clinton administration—was in the final months of his second and final term as New Mexico’s governor, but Gary King remained the state attorney general until 2015. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2014 and may have imagined nobody would be any the wiser when he accepted $35,000 donated by five shell companies that Epstein had established. &quot;</p>

<p>“I thought, ‘Oh, these must be his daughters and friends he took along on the trip,’” says a New Mexico real estate agent who worked with Epstein in 1992.&quot;   <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-new-mexicans-saw-young-girls-with-him-as-he-shopped-for-his-baby-ranch">https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-new-mexicans-saw-young-girls-with-him-as-he-shopped-for-his-baby-ranch</a></p>

             "In December 1999, the FBI was investigating how China obtained plans for a specific nuclear device. Wen Ho Lee was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory for the People's Republic of China. Federal officials, including then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, publicly named Lee as a suspect before he was charged with a crime."

              ROBERT MAXWELL AND THE ENHANCED PROMIS SOFTWARE SCANDAL
             </p>
             <p>
              According to this book, Robert Maxwell (Ghislaine's father) sold PROMIS to Los Alamos Laboratories::
             </p>
             <p>
              "According to Thomas's well-placed sources in Israel, Washington, and London, Maxwell first came into Mossad's orbit in the 1970s, when the crack Israeli spy organization stole from the United States its most sophisticated piece of intelligence-gathering software, Enhanced Promis. Of it Mossad made an electronic Trojan horse, secretly amassing strictly classified information from inside the very organizations worldwide to which they were selling it. Mossad's representative for these extremely sensitive transactions costing tens of millions of dollars in China, Russia, India, and twenty other countries was Robert Maxwell."
             </p>

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              "With the help of former Texas Senator John Tower, Maxwell managed to sell the software to the Los Alamos Laboratories, thus making Israel's Mossad privy to the innermost secrets of American atomic energy programs. When Promis was sold to Credit Suisse, Israel was able to follow the money flows from any government or business agency that used the bank."

            Without further ado or any ado at all or even an autopsy report, the assembled Big Organs of Propaganda, left and right, declare that Epstein suicided. Not a chance of an Arkancide or a semi-clever escape or a murder. And all who declare otherwise are loony conspiracy theorists intent on embarrassing the Clintons and Democrats. Would a man so enamored of himself that he wanted his head and geometrically peculiar penis removed after his death and frozen really end himself? He'd already escaped a similar situation before and even if he was imprisoned others point out that the rich, such as the mobster Gottis, live very well in prison.

            To answer the question in your post title: not likely, based on the method and timing of his death. They have to act quickly to preserve the body. In most cases, a medical team with the cryogenics company (such as Alcor) are alerted that a client is near death. The client is either taken to the lab/facility, or a mobile team is sent to the client. As soon as a doctor declares the client dead, they go to work lowering the body temp to freezing and prep for storage.
            <em>
             IF
            </em>
            Epstein is dead, and
            <em>
             IF
            </em>
            his death went unnoticed for hours (as stated in news reports), there’s no way the cryogenics process would have worked. At least not based on the research I’ve done.

            Richardson’s Purge  June 25, 1999
           </p>
           <p>
            "Yesterday, the House Government Reform Committee held a critically
           </p>
           <p>
            important hearing featuring testimony from Energy and Defense Department employees who

           <p>
            Representatives received this evidence of
           </p>
           <p>
            efforts by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and other senior Clinton Administration officials to
           </p>

            punish people for the incompetent or malfeasant behavior they opposed than rumors began
           </p>
           <p>
            circulating in Washington about Mr. Richardson’s next victim: Vic Reis, the

            Assistant Secretary
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            "In fact, for at least

           </p>
           <p>
            the nuclear weapons complex — has actually been vested in somebody else, Rose
           </p>
           <p>
            Gottemoeller. Ms. Gottemoeller is a proponent of radical anti-nuclear proposals who, thanks to Secretary Richardson’s machinations, was stealthily elevated earlier this year to the status of Assistant Secretary of Energy for Nonproliferation and National Security.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been Ms. Gottemoeller, not Vic Reis, who has had responsibility for such

            1.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            the Atomic Energy Act and job action against a senior DoE bureaucrat who had the
           </p>
           <p>
            temerity to alert Congress to this breach of security and the law.
           </p>

            2.
           </p>
           <p>

            Intelligence Office, who was
           </p>

           <p>
            penetration of U.S. nuclear weapons secrets.

             Schmidt is part of a "private humanitarian mission" led by former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, which is ostensibly focused on the case of a detained US citizen awaiting trial for alleged crimes against the state.

            <p>
             But state media have made North Korea's spin on the visit very clear. "Delegation of Google Corp of US Arrives" was the headline used by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in announcing the Americans' arrival on Monday.

             "Weapon plans stolen[edit]
            </p>
            <p>
             Main article: Wen Ho Lee
            </p>
            <p>
             In December 1999, the FBI was investigating how China obtained plans for a specific nuclear device. Wen Ho Lee was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory for the People's Republic of China. Federal officials, including then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, publicly named Lee as a suspect before he was charged with a crime. The U.S. Congress held hearings to investigate the Department of Energy's mishandling of his case. Republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of nuclear weapons and security issues, not the Department of Energy.[15] All but one of the 59 charges against Lee were eventually dropped because the investigation finally proved that the plans the Chinese obtained could not have come from Lee. Lee filed suit and won a $1.6 million settlement against the federal government and news agencies."
