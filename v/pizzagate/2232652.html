            The wording of that sentence doesn't help his case either. Glad these empty husk of humanity are flapping their gums and showing people what creeps they are. But hey, at least it wasn't Rape rape.

            .Most of the Voat users had no clue this post was up due to the quickness that it was taken down.
           </p>
           <p>
            **"A man tried to run over parents and their children at a train museum. Witnesses and victims think this was an intentional act, read the article comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            The museum is across the street from the Rob Reiner Children and Families Center
           </p>
           <p>
            This is related to pizzagate because Rob Reiner is circumstantially tied to sexually assaulting Corey Haim. Reiner follows the Jerry Sandusky / The Second Mile model of interfacing with deprived children.

            VIDEO: Hollywood Blabbermouth Rob Reiner Suspiciously Defensive, Blames Trump for Harvey Weinstein’s Alleged Rapes OCT. 17 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            "Ask Rob Reiner about Harvey Weinstein and suddenly he sounds like a worried man. A very worried man. Perhaps he should be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Smoke. Fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            A seasoned investigator would be lining Reiner up for a polygraph after watching this display of lunacy." "And the morons posing as journalists at MSNBC’s Morning Joe are no better.
           </p>
           <p>
            Listen for yourself. Watch the wheels comes off Reiner’s alibis for Weinstein as he tries to pin Hollywood’s sex abuse troubles on everyone except Hollywood."
           </p>
           <p>
            LOOK TO THE COMMENTS : "Greta G • 22 days ago He is acting suspicious, like a perp returning to the scene of crime talking to police or just protesting too much, unwittingly bringing attention to himself. Reminds me of Raskolnikov gabbing to Petrovitch in Crime and Punishment. Rob Reiner is rumored to be a pedophile. Corey Haim."

            "Morning Joe co-anchor Willie Geist asked Reiner,
           </p>
           <p>
            "There are millions and millions of people who do not watch this show that actually like what they hear from Donald Trump. And they aren't taking messages and orders from us in the media. But they listen to what he says for themselves and vote for him. How do you explain that?"
           </p>
           <p>
            "There are a lot of people who are racist," Reiner quickly replied.
           </p>

            Joe Scarborough was shocked, remarking, "Oh my God, did you just say that?" Enjoy the cringe-worthy moment..."

            Anyway, I'm starting to wonder if Kevin Spacey, guilty as he may well be, is being put forward as the sacrificial lamb, neatly diverting attention away from certain other people
            <em>
             cough

            Weinstein
            <em>
             cough
            </em>
            that got put in the shit a few weeks ago, as he's more well known to the regular Joe's, thus able to take the spotlight.

               Lookin for love in all the wrong places ... now, you got a link like that that explains Bo Derrick and Olivia Newton Johns? I have to see that. I remember when Dolly Parton and two others were against Australians taking on their music, and now they are singing duets. Search engines on that particular topic are not in sync with memory. His book should be Saturday night Fever the Feeling.

            Talese is the guy who famously investigated and withheld from authorities what he knew about a motel owner who for years spied on his guests in their rooms from a specially constructed "viewing platform."  Talese even joined the voyeur one night in watching a couple have sex through a fake ventilation vent.  Also, the voyeur told Talese he'd witnessed a murder and withheld his eyewitness account from police.
           </p>
           <p>
            Talese took heat for his part in all this after he finally wrote about it last year in a New Yorker magazine article called "The Voyeur's Motel."  Here's the article:

           </p>

            He's also been excoriated for his comments about female writers:

            Does Talese mean like the minors in Bangkok, Thailand did? They have no rights, Gay!!!! That's why they're perfect to take advantage of!!!! Rich people pay money, do what they will, and nobody's the wiser!!!! No news stories coming out because fucks like you wouldn't even care!!!! Taking a cue from the great Andrew Breitbart, "What's in your closet, Gay Talese?"

               Approximately 126 people in the world have this last name. We got 7.6 billion people roughly. Maybe they are such a gay family that they cannot reproduce, or is it another fake AKA? I am leaning towards a more common name with a few changes, like what happens when a foreigner moves into a new country. Immigrant Names and Name Changes at Ellis Island - genealogy.com

            I am not going to touch that line with a 10 ft. pole.  Gay Talese thinks nothing of this, probably because he approves of this.  Very telling indeed. He needs to look in the mirror and stop blaming others, Like the Dalai Lama.  So he just tried to take the attention off of Spacey and dump it onto a totally other person.  Shut up Talese.

             You know what I'm most ashamed of? It's either starting smoking or wasting my teenage years skipping school and doing drugs. I don't think either of those compare to what this degenerate has in mind.

             He sounds pretty fucking guilty about something.

            <p>
             I imagine that he, along with the soon to be named and shamed Hollywood rapists, are shitting gargantuan bricks right now. And probably considering leaving the country, or have already left.

              I don't think he will. He will spend some time in 'rehab' for 'sex addiction', then take his money and move to Thailand or Marocco or whereever he can continue his lifestyle going unnoticed.
