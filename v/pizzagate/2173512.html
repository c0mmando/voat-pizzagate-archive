A Dr. Lawrence Dunegan (1933-2004) attended this meeting.  The tapes are his recollections from it.  Dr. Dunegan was a former student of Dr. Day.  
</p>
<p>During this meeting, Dr. Day gave &quot;off the record&quot; remarks.  He talked about the changes the audience would witness in their lifetime as a result of &quot;The Order,&quot; or as we call it now, The NWO.  During his speech, neither recording devices nor note taking were permitted.  
</p>
<p>Dr. Dunegan was known for his photographic memory.  He wrote his notes after the lecture, and they remained in his desk for 20 years until 1989 when he decided to make audiotapes of the information contained in his notes.</p>
<p>Some of the topics that were covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Girls would be discouraged from 
   playing with dolls.</li>
<li>Guns would be eliminated almost 
   entirely.</li>
<li>Cures for cancer were already 
   available at The Rockefeller Institute 
   but would never be released.</li>
<li>Families would diminish in 
   importance.</li>
<li>Euthanasia would be encouraged by 
   the use of a &quot;demise pill.&quot;</li>
<li>Homosexuality would be 
   encouraged.</li>
<li>Births would be strictly controlled.</li>
<li>Private doctors would be eliminated.</li>
<li>Health care will become so 
  expensive that one must have 
  insurance.  Limiting access to 
  medical care would make 
  eliminating the elderly earlier.<br />
  Hospitals would cease giving any 
  charity care.</li>
<li>New difficult to treat diseases would 
  come about as a means of 
  population control.</li>
<li>Travel restrictions would occur.</li>
<li>An under-the-skin implantable device 
  would be developed to identify each 
  individual.</li>
<li>Initiation of puberty would start 
  sooner.</li>
<li>More airplane and auto accidents 
  would occur contributing to feelings 
  of insecurity which would initiate 
  more government regulations.</li>
<li>Manufacturing would be curtailed in 
  order to give other countries, namely 
  Japan, a chance to compete.</li>
<li>Food supplies would be centralized 
  and come under tight control if 
  population growth doesn\'t slow 
  down.</li>
<li>Weather would soon be controlled, 
  and weather would be used as a 
  weapon of war, a weapon of 
  influencing public policy, or perhaps 
  habitation patterns.</li>
<li>Terrorrism would be used by 
  necessity if the US does not move 
  rapidly enough into accepting the 
  new system.</li>
<li>There would be a blending of all 
  religions.</li>
<li>More time would be spent in 
  schools, but nobody would learn 
  anything.</li>
<li>Sex and violence would be 
  inculcated through entertainment.</li>
<li>Scientific research would be 
  falsified.</li>
<li>There would be an arrival of a 
  totalitarian global system.</li>
<li>There would be redirecting the 
  purpose of sex - sex without 
  reproduction and reproduction 
  without sex.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Day predicted these changes would be in place by 2000.</p>
<p>A little bit about Dr. Day - He was the chair of pediatrics at Pittsburgh Medical School from 1960-1965 and was considered as one of the intellectual architects who built the school into the medical research powerhouse it is today.  He left Pittsburgh in 1965 to accept the position of medical director of Planned Parenthood because of his &quot;strong convictions that overpopulation is arguably the most important problem faced by this planet.&quot;  From 1968-1971, Dr. Day taught at Mount Sinai and then retired.</p>

When the whole agenda is lined up here, together with everything we've learned over the past year especially with regards to children, it overwhelms me, and as loathe as I am to say it, it can feel like a battle so huge that without a mass full on red pilling of average armchair, tv worshipping Joe's anyday soon, we are on a hiding to nothing.

            and others here saying the same, are not alone in finding the mass resistance to what we now all now understand to be the factual nefarious agenda and activities of an evil cabal.  Having said that, the Vegas false flag is being revealed to have been a very sloppy operation and a huge step over the mark imo that even has some 'normies' starting to ask questions and  look more closely at the very possibility of this having been not only sanctioned by, but even possibly pre-organised and orchestrated by factions within their own government.  We can only hope eyes are staring to open  It's awful to say it this way, but I do feel we need to exploit such opportunities as best we can to find ways to open the collective consciousness of the capabilities of these bastards to inflict massive hurt on those they're meant to be serving.  Only then we may have a chance.  Otherwise, so far, looking at that list, much is going along according to plan

             Well said. The only thing I know to do is spread what we know. Get the information out there. As for myself, I won’t go to protests. I’m not going to put myself in danger when I know there are people being paid to start violence. I guess everyone can spread the word in whatever way that suits them. Some are in positions where they have access to get to speak to large groups of people.
            </p>
            <p>
             What concerns me is that people are fed lies and getting angrier by the day. This violence that is erupting is going to lead to a civil war. That’s would be the perfect scenario to the Illuminati. They will enforce Martial Law. I think we need to fight back, but not stoop to their level. Keep our cool. Push out the facts. Any kind of violence will be used against us and give them more reason to hate us.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some will disagree with me here.... but we’re going to be attacked no matter what. For any believers, I think we need to be praying. Because it’s literally a fight between good and evil right now. Biblical Prophesy is happening right before our very eyes. We are living in exciting AND scary times. Never before has a generation lived to have the Internet, which gives us access to a vast amount of information at our fingertips. They are trying to take that away. But, we are also seeing Biblical prophesy come to pass like never before. We are living the end times. I think Trump bought us some extra time by screwing up their plans. But in The Bible, it says this is going to happen. It will get worse. Prayers and our fight can earn us time.

            Wow! This was excellent. Thank you for sharing. It’s really scary to even imagine what it will be like 10 years from now. It’s sad that SO many people in the world are actually fooled into believing they are fighting for something good, when in reality, they are playing right into hands of the Illuminati.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can’t imagine being, let’s say 20 years old, and planning my future in this day and age, knowing what I know now. I would be afraid to have children. I wouldn’t send them to public schools. There will probably be a day where public school is the only choice. There’s already forced immunization of children in some states.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing how much society has changed since Obama was elected, and how corrupt the liberal way of thinking is, and how it’s being so accepted to have this blur between genders, the acceptance that the family unit is disappearing. Free speech is being taken away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our entertainment options suck because everything they want is pounded into our heads in practically every show or movie. It’s like being gay is looked up to. Being “different” is applauded. The family shows many of us grew up with didn’t push all this on us. The traditional family is no more.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other day, There was a post on voat about a guy that was on the show Glee. He plead guilty to child porn charges. He had child porn on his computer of children as young as 3 years old. I knew my niece watched it. I told her. I was thinking she would be like “ 😮 What?! Noooo. How could he?!”
           </p>
           <p>
            Well that’s not the reaction I got. The reaction was more like this... “😏 really? That sucks.”
           </p>
           <p>
            I said “Aren’t you shocked?!” This is so sad. She said “Not really. I hear this kind of stuff all the time. It’s kind of normal for celebrities.”
           </p>
           <p>
            What the hell is wrong with people? How can someone be so blind that they see kids growing up thinking all of this is the norm and they just go with the flow. It’s only going to get worse. These kids are going to have kids and go on to raise their kids without morals and values. It’s all because of this New World Order. The Illuminati is leading everyone like little sheep to the slaughter, and most of them are all for it. People are losing their minds.

             , every word, and my sentiments exactly.  It is so very difficult for me to talk to anybody about what is occurring.  I find that most do not even want to hear because they focus only on themselves and do not want to hear or they do not believe a word you are saying.

             As much as I become frustrated with this sub because of 1 mod in particular, on the other hand, I am grateful I found it a year ago.

            <p>
             We are all in this together and are different individuals than we once were because of it.  We will certainly be heard everywhere, however, if a major SHTF epic occurs, and I do believe it will.  Our knowledge will then be put to use in helping others deal with the truth.

              Well thank you. I don’t have anyone in real life that listens either. It’s frustrating. If I try to explain then I just get frustrated because they act like it’s some conspiracy. If you are familiar with me here, you will know that it’s hard for me to hold back and keep my mouth shut about something I believe in. LOL. That’s why one of my other commenters here is always running his mouth with me.

              My way of thinking has changed SO much. I can’t even watch what I used to watch anymore. I see the Illuminati symbolism everywhere.

             BOTH PARTIES have been involved in getting us where we are today.  This is a 2,000+-year-old plan so has been in the U.S. since its founding.

              Thanks for your input you wannabe expert on every topic. I do not refuse to see Jews as perps. I’ve stated time and time again that they are not the ONLY ones. I’m not narrow minded and focusing on one group. I did not even mention democraps. I said liberals.

             Her response (“Not really. I hear this kind of stuff all the time. It’s kind of normal for celebrities.”) shows that their plan is in full effect and quite rapid. Overall it's all a plan to win souls for the devil and people are lining up like it's"Black Friday"... smh.

              No. She’s not evil and doesn’t have some evil plan. She didn’t agree with it. She’s a normal teenager with a good heart.
             </p>
             <p>
              It just shows that our entertainment industry and celebrities normalize everything. When teenagers see all of this happening around them, news like that doesn’t phase them like it would someone 10 or 20 years ago.

            I remember reading this a few months ago.  Their plans are certainly on track.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are just some of my questions:
           </p>
           <p>
            what's the friggin purpose of it all?
            <br/>
            Who are 'they' anyway?
            <br/>
            What purpose is served by having the majority of people without access to life-saving healthcare?
            <br/>
            What purpose is served by having a degenerate generation who've been groomed into violence and debauchery? 
What's the purpose of dumbing down a whole generation of students?   A well-educated populace enrichens everybody's life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Feel free to give me your opinion, because if all the above is happening simply because a few moronic power-hungry twats want total control and think 'satan' is going to come down from Orion's belt to rule over us, they're more imbecilic than I thought.

             THEY are Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
             The purpose of it all is to control the world, a JEWISH agenda that has been well documented for over 2,000 years.

             THEY want to eliminate the white race.  Jews are NOT whites.

             GLOBAL DEPOPULATION (down to 500 million, consisting of technicians to serve them) is their route to achieving that.

             Check this out. Learn about Agenda 21. It’s now updated to Agenda 30. This will show you what their future plans are. How they explain things vaguely make it sound like they are doing things to help us. You need to see the reality of it though...

             It’s the Illuminati. They want to get rid of 90% of the population. They want to live amd have control of everything...their future generations. The New World Order.
            </p>
            <p>
             By the media, schools and entertainment industry pushing gay marriage, abortion, transgenders, etc... that’s population control. Getting rid of traditional families means less people for them to deal with later.
            </p>
            <p>
             By dumbing down the newer generations makes these people easier to control, less likely to fight them, and make them dependent on the government for everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pushing Black Lives Matter (Soros funded), and now people crying white priveledge, feminism, the fight for free speech, hating the cops, disrespecting our veterans, etc...All that is causing people to turn against each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Riots, tearing down monuments, and things like that is because if they have everyone fighting, groups turning on each other, causing people to hate each other, pushing this radical violent way of thinking (antifa), it will cause more violence and then it gives the government power to control us more. Like more gun laws.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it was bad enough, they could declare marshal law. The more divided the people are, the easier it will be for them to use that to enforce whatever they want to force. Like, free speech or alternative news...they say it’s fake news. Why? Because then they can censor it and say that it’s causing violence. By making people think that, it makes people go along with them taking away free speech.
            </p>
            <p>
             That’s how they also push war. They pound stuff in our heads and make us so emotional, so that we will go along with them going to war. Like 9/11. They used that to go to war and make so many new laws.
            </p>
            <p>
             Blending religions...the Illuminati hates Christianity. They don’t want us believing in a good higher power, a creator. No healthcare means people don’t live as long. Hormones in our food is causing kids to hit puberty sooner. The foods we eat and the air we breathe, ALL IS CONTROLLED BY THEM.
            </p>
            <p>
             I need to try to find it. But, you need to read about agenda 21 or agenda 30. I’ll try to find this one that I read that breaks it all down for you. It’s just shocking. I’m glad you seem curious and are questioning this. So many just disregard it if it doesn’t make sense. I hope I didn’t confuse you.

             From what I've learned, they are the wealthiest people in the world... I'm not talking about Bill Gates, Oprah etc. These are people whose wealth is essentially limitless because they own the banks. The descend from bloodlines that go back ages.The Rothschilds are a part of them. The House of Windsor (Queen Elizabeth) is a part of them. So are the Rockefellers. Your conclusion is spot on, even though it doesn't seem to be satisfying for you... People mock the Bible but the predictions are basically laid out in there; it's just hard to understand because of the parables and visions (The prophets wrote it in the best way they could describe). They want to turn everything that is "GOOD" to "BAD" and vice versa and the Bible literally states this. They believe that Lucifer is our 'redeemer" (tree of knowledge) plus he feeds their greed by enriching them however there is a price to pay: their souls (which they sold eras ago), participating in vile things such as human sacrifice, cannibalism, sex with children and infants etc. I could go on and on... Their main goal right now is to have humanity in their palms; they tell us what's right and wrong, they teach us what they want to know (even the mandela effect shows this. When people are confused about their memories with this phenomenon, how do they verify it; the internet, which they control). They are stripping us down to defenseless sheeple. Please make sure you don't get that implantable chip (RFID); that's the key to your soul.

               You are being very condescending and obnoxious in your comments. I am not an angel by any means and I like to troll also; however if you wish to convince people of something, coming off as a pompous know it all will certainly deter people from listening or taking to heart what you say. Just food for thought dude, as a lot of people agree with things you wrote just not the manner of your delivery. Sincerely, take care and be easy.

            That is an impressive prediction.  Dr Day was the medical director of planned parenthood and believed overpopulation was the biggest threat, so he might have been revealing the method and not just predicting.
