             I see that and for me it’s also a Broken Heart. Yes and I agree it may connect to organ trafficking. Florida is a cesspool for Children. Dade  and Broward complicit. Read something last year about Pam Bondi and Pence being involved in trafficking. We can also know that DWS also is or covering for others. Oprah had a House in Fisher Island. Don’t know if still does.

            They were found embracing in the back seat, yet the investigators think she hit the accelerator instead of the brake when rolling off the ferry deck? How did they get in the back seat?

             Car went nose in and they climbed up to follow the air bubble?  It's a 113' ferry.  Not big.  How high would they have been off the water, maybe 6-8'?  Considering they were going to Fisher Island, I'd bet $ it was a very new Mercedes S550 or similar.  They are pretty much airtight.  I would think it would have floated, almost.  No way they could break the windows without a breaker.  Which is stupid for anyone riding a ferry not to have.  Pretty sure if they can hijack a Porsche (Walker), they can do the same with the Benz.  Including locking the doors, etc.

              I would think the ferry operators would have been on them within minutes -- long enough for them not to suffocate. I know they would be in the Puget Sound. Plus they chock the wheels of the front and back cars, and there is a chain the vehicle would have to go through. Larger ferries, but still. I would imagine Coat Guard regulations apply to ferries to prevent cars from randomly rolling into the drink.

               Looks like we have some marine digging to do:

              <p>
               Here's the ferry.  It belongs to a private club$ (this is the richest place in the US).  This is the old Eagle:

               As there are no bridges or causeways connecting Fisher Island Club to the mainland, our island oasis is only accessible by yacht or private 24-hour passenger vehicle ferry service, which conveniently departs from Terminal Island Road just off Miami Beach’s MacArthur Causeway. To board the ferry, hotel guests require pre-arranged
               <strong>
                security clearance
               </strong>
               (I know this isn't what it means...just funny), guaranteeing security and exclusivity. From the moment you board the ferry, a wave of calm overtakes you, as you know the luxury, beauty and ultimate lifestyle that await you.

               It's pretty deep there.  12-15' on avg.  Water probably isn't too clear either.  If there was a window partially open and it flooded fast, they'd be unconscious in 2 min and dead in 4.

                Those barriers should keep a rolling car from going over, unless the water was exceedingly rough or someone tromped on the gas and the car was running. Typically cars aren't running on ferries, due to flammability and exhaust fume issues. Also, I am pretty sure wheels have to be chocked by Coast Guard regulation, because if the cars roll into each other suddenly, the whole boat could capsize. They have to be loaded carefully in a particular way for the same reason. Especially a ferry that small.
