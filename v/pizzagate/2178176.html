            Especially interesting considering the Obama kids aren't genetically theirs (Michelle is trans, born a man). The more those two grow up, the less they look alike and the less they look anything like their parents. Good luck finding any pics of them as babies, Michelle pregnant (not even once), and family tree lineage on public sites. None of it exists

             I thought Sascha looked a bit like Michelle when younger, but she no longer looks like either of them. Ditto Malia. But they ARE tall like both parents, which makes me believe they must be theirs?

            If Weinstein made a pass at Malia he really is dumber than I thought, unless that was the payoff for a well heeled job for Malia.  But really,  evidently she could have just been really shook up because, Gee, a girl that young and pretty imagine her having to do THAT with HIM.  Yuck.  Possibly that is what shook her up.  Possibly somehow Obama found out about it and BOOM.

              What's really curious is that you can't find anywhere a verifiable source that Larry Sinclair is dead, but considering his allegations you can't think anything else. If Joan Rivers didn't survive telling the truth, why would Larry?

            Just chiming in here.  I work at a high end restaurant in Manhattan.  Lots of celebs.  Have met Paul McCartney, Clive Davis, James Murdoch, Megan Fox and others.  I also met Malia Obama in December 2016.  She sat at the bar and got a glass of water.  Security outside.  She couldn't make eye contact and seemed VERY shaken up.  Just odd.  Everyone made the same observation.

            I recall Obama's farewell speech and how UPSET she appeared and how she notably stood a distance behind her dad. My gut was something other than her father leaving office was making her cry, I wondered if it may be upcoming internship.

            I don't believe "they" are throwing Harvey Weinstein under the bus. The sexual harassments claims are to cover up the real crimes, and that's pedophilia. They are taking control of the narrative.
The Luciferian pedophile cabal offer their own children to each other, I would not be surprised if Malia is part of some deal.

                  Well I know some do. But I thought you knew a lot about this topic. I was wondering if that was the norm or what. I’m just curios about how these people think. I don’t know how all that works. I’ve been reading about it. But there are many different groups.

                   There is no "norm", jsut like there is no "norm" among, well, "normies".  My gut tells me that the highest level Satanists, or whatever the f*** they are, don't practice on their own children, but rather, indoctrinate them, versus abusing them.  If that makes any sense.
