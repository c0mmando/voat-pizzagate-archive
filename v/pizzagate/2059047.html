            I would think they would have had him killed too. But, maybe since he's so well known, it would look suspicious. I think his wife was Jewish. His ex.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the same thing about George Webb. He's uncovering so much corruption that is actually showing to be true. I don't know who he's working for. But, he's working for someone because he should have been dead already too.

            That's interesting. You seem to be knowledgeable about this sort of thing. But, when it comes to Infowars, this theory doesn't apply. I've listened and watched him for over 10 years or more. He's not perfect or anything. But, he's definitely not into evil. He's a good person and a Christian. I know people will talk crap, but oh well. That is what my gut tells me. I feel that he's genuine.
           </p>
           <p>
            He may back track because maybe he's threatened with a lawsuit or something, but he doesn't intentionally mislead. People take clips out of context and make him look worse. I've listened to him enough to know that he's a good person. He brags too much and loves to scream and take his shirt off lol. He's an entertainer. But, he's woke a lot of people up.

            This is a piece of information that may help solve the mystery of Seth Rich. It may be true, it may be false. Where does it come from? One of the members of a team doing sterling work investigating his murder. Can they be trusted? I think so. I've been following them for a while and they're very cautious and conservative as well as treating their sources carefully. Does it fit with what they've claimed recently? Yes it does: the other day they made the startling claim that Seth Rich was at a party with his team where he was betrayed, fled and called his gf while running. It also fits with some other information that I've seen about the night he was killed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Verdict: I'm going to take it at face value.

           <p>
            Perhaps some "insider" is trying to take him down a notch with false info as he has seemed to be one of the top people on the Seth Rich investigative case. Or it's real. We'll see.

              That email was in FEBRUARY 2016.  If Seth Rich was leaking and they knew it in February, why'd they let him breathe -- and presumably continue to leak - for an additional FIVE MONTHS?!

               So it applies even less to Seth Rich putting aside the absolutely massive leap that folks have no problem making that John Podesta was going to have campaign workers killed

                But it shows that they are psychopaths and will do things like that which happened to Seth. Not proof of a crime, but showing availability of intent.

             <p>
              Yes. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden are both CIA limited hang-outs. Edward Snowden from the beginning and I'm almost positive Julian Assange was as well from the beginning.

              You think these people are beyond faking someone's murder? Wake up. Then killed 3500 people on 9/11 in cold blood. Faking someone's death is NOTHING to these people.

               Have you considered the possibility of a kind of war going on behind the scenes within the intelligence community? Both Snowden and Assange were probably working from within, but that doesn't make them bad guys.

                Yes totally. There is a civil war within the IC and Military. I suspect a lot of the generals who Obama forced out are just biding their time. There is no United States anymore. It's shocking when you find out what really is going on in DC.

               They literally tried to frame Assange for rape. Hilary even wanted to drone Assange. If it wasn't for WikiLeaks, we wouldn't even know about a ton of stuff like vault 7. You have no proof WikiLeaks is compromised.

                The only explanation that explains the CIA running Wikileaks as a limited hangout is if the Deep State decided to shit can Her Thighness and go with Trump sometime early last Summer after Trump locked up the Republican Primary.

               <p>
                Hillary is toxic as shit and out of her gourd. She's got Parkinson's disease and one of the most common side effects is psychosis.

                 This is ridiculous. Not a chance she would fight back if she was "shit canned" by the elite. She would have been sent to prison already if this was the case. Or 6 feet under.

                  I do and I still consider it fact. Remember the Awan brothers? My opinion of George Webb changed only in regards to who he represents: the faction within the Deep State that deep sixed Hillary Clinton.

                  George Webb is a limited hangout. A limited hangout dishes out real information it's just not the real damaging shit. A limited hangout is a way to protect information that can't ever see the light of day. Care to guess what I'm thinking of?

                So you believe Roger Stone created pizzagate along with WikiLeaks and, at the same, the conspiracy is real? That doesn't make sense.

                 Roger Stone is heavily involved with "Info Wars".
                </p>

                 Stone is very pally with Jones and Trump.

                 Alex Jones InfoWars is pretty popular. Plenty of folks are skeptical, seeing what he does as "limited hangout." What's going on over there? As usual, we have no insider information to offer, but we can decode the symbolism of the logo.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This speaks volumes.

                 The word WARS is stylized, with a slanting of letters that gives special emphasis to the W. Let that keep rotating around, pulling the ARS it's leaning on away, and it falls into place, resembling the letter E. Send it to the rear and you've got ARSE. There's more funky letter action going on with, INFO.

                 The letter F is extending a member to the O. It's an ideogram, a picture of a "F"allic member, touching the "O"rifice. If you rearrange this branding, a caption appears for sodomy FO. IN ARSE.

                </p>
                <p>
                 Makes sense. Also, FO is shorthand for F* off. Bugger off.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When the graphically connected FO is given special consideration, it adds layers of Occult symbolism that enhance the effect. F is the 6th letter and O is the 15th. This resolves to 6 and 6 or 66 because 15 is 1+5 = 6, so FO is a signal of the Abyss. In an alternate gematria, when Z is 1, F and O are the 21st and 12th letters. These reduce to 2+1=3 and 1+2=3, so 3 and 3 or Code 33. Do Code 33 and Code 66 have anything to do with sodomy? Yes. Plenty.

                <p>
                 “INFO ARSE” speaks to us as a reference to the gnosis kind of info that comes with the enlightenment acquired via ritual sodomy. The simple black and white of the graphic supports this with the knowledge of good and evil being signaled by the white and black, respectively.

                 Alex Jones ~ Alex joNES ~ A-NES ~ phonetic : anus. It's subliminal. Jones, is not who he says he is. He's using an alias, but I'll let you figure that one out.

                 INFOWARS "Because there is a war on for your mind." Yes there is. Sodomy mind control. Making mind control slaves. This kind of thing you see with this branding constitutes a cover spell.

                 What cannibalism and sodomy do for the practitioners of the left hand path relates to worship. This is how their gods are worshiped. It brings them near to their (demon angel) gods and makes them like the gods they worship, bringing to themselves power, illumination and gnosis. When the serpent told Eve "ye shall be as gods" it was not entirely a lie, despite what you may have been taught. What was promised was not, however, a thing to be desired by anyone who knows the love of the Lord God who created us. It may be said that sodomy is a back door to knowledge to the gnosis forbidden for our own good.

                  One thing I must tell you is that I do not listen nor follow any of the YT Idols.  I have no time for them.  I would much rather spend my time on here talking and learning from those that are in lockstep with me, for we are the ones that are the truth tellers, not they.  We are the ones that we can always depend on, to spread the word of pizzagate to our fellow Americans.  I think we do a much better job than they do, really.
