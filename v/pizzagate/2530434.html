<p>Vice President Mike Pence’s physician, Army Dr. Jennifer Pena, resigned from the White House Wednesday according to several senior Administration officials. Pena’s resignation comes just as the allegations she brought against President Trump’s physician Adm. Ronny Jackson were proven to be unsubstantiated. The onslaught of unfounded allegations – also propagated by Montana Sen. Jon Tester – led to Jackson’s decision to withdraw his name from consideration after being nominated by Trump to lead the Veteran’s Affairs Administration.</p>
<p>Pena briefed Democratic members of the Veteran’s Affairs Committee last month on the allegations. She accused Jackson of over prescribing medication to White House staff, claimed he wrecked a government vehicle after leaving a Secret Service party under the influence and that he was disruptive at work and on trips. None of those allegations were found to be accurate. Pena, was assigned to Pence by the White House Medical Unit and White House Military office. Tester contends that the allegations against Jackson were supported by 23 people but did not release the names of those making the charges.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Pena told colleagues in the White House Medical Unit that she was resigning and moving on, according to sources with knowledge. She officially left the White House on Friday, they added.</p>
<p>Trump has called out Tester and said he should resign for spreading false allegations against Jackson.</p>

            Although the origins of the name are in Galacia, the family is in USA view, Spanish and European, with many political figures in South and Central America, and especially Mexico. Went to high school with some. To cut it short, they are Spanish nobility. Fairly pasty skinned folks too for being down there that long.

              I have been watching this story too. I think it’s a dang shame the way they treated this guy. This is about elites, on the surface, and you know the opponent’s are likely cabal servants, but there is no mention of satanism or child-trafficking yet. So, interesting as it is, this has not yet developed into a pizzagate situation. Maybe we all agree that it’s worth talking about, idunno.

              By the way: by posting this and clicking “discuss”, you literally asked what I think. You’ll probably notice that I’m not arguing with you, eventually.

                So I’m going to ignore your poor attitude. I looked closer at what you wrote in your recent posts, and I get it
               </p>
               <p>
                To summarize:
               </p>
               <p>
                Peña is jealous of Jackson. She manufactures the rumors to smear him so he withdraws from the nomination. This part COULD be construed a normal vindictiveness, but you went a step beyond and found the skull and bones connect... The rest I know, up to the resignation, However, as far as I can tell, Peña is almost nobody. Now, the politician that admitted all of the smear was ‘rumor’.. thats a fish worthy of PG. If there are consequences for the cabal, or Tester, that’s pizzagate worthy news.
               </p>
               <p>
                Well, I appreciated that you dug up a little more that was available from the news. That is why I upvoated, initially, before I made my first comment. While appreciating your effort, I had (and still have) doubts that I thought were worth discussing. I have not, and do not suggest that your post should be deleted, rather that you should defend it with your insights (rather than your childish ad hominem attacks). I, for one, would benefit from understanding your insight into the situation. You may (or may not) benefit from admitting that the relevance to pizzagate is tenuous and thus direct the rest of us in assisting with our insights. I didn’t realize that you had such huge problems with criticism. The choice is yours, to collaborate as a team or not. I will take that into consideration in the future. I did not expect your flippant responses to my comment. I was honestly just trying to be helpful and motivate you to elucidate your point more clearly.
               </p>
               <p>
                You almost hurt my feelings, but seeing as how we are on the same side, and that we all get quite burned out by fighting monstrous evil, I can tough it out. Jus notice that I am not a shill, and I’m not interested in an argument. I’m just tryin to help. I don’t always get it right... just another imperfect human. Check my profile, you’ll see.
               </p>
               <p>
                I speculate, as you do, that the cabal is just opposing Trump on issues like this. Frankly, it’s obvious to the public that they are just trying to slow him down. That fact in itself is part of pizzagate. Most of us are aiming for more than some unknown doctor’s resignation, that’s all I’m tryna say.

            A few months will go by and then one of her friends in the cabal will give her another cushy job where she'll sleep around and be paid for ruining lives.

            Just going to throw on my tin foil hat. Jackson worked for Obama. I'm sure he saw and heard a few things while there. Once officially in the Trump administration {and protected} he would be spending more time with Trump himself, those stories would eventually come to light in small talk.
           </p>
           <p>
            This just smells of a degenerate ex-lover (Obama) attempting to keep their ex isolated (Jackson) from the tribe and keep their secrets secret.

             The only reason The Cannibal Queen's minions try to destroy someone is because they're not a part of the cabal. Cabal members they handle differently.

              I agree whole heartedly you with on that one! I think GMV has a point though. Imagine yourself believing that being in the progressive party will change the world, promises are made to you personally, and then you meet that beast.

               Are you talking about that whore Pena? She's been over the mask dropping. She wholeheartedly is in it to win it now. That includes screwing anyone the cabal tells her to and lying like the bitch she is. She went with the side she thought was powerful and going to win. Like you see two people playing chess and go all in on the one you believe has an advantage. That's what she did a long time ago by joining Skull &amp; Bones. They just point to who they want her to destroy and she does the rest. And the ties to the NXIVM are troubling. Nope, no masks dropping here. It's her pants dropping that we should be worried about.

                No, I was talking about meeting Hillary. Female BEAST. Is that better understood? I did read what you said, and again, I agree. I have to educate on your Penya's though. Pirro, Perro, and multiple examples I can serve. That is what they do! They change there last names, but that is not all.

                  The reason you can not keep up, is the name changing. It get's ever so tiresome for them though. I would also suspect Pinya, Pina, Pena, and Perrone in the Romantic language speaking countries. From personal experiences.

                    What, you have not been alive for hundreds of years? That is what I was referring to before. It is a huge inconvenience to change an entire families last name. Easier to do when you enter a new country though. Assuming that you are currently a legal citizen of the USA, you can march down to the SS office and change your name. It takes a couple of weeks or more depending on where you file. Other countries are different though, and can fast track that process with very little USD.

             Oh, Tester's a dirty boy ... no doubt.

             I hope our POTUS unloads what he knows. He said it would make him unelectable. Probably would make him unable to walk down the street without people throwing food at him also.
