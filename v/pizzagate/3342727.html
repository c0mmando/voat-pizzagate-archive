            Podesta and Epstein are linked to Clinton Global Initiative. Most of evidence has been long scrubbed from obvious digital sources. But not all. Court houses and bank records from BCCI on forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein and the Podesta Brothers should also be connected to BCCI, since that was the Spook bank of choice back then.

            Not at all damning, but they both like Pan. Alefantis used to have a image of Pan for his instagram account. Epstein has pan statutes on the island.

            I saw a comment in an old submission a while ago that had a link for a pic that was Epstein at Comet Ping Pong, but it was a sl.img link that had been scrubbed, so I couldn't verify. I'll bet you could find it again on archive.is if it ever appeared on 4chan and 8chan, though.

            Well some of Epstein's victims are being represented by Boies Schiller Flexner. What's odd about this is BSF are more likely to attack anyone that threatens an important/powerful Democrat.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Boies, co-founding partner in the high-powered law firm Boies Schiller and Flexner, has deep ties to powerful Democrats.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Also a frightening quote from the BSF website. They sound like the mafia:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             known for our creative, aggressive, and efficient pursuit of success for our clients.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They were involved in representing Harvey Weinstein, Aaron Rich(Seth Rich's brother) and James Alefantis. For all these baseless, crazy conspiracy theories, why do these people hire one of the world's leading law firms?

            Back to BSF and their involvement with Weinstein:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Boies Schiller and Flexner, has deep ties to powerful Democrats. Boies also represented Harvey Weinstein, and he hired Black Cube, an organization run largely by ex-Mossad agents, to tail, find dirt on and intimidate women who were accusing Weinstein of sexual assault.

           <p>
            From that same article we can find more links:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Another attorney with ties to both the Weinstein and Epstein cases is New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance. A prosecutor from Vance's office argued in favor of Epstein's petition to have his sex offender status reduced in New York.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vance's office also declined to prosecute Harvey Weinstein when Italian model and actress Ambra Battilana Gutierrez filed a complaint of sexual assault against Weinstein in New York in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
             Boies (there's that name again) was revealed to made tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to Vance's political campaigns over the years.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So are BSF cutting out the middleman(Black Cube) and simply working for Epstein's victims in order to catch them out or sabotage their case?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another connection to BSF is NXIVM linked Kirsten Gillibrand was a partner at the firm:

             What a ridiculous comment.  Um, because baseless, crazy conspiracy theories inflict real damage on real people.

             Example A being the Rich family.  They lost their son and brother and the real person has person has been lost to frauds like Kim dot Com and the people who have been fooled by the nonsense of him and others like him.  And the folks who were fooled by this now use Seth Rich as a totem and pretend to care about his death, while lying about his life.

            <p>
             Yeah, Vance has got to go.  Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr committed fraud on the Trump Soho project and Vance had them dead to rights.  All of a sudden a Trump lawyer shows up uninvited (and in my opinion blackmails Vance) and the case is dropped.
            </p>
            <p>
             The New Yorker wrote
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The evidence included e-mails from the Trumps making clear that they were aware they were using inflated figures about how well the condos were selling to lure buyers.
In one e-mail, according to four people who have seen it, the Trumps discussed how to coördinate false information they had given to prospective buyers. In another, according to a person who read the e-mails, they worried that a reporter might be on to them. In yet another, Donald, Jr., spoke reassuringly to a broker who was concerned about the false statements, saying that nobody would ever find out, because only people on the e-mail chain or in the Trump Organization knew about the deception, according to a person who saw the e-mail. There was “no doubt” that the Trump children “approved, knew of, agreed to, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,” one person who saw the e-mails told us. “They knew it was wrong.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Bascially the Trumps were claiming many more of the units in building were sold than they were.  They said 60% of the units were sold when in fact it was 15%.  This weakened the financial status of project and lowered the value of every unit already sold. It also up the risk to the buyers.  Years later when the project failed and creditors took it over, only 33% of the units had sold.

               I also don't spend too much noting the sky is blue.  Because, it's you know, obvious.  (I also personally know many real people who have been damaged.)  I came close myself when I was about 5 years old.

               I have spent some time saying that folks on this board could be using all this energy to build some positive, something that actually does something against real cases of abuse or trafficking, but that is not what this board is about.

               They are far too invested in the idea of cabal ruling the world for centuries.  That's what truly excites them.  That the world is not random.  That somebody must be behind all this, and if find those few people, we will have paradise.  It's a longing that has animated centuries of conspiracy theorists.

               Folks on this board don't wish to give up their illusions about a cabal.  In fact, they seem to bitch and moan every time real traffickers or abusers are arrested.
               <em>
                They are the wrong people, when do the real arrests start, etc.
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               They complain it's not the real elites.
              </p>
              <p>
               They are too invested in their fake stories, that folks who are working against exploitation like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children are accused.
              </p>
              <p>
               Folks here are far too invested in the fake pizzagate bullshit that has zero basis in fact to actually attempt something constructive.  They would rather make up shit about modern art.
              </p>
              <p>
               Paranoia is dangerous for your health and becoming increasingly radicalizing your paranoia can damage people, in fact, in can be irreversible.  Look at the folks here and QRV/Great Awakening who have complained they are now cutoff from their families.  Look at the folks who are so far gone, they have convinced themselves Ruth Bader Ginsberg is dead and the whole Supreme Court is covering it up.  That's no healthy.
              </p>
              <p>
               Folks on here bitch and moan about the Mainstream Media being part of the cabal, when the truth is both the NXIVM case and the new Epstein case were BECAUSE of main stream reporting, but the New York Times and Miami Herald respectively....and the prosecutors mentioned this when the indictments came down.

              <p>
               I actually never claimed this.  I claimed the code words were fake and they were.  The symbols seem to come from a genuine FBI document and were traced back to certain website.
              </p>
              <p>
               What I have argued is that it's completely irrational to believe everyone who uses that spiral is a pedophile, it's a really common design (you can find stock photos of it) and the vast majority of people are completely unaware that pedophiles coopted it.  This is probably why the FBI never publicized this.....because it would just lead to them being swamped with thousands of bad leads.  Did you know about that document before pizzagate?  I surely didn't.  It's a very simple and common geometric design, easy to draw, because you never have to take the pen off the paper.  I would venture to say the majority of pedophiles don't know about this code.

               I'm saying this list of code words was fake

                4chan's anonymous posting style has long been a way for users to request and post socially unacceptable content and taboos without facing many risks. ...users commonly try to post such content with the hope the site moderators won't spot it, such as in "mods are asleep" threads.

We have a Alefantis'  settlement w/Brock not to spill the beans about something something.  We have the side by side pics of Alefantis with that old Rothschild bitch showing strong resemblance.

             There are layers upon layers of connections between many of these people. They may not all run in the same group, but they run in the same circles. Even the Bronfman's connect to these people, in turn connecting NXVIM to all of this.

            I don't know of any direct links at present, but as more is revealed then maybe things will connect down the line. But they may be two completely unrelated affairs, which is where my money would be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other than that, at the minute there's not much more than: Alefantis &gt; Podesta &gt; Hillary &gt; Bill &gt; Epstein. There are loads of dems that could also link back as well, but we'll have to wait and see what gets revealed.

            great question, have been wondering this myself for a second.
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein seems to be a placeholder (private life hidden) vs Alefantis who posts extremely vulgar things to the public...as if he is "too big to fail" or unable to get arrested.

              With the fake passportS, ready cash on hand, and loose diamonds in one of his home safes, not to mention having his own dental chair and equipment, I agree. Jeffrey is likely Mossad or some other agency.
             </p>
             <p>
              The dental equipment would allow him or people he knows to implant RFID chips into someones teeth.

               Have you seen Epsteins teeth? I finally saw them in the Trump/Epstein video from the 90's. There something wrong with his mouth. I am pretty sure he has implants or dentures at least since 92. His gums were like pure red. It made me think of a reptiles mouth, like a lizards gums.
              </p>
              <p>
               All his other photos are closed mouth, no smiles.

               "By January 1996, the billionaire Les Wexner hadn’t spent two months in his 21,000-square-foot stone mansion on East 71st Street... Never mind that it had been outfitted with a HIDDEN LEAD-LINED BATHROOM (with a closed-circuit TV) and a heated sidewalk to keep the mansion snow-free. Mr. Epstein... eventually moved into that mansion..."  From the NY Observer 2009
              </p>
              <p>
               Over at CDAN there is a long, involved blind gossip item, where they picked up on the above quote, hinting at many characters: Epstein, Wexler, Cosby, the Maxwells, the English royals, Barry Diller, the Clintons and several obscure others --  CDAN 2019/07/todays-blind-items-retail-king

               Lining a room with lead sheets is used for soundproofing. It deadens low frequencies. Of interest would be if any of the properties in the vicinity have small crematoria or animal or medical waste incinerators. Incidentally, reports speculated that the temple on Lolita Island was a music room, because Epstein was a trained musician. It might well have been a recording studio. A death row inmate related that aficionados of torture / snuff movies get unduly upset when screams and noises are not reproduced accurately.

               Wexner's / Epstein's palatial mansion at 834 Fifth Avenues is repeatedly described in New York papers and magazines as Godly or Lordly.  --   "Definition of Lordly: Suitable for a lord, as trappings or ceremonies; grand or magnificent. Very dignified and noble; a lordly and charitable enterprise. Definition of Godly: Old-fashioned, believing in God and in the importance of living a moral life."  --   Trust super-sophisticated New York City dwellers (le nec plus ultra de -- the very top of the world's shit pile) to describe Satan's cozy dwelling, with a secret, soundproofed, lead-lined bathroom including closed circuit TV as Godly or Lordly. While they mock and deplore Les Deplorables. It's like the English going on about their depraved royals and elites as "The Great and the Good." Makes no difference what they're F'ing, even two-year-olds, so long as they correctly pronounce Cholmondeley.

            well, they both are pedos, know a lot of pedos - and even worse, know the SAME pedos.

            Or are there connections via NXIVM, Rothschild, CIA or the Bronfmans or the Standard Hotel?

             You're basically asking the same questions I am hah - couldn't find anything searching the archives here. Aside from the same circles being able to tie NXIM, Alefantis, and Epstien + his island would be a smash. I wonder if Epstien ever visited CPP
