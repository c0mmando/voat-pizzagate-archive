<p>Conspiracy theories thrive in the new age of post truth – often with dangerous consequences.

            Here's the larger issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is not showing his tax returns.  He had his lawyers release a letter.  A letter where the language was exceeding favorably to Donald Trump.   The best joke I heard about it, was the Titanic never hit any icebergs with few exceptions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since they just sending this letter, there is not way to ask follow up questions to find out if Russian/Ex-Soviet funds are finding their way to Donald through shell corporations.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entity that bought the House in Florida was a US based LLC.  Of course, the size of this transaction meant that the real buyer was discovered.   We don't know how US based entities deal with Trump and if there is Russia/Ex-Soviet money behind them.

            I don't think the Manchester Guardian article has anything to do with the FBI or paedo investigation its just a list ten things filler piece half of the list probably doesn't relate to a US audience and the rest is there so British people can laugh at yanks.

             I think that now that they've lost the FBI, and the Justice Dept. they are sitting ducks. I'm sure they will push to impeach Trump asap, but that will be a tough sell. Dems aren't going to want Pence as an alternative, and Reps can't justify removing Trump.

            Oh..we are not trying hard enough!  We need to drive this to number 1...Comey is a BIG SHOE folks, things will start heating up now!  Also, Rosenstein is another big shoe..things are happening faster after his confirmation..Russian narrative DIES without Comey in the middle stirring shit up...where does the MSM go now?  Straight to Podesta suggestion of a Nixon Sat or whatever the fuck that was...whatever, we have already WON this battle..we cannot ever go back to the way we were before...those that we red pill cannot either.  They will never be able to fool US again as long as we stay diligent.  The fun will be in watching their very thinly built house of card come tumbling down around their luciferian heads :-)

            "Truth is losing its value" - That is correct, as the mass media threw it away a long time ago. Now they come up with a fresh definition "post truth", trying not to explain WHY such term emerged but instead how it explains the errors in journalism which mass media did and still do.
           </p>
           <p>
            The rise of alternative media was evident after how the truth was wasted. However, this new media does not yet have the resources of the mass media, so they are easily played and used, debunked when needed, connected to whatever wanted, by the mass media. They are easily fed, and they are eager for any food - also for those they can't confirm. Any journalist can feed them anything, in general. Then, just by showing one suspicious article, the reliability of any later reliable article can be challenged.

            The Council on Foreign Relations are the ones trying to defend their masters. Notice that there is never any reporting from the press on the fascinating web of connections between Comet, the USG and the global elite, something proven on this sub alone in the past few months.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Council on Foreign Relations were also really adamant in suppressing Gary Webb when he reported on the CIA's crack shipments on the West Coast. It's because certain members of the press work to suppress the actions of illegal government activity and in return get access to the OWL/Minerva circle in DC, which of course includes parties catered by the Alefantis family and dinner parties with the Podestas.

             The Council on Foreign Relations has connections with the Trilateral Commission, United Nations Agenda 2030 (formerly Agenda 21), and the Pilgrims Society which all link back to Racine, Wisconsin.

             Racine is a weak spot to the entire system with a history connected to satanism, abuse, and the history of sacred burial mounds and ancient Giants - see Dr. Hoy.

             The elites are scared, and they are all in panic mode, including their press and political puppets. They are not scared of Russia. They are scared of Racine, Wisconsin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once people understand what is happening in Racine, and how that connects to every aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, the entire system will fall like dominoes one way or another. Comey and Lynch know how Racine is connected. So does Hillary, John McCain, Ashton Kutcher, Anthony Weiner, the Awan Brothers, the Pilgrims Society, the Knights of Pythias, and everyone else involved. Trump better hurry and separate from Kushner, Priebus and company, and he may be in too deep to get out. His time is running out to drain the swamp and get on the right side of this before it's too late, and he too is exposed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Will Trump answer - Is he a Freemason or member of the Pilgrims Society, or does he just make deals with them, and will he repent and confess in time to stop the information revolution? Does the video alleged by Robert David Steele exist where he claims Trump murders a child? Is he lying or are they both lying? Where does Trump fit into this spectrum?
            </p>
            <p>

              I am marking the days on my calendar.  The members listed with the Knights of Pythias are amazing.  You have some very interesting points and questions.  The answers are coming.  When the time comes near, yes, listen and look for suicides and disappearances of the elite.  For I believe there will be many.

                Did you get to see his comment before he deleted it?  I would love to know.  It is amazing when you think that there are times when they are at a loss for words or think twice about what they have just written, and decide to delete, possibly for revealing some information.

             No, this is not working out for you, this is very weak. Trump has repeatedly said he's got nothing to do w/ Russia, and wants the (sham) Russian investigation to go on.

             Did you see that clip of Putin in his hockey outfit being questioned about the firing of Comey? That was hilarious.

              That is hiliarious.   Trump says a lot of things.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump also said he fired Comey advice of the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General.  His adminstration pushed this cover story for days:  that Comey was fired because of how he acted in 2016 during the Clinton investigation.  He had his people put their names to this story and say
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Then Trump himself revealed it be a pack of lies. Trump came out and said he was going to fire Comey anyway, the decision was already made before he talked to the AG and DAG.  AND he connected his decision with the Russian investigation.  Very dumb move by the President.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               But regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it. ...And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself -- I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Trump just admitted he fired the head of the FBI and the reasons given were fake.  Since several members of his campaign are currently being investigated by the FBI, this will be quite problematic down the line.

               I'm aware of the "confusion" w/ the timeline and reasons given for the sacking of Comey. It's not surprising w/ an unpredictable never before seen non-politician successful businessman POTUS like Trump. I think it's a good thing, a reflection of a man who knows when to hold  'em, and knows when to fold them, and who is crazy like a fox, and understands well the element of surprise.
              </p>
              <p>
               And who cares? It's a non-issue. Grabbing at straws. As a drowning man will do.  I can make the prediction that Trump will not be stumped by leftist and MSM corporate and deep-state controlled opposition. He will never be impeached, his base would burn the damn House down.

              Every source other than Fox.  Including the actual letter from his lawyers.
             </p>
             <p>
              They admit exceptions of about 100 million dollars in income.  I don't know what your bank account is like, but to me "has not received any income" doesn't equal "has received $100 million dollars in income."
             </p>
             <p>
              But since he's not releasing his tax returns, we can' confirm anything.   For example, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project just did a big report on what they called the "Russian Laundromat", how $20 to $80 billion was taken from Russian washed through other countries like Cyprus or Moldova and wound up invested in real estate in NYC and London and other places.
             </p>
             <p>
              So when his lawyers say he doesn't have income from or debt to Russian people or Russian entities, Does this cover subsidiaries or shell companies?  The fired US Attorney in NY had an open case involving money from the "Russian Laundromat" being involved in NYC real estate.
             </p>
             <p>
              He certainly has does business with ex Soviet officials.  Just take a look at how the Trump Soho project got funded.  Look at this story that came out a few days ago.  A well know golf author talked about playing with Donald and Eric Trump.  Eric told him they were building a lot of golf courses
              <a href="http://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2017/05/05/james-dodson-donald-trump-golf">

              </a>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "Trump was strutting up and down, talking to his new members about how they were part of the greatest club in North Carolina," Dodson says. "And when I first met him, I asked him how he was — you know, this is the journalist in me — I said, 'What are you using to pay for these courses?' And he just sort of tossed off that he had access to $100 million."
              </p>
              <p>
               $100 million.
              </p>
              <p>
               "So when I got in the cart with Eric," Dodson says, "as we were setting off, I said, 'Eric, who’s funding? I know no banks — because of the recession, the Great Recession — have touched a golf course. You know, no one’s funding any kind of golf construction. It’s dead in the water the last four or five years.' And this is what he said. He said, 'Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.' I said, 'Really?' And he said, 'Oh, yeah. We’ve got some guys that really, really love golf, and they’re really invested in our programs. We just go there all the time.' Now that was [a little more than] three years ago, so it was pretty interesting."

               No US uranium was delivered to the Russians.  What the Russian bought was a Canadian owned mining company with mines in Kazakhstan, the US, and other countries, South Africa, I think.  The Kazakh company was the one most important to Russia.  They now own the US based mine, but they cannot export any uranium because that is tightly controlled and they do not have export license.  They basically have the right to get it out of the ground and sell it in the US.

                 That mine produced something under 10% of US Uranium last year.   Uranium is cheap and plentiful. We have a steady secure supply of it and if not we can just buy some more from our allies Australia and Canada who have the most in the world.
You can buy some uranium yourself.

                 You can buy uranium ore on Amazon.

                 The US produced 1129 tonnes of uranium last year.  Uranium One produced 23 tonnes of that.  That's 2%.   That 23 tonnes stayed within the US.  Uranium One does not have an export license

                 Hillary personally got 0$.   The Clinton Foundation Charity got money. Frank Giustra the guy who was closest to the Clinton Foundation gave his money in in 2005 and 2007, way before Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.  He also sold his stake in the Uranium company that became Uranium One in fall 2007 three years before this Uranium deal.

                <blockquote>
                 <p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 That is correct for Hillary.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Tony Podesta's company lobbied for the deal.   John Podesta hasn't been part of the Podesta Group since the 1990s I believe. Is there another connection for John Podesta?  I haven't really heard of his name with this deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The State Department had a connection with approving this deal through The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.  CFIUS members come from throughout the US government including Treasury, DOJ, DHS, Commerce, Defense, State, Energy
                </p>
                <p>
                 CFIUS itself cannot stop a deal.  It can make a recommendation to the President to stop it.  CFIUS approved the deal beause nothing about the deal was a threat to US security for all the reasons I pointed out above. To say Hillary approved this deal is false because this deal was approved throughout the US government.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's aslo false to say that for another reason.  Hillary wasn't on the CFIUS board herself.  There a was repsentative from State with her proxy.    The State representative on CFIUS said Clinton never intervened on the Uranium One or any other CFIUS matter.   None of them ever rose to the level of the Secretary of State.

              Seems that far less negative comments are getting through on these tweets than usual...and the one's that do are being met with a load of allegations of being paid russian trolls....

              Also noticed my Twitter had been shadowbanned yesterday...even though I've only made 3 relatively innocuous comments in the last 6 months (as I use it so rarely I can't know when this happened)

              😂 All of this ridiculous deflection reminds me of this passage on HRC from Christopher Hitchens' excellent No One Left To Lie To, written back in 1999:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Mrs. Clinton has the most unappetising combination of qualities to be met in many days' march: she is a tyrant and a bully when she can dare to be, and an ingratiating populist when that will serve. She will sometimes appear in the guise of a 'strong woman' and sometimes in the softer garb of a winsome and vulnerable female. She is entirely un-self-critical and quite devoid of reflective capacity, and has never found that any of her numerous misfortunes or embarrassments are her own fault, because the fault invariably lies with others. And, speaking of where things lie, she can in a close contest keep up with her husband for mendacity. Like him, she is not just a liar but a lie; a phoney construct of shreds and patches and hysterical, self-pitying, demagogic improvisations."
             </p>
             <p>
              She's consistent, I'll give her that!

                 I don't know what's with Alefantis on that. What do you think he meant when he said that? Remember it was said privately, while at same time he said "Everything [else] they say about me is true."

            Interesting how Trump just "threatened" Comey about possible tapes he might have of Comey. Although Trump was apparently speaking of the dinner they had, it's ironic in light of the E. T. Williams youtube.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Apparently Trump has had enough of this Russian crap. Interesting also, during the recent Lester Holt interview, Trump said Flynn was a great guy.

             He should make Michael Flynn as the head of the FBI - then tweet, ...., goes around Comets around .... sure does! That would flip liberals out of their skull. In all seriousness - Trey Gowdy is the best guy to expose the Pedo Gate.

              My guess is not in some official capacity but who knows, Trump is kind of pulling off the gloves right now. I saw he trolled Rosie O' Donnell and told her they finally agree on something (she had said months ago that Comey should be fired).
             </p>
             <p>
              Neither Trump nor Flynn's son seem to be too concerned about General Flynn.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: I think Trump has been trying to "reach across the aisles," and be presidential, and get things done. But when push comes to shove he may say the hell with it, go back to his "base," and seek comfort and support from them. He's had everyone from Coulter to Savage to Limbaugh breathing down his neck, and I'm sure when you add in the kids he's pretty conflicted. Don't want to corner a guy like him.

               I agree, I think they've pushed him too far and now he's just pissed off. I still think Flynn is key somehow, and that the talk of re-opening the Clinton email investigation

                 Thomas Wictor in twitter has a good theory. 
Flynn created a non-official cover (NOC) persona, called a "knock." Spooks also call it an "illegal" persona.
The ENTIRE PURPOSE of Flynn's operation was to make himself appear shady, shifty, and untrustworthy
By making himself a target, Flynn created a REASON for the intelligence community to leak. It was a sting, a trap, a tiger pit.
The National Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence control raw signals intelligence (SIGINT).
It's clear that the NSA and the ODNI were part of the sting operation. RAW SIGINT WAS NEVER PUBLISHED.
The leakers were given REPORTS, not raw SIGINT. There had to be a REASON to blather to press. Flynn provided the reason.
As Gingrich said, the press wants to chase rabbits, so Trump gives them rabbits to chase.
There is NOTHING TO the Flynn story. Flynn made it all up in order to FOOL people into leaking.
Each leaker was given a DIFFERENT REPORT.
Since the leakers did not have access to raw SIGINT, they didn't know that their reports were not accurate.
Also, the leakers didn't get together and compare notes. They were sitting ducks.
AS each leaker spoke to the press, he or she was identified, since each leaker got a different report.
But the leakers needed SOMETHING TO LEAK ABOUT. Flynn give it to them.
NOW do you understand? Flynn did nothing wrong. About a hundred fake sources are claiming he did. That's deliberate.
