TL;DR aka BLUF: OP self-doxx’d because of a Steemit post under a tangentially related name and another “data point”.  This provided the shill who targeted OP with enough information to eventually target OP, up to and including death threats and enough information to indicate 100% PII disclosure.
I was asked to post a brief on “Physical (and virtual) security for Pizzagaters” – my words, not the requestor.  Obviously, everyone’s security situation is different.  I’m sure there will be some “expert” out there to one-up or counter my claims.  Regardless, I use the following guidelines as a starting point for research, rather than a “how-to” guide.</p>
<p>To address physical security, you also have to address virtual security.  This needs no explanation, or I would not be writing this post.  As soon as you are doxx’d for real, your force protection condition (FPCON) is going to jump from NORMAL/ALPHA (should always be alpha – learn basis of any good close combat/martial art platform) to CHARLIE/DELTA. What is the real threat?  Is someone really sending a hitman after you? Or is it just some asshat getting paid 15.00/hr. to harass his employer’s adversaries?  Only you can make that call.</p>
<p><strong>Online:</strong> I’ll skip the lecture on the perils of social media and anonymity. If this Reddit post is real - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/55fa39/david_brock_hacked_on_his_chat_network_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/55fa39/david_brock_hacked_on_his_chat_network_the/</a> - then you can pretty much rest assured that the enemies of freedom have an extraordinarily powerful weapon in their hands, when it comes to doxing enemies.  Everything you do must be air gapped online, including passwords, user names, geographic references, etc.  Anything which can be used to triangulate you is probably at their disposal, assuming the application wasn’t serialized and can’t be killed remotely.  So, if you used a password of !!ILoveCorgis123? on your Ashley Madison page and used that same password at Home Depot?, because that was your “secure” password, guess what?   There is probably enough information out there that a powerful toolkit like FOXACID could provide the savvy targeter with information to identify you as an individual. [PS – Don’t store your investigative notes in the cloud – save them to USB]</p>
<p><strong>Cellular:</strong> No cellular phone is safe from eavesdropping.  “Burner” phones can be used and rotated making it very difficult to track – how did you pay for it?  They can pull IMEI numbers, narrow them to a batch shipment, possibly to a region via distributor, possibly via CCTV camera.  Facial recognition?  More than you can even know.  Face to face discussions are always preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> That fun little Amazon Alexa?  Big ears.  You cell phone is too, if anyone is listening.  On Star, iWatch, Samsung fridges, TVs. Anything with a camera or microphone is game.  Watch Person of Interest.  It is very close to reality.</p>
<p><strong>FISA Exclusion Zones:</strong> My understanding, though explanations have been fleeting, is that if you live within 30 miles of whatever is defined as the center of Washington, D.C and NYC, then no FISA warrant is needed.  Everything is Hoovered. Good money says this applies to more than those two cities.</p>
<p><strong>Situational Awareness:</strong> Spidey sense…either you have it or you don’t.  Either way, pay attention to your surroundings.  If someone is “after” you, they will need to observe you first.  Those changes in environmental surroundings will usually be the tip off that something is out of place.  New car on the street; someone hanging out by the market you get morning coffee at; strange vehicles.  It could be anything.  Keep a good eye on your surroundings.  Rule #1 – do NOT ever confront someone who may be conducting surveillance on you.  The key to doing this is to be able to not react.  If you do, cover it up by doing something stupid – drop a phone, keys, etc.  This also applies to more immediate threats – i.e., Seth Richards.  Alright, now I have your attention.  If you reread the various accounts, most say he was on the phone (FaceTime?) with his GF.  Well, guess what – he never saw it coming.  Nose down on a phone at 03XX in D.C.  Would being observant saved his life?  Hard to say.  Probably not as he was in DC and not armed.  Don\'t give them the edge - be alert.</p>
<p><strong>Residential Security:</strong> This is where most individuals feel vulnerable.  CCTV – Unless you have a proper system and can afford to monitor it 24x7, the only thing it’s good for is evidence after the fact.  Locks/Windows – They can all be defeated by a professional.  Alarm system – Effectiveness depends on application.  If it makes enough noise heard by others and can alert the police – good.  If it can be disabled and no one hears a siren – worthless. Best bang for the buck is SimpliSafe. Lighting – Light it up like Fort Knox – evil loves darkness.  Dogs are good.  Stay vigilant. </p>
<p><strong>Mobile Security:</strong> “Hitting” a target while they are on the move is usually a top choice.  Unless you have floor plans and a mock-up of a home, taking one down is a risky proposition.  Open road is best.  The key to surviving this is the old identify, predict, decide, execute.  Always have an out.  Leave a reaction pocket – aka car length – when you stop at a light.  Check your mirrors frequently.  Visually inspect your vehicle before getting in it (cut brake lines leak).  It sounds trite, but vary your daily routine by 50%.  Don’t be predictable. Understand what a surveillance detection route is – if you think you are being followed, try an SDR out. </p>
<p>[I’m sure I’ve lost most readers due to TL;DR by this point]</p>
<p><strong>Workplace Security:</strong> Not what you would expect here, but be very thoughtful towards who your “work friends” are and are not.  I’ve noticed a trend recently for the sheep/bot/drones (or whatever) to do unpredictably vindictive things you would not think they are capable of.  Not everyone is your friend.  Be careful what you say at work.  Think of the work place as East Germany light.</p>
<p><strong>Self Defense:</strong> It’s never too late to start. Criminals (like the one that “robbed” Seth Rich) always pick soft targets.  Don’t be a soft target.  Confidence projects confidence and does not convey a soft target.  Anything is better than nothing.  [Zionist Trigger Alert] If I had to recommend the quickest way to become confident, I would recommend Krav Maga – Israeli hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p><strong>Counterintelligence:</strong> Last thought here.  As mentioned above, reevaluate who is in your life.  What have and have you not said to them?  What do they have access to?  Do you have friends or friends of friends through your domicile?  Is your computer locked?  Do you have positive key control?  Who has access to your life.  Start thinking a bit like – if I wanted to “get” to me, how would I do it?  Think of it as offensive counterintelligence.</p>
<p>Yes, 10,000 books have been written on the subjects herewith in.  I’m not here to debate the finer points.  Only to provide a constructive discussion on keeping fellow PG researchers safe.  My guess is that deserves a pass on the “meta” test.  And I worked a link or two in.</p>

                 Don't know how; but I now have web cams on the house.  Have been working on research since November...I am guessing that someone wants me to give it up.  :-|   Thank you and I am implementing new drive routes, departure/arrival times, and some extra opsec.  Not mention I have a C&amp;C license.  :-)

                  you're welcome. hmm.. maybe you can better conceal your presence on-line. type differently, etc. I have a compsci friend who knows deep/dark web stuff, if I ever wanna research for myself. 
what's opsec? and nice. make sure you stay calm, breathe, and don't hesitate to 'pull the trigger' &gt;:)

            Great post!

            You researchers and participants have been walking through the valley of death.  Those who have been here a while realize this is the same group that has pushed every conflict in our lifetime.  Don't succumb to fear.  Internet security has been a cloth over our eyes for some time.  All the protection in the world couldn't protect you from Reddit admins with direct access to the servers.  This group has used violent conflict to advance their agenda and they do not plan to stop.

            This book was a great reference and after purchasing it from amazon you realize bezos has done nothing but added a check mark to your profile.  All we can do is move forward, it's for your children and mine.

            for posting this.  Some people may think this is either common sense or understood going into these investigations. But not everyone coming to this forum and trying to help will have the same backgrounds to know ahead of time the seriousness of what getting involved really entails, much less how to know, or what to do if and when they do suspect they're being surveilled.

              as in no policy to keep them from sharing whatever they know about us private, or keep them from selling our "data".   With the exception of the public board's no dox policy between members that is.  If so, add that to the uncool pile.  However they don't ask for much, just an avatar name and they have our IP address I'd suppose which gives locale.   Amd of course our comment history.  Wouldn't be surprised at all if THEIR search button worked fine when it comes to looking at our history.

              So maybe the rumors of sex blackmail to keep loyalty among the 
upper echelons of the intelligence establishment are true. Was Jon-Benet Ramsey part of that?
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe the Columbine Massacre was a pre-emptive strike on an
emerging SRA scandal involving Lockheed Martin and Jon Benet Ramsey?
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was very similar?
Maybe the cult knew that trouble was brewing at both Columbine High School and Sandy Hook and long ago decided that they could not afford, at any cost, to allow another Jonestown/McMartin Preschool/Presidio Daycare type satanic ritual abuse media scandal to emerge, and now they just go in and shoot everybody.

               The Columbine Massacre was completely faked. I have read the entire 3000+ page FBI report. It is full of bullshit. The father of one of the fake victims led the FBI investigation. This was faked, through and through. Sandy Hook shooting is no different.

            Forgive me but I gotta ask regarding: "is probably at their disposal".
           </p>
           <p>
            Why "probably"? Everyone here has seen Wikileaks dump of Vault 7 and the other surveillance tools. There is no "probably", it's most definitely. They've got everything and everyone monitored 24/7.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm just waiting for them to figure out how to monitor your thoughts:
