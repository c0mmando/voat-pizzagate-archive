            To get to the top you have to sell your soul. To change the current socioeconomic and morally deprived system you have to be a martyr. Action speaks louder than words.

            The media is entirely bought and controlled. Just look at the Telecommunications Act of 1996 under Bill Clinton. We went from 50 media outlets on to 5. They had Clear Channel buy up all the radio stations! So we all listen to Rush or Hannity at some point during the day, no matter where you live in the country. I know that it's been whittled down to 50 fax numbers of Television print and radio, that the talking points are sent to be read by the puppets.

            Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  It appears that the July issue isn't online yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, ALL media outlets are owned by TPTB.   AND controlled by the CIA (Operation Mockingbird, 1950s).
           </p>

            Nothing but wealthy Jews here.  And it has a Reuters (Rothschild) connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Inc. was founded in Boston by
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Bernie Goldhirsh
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , and its first issue appeared in April 1979.[4]
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Goldhirsh was an MIT-trained engineer who worked at Polaroid and on ballistic missiles
             </strong>
            </strong>
            before becoming an entrepreneur and founding Sail magazine, which he sold for $10 million, using the profits to found Inc. Paul W. Kellam, who had joined Goldhirsh's company as editor of Marine Business, was tapped as the first editor.[5] Goldhirsh kept a low profile, and longtime editor George Gendron was the "public face" of the magazine for two decades.[6] Though long considered the younger upstart compared to most business publications, Inc. suffered following the dot-com era as titles like Fast Company seemed to grab more attention, but the tech crash and subsequent retrenchment saw the magazine stabilize its circulation and image.[6] In 2000, widowed and battling cancer, Goldhirsh sold the magazine to Gruner + Jahr[6] for a price reported over $200 million.[5]
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The magazine was purchased in 2005 by Morningstar founder, Joe Mansueto, and Inc. and its sister magazine Fast Company constitute the publishing arm of Mansueto Ventures. The magazine is now based in New York City, and its editor-in-chief is Eric Schurenberg. In December 2013, Schurenberg was appointed as President of Inc., replacing the long-tenured Bob LaPointe. In late January 2014, Inc. announced that Reuters Opinion editor James Ledbetter would take over as editor of the magazine and Web site.[7]
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Goldhirsh's devotion to the principles of entrepreneurism led him to create the Goldhirsh Foundation[8] and a unique trust run by his children.[9] Founder Bernie Goldhirsh's son, Ben Goldhirsh, is the founder of Good Magazine.[5]
