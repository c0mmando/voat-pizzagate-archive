            No one ever said that telling the truth was easy, or that doing the right thing didn't require sacrifice. Even then, when you may die for doing it, you will one day be forgotten by history, or even reviled by it should they remain in power. But if you have the chance to help even one kid who is or might end up trapped in a system of abuse, even if it costs you everything, would you just sit by and do nothing?
