<p>I\'m the author of two pizzagate posts at <a href="http://aceloewgold.com">http://aceloewgold.com</a>. My goal there is to compile the best, most compelling, most connectable info from the investigation and summarize it for skeptics to spark them to dig more on their own, and fall down the rabbit hole and red-pill themselves. From some comments there and around the net, conpiracy skeptics seem to be finding it credible-sounding, (some even commented things like &quot;I thought this was totally a ridiculous conspiracy nut witch hunt at first, until I read this post), and all we need is for people to say &quot;there might really be somthing to this&quot; to then start their own digging and red-pill themselves fully. That initial spark.</p>
<p>I am trying to gather enough for a follow-up but try to only include the most 100% verifiable and effective/damning facts vs speculative stuff and half-completed connections.</p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions, with links to sources, of what I should get into the follow-up I\'d love to crowdsource it. It\'d make it a lot easier! SO much being discovered, but most of it I feel like I just can\'t include yet until it becomes more concrete. Nothing turns off newbies to this stuff as much as sensationalism, massive claims with lame sources, and wording that stinks of tinfoil hattery.</p>
<p>I\'m going to start a new thread of my own where others can contribute their ideas (with sources, again!). This is key. We don\'t need everyone to believe all the research, we just need enough people to believe enough of it. I feel I can be very effective at doing this if the right info can be compiled and sourced.</p>
