            Foster was murdered inside the White House and carried outside in a rolled up carpet which was put into a van and driven to Fort Marcy Park. Carpet fibers were found on his suit. The Secret Service boys carried his body out of the van and dumped him where he was found. He had no dirt on the bottom of his shoes so he could not have walked up that dirt path impossible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why was he killed inside the White House? Most likely he told Hillary he would have to testify about her past crimes or he told her he was quitting and going back to Little Rock to have a normal peaceful life. It's been reported that Hillary ordered her SS agent to shoot Vince or maybe Hillary shot him herself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also reported the Russians have spy satellite video of the rolled  up carpet being taken out of the residence and the satellite followed the van all the way to the park. The video will show the SS agents carrying Foster's body to where they dropped it.
           </p>
           <p>
            We and the Russians have geo-synchronous orbital satellites that stay above the same location all the time. These satellites are amazing close-up video power and they never lose focus of what they are stationed above they are the highest technology truly fantastic capability.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Russians also have satellite video of 9-11 showing where the planes went and where the military remote-control planes came from. The Russians could have exposed 9-11 the very next day as a false-flag military psy-op. They did not expose it they wanted to profit from what they had.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both countries have the goods on each other which is why none of this video ever gets released they use it to blackmail the other side and it keeps things at a Mexican standoff.

             <em>
              The latest thing Donald Trump is talking about not talking about is the 1993 death of White House attorney Vince Foster, which was ruled a suicide by multiple investigations but which "people" — according to Trump — believe was a murder orchestrated by the Clintons. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told The Washington Post's Jose DelReal and Robert Costa that Foster's death was "very fishy."

             <em>
              "I don't bring it up because I don't know enough to really discuss it," Trump said while bringing it up. "I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder. I don't do that because I don't think it’s fair."
             </em>

            <p>
             <em>
              Riiight. Trump isn't talking about Vince Foster. He's just casually mentioning that a bunch of other people think his likely general election opponent and her husband had a guy killed. That's all.

             I'm not saying I disagree, but after looking at your comment/submission history (of what is essentially propaganda in favor of racism and "white nationalism"), I'm really not interested in your opinion.

              So you hold a lie and discard truth.  Pedogate and Pizzagate are real, this story is not.

               you obviously did not read what I said. I have been here 4x as long as you - I know pedogate/pizzagate is real. I posted this article specifically because I was unsure about its accuracy. I made that very clear in my first comment on the thread.
              </p>
              <p>
               What I'm discarding is your nonsense about "white nationalism" and racist propaganda, as I said. For example, this thread of yours:

                https://voat.co/v/Identitarian/1645563
               </a>
               (reasonable people in here: have a quick look at this poster's history and you'll see what i'm talking about).

            I'm not sure why anyone would downvote this post seeing as how I've asked if anyone can confirm the accuracy of the posted article. It now seems unlikely me to me that this is true, because of the following other recent articles from the same source:

            Not sure of the validity of this but for those of you who weren't around at the time it was a big coverup and we all knew he was murdered, even the writers for the Jim Carrey movie 'Me Myself and Irene' brought it up in their movie!

            After Vince Foster committed suicide in the cathouse (Bill's orgy apartment), he then wrapped himself up in carpet (which had to be replaced) and drove himself to a parking lot near some federally-administered park.  He then staged his suicide, complete with a pack of wine coolers and one empty bottle, which he left for added effect.  Unfortunately he mistakenly staged this second suicide in city jurisdiction (the parking lot was in a different jurisdiction that then park itself), so he then had to move himself into federal jurisdiction so the president's personal police force (the Secret Service) could oversee the investigation.  Mr. Foster then shot himself one last time.  This time he put the gun in his mouth yet didn't even chip any teeth despite the kick when it fired.  None of this had anything to do whatsoever with the ten year affair Mr. Foster had with Hillary Clinton or the effect that could have had on her future political aspirations under the so-called '86 plan she and Bill developed in 1986 to eventually become the world's greatest power couple ever (first female president Hillary and UN Secretary General Bill).

            Snopes said it was fake, but I don't find snopes reliable and very biased. I found the article believable and very specific without vague references myself but unfortunately I have never heard of the source. So I am not sure.

             So the way I usually try to verify if an article is on the level is by searching the title in google and seeing if different publications use different wording, if the same article is attributed to different people, and if articles are attributed to an actual person especially.  Like someone with an attached Twitter and bio.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aaaaaaand this one fails that test.  All the articles are from random people except 'Delano Ben' who doesn't exist as far as I can tell.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it's fake news.

            this article has zero sources so I'm going to flair it "accuracy in question". I heard about this a while ago and it seemed like it was fake. If anyone can confirm it I'll remove the flair.

             I saw one about Trey Gowdy ordering the body to be exhumed a few days ago. It was posted by someone on Facebook who posts a lot of fake articles without fact checking them first. I posted the verbatim cut and pasted disclaimer from the website that said it was a satire site with nothing but fake articles. Today I saw this one and thinking it was fake I clicked on the youtube and then followed the links, and it took me to a site that appears fake but doesn't have any disclaimers. When I click on the links that come from the second website that seems fake, it takes me to another fake site that has a bunch of ads. I believe this is fake or else it would link to a more legitimate source. I also think that the lady's voice was the same in both videos and I would bet she is behind the linking to ads, and setting up fake blogs that appear legit and don't have disclaimers, to get more clicks and more revenue. She is probably triple linking all of her stuff and monetizing it. Somehow I think that exhuming Vince Foster's body would be a major story, don't you?

             no problem, I wasn't sure about the accuracy either, which is why I was hoping someone could confirm.

             Well, Snopes calls it Fake News, so there must be more to it. In Before It's News:With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide. LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible.***Stay Tuned Folks. Popcorn Time.

             My initial search shows news sources i am not familiar with, saw this one as a follow up report, remember seeing this site before but am unsure of its accuracy, so trying to find reports of stolen ambulance etc
