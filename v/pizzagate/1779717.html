            All organized patriarchal religions underpin patriarchy which is responsible for sexual abuse of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            For it is MALES who are our sexual abusers of children and they are heterosexual males as studies show.

            ** the majority of child molestation cases are heterosexual in nature.**

             Only false religion does that.
            </p>
            <p>
             True faith is a theandric organism, not an organization. The thousands of Protestant denominations, the schismatic Roman Catholic church and it's 150 Jewish popes and countless pedos are worldly power organizations--nothing to do with real Christianity--for just a couple examples. Unfortunately, most in the West do not know anything about ecclesiology or real history and recent book burning at Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble is trying to make sure you never find out who is really behind the facade and who facilitated the creation of false religious organizations.

            Presumably you'll be happy when there's a second Jewish Holocaust?
Meanwhile, it is the history of the RCC which deals in Satanic Ritual Abuse as reports from nuns
continue to report and bear witness to even in current times.
Wherever we find sexual abuse of children - whatever the "Church" or "Temple" - it must be stopped.
Anyone still supporting organized patriarchal religion -- whatever it is named -- is supporting evil.

             The Catholic church is basically a trolly 2000 year old Jewish Ponzi scheme. The fucking pope wears a Yamaka. The only people mutilating the genitals of children, condoning the rape of infidels (which they call Cattle, or Hebrew "Goyim"), and committing false flags and starting wars are the Jews, and conservative Islamic fucks. The Abrahamic religions are a long running joke. All of these religions are synthetic freak-shows.

             Catholicism is literally crypto-judaism. The Pope wears a Yamaka. They tried to spread the Jewish practice of circumcision, or infant mutilation, which was implanted into Islam in the 9th Century by the Jews. They are just trolling at this point.

            Look up the "Alta Vendita" - it's a 200 year old plan of jews/freemasons to infiltrate the Catholic Church and bring it down through scandals and doing their usual pedophilia. It's time to genocide jew garbage. Bomb them, shoot them, blow up their freemason lodges on the full moon nights they meet there. It's war and this pedo homosexual jew/freemason dog shit needs to be killed.

             They created the Roman Catholic Church for the purpose of founding international banking (((The Templars))) and endless war, starting with the so called "Crusades". The fourth crusade was against the only Christian empire, btw.
Yet, people are ignorant about the true origins of all this. There's no need to infiltrate what you already created and already run.

            Though the homosexual community and much of the media scoff at such accusations, Baldwin – who chaired the California Assembly’s Education committee, where he fought against support for the homosexual agenda in the state’s public schools – says in his report that homosexual activists’ “efforts to target children both for their own sexual pleasure and to enlarge the homosexual movement” constitute an “unmistakable” attack on “the family unit.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Baldwin’s research is substantiated in a recently completed body of work written by Dr. Judith Reisman, president of the Institute for Media Education and author of numerous authoritative books debunking sexual myths, including “Kinsey, Crimes &amp; Consequences.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In her thesis – also written for the Regent University Law Review – Reisman cited psychologist Eugene Abel, whose research found that homosexuals “sexually molest young boys with an incidence that is occurring from five times greater than the molestation of girls. …”
           </p>
           <p>
            Abel also found that non-incarcerated “child molesters admitted from 23.4 to 281.7 acts per offender … whose targets were males.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “The rate of homosexual versus heterosexual child sexual abuse is staggering,” said Reisman, who was the principal investigator for an $800,000 Justice Department grant studying child pornography and violence. “Abel’s data of 150.2 boys abused per male homosexual offender finds no equal (yet) in heterosexual violations of 19.8 girls.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Jay Heavener, spokesman for PFLAG – Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, counters that federal crime data refute claims that homosexuals molest children at higher rates than heterosexuals.
           </p>
           <p>
            “According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), this claim is false,” he told WND by e-mail. “The gay and lesbian community calls into question any dubious research which flies in the face of our own experience.”
           </p>
           <p>
            And Gary Schoener, a clinical psychologist who has been diagnosing and treating clergy abuse for 28 years, told Salon.com, “There are far more heterosexual cases than homosexual.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of sheer numbers, that may be true. But in terms of numbers of children abused per offender, homosexuals abuse with far greater frequency; and boys, research shows, are the much-preferred target.
           </p>
           <p>
            Baldwin says evidence he examined disproves the assertion that child molestation is more prevalent among heterosexuals. Both he and Reisman found that media coverage of adult homosexual abuse of minors is also slanted.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA) recently boasted that although homosexuals are less than two percent of the population, three-fourths of the people who decide the content of the front page of the New York Times are homosexual,” Reisman wrote.
           </p>
           <p>
            That one fact is especially noteworthy, experts point out, given the recent child sex scandals taking place within the American Catholic church.
           </p>
           <p>
            A survey by WorldNetDaily of recent news reports found that rarely did the media describe priestly sexual abuse as “homosexual” or “gay” activity – even though the worst incidents involved male-to-male contact, and a spate of investigative reports has revealed that the Vatican is concerned about an upsurge of homosexuals in seminary schools throughout the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gay press promotes sex with children
           </p>
           <p>
            Baldwin says his research not only “confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals,” but it found that “the mainstream homosexual culture” even “commonly promotes sex with children.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “The editorial board of the leading pedophile academic journal, Paidika, is dominated by prominent homosexual scholars such as San Francisco State University professor John DeCecco, who happens to edit the Journal of Homosexuality,” Baldwin wrote.
           </p>
           <p>
            During his research, he also found:
           </p>
           <p>
            The Journal of Homosexuality recently published a special double-issue entitled, “Male Intergenerational Intimacy,” containing many articles portraying sex between men and minor boys as loving relationships. One article said parents should look upon the pedophile who loves their son “not as a rival or competitor, not as a theft of their property, but as a partner in the boy’s upbringing, someone to be welcomed into their home.”
In 1995 the homosexual magazine “Guide” said, “We can be proud that the gay movement has been home to the few voices who have had the courage to say out loud that children are naturally sexual” and “deserve the right to sexual expression with whoever they choose. …” The article went on to say: “Instead of fearing being labeled pedophiles, we must proudly proclaim that sex is good, including children’s sexuality … we must do it for the children’s sake.”
Larry Kramer, the founder of ACT-UP, a noted homosexual activist group, wrote in his book, “Report from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist”: “In those instances where children do have sex with their homosexual elders, be they teachers or anyone else, I submit that often, very often, the child desires the activity, and perhaps even solicits it.”
In a study of advertisements in the influential homosexual newspaper, The Advocate, Reisman found ads for a “Penetrable Boy Doll … available in three provocative positions. She also found that the number of erotic boy images in each issue of The Advocate averaged 14.
Homosexual newspapers and travel publications advertise prominently for countries where boy prostitution is heavy, such as Burma, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Homosexuality ‘youth-oriented’?
           </p>
           <p>
            “Research on the homosexual lifestyle confirms it is almost exclusively a youth-oriented culture,” Baldwin wrote. “Very few gays exhibit preference for older men.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Some admit to focus on teenage boys,” he said, “some on prepubescent boys, and many cross over between categories.”
           </p>
           <p>
            A 1988 study detailed in Baldwin’s report found that most pedophiles even consider themselves to be “gay.” According to the study, “Archives of Sexual Behavior,” some 86 percent of pedophiles described themselves as homosexual or bisexual. Also, the study found, the number of teenage male prostitutes who identify as homosexuals has risen from 10 percent to 60 percent in the past 15 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            When asked what he thought about critics who attempt to debunk his research, Baldwin said the results speak for themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            “For them to say this theory is false is to call many of the homosexual movement’s leaders liars,” he said. “Most of my evidence comes right from the gay community.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “I managed to find enough evidence that my thesis – child molestation is an integral part of the homosexual movement – is a valid thesis,” Baldwin told WorldNetDaily.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other experts have also found a distinct pattern between child sex abusers and the incidence of homosexuality.
           </p>
           <p>
            “How long can psychologists be in denial about the significance of the dark side, and ignore what it implies about the homosexual condition? And there’s a matter of even greater concern. How long will psychologists eagerly throw open the door to gay life for every sexually confused teenager?” writes Joseph Nicolosi, Ph.D, on behalf of NARTH – the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality – a group that says it exists to “provide psychological understanding of the cause, treatment and behavior patterns associated with homosexuality, within the boundaries of a civil public dialogue.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, is “a group that openly promotes sex with minor boys and claims that boy-lovers respond to the needs of the boys they love,” Baldwin said in his report.
           </p>
           <p>
            The group is often endorsed by “many of the homosexual movement’s most prominent leaders,” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Advocacy moving to schools
           </p>
           <p>
            Promotion of the “gay and lesbian lifestyle” is increasing in the nation’s public schools.
           </p>
           <p>
            A WND survey of homosexual-oriented websites found that almost every group has some sort of program to “educate” teachers, school administrators and other school employees about the homosexual lifestyle:
           </p>
           <p>
            GLSEN – the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network – bills itself as “the largest national network of parents, students, educators and others” specifically formed to end “discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in K-12 schools. Two recent press released boasted of the Broward County (Fla.) school board approving GLSEN-sponsored “training for teachers.”
A student activist working with GLSEN officials has managed to “give voice” recently to “gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered students” at California schools;
PFLAG has created a national campaign called, “From Our House to the Schoolhouse,” distributing to school officials – among other materials – a booklet entitled, “Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer For Principals, Educators, &amp; School Personnel. [Editor’s note: Readers need the Adobe PDF reader to open and read this file.]
Though most school-related programs are sold to administrators and parents as programs designed simply to end persecution of homosexuals and lesbians, none disclose what Baldwin says is compelling evidence that homosexuality is harmful to children.
           </p>
           <p>
            “What … does the academic literature say about the relationship between homosexuality and child molestation? Quite a bit, actually,” he wrote, quoting data compiled by the Family Research Institute: “Scientific studies confirm a strong pedophilic predisposition among homosexuals.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The institute, after reviewing more than 19 studies and peer-reviewed reports in a 1985 “Psychological Reports” article, found that homosexuals account for between 25 and 40 percent of all child molestation.
           </p>
           <p>
            “But this number is low,” Baldwin says, “due to the fact that many reporters will not report if a child molester is a homosexual, even if he knows that to be the case.”

             </p>
             <p>
              Kurt had put forward the hypothesis that voyeurism, exhibitionism, obscene telephone calling, toucheurism - frotteurism, and at least some cases of the preferential rape pattern were distortions of normal courtship behavior. Kurt was a biologist at heart and borrowed the concept of courtship from the ethologists' descriptions of lower animals' fixed-action patterns leading to mating. To feminist scholars, who of course viewed rape as an act of aggression and an example of men's domination of women, referring to rape as a disorder of courtship was anathema. During a coffee break at the Clarke Institute late in his life, he told me he could not understand why his concept of Courtship Disorders had not been more influential in the field.  When I suggested to him that the rest of us did not have his courage, I had the impression that he did not understand my response.&gt;

His compassion for his patients, his thoughtful enlightenment, and his commitment to the scientific method will continue to serve as a positive role model for generations to come.

homosexuals and bisexuals probably represent much higher percentages -- 15% or even higher.

             <p>
              The evidence indicates that homosexual men molest boys at rates grossly disproportionate to the rates at which heterosexual men molest girls. To demonstrate this it is necessary to connect several statistics related to the problem of child sex abuse:** 1) men are almost always the perpetrator**; 2) up to one-third or more of child sex abuse cases are committed against boys; 3) less than three percent of the population are homosexuals. Thus, a tiny percentage of the population (homosexual men), commit one-third or more of the cases of child sexual molestation.&gt;

              A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."&gt;

             A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

             In an earlier study of convicted male child molesters in Massachusetts, none of the 175 men were found to have an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation or to be primarily attracted to other adult men.
