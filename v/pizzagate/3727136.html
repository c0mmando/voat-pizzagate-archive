This was a tough one and took a long time, my mouse broke so I found an old one but am having to use a combination of a mousepad that doesn\'t click and a mouse that doesn\'t move the cursor. Also going through their instagram was more work than any of the previous segments since there were so many connections to people who have been covered.</p>
<p>I will definitely need more than the 10.000 characters on this one so there will be more pictures in the comments. I struck gold in this one imo. A Podesta connection. I didn\'t literally find him one of the pictures but they featured one of the creepy artists they are into. I also saw a picture of a very familar art piece. I also saw Rodney Bingenheimer and Kim Fowley who I posted about on Friday with the documentary:</p>
<p>So, first things first. We know that Rachel Chandler used to work for Purple Magazine: <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2009/09/rachel_chandler_loves_her_belg.html">https://www.thecut.com/2009/09/rachel_chandler_loves_her_belg.html</a> (<a href="https://archive.li/tzPfE">https://archive.li/tzPfE</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;Since February, 22-year-old Rachel Chandler has been snapping shots for the art, nightlife, and fashion worlds for Purple Diary. The L.A. native came to New York to study art history at Gallatin in 2005, and in the meantime, picked up regular D.J. gigs at the Beatrice Inn and now Avenue, as well as a steady slew of cool, private parties.&quot;</p>

<p>There you can see a few pictures of her modelling:</p>

<p>Purple Diary regularly held events at Standard Hotel in &quot;the boom boom room&quot;</p>

<p>See this is why I have to do screengrabs of all this stuff. Just the other day this was up, but now? 404 not found.</p>
<p>This one is still up though:</p>

<p>And I found some screengrabs online: </p>
<p>Rachel and Oliver Zahm</p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D_EedV2WkAAKfpw.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D_EedV2WkAAKfpw.jpg</a></p>

<p>Tom and Rachel:</p>

<p>So far a lot of the pictures have been NSFW but have been slightly censored due to the fact that they are posting it on instagram. Of course in the printed versions of these magazine they are under no such restrictions. On the website as well. There they truly reveal what they are about as they are not only posting nude pictures but straight up smut. I mean they are literally posting pornographic videos there and some of the models seem to be of a very questionable age.</p>
<p>F.e. this is a film about an intersex woman and they show a picture of what appears to be her, naked as a young teenager: <a href="https://purple.fr/television/arianna/">https://purple.fr/television/arianna/</a> </p>
<p>I feel uncomfortable taking a screenshot of that but you can click on that link and watch the video.</p>
<p>Next bit I found is of &quot;the King of Creeps&quot; Kim Fowley, who was featured heavily in the documentary I posted about on Friday: <a href="https://purple.fr/television/get-well-kim-fowley/">https://purple.fr/television/get-well-kim-fowley/</a></p>
<p>Here she is talking about &quot;Watersports&quot;, that is urinating on your partner:</p>
<p><a href="https://purple.fr/television/watersports-by-slutever/">https://purple.fr/television/watersports-by-slutever/</a></p>
<p>Presumably in this video the guy is urinating on her but fortunately it seems not to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://purple.fr/television/slutever-watersports-pt-2/">https://purple.fr/television/slutever-watersports-pt-2/</a></p>
<p>This one is just creepy. A guy is yelling at these two girls as they make out. He ends the video by saying &quot;What if there is no next time? What if there is no tomorrow?&quot; </p>
<p><a href="https://purple.fr/television/dont-feel-bad-slutever/">https://purple.fr/television/dont-feel-bad-slutever/</a></p>
<p>In this one they act out some weird modern Roman orgy setting.</p>
<p><a href="https://purple.fr/television/conversion/">https://purple.fr/television/conversion/</a></p>
<p>Here a woman gives a &quot;blowjob&quot; to a strap-on dildo... </p>
<p><a href="https://purple.fr/television/slutever/">https://purple.fr/television/slutever/</a></p>
<p>Ok, you get the point. No need to insult my senses further by watching more of this.</p>
<p>The editor is Olivier Zahm who we will learn more about during this segment. He has a reputation for being a sleazebag but apparently, as Rachel Chandler explains &quot;he just really loves women, more than anyone else I know&quot;.. so it\'s ok! Much like Terry Richardson, a frequent contributor to the magazine has been accused multiple times of inappropriate behavior and exploiting young models for sex with a promise of fame. </p>
<p><a href="https://hyperallergic.com/11936/editor-olivier-zahm-just-really-loves-women-bro/">https://hyperallergic.com/11936/editor-olivier-zahm-just-really-loves-women-bro/</a></p>
<p>I first heard about Terry Richardson because Miley Cyrus was endorsing him heavily and modelling for him in some weird nude pictures. He also did the video for her for &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; which I\'m sure many of you will remember. He has also directed a video for Lady Gaga. He has appeared multiple times in connection with these people and is surely a part of Rachel Chandler\'s circle. Here is a news article detailing his disturbing behaviour and explores a multitude of allegations against him: </p>

<p>Here are some extra articles about Rachel Chandler that I thought were informative and add further context:</p>

<p>If you look up Michel Chelbin you will find extremely disturbing photographs. Here is her explanation for her work:</p>
<p>“My images are vehicles to address universal themes: family issues, ideas of normality, puberty with its all incumbent pains and distractions, the desire for fame. An example of this is the adolescent girls I photograph, many of them are on the verge of sexual consciousness. They are in this difficult age, torn between innocence and experience. While their bodies might be still that of a child, their gaze sometimes imply differently. I try to create an informal scene, in which they directly confront the viewer. I feel they and their stories represent with most clarity the theme that interests me the most and which is the twilight zone between reality and fantasy. My aim is to record a scene where there is a mixture of direct information and enigmas and in which there are visual contrasts between young and old, large and small, normal and abnormal. My playground lies between the private and the public, between fiction and documentary. For me, the image is just the tip of the iceberg; it’s the gate to a story waiting to be told and which I try to depict in an appealing yet troubling way.”</p>
<p>As far as I can tell there is no direct connection that has been established between this &quot;artist&quot; and Rachel but Q anon has suggested that there is one. </p>

<p>Another person who has come up many times in this series is notorious spirit cooker, Marina Abramovic. She has also been featured in the magazine many times:</p>

<p>One of her weird events: <a href="http://manonparent.com/centerpiece-marina-abramovic/">http://manonparent.com/centerpiece-marina-abramovic/</a></p>

<p>Since there are so many pictures to post I will do it all in the comment section. I definitely feel like this is a very important segment. I encourage you to read and share this information. This magazine needs to be seriously investigated and should probably be shut down. Some of these images we have seen before in segment about other individuals and as you will tell, there will be a lot of people involved here that you will recognize if you have been following my posts about this. Since this might take a while I will try to post as much as I can now but it might take me some time to finish it.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and as always, I do not condone harassment of these people. However if you want to help out with this investigation and find others who you believe are connected and do something similar that would be helpful.</p>',

           I feel uncomfortable taking a screenshot of that but you can click on that link and watch the video.
          </p>
          <p>
           Next bit I found is of "the King of Creeps" Kim Fowley, who was featured heavily in the documentary I posted about on Friday:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Here she is talking about "Watersports", that is urinating on your partner:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Presumably in this video the guy is urinating on her but fortunately it seems not to work.

           This one is just creepy. A guy is yelling at these two girls as they make out. He ends the video by saying "What if there is no next time? What if there is no tomorrow?"

           The editor is Olivier Zahm who we will learn more about during this segment. He has a reputation for being a sleazebag but apparently, as Rachel Chandler explains "he just really loves women, more than anyone else I know".. so it's ok! Much like Terry Richardson, a frequent contributor to the magazine has been accused multiple times of inappropriate behavior and exploiting young models for sex with a promise of fame.

           I first heard about Terry Richardson because Miley Cyrus was endorsing him heavily and modelling for him in some weird nude pictures. He also did the video for her for "Wrecking Ball" which I'm sure many of you will remember. He has also directed a video for Lady Gaga. He has appeared multiple times in connection with these people and is surely a part of Rachel Chandler's circle. Here is a news article detailing his disturbing behaviour and explores a multitude of allegations against him:

           If you look up Michel Chelbin you will find extremely disturbing photographs. Here is her explanation for her work:
          </p>
          <p>
           “My images are vehicles to address universal themes: family issues, ideas of normality, puberty with its all incumbent pains and distractions, the desire for fame. An example of this is the adolescent girls I photograph, many of them are on the verge of sexual consciousness. They are in this difficult age, torn between innocence and experience. While their bodies might be still that of a child, their gaze sometimes imply differently. I try to create an informal scene, in which they directly confront the viewer. I feel they and their stories represent with most clarity the theme that interests me the most and which is the twilight zone between reality and fantasy. My aim is to record a scene where there is a mixture of direct information and enigmas and in which there are visual contrasts between young and old, large and small, normal and abnormal. My playground lies between the private and the public, between fiction and documentary. For me, the image is just the tip of the iceberg; it’s the gate to a story waiting to be told and which I try to depict in an appealing yet troubling way.”
          </p>
          <p>
           As far as I can tell there is no direct connection that has been established between this "artist" and Rachel but Q anon has suggested that there is one.

           Another person who has come up many times in this series is notorious spirit cooker, Marina Abramovic. She has also been featured in the magazine many times:

           Since there are so many pictures to post I will do it all in the comment section. I definitely feel like this is a very important segment. I encourage you to read and share this information. This magazine needs to be seriously investigated and should probably be shut down. Some of these images we have seen before in segment about other individuals and as you will tell, there will be a lot of people involved here that you will recognize if you have been following my posts about this. Since this might take a while I will try to post as much as I can now but it might take me some time to finish it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thank you for reading and as always, I do not condone harassment of these people. However if you want to help out with this investigation and find others who you believe are connected and do something similar that would be helpful.

            - A notorious French Marxist with a lot of elite connection who seems generally hated by most. Apparently took part in toppling Gaddafi in that terrible bombing campaign that put the country in complete turmoil. Here is an interesting article called "Why does everyone hate Bernard Henri Levy?"

            - In it the interviewer states he was "dating" Daphne Guinness who is Tom Guinness sister. This would put him in Rachel Chandlers family. This could potentially be big. Wikipedia actually says he has been married to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arielle_Dombasle">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arielle_Dombasle
            </a>
            Arielle Dombasle who is in this picture with him but they may have split temporarily. It is weird he is showing up with his wife to these circles if he was "dating" Daphne but who knows with these people?

            - Licking an apple. Of course the apple is often used to symbolize the forbidden fruit. Now what would a "forbidden fruit" represent to these people?

            - Look familiar? If you are a diligent pizzagate researcher I'm sure you know this one. Of course there can only be one artist sick enough to commemorate a Jeffrey Dahmer in this grotesque manner. Which means that there could only be one artwork like this. Only one person could be perverted enough to put this up in his house. Of course I am talking about Tony Podesta and this is indeed the same piece as he grinningly exhibited in his house to a confused reporter of the Wall Street Journal:
            <a href="https://archive.li/fHtA8">
             https://archive.li/fHtA8
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the Louise Bourgeois art piece:
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, according to this article Podesta spent over 300.000 dollars on art and wrote it off as "business expenses" and his "passion for art" led to a divorce. Well... I'm going to guess that the type of "art" in question had something to do with it. It also speaks about his appearance in a red suit wearing "red shoes".
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that this artwork was on display in 2018 means that Podesta must have given it back, at least temporarily for the exhibit since the pictures from his house are older.
