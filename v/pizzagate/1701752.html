            Ill say it again sam. I'll just consign myself to having to do battle with you each and every time you show up. I've done nothing wrong and am not a shill, my threads speak for themselves, and you do not care to refute the material I write about you have made me your target, regardless if I try to talk logically about what actually happened on that thread. We both know  you attached yourself to me then. You did not come from some mysterious place on the internet or anonymous as a freedom fighter for the cause. You have latched on to an ordinary guy who see's the world as I have described. I have no Intel employ and your premise for this attack is all wrong. If you were serious about change you would not target me because their are many other big fish out there that are really shilling for the cult. You and I, we have to squash this. I want to talk amicably about this, correct your misconceptions about me, figure out what it is that pissed you off so  virulently and so I can apologize. If you won't or can't give me that chance then I will assume, and the rest of the forums we visit together will assume as well, that you are simply incapable of doing so and have other motivations behind this trolling. Anyone with an intellect would help me understand where my premise is wrong in the material. But your premise rests on the idea of 'socking' to make myself look good. And no matter what I say about how it REALLY went down you are HELL BENT on making it look like that's the ultimate proof I'm a shill. Its the weakest argument anyone's ever heard AND YOU ARE PUTTING IN A TON OF EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THAT. Honey, that's not freedom fighting that's mental illness. Others can see it, its disturbing that you can't. NO ONE, in my 20 years of knowing and researching this 'thing' we live in, has ever gone to such lengths to convince others Im deceiving them, when by simply reading the material, and knowing something about conspiracy, anyone can tell that that's really how it has been going down. If you think you know better then please enlighten me. But until you are able to do that there's only two other reasons your so persistent, your getting paid or your batshit crazy. The latter is why  I'm so persistent, I kind of have a love/hate going on trying to understand the what, why, who and where of you. Keep following though, we will have a fun ride, you might learn something, but rest assured, I'm not as embarrassed about socking as you think I am and someday, in one of our forums, I will make an example out of you.

            Who's over the top?  Your not fooling anyone.  People can see by from the material in my threads I'm for pizzagate and not trying to manipulate opinion and have been quite engaging in this forum,  whereas there is zero contribution from you.  And I know your against pizzagate because you would not have followed me from lop to here if you weren't.  You would have already had an account.  People see your charade it's quite sad that you think it has any effect on the work in general or anyone here.  Keep shilling bud,  we'll getter ironed out eventually.

            Hee hee, says the shill who attached themselves to me from my pizzagate thread on lop.
           </p>
           <p>
            WARNING: This shill is a troll that is in opposition and AGAINST Pizzagate who created this profile here ONLY to harass me. Sound like a friend to you folks? See any contributions? This one also claims to be in Anonymous, wonder what a real hacker would think about this claim considering  I'm a proponent FOR pizzagate.

            ASolo,thank you so much for posting this here on Voat.And I love to hear Cathy O Brian again and what she personally has to say when it does come to "Pizzagate" and John and Tony Podesta and their buddies.Surely she knows a lot to say about Hillary Rodham Clinton and it will be no good.I am glad Cathy has found the freedom and can say what was done to her.Very courages woman she is.

            Hey everyone, go to YouTube and search "Elisa E MK Ultra" she has an AMAZING story to tell 100% truth. They are still trying to control her brain now remotely she talks in great detail about everything. It's well worth listening to her she is a great speaker. Her website is life beyond MK Ultra and she has written two books.

            Although Cathy chooses her words wisely and does not speak personally about Pizzagate she does provide the requisite implication that what we are witnessing is indeed very, very big in scope.

            Speaking of gratuitous plugs, a bit of a shocker, James Franco's new film
            <em>
             The Institute
            </em>
            is a MUST SEE if you are curious about very early end of the 19nth century elite satanic secret societies embedded within institutes of mental health and the bourgeoning of the occult inculcation of multiple personalities or what 1920's eugenenics scientists and later nazi scientists would call MK-ULTRA.
