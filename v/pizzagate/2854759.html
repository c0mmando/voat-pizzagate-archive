This was done &quot;with no advance warning to the boys or their parents&quot;.</p>
<p>I wanted to see who was behind this and found the following:</p>
<p>I looked a bit into this and it seems the person publicly responsible for this is Jackie Jackson-Dean.</p>
<p>From what it looks like she\'s a white (non-jewish?) SJW from Ohio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackie currently works as a School Psychologist in Florida, where she also serves as an LGBTQ Liaison.  She has lived and worked in Florida for over 10 years.  Prior to moving to Florida, Jackie worked as a School Psychologist in Ohio.  She attended The Ohio State University, earning both her bachelor\'s degree (in Special Education) and master\'s degree (in School Psychology) from OSU.  Additionally, she holds a master\'s degree in Mental Health Counseling and is a Registered Mental Health Counselor Intern in the state of Florida.  Jackie\'s professional areas of interest include trauma-informed care, working with individuals with disabilities, the impact of poverty, crisis response &amp; intervention, and affirmative LGBTQ therapy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So far, nothing seems suspicious about her, just an idiotic do-gooder SJW.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackie has been an ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community for most of her career.  In 2010, she was selected to attend the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) Safe Schools Advocacy Summit in Washington, D.C.  While in D.C., Jackie had the opportunity to expand her knowledge of the Safe Schools Improvement Act legislation and lobbied on Capitol Hill for its sponsorship and passage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) is what\'s pushing the political platform. So that\'s where the money is coming from, let\'s follow the money...</p>
<p>Who runs that? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Jennings">Kevin Jennings</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kevin Brett Jennings (born May 8, 1963) is an American educator, author, and administrator. He was the assistant deputy secretary for the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools at the U.S. Department of Education from 2009 to 2011. He is currently president of the Tenement Museum.</p>
<p>Jennings holds degrees from Harvard University, Columbia University\'s Teachers College, and the Stern School of Business at New York University. He became a teacher and was named one of fifty &quot;Terrific Teachers Making a Difference&quot; by the Edward Calesa Foundation; he also came out as gay to his students <strong>In 1990 he founded the Gay and Lesbian Independent School Teachers Education Network (later changed to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network),</strong> which seeks to end discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 1992 he was named co-chair of the Education Committee of the Governor\'s Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth in Massachusetts. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So he\'s a fag who was the son of a Southern Baptist pastor. Now he\'s doing all of this &quot;I\'ve come out&quot; bullshit. I put 100 bucks he\'s one of these gays who was sexually abused by a man as a little boy. </p>
<p>Now here comes the important part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jennings is currently president of the Tenement Museum following a five-year stint as executive director of the Arcus Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the Arcus Foundation?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcus_Foundation">Arcus Foundation</a> is a charitable foundation focused on issues related to LGBT rights, social justice and conservation. The foundation\'s stated mission is &quot;to ensure that LGBT people ... thrive in a world where social and environmental justice are a reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arcus got an endowment of <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2016/383/332/2016-383332791-0e5e23fa-F.pdf">$168,714,924 in 2016</a>. Hmmm.... who runs this thing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arcus Foundation was founded in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 2000 by Jon Stryker, a U.S. architect, philanthropist, social and environmental activist, billionaire stockholder... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa... a <strong>billionaire stockholder</strong>? </p>
<p>and heir to the <a href="https://www.stryker.com/us/en/about/corporate-responsibility/strykers-allies-for-equality-safe.html">Stryker Corporation medical supply company fortune</a>.</p>
<p>He is gay and lives with <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/uZryvVj.jpg">a guy</a> and has children. Might be worth looking into this guy. He\'s in high places and has a lot of money and connections. I think he\'s definitely an importnat node in the network.</p>
<p>In addition, he\'s a rich fag whose company can only profit from butchering up mentally-ill people to be &quot;another gender&quot;. Another reason for him in particular to promote and fund transgenderism.</p>

            Jewish woman often have hyphenated names, and Jewish people often like alliteration in their names.

            There's an example of both those things. Note that she is also a psychologist, a Jewish founded and dominated industry.

            I note that Alice Cooper was given that background, "Son of Christian Parents", and in an interview, his concert promoter boasted that in fact it wasn't true, but Cooper was given that background to appeal to his target audience. His target audience being Christian. Initially Cooper was hated, a no talent degenerate whose albumn cover was overtly pedophilic (very recently scrubbed from the net as he has had a recent image makeover, no doubt to make a secular saint of a deep state asset as he retires).  I note that Katy Perry's Dad was the main distributor of LSD for the CIA in the 1960's (as reported in David McGowan's excellent book on the Hippie / music /hollywood scene of the 60's - Wierd Scenes Inside the Canyon: The Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream). Katy went to an elite school that has turned out some famous military leaders, athletes, politicians and entertainment stars. When she moved from being a wholesome entertainment role model to what she is now, taking her young audience with her, her CIA parents became CIA approved "Evangelists", and of course now are shocked "Christians". Perry went on to briefly marry MI5 agent of influence (in my opinion) Russell Brand.
           </p>
           <p>
            So when someone is from a "Christian" family, and start doing stuff like that, OFTEN, it is a cover story, to better disarm a targeted group. Axle Rose also claims to be an apostate raised by fundamentalist Christian parents, as does the gay band Kings of Leon. How much of that is just establishment propaganda? I would say most if not all of those stories.

            Pedophilia is a dark, depressing and very emotional subject so I understand why so many people have such anger in their hearts when speaking about it, but this post is absolutely unacceptable and I am surprised the voat community has allowed it to rise in popularity at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The title of this post alone was enough to give me the suspicion that this was a propaganda piece, but the comment
            <strong>
             "So he's a fag who was the son of a Southern Baptist pastor,"
            </strong>
            was all I needed to prove my suspicions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Statements like that should be a red flag to any critical thinker and certainly do not belong on this website (or anywhere, really.)
           </p>
           <p>
            We are here for FACTS. Not prejudiced, biased opinions based off fear and hatred.
           </p>
           <p>
            The rising in popularity of the whole "LGBT is causing/promoting pedophilia" topic is a clear example of the power of rhetoric and propaganda utilizing the emotional responses of the enraged public to distort the truth and push a separate agenda in order to take the public focus off REAL ISSUES.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to help expose pedophilia and protect children, great. But that isn't what OP is doing, they are just pushing their homophobic agenda on all the readers, and to be honest, it is pathetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who reacts negatively to my comment should also be closely scrutinized as a potential propagandist because why would any critical thinking human being capable of deductive reasoning disagree with the approach of unbiased and professional journalism unless they were just here to spread hate or propaganda themselves?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             If you value truth more than personal prejudices and biases, downvote this embarassing post so potential newcomers to voat don't think this is all the community has to offer.

             If you don't see the obvious tie between progressives pushing normalizing faggotry, which harbours the trannies, who have a group who dress up little kids, if you don't see this and can't make this connection. You are a goddamn idiot.
            </p>
            <p>
             In other words, you need to fuck off. It's a known fact that fags claim they were diddled by other fags when they were kids and that one study shows about 40% asked admitted this.

             You better fucking believe it is. Why do fags run around half naked sucking each other off at parades? What other group of people who have parades do this? AND THERE ARE CHILDREN AROUND.

              You can pretend you want to help kids all you want but at the end of the day you're just a violent, hateful person who wants to hurt innocent people for not using their genitals the way you want.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pedophilia is in no way connected to homosexuality and if you can't see that then you're either developmentally challenged or your hate is so strong it has bypassed the logic and reasoning centers of your brain.
             </p>
             <p>
              Good luck in your life, I feel sorry for anyone who crosses your path because one day if you haven't already, you will probably commit a violent hate crime and end up in prison. That's where people who talk like you often end up.

                Aww how cute the lil baby is throwing a temper tantrum now. Typical of bullies like you: always have something violent to say but when it comes time to defend themselves they have no wit or tact whatsoever because they are uneducated parasites that do nothing more than hinder our growth as a human society.

                But then again you don't think gays are human do you? Who am I kidding you probably ritual sacrifice children who display homosexual tendencies and drink their blood lmao, that's just the kind of person you are.

            I'm planning to do a post on this but I think you need to look at this re rainbow symbology.  The video may start off a bit dryly because he's going through some text in a book but watch it through to the end. It's very interesting:

              Google The Seven Noahide Laws, I'm not going to point to any more videos on that.  I do also think now that Christine Lagarde of the IMF was referring to that when she did that famously weird numerology speech about the 'magic 7' :

              Holy shit.  Why didn't I save those videos.  That's a clear sign that this voat subverse is being closely monitored. Those two videos were from different channels so someone took note

               Wow that's nuts. That was in a matter of minutes. If they were from different channels then it was most likely someone who read your comment here before I did.

            They host private events, they are located in NYC.

           <p>
            Or rather, they host an event every Thursday night at the museum, and other parties can purchase other time slots. From the 2-part Rothstein interview (
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rothstein+interview+sarah">
             https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rothstein+interview+sarah
            </a>
            ), I would initially be suspicious of what events people host there. Anyway, just thought someone smarter than me might be able to find something.

              Even the White Nationalist crowd LOATHE the “White Sharia” group (heavily active on Daily Stormer and TRS). Refer to White Sharia followers as “vile psychopaths who ALL need to be hunted down and impaled Vlad the Impailer Style” for their views that women need to be locked in dungeons and raped.

                That doesn't make it a bad meme.  White Sharia literally built this country.  The Puritan founding stock went from a few hundred to 700k in a few generations.  It is exactly what we need.

                  holy shit how ignorant could you be about our European history?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  we controlled our women WAY MORE than the muslims. they couldn't own property, start a business, or do anything without their male guardian's signed approval.  They had to pay a dowry to the man.  Even the Germanic blood money for a murdered woman was half a man's.  In islam it's FOUR TIMES a man's.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is beyond embarrassing how kiked you white knights are.  I bet your boomer ass thinks "a real man would never hit a woman" and "society is built by women AND men" or some shit.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Women are the entire crux of our existential threat.  We pogromed and expelled kikes periodically precisely until women got "freedom" and influenced public policy.

                    And we've observed a clear and proportional-to-women's-empowerment decline in Jew-awareness and racial solidarity and increase in cuck policies like welfare, immigration, multiculturalism, faggotry, and promiscuity.   Women are the ultimate NPC golem army and if you're even disputing that you are beyond worthless to any movement.

                    There is no such concept as "oppressing women."  It would be like "oppressing" your own kids or farm animals: it would cause YOU problems and reduce YOUR return on the investment of feeding and living with them.

            , per Rule 1, we need a clear statement about how you think this is related to the abuse of kids by the global elite. You need to lay out the evidence for a connection between the push for transgenderism and pizzagate. I agree with your hunch that this guy might be an "important node in the network", but that's not enough by itself for
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            . It's more suitable for
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, we need a link per Rule 2 to support your statement that his "company can only profit from butchering up mentally-ill people to be "another gender". I saw no evidence of that presented.

             is a propagandist so naturally, they think all the evidence anyone needs to know someone is a pedophile is that they are homosexual, transexual, black, mexican, chinese...you get the picture.

             Need Proof?
            </p>
            <p>
             Just read their top posts from their profile: "nigger" this, "fag" that, this guy is a propagandist on here to do nothing more than push their hatred of homosexuals, transexuals, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not exactly someone who should be allowed such a massive voicepiece on voat and 3 moderated subverses...but what do I know, I've only been on here 3 days and so far this guy is my first impression of voat.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hopefully, the rest of the community here actually posts facts and unbiased information.

             : My suggestion would be that you actually put the headline of the linked article in the OP, like this:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2018/11/14/florida-school-district-gags-p-e-teachers-telling-parents-girl-watching-naked-sons/">
              School Punishes Male Teacher For Refusing To Watch A Naked Girl In The Boys’ Locker Room
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             at the top of your post, then add a sentence like:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              'The school (which constitutes an elite entity in our definition of Pizzagate), tried to force a teacher into pedophile behaviour (watching a girl naked), and even punished him when he refused. This is part of pushing pedophile behaviour in schools, in this case in the context and under the pretext of LGBT issues.'
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This should suffice regarding Rule 1. Yes,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Vindicator">
              @Vindicator
             </a>
             ?
            </p>
            <p>
             I will look into the sentence in question that made
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Vindicator">
              @Vindicator
             </a>
             flair the post per Rule 2, and will edit this comment later.

            You like trails, here is the trail that woke me up. Obama attended United Church of Christ, Chicago, IL. Rev. Wright. There children's Sunday school curriculum has lessons in accepting different sexuality aka, gay, trans, etc. The United Church of Christ belongs to a huge left wing Christian organization called National Council of Church's aka United Council of Church's, 45 million members. I began searching because I wanted to know why Obama was so interested in transsexual, and then I found Soros, and started following the money.

             Rev. Wright also heads a group of gays that want anonymity due to their public lives.
