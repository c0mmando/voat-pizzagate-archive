You\'re probably thinking that\'s insane and impossible, but these are elite connected to the occult who know much more about consciousness and psychic abilities. They practice ritual magic and Hillary has been known to talk to spirits. Remote viewing has been conducted by the CIA to spy on various locations throughout the world, but it can be used to spy on people. Max Spiers alleged that he was able to travel anywhere by remote viewing, talked about government pedophilia, and was also killed. A friend of Tory\'s (Galactic Connection) also did interviews with him on pizzagate type scandals, and alleged his bowel movements/urine were black during the end of his life.

<p><strong>Tory alleged 6 children were gang raped and murdered in the basement of the White House Friday the 18th.

            I thought remote viewing was being there in the place and seeing. a gift to see where no one can see.  wasnt till last year when I was on a remote view thread and talked about it. I thought remote view was then a program to teach people to be clairvoyant and then watching remote views who draw what they vision. 
few months ago I thought I would remote view an a site that asked a question, yes I wasnt sure no one responded to my post but months later I my remote view was real . 
sorry I am going off topic here. I remote view with the images I see so I draw them on paper . My remote was about the south pole and the images I gave would of been nice if just one responded but no but i was happy to see my view months later on many sites the vision I saw. so it comes back now to climate change how.. well a remote viewer is only trained to see what they want them to see, which means it is already in the works the government works. As a clairvoyant remote view is a story told not a vision of the future. 
sorry I didnt know where to post .... 10 to 8.. use these numbers when searching on wiki also time counts and royals all royals not just english demark and middle east

             I said much of this is alleged, but two people dying very similarly way before their time, speaking out against the same pedophiles. Lots of coincidences. Also, they both claimed to have been drained supernaturally by dark entities that feed off our energy. Kind of like, Harry Potter dementors. I'll edit as I go along and gather more research.

              I wasn't going to comment but wanted to offer some personal experience... I'm non religious and pretty level headed. My entire life I've been able to sense weird vibes from some places. One of the last ones was the worst. It was an old antique mall in a run down part of town. I felt the"drain" feeling at the entrance of the store and as I got near the back it was so intense that I dropped what I'd come for (a very specific gift I'd hunted for a while) and left my husband without a word. For days I was drained. No black stuff coming from me but I just wanted to chime in that this gave me chills reading as I hadn't heard of anyone else sensing draining energies before and just thought I was really weird. I've never seen anything like ghosts or demons. I really have a hard time reconciling these experiences with my non belief in the supernatural.

            Yep. It's a weird fucked up world we live in, but truth is coming to light everyday.
