<p>Yesterday I got a new follower: <a href="https://voat.co/user/FreedomArrows">@FreedomArrows</a>. I dug in and discovered it was an NGO call the Freedom Arrows Foundation <a href="http://www.freedomarrows.org/">http://www.freedomarrows.org/</a>. Their home page tells us &quot;Arrows Foundation fights human trafficking at the source by utilizing and empowering local organizations worldwide. Through the help provided by Arrows Foundation, stronger local organizations around the world are built. In short, Arrows Foundation is building a unique network to abolish slavery unlike any other on earth seen to this date. We firmly believe the free market is the answer and refuse to work with government, but expose their involvement instead.&quot;</p>
<p>It was founded by Tony Stiles <a href="http://www.tonystiles.com/">http://www.tonystiles.com/</a>. His bio says: 
&quot;Having played a role in the successful start of over twenty businesses worldwide, this young venture capitalist retired from the business world at thirty-four and has now turned his focus to giving back through his charity work, speaking tours, activism, writing and media commentary.&quot;</p>
<p>This could be totally legit, but the website seems oddly primitive and has no images except one of some really stressed out looking 3rd World very young children. And the sentence &quot;We firmly believe the free market is the answer and refuse to work with government&quot; gives me pause.</p>
<p>They describe their approach to &quot;rescuing&quot; victims here: <a href="http://www.freedomarrows.org/what-we-do">http://www.freedomarrows.org/what-we-do</a> Here it is:</p>
<p><strong>RESCUE</strong>:
&quot;Arrows Foundation works with individuals and groups outside of government to **recover captives through what Malcolm X called a “by any means necessary” (BAMN) **approach. While the tact of Dr. King and Gandhi of non-violent protest work the majority of the time, the principles of non-aggression should not be mistaken for full-on passivism. Self-defense is not aggression and often means the defense of others who cannot defend themselves. Because politics and government bureaucracy mostly determine the way law enforcement conduct a rescue, it can take years for them to build the case; leaving innocent lives to be ruined waiting for red tape before law enforcement will even contemplate making rescue plans. Government wants to show numbers and pat themselves on the back while people are being raped and tortured. Their priorities have been compromised. As we have already discussed, law does not equate to justice. <strong>Arrows Foundation chooses to keep life a priority and by extension not to work with governments in rescue projects when at all possible</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>They seem to be really pushing the fact that they operate outside the government, and are dedicated to rescuing victims by any means possible yet there is virtually no explanation of what then happens to the victims. I can\'t help but feel that this website seems set up to attract pedophiles. BTW, searching \'Arrows Foundation\', \'Freedom Arrows Foundation or \'Tony Stiles\' in Wikipedia turns up zero results. They list &quot;friends&quot; they work with on their homepage who might be worth also investigating.</p>',
