            Don't listen to anyone that says not to attend or is discourging attending.  To me that is the other side ,shills or whomever.  That simple.  We are grown ups aware of the possibilities that might arise.  False flag would back fire .  You all do what you feel you need to do.  I've never seen anyone go so far out of their way to discourage attendance.  Kids are suffering now.  This site has shadow ban me multiple times for telling the truth.  I know who dis and owns this vote and every time I bring it up I can't log on and my posts are taken down.  So it's ok not to listen to them they are the enemy and propedos.  Swedish Muslim running this site and censors the shit out of it.  Last time I was banned it was coming from Morocco time.  Heavy Islamic area time zone region.

            <strong>
             YOU ASK:
            </strong>
            <em>
             Do you think that the mainstream media will go ahead and report honestly on this?
            </em>
            <strong>
             ANSWER:
            </strong>
            Of course not. They’ll portray this in the same negative light that they portray ALL NEWS that doesn’t fit the progressive agenda.
            <strong>
             I ASK YOU:
            </strong>
            Do you think the mainstream media is
            <strong>
             gaining credibility
            </strong>
            these days? Do you ever read the
            <strong>
             TRUTH
            </strong>
            in the
            <strong>
             user comments
            </strong>
            on social media, and all over mainstream media’s own web pages? Are you aware of the growing public
            <strong>
             DISDAIN and MOCKERY
            </strong>
            of mainstream media, due to MSM’s lame and easily debunked
            <strong>
             FALSE REPORTING
            </strong>
            , and the reverse effect of their constant cries of “fake news,” and MSM's UNPRECEDENTED BEHAVIOR of
            <strong>
             LITERALLY CRYING TEARS
            </strong>
            on national "news," over EVERY SINGLE WORD that doesn’t fit the progressive future they believed they had already won, thanks to their failed hero MSM journalists, who got the 2016 election COMPLETELY WRONG?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             YOU ASK:
            </strong>
            <em>
             Do you think you’re going to be able to reach anybody else that might not be awake to this subject matter, through the mainstream media?
            </em>
            <strong>
             ANSWER:
            </strong>
            YES.
            <strong>
             Every attempt by MSM, to SUPPRESS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE of human rights violations will be brought to light, and documented - taking such things out of the tired old “conspiracy theory” box, and mainstreaming them into legitimate dinner table discussions.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             YOU CLAIM, WITH CONFIDENCE:
            </strong>
            <em>
             The people that understand that the mainstream media is garbage propaganda, well, they’re already awake, they’re already aware.
            </em>
            <strong>
             WRONG
            </strong>
            - some of my closest relatives are NOT YET completely awake or aware. People are far more likely to BELIEVE what they SEE with their own eyes, and HEAR with their own ears, and every bit of garbage propaganda served up by the MSM will serve as another
            <strong>
             PRIMARY SOURCE
            </strong>
            of controlled opposition to TRUTH, and to pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             YOU SUGGEST:
            </strong>
            that pizzagate protesters are
            <strong>
             unwittingly
            </strong>
            placing themselves in an EXTREMELY DANGEROUS situation, to the point of likening them to the VICTIMS of serial killer/cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer, VICTIMS of Islamic terrorist executioners, and
            <em>
             jumping into a lion pit AT THE ZOO
            </em>
            (you couldn't have been more literal than THAT obvious swipe at pizzagate believers), wearing a suit of steak.” These suggestions are RIDICULOUSLY EXTREME. You make sweeping assumptions that EVERYONE who supports this protest is utterly gullible, that ALL people in government and LE are hopelessly corrupt and complicit.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             YOU USE FAKE PHOTOSHOPPED IMAGES
            </strong>
            that serve to propagate the absolute WORST OF THE
            <strong>
             FALSE MESSAGING
            </strong>
            used
            <strong>
             AGAINST
            </strong>
            pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             DO HUMANITY A FAVOR.
            </strong>
            OUT your
            <em>
             mole,
            </em>
            <em>
             the shill in the midst,
            </em>
            you say that you have
            <em>
             on good authority.
            </em>
            You’ll NEVER come up with enough irrefutable evidence, so
            <strong>
             JUST DO IT
            </strong>
            with the circumstantial evidence you have.

              <p>
               Yes, I am aware that the MSM is falling rapidly. Unfortunately we are STILL outnumbered by the sleeping sheep Do a Google search for Pizzagate, and skim every single PG article that you see. There are still millions of people that believe every single word the MSM shoves in our faces. This event will be used for propaganda purposes, if they report on it at all. The only people paying attention to the independent media will be people that are already aware of what is going on in this world.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The MSM reporting on these protests will be the same exact way that they have reported on anything PG related before. They will not report it honesty. They will paint everyone at the marches as crazy right wing conspiracy theorists that are harassing poor Comet Ping Pong. They will stray away from the real story. Again, the only people that will listen to alt-media on this subject are people that are very clearly aware of the situation. Do you think that uncle Jim will flip CNN and see a story of a bunch of whacko dangerous conspiracy theorists and say, "GUYS- WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE!!" ? The answer is no. This is preaching to the choir.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Do you think that the media will allow us to take this subject out of the conspiracy theory box, or do you think they will control the narrative? Do you think they will air interviews with reasonable people providing facts, or do you think they will find the handful of over the top people screaming "FUCK THE NEW WORLD ORDER!" ? We all know how the media behaves, and at least half, if not more, of the people in this country still believe the MSM narrative. Millions of programmed people not only voted for Hillary, but did so with great enthusiasm. They won't suppress the protest, they will twist it to meet their end goal, which is to discredit the entire investigation, and anyone even saying the words Pizzagate or Human Trafficking. I believe they will use the worst of us to deliver the message they want to hear. This is an emotional subject. When people get overly emotional, they say and do stupid things. It will be very easy to manipulate people into saying over the top things for their sound bytes. Just look at some of the responses I am getting. People are haranguing me because I believe that we should exercise caution, and think things out clearly prior to acting. This is not a religion, and has nothing to do with politics, but everyone is responding like I am a part of the trafficking ring. It is ridiculous, disrespectful, and does nothing to further the cause.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               This bothers me. We all believe there is a government wide international trafficking ring. We believe that people in the highest levels of government, public and shadow, are involved. We also have clear evidence that they pay protesters, controlled opposition, overthrow entire governments, perpetrate false flags, and maim, murder, and rape on a regular basis. This same group has UNLIMITED resources. They have the man power, the technological superiority, all of covert and overt law enforcement, all of the alphabet agencies, double agents, undercover agents, and the full support and backing of ultra rich oligarchs and political operatives. Why are people acting like it is so incredibly far fetched that they would use this immense power to take down their opponents, which is US? Why are people acting as if they can just walk around publicly, at the epicenter of evil, and these people will not use it against us? We know they murder, gangstalk, harass, and destroy peoples lives. We know that they are willing to MURDER CHILDREN, yet we shouldn't believe that they will come after us? How many false flags take place on a regular basis? You also did not understand my metaphor. I was not taking a swipe at anyone, and I fully believe that PG i not only real, but WORSE than what we already understand. My metaphor was trying to explain that we are going to protesting, and asking the same people that are implicated in PG, and asking them to do something about it.It is NOT EXTREME. Look around at the world we live in. These people murder MILLIONS of people worldwide. If they deem us to be enemies, they will treat us as such. And yes, I believe that most people working for the fed are NOT on our side. I don't think people are gullible, I believe they are doing two things; thinking with their emotions, and underestimating the evil controllers and what they are capable of. If Seth Rich were still alive, I am sure he would agree with me. Same goes for Michael Hastings and every other person that has died at their hands.

               The images used in the video are strictly visual aids. Quit assuming that I "don't believe".

             <li>
              <p>
               Like I said in the video, I am not going to slander someone else if I am not sure. I know that a lot of people in the truth community love to throw the term shill around without it being backed up by evidence, but that is not how I operate. Remember David Seaman? Slammed by the MSM AND people in the truth community on the same day. That leads me to question those people more than David. Here is what I can tell you. Ask yourself these questions.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Who are the people organizing the protests? Are they well known? Have they been in this community for a long time? Are they who they say they are? What would the MSM say if they saw their social media? Does anything about these people sound fishy? WHO are these people?
            </p>
            <p>
             In a situation that is this big, this evil, and this corrupt... you had better be careful of who you jump into bed with. Go research some of the people surrounding these protests. If you don't think the powers that be are already planning for counter-measures, then you might want to slow down and look at the situation a bit more.
            </p>
            <p>
             Honestly, I could care less if you or anyone else attends. I already made my concerns known. If you guys want to trash me and call me a shill, go ahead. My thoughts on this are not extreme, they are not far-fetched, and if people would think less with their emotions, and more with logic they might see that I make valid points.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the better strategy would be to keep digging. Educate people on a person to person basis. Reach out to friends and family that work within the government, and try to find the good guys. Share George Webb's work with others. It is well sourced and very hard to refute. Work within your sphere, and the more people that we bring in using this tactic, the more dots that can connect, and the more effective we will be. I just do not see this as being an effective route. We are currently witnessing a governmental "civil war." We need to find the people that are on OUR SIDE, and get them into the fold.

            <p>
             I hope I am wrong, I hope it goes off without a hitch and everyone stays safe.I hope that it brings some positive attention to PG. I fully believe that at the least, this event will be used against us. The media will use this to push people even further from the truth, if they cover it at all. I will be back after both of these events, and we can compare notes, and see what the results are.

              You would probably get a far more positive overall response if you didn't come across as annoyingly condescending and arrogant. Nobody is 100% correct or 100% wrong here. The collective

               This is an emotional subject. When people get overly emotional, they say and do stupid things.

               not trust anyone

               You are right, I do care. I care about individuals, children, and humanity. I care about this topic quite a bit. I do not want to see people needlessly putting themselves and others in harms way. It is a massive risk, for very little return, and even a
               <em>
                negative
               </em>
               return. My words are not about me, but I feel as if SOMEONE needs to be questioning all of these protests springing out of nowhere, hosted by relatively unknown people in such a short time span.
              </p>
              <p>
               My Youtube channel has been FLOODED with people calling me a shill and a pedophile, it is disgusting. I have spent the last 20+ years of my life educating those around me, getting people to question 9/11, harping about government surveillance, and getting people to question the left right paradigm. I was under the impression that being individuals that are "awake", we would question our actions, question the motives of others, and to
               <strong>
                know our enemy.
               </strong>
               Strategy is important. If Sun Tzu knew of our plan, he would laugh.
              </p>
              <p>
               If we all believe there is a massive global human trafficking ring, backed up by a massive black budget, being undertaken by some of the most heavily armed and resource rich individuals and organizations, why do we think walking around downtown DC is going to be a safe venture? These people do this stuff for FUN! What lengths do you think they will go to stop the general public from being informed? What will they be willing to do to stop any person or movement from getting in their way? If they deem us a threat, they will treat us as such.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have seen several people discussing agent provocateurs as being Soros paid actors.... they exist...but the people we REALLY need to worry about are the CIA-Dyncorp-FBI scumbags that are operating this ring. They are dangerous murderous criminals that WILL NOT STOP if they think we are a threat. They will kill us, our friends, our relatives, and destroy everything around us.
              </p>
              <p>
               I feel as though everyone is ignoring he grave reality of the situation. I don't think people are thinking this through. If this were a battlefield, we would lose. This is not a fight that we take on the ground. This is a war of information, and all we are doing is feeding them more slanderous headlines. Why is the new hashtag #pedogate? Because the media twisted #pizzagate out from under us. Whoever decided that this event should be marketed using "#PizzaGate" on all of the literature clearly did not think it through. Just that alone is going to get swallowed up like a tasty snack by he media. I suggest revisiting the thread on the front page, "Why Googling Pizzagate is useless."
              </p>
              <p>
               If I sound negative while typing, it is not my intent. I guess I am just taken aback at how the "truth" community has turned into a religion, and anyone that does not follow the popular narrative is assaulted full force. Look at what these people did to Seaman, with zero evidence. There is more infighting than outfighting at this point. It is ridiculous, and this is why we are still under the boot of our oppressors. I never in my life thought that someone would dare call me a pedo, yet it is coming from my people. Sad. I have also been called a "coward" and a "pussy" like I am declining a cigarette in Jr. high school. There is a massive difference between "cowardly" and "calculated."
              </p>
              <p>
               I will stand by my analysis of these protests. No good will come of it. The media is going to control the narrative, and it is potentially very dangerous and ill-advised. If the media does cover it to any extent, it will be used to alienate anyone that is not in the know. Any alt-media coverage will be preaching to the choir. I hope I am wrong, but I don't think so. I am always happy to look at new evidence, and change my stance in light of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               You know what the most ironic part of all of this is? Not only are people protesting TO the very people they are protesting AGAINST, but they are actually purchasing free speech permits in order to be allowed to exercise their constitutional rights, and putting more money into the machines pockets.

            TL;DW... Protests are good at raising awareness. 
The more people that show up will send a clear message that we are United and it's not going away. Most social media is trying to censor people so getting out there and doing this will have a guaranteed effect. 
I suspect the poster is the same guy that is shilling with the Dawson meme.

            A lot of your concerns seem to be around how the media portrays and handles this. Seems to me it would make more sense to protest outside the HQs of media outfits, demanding they start looking at this, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            And protests do have some effect when they have a clear message behind them. Part of the problem is desensitization to protests thanks to those with no clear goal cropping up. Looking at you, blind "fuck Trump" shills. And who's largely to blame? The media. The same assholes who insist on talking about PG to keep talking about how debunked it is. We could find video proof of Podesta and Alefantis eating a baby at CPP and these assholes would still ignore it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, we should keep digging, and we shouldn't just have a couple of rah-rah get together protests, either. We need to start using some of their own tricks against them. Infiltrate their protests to spread our message. Put up flyers showing emails and other evidence. Show up to town halls, city council meetings, etc. and start asking questions at those levels as well, even if all you can do is discuss fighting child trafficking in your area and show what pedo symbols to look out for using the FBI docs.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we don't stand up for these kids, who will? If those who protested for gay rights or civil rights had concluded the state is too strong and the media will just paint us badly, what's the use, etc., we'd still have segregation in this country. Civil rights protesters had to deal with all kinds of violence and BS, and were also being monitored at the time, and yet they kept going. I get that it's easier to watch people now, but we simply cannot keep responding to this by keeping our heads down. They want us to stay quiet and keep us in a little corner, hence how hard they censor this thing. Don't help them this way.

            WE KNOW, about provocateurs. From the simple-minded individual SWJs, to organized/paid opposition, to violent/paid opposition. Video will come from this event, and with that, opportunity to further expose who those boots-on-the-ground people are, and increase public awareness of organized opposition posers.

            WE KNOW, about the certainty of opposition and ridicule from corrupt media (and also from Hollywood). We live that shit daily, and are stronger for it. Their "stranglehold on the masses" will never be broken if we continue to oppose it by only continuing to talk about it on Internet, while allowing the "false reality we LIVE in" to dominate REAL LIFE.
           </p>
           <p>
            WE KNOW, our evidence is circumstantial, and you've made it clear, that you value such evidence, and have been building it yourself. I agree, we need IRREFUTABLE evidence to fully wake up the masses. So, I say, the more we investigate, the better the chances of finding more of it. The more people awakened, the more interest. The more interest, the more evidence produced. The more that the PUBLIC sees REAL PEOPLE on national television, and alternative/social media, the less "conspiratorial" our concerns will appear. I'm probably the last person anyone, even here, would guess to be a dedicated pizzagate follower, or investigator.
            <strong>
             We need to put an end to the imaginings of WHO WE ARE, placed in a box. We come from ALL walks of LIFE.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            WE KNOW, there are people in government, LE, media, private investigators, on and on, who are currently working, and risking their livelihoods, and risking their LIVES, for the good of humanity. Not for OUR cause, or THEIR cause, but for THIS cause. I pray for, and constantly support these people, and continue to perpetuate their work, until they utterly disappoint us.
            <strong>
             WE REMEMBER the brave and good people who have DIED for the cause of ending human trafficking
            </strong>
            ' and will continue their work, with regonition, and with diligence.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             All that said, HERE'S MY QUESTION to you:
            </strong>
            - If you are ineffective at stopping this protest, which you surely will be, do you have any advice for those of us who WILL attend, beyond NOT attending? You have plenty of time to produce another video, with POSITIVE suggestions. For example: How people should handle opposition; messages and topics that should be brought to forefront; messages to be avoided.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have a few weeks to reinforce your message. Please do that, without continuing to assume that we are idiots.

             I gave my advice in the video. Don't trust anyone, don't get into anyone's cars, don't go to anyone's hotel rooms, and don't trust anyone. The feds love setting people up, and this is the perfect opportunity for them to do so, especially if anyone that is a bit more popular/high profile shows up. These people orchestrate MASSIVE false flag events on a regular basis, so a small event like this will be easy for them. Worse case scenario, they create some kind of event, people die, and they blame it on PG investigators. BEST case, the media makes you all look like a bunch of psychos, and regular everyday people never look into anything seriously that revolves around PG. No matter what, the media will spin, and the eyes of the elites will be trained even harder on this community. It is a lose/lose scenario either way. You wouldn't walk in to a Bloods neighborhood screaming "FUCK BLOODS" while wearing blue, and expect nothing to happen. If the goal is to raise awareness, that goal has already failed. The only people that will pay attention to this event will be people that are already aware of what is going on, and the elites themselves. If they perceive you guys as a threat, they will deal with you accordingly ie; Gary Webb, Michael Hastings, Vince Foster, Breitbart,etc. etc.I would be fully supportive of this if I believed it to be a productive event, but it can only hurt the cause. Hopefully I am wrong.

              Public protesting  creates safer inroads. Previously obscure researchers died. We are surpassing the media bs. I do appreciate  your concern.

            The reason is simple. Half of the sick fucks that work in the MSM are involved, or know about the abuse themselves. The MSM defends the elites at all costs, because they are all in the same ruling class. We will not see a single fair story on this. Maybe if it wasn't linked to Pizzagate, and it was just a "Children's March" but it isn't. All of the marches are being advertised with #pizzagate . The media is going to go super hard on this OR they won't report it all, but I doubt that. Just remember what happened to Ben Swann, and anyone else that taked abou PG out in the open. Total character assassination.

            Did you watch the video? So do me a favor, you can disagree with me all you want, that's fine. If the protest goes down the way that I said it will go down, will you come back and apologize for being a dick? Maybe I am wrong, maybe this will go off without a hitch and the media will report fairly on it. Maybe I am right, and the media will twist the narrative to further discredit anything and anyone related to PG. If it does go well, and the media reports fairy and actually raises awareness, I will come back and admit I was wrong. I don't think so though, the elites are not going to just let this go on without interfering in one way or another.

            As long as it is non-violent, the American People have the right to protest.  Though I am sick of protests and generally speak against them, I have never gone to the extent of creating a fifteen minute YouTube video.   What gives?

             Yeah, now think back to how the media reported it. They portrayed that nasty bitch like a hero. Same thing with that other black lady that did 20 years or so in the pen for murdering and sodomizing a guy for a week. We all know the media's games and tricks. How do you think they will report on a PG protest? Will they portray you as heroes, or will they portray you as domestic terrorist conspiracy theorists? We are willing to believe a massive global pedo ring, yet we think the elites will just sit back and watch us protest without controlling it in one way or another.

But obviously we all know this investigation into pizzagate pedogate 
Is being suppressed by all the alphabet agencies because they are all in on it.
You can even question the validity of that assumption but if you think about it, people have been questioned by police with just little evidence of someone doing something illicit. 
Will a protest against the pedo cabal of the shadow state be effective in making something occur that will start a internal investigation by authorities who are not compromised by the deep state? Who knows. Are concerned citizens putting themselves at risk of being harassed by the deep state ? Of course. Is waiting for something to occur that gives credence and validity by a fair and impartial media going to happen by itself or least by the proper agencies ? 
No.

            I am spreading logical thinking. I will be watching the smear campaign and the media propaganda machine swinging into full force to further discredit the investigation.Everyone in attendance will already be aware of what's going on, and the general public will be led to further believe that anyone discussing this topic is a "right wing conspiracy theorist".

            Don't agree at all. Nothing against you OP, thanks for posting. But no I don't agree with this. At some point we'll have to do something else than typing on our keyboards.

            Becki Percy will attend the March 18th event and she will speak! This woman is a sex trafficking survivor and she has so many things to say. People walking around who don't know anything about Pizzagate will hear what she says. They will wonder what this is all about... and there will be people nearby to explain them what Pizzagate is. Honest face to face conversations, this is all good. The deep state a-holes might try something but they will fail.

             Anyone at these should at least have some of the evidence on the ready to help answer questions.
            </p>
            <p>
             And focus on showing evidence. Show them the IG pics, the emails, tell them about Silsby and Epstein and go from there. Don't start with "ritual killings" and "Satanism", work your way to there once they've woken up.

            A "lack of evidence:" is NOT the problem.

            There was PLENTY of evidence 30 years ago when the Franklin Scandal broke.  Nothing happened. (OK, Lawrence King was thrown under the bus -- that happened.)

             REFUTE what I said. Give me a reason why I am wrong. This "shill" nonsense makes me think the people calling other shills are the CTR people. What exactly do you think you will achieve by protesting? Please, enlighten me. Do you think the media will put it all over the news? You think that Grandma and Uncle Jerry will see a fair and reasonable reporting on the protests? NO. I just don't understand how people don't realize how the media will spin this. It will just be another "fake news conspiracy" narrative that will FURTHER derail the investigation.

               I was wrong. You scrolled through all of my videos to try and prove I am a shill? Go through the progression, I have admitted that I was wrong about Trump. At the time, he looked like he was a plant. I went to two Trump rallies, and donated my own hard earned money to the campaign for the first time in my life. That video was a year ago. And guess what, I am still suspicious of Trump. I hope he is the real deal, but there are some shady people in his cabinet, like Steve Mnuchin of Golfman Sachs fame.. But whatever, screaming SHILL SHILL everytime you disagree with someone really fucking helps doesn't it? This is the reason we can't fix this world, because everyone is stuck on their own worldview, and cannot come together to put an end to the controllers reign of terror.

                You like to call people Shill yourselve i see. You even make video's about probably the only man in the world at this time who can change this Evil, calling him a Shill. As you were totally wrong about everything, Yet you say; "I am spreading logical thinking" Man you are so full of shit!

                 Oh, so it never crossed your mind that a man that associated with the Clintons out in the open could possibly be working for the other side? You NEVER questioned it? If that's the case, then you are not thinking at all. People do change their opinions in light of new evidence.

            I really hope people will seriously think about what they are doing. These protests are a bad idea. This will set the investigation back, and will put a target on everyone attending. DO NOT underestimate the evil people we are up against!

              Just think about it is all I have to say. The only people you will get to look in the eyes are the paid "useful idiot" police officers who protect the elites at all costs.
