            Don't overlook this post! This is an excellent resource to refer back to. Excellent insights into the programming techniques and manifestations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that many pgate researchers here want to focus strictly on the trafficking, since these are presecutable offenses. However at some point society will have to confront the satanic/occult practices and programming. Follow the money to prosecute the crimes, but follow the spiritual and the programming to cut the head off of the snake.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is nothing to "watch" so it is better to just let this play in the background.

            You can safely skip the first 8 minutes before the talk actually starts.

            <strong>
             There is a plan to replace much of the world population with mind control slaves!
            </strong>
            It has been happening with buildup since WWII. It happens through many programming avenues, some are CIA cults like Gulen School, Scientology, Church of Satan, and such, others happen through generational avenues. This has always been about control, because the people that can afford to plan such shit really have no control, especially over their own thoughts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently we have seen these cults and their proctors fucking up a lot, some in Turkey, some with Philippines, now with the US elections. Yes it has to do with hubris, mental illness taking over the asylum, and drug and sex addiction to wash out the programming woes -- but mostly it has to do with the age old issue with humanism: Nimrod's arrow never hit anything when shot into the sky. This boils down to more stupid shit people do in their angst called life.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is about bad coping mechanism and fantasy prone personalities. There never was any product to be obtained here, as the shitheads even hijacked the word gnosis. Notice the assets claiming to be Christians on YT still demonize gnosis? Christian gnosticism, like the Cathars is the staunch enemy to these material loving monkeys. But I regress. Below is another proof of this operation to supplant the peopulation with mindless drones...and you will hear how kabbalism was mixed in by the Nazi doctors to do this mind control operation.
Dr. Hammond took great personal risk in presenting this extensive research into ritual abuse being carried out by a system of cults around the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Due to intense threats, Dr. Hammond stopped speaking about this topic shortly after this speech and has remained quiet since. These secretive cults appear to be intent upon gaining as much control over our world as possible through developing an army of Manchurian Candidates which have infiltrated many aspects of government.
           </p>
           <p>
            "When you find the same highly esoteric information in different states from Florida to California and from different countries, you start to get an idea that there's something going on that is very large and very well coordinated. So I have gone from someone not knowing what to think about it all to someone who clearly believes ritual abuse is real... I [have had] concern because of personal threats. I finally decided to hell with them. If they're going to kill me, they're going to kill me. It's time to share more information with therapists." 
-- Prof. D. Corydon Hammond in lecture "Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse"

             Same thing bothers me. Growing up in Hawaii and living in Southeast Asia for 11 years I find they like to high jack aspects of other beliefs like Buddhism, hindu, gnostic, meditation ect. And wrap in a nice new age belief by claiming to have learned by Tibetan masters and becoming an ascended master. After a certain amount of initiations they start introducing darker aspects of occult like lucifer. I always found it extremely deceptive and effective in the west. I have never met a real Buddhist that believes or teaches this. Whenever I read someone like Crowley or read the website of the philosophical society I feel like it's a deception for ppl just looking for genuine enlightenment. I'm starting to think this obsession with ancient Babylon mystic beliefs is just another lie but it's difficult to find the truth. Another subject I came to voat to learn more about these ppl and not sure if I'm searching incorrectly but every time I look up pizzagate as a subverse there are no new items but then do see new postings in  general news section or on gab. Any suggestions?

              True. It's their scheme. They hijack elements from other fields of knowledge as well, e.g. psychotherapy, which is really frustrating because they implement techniques that could genuinely be healing and alienate them for their purposes. This leads to laypersons being either deluded or detached or both which undermines the efforts of all the good people working on a more healthy society. A very perfidious strategy.

               Wow your right this video is the key. The only explanation of the entire picture that I've even seen. This goes so deep. Now I understand the need for bloodlines in secret societies. You have to be born into this or done to starting at 2 years old and the bloodline ensure the continuation. Fucking sick ppl
