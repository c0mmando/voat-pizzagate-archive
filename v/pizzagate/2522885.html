            "You can tell it's real because it looks so fake." That's what Elon Musk says. Of course rockets land backwards. So Jez Wilkins the producer of 'World's Greatest Hoaxes' travelled to Portgual on the very same plane as the McCanns. And so did his wife, Bridget O'Donnell, who was a producer on Crimewatch, the very programme on which the McCanns would so hugely figure! On which Wilkins also worked! And they were also key witnesses woven into the ensuring drama. Wow - who writes this stuff? Oh, right, we do, I forgot.

            And John Podesta's password is 'p@ssword'? Ha, nobody will believe that of a top intelligence agent. What does it say in the manual - ah yes, arrogant, above the law. And then he goes to Portugal with his brother, an amazingly in-your-face pedo (arrogant, above the law), and then they both manage to get ID'd by a member of the public. Way to go for a top intelligence agent (arrogant, above the law.)

            Madeleine, Emilie. What were those names again? Oh yeh, that was Sandy Hook - that was us too. Our humorous anagrams 'me lie' 'made lie'. No wait it's this one too. And Maddie ... 'i'm dead' or 'i am ded' or 'am i ded'. And the children's ages ... what were they? 3, 2, 2. Ah well, that number doesn't mean anything does it? And, anyway, 'There are no coincidences' - oh wait that's the Q bit of the manual. Of course there are coincidences.

            I think the cadaver dogs got it right, and that she was indeed killed.

             No problemo!  I forgot to mention in the previous attempted submission, regarding whether Madeleine died or not, it was the official conclusion of the Portuguese Judicial Police (the PJ) that Madeleine did indeed die in the apartment, based mostly on the sniffer dog alerts.  As to how she died, the PJ concluded in 2008 that there was no evidence to suggest that Madeleine's death was anything other than a tragic accident.  With the passage of time and the sterling work and research of people like Richard Hall and the good folk of the Jill Havern 'Complete Mystery of Madeleine McCann' forum, a much darker picture has emerged.
