<p>In this video a child is shown being kidnapped by a man on a motorcycle.  The lyrics are quite clearly about child trafficking given the context of the video.  It is odd research but may be significant as many of Depeche Mode\'s videos have themes of &quot;master/servant&quot; and other similar themes.  I post it mainly for interest as it managed to make me rewind the video a few times and I don\'t usually do that.</p>
<h1>Edit for clarification and emphasis.</h1>
<p>Actually watching this video and considering the lyrics is quite shocking.</p>

<p>I\'ve got to get to you first
Before they do
<strong>It\'s just a question of time</strong>
<strong>Before they lay their hands on you</strong>
<strong>And make you just like the rest</strong>
I\'ve got to get to you first
It\'s just a question of time
<strong>Well now you\'re only fifteen</strong>
<strong>And you look good</strong>
<strong>I\'ll take you under my wing
Somebody should</strong>
They\'ve persuasive ways
And you\'ll believe what they say
It\'s just a question of time
It\'s running out for you
It won\'t be long until you\'ll do
Exactly what they want you to
I can see them now
Hanging around
To mess you up
To strip you down
<strong>And have their fun
With my little one</strong>
It\'s just a question of time
It\'s running out for you
It won\'t be long until you\'ll do
Exactly what they want you to
Sometimes I don\'t blame them
For wanting you
You look good
And they need something to do
Until I look at you
<strong>And then I condemn them
I know my kind
What goes on in our minds
It\'s just a question of time</strong>
It should be better
It\'s just a question of time
It should be better with you
It\'s just a question of time</p>

             It is peripheral.  Just thought it was interesting and to me relevant from the perspective of psychological factors behind the trafficking.  I interpret the video to be showing a baby being delivered to a household of men.  Then there is a moral dilemma about the fate of the child.
