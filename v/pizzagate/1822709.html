            Any child can be convinced that anything bad is good for them and it is for that reason they need to be protected from devious adults. They are not capable of making intelligent and informed decisions for themselves.

            One of the things missing in all this discussion about is that a young child can hardly begin to understand the lifelong hazards of sexually transmitted disease. Even if they did feel some warmth and closeness to the abuser and want to please them, they don't know the risks.  While adults often ignore the risks they do so with some knowledge of what they are.  Another point these people miss in saying that it's ok if a child gives consent is the mismatch in body and body part size.  An adult woman knows there might be pain in her first sexual encounter.  For a 10 year old the pain may be more as not only will the hymen be torn but the vagina as well.  Likewise the buggering of little boys.  When looking for signs of sexual abuse, kids are examined for tears in their genitals.  Even if they consent to sex the first time it is unlikely they would do so if they knew the pain they were going to have to endure.  I recall an 8 year old in some country, maybe Libya, was married to a 40 year old man.  He had agreed to wait to have sex until her first menses.  He didn't wait, tore open her insides and killed her.  Nature certainly didn't design us to have sex until we were able to procreate.  The desire for sex is to get us to procreate and there would be no reason to feel that desire until the body is mature enough to procreate.  I don't believe any girl who hasn't had her first menses has any real desire for sex and consent would not be about a desire for sex

            I'm adding these links here because I need a place to put them and don't have the time to work out a new thread on the subject of not only how the Kinsey Institute (covered this topic before), but it's related world organizations support the normalization of pedophilia.  I imagine not all the people within the organizations do, but given what we know, there's no doubt the pedos are in there.

            Is there a list if testimonies of people who extol the virtues of the sexual exploitation they experienced as children? From what I have read, young people can be convinced that it's okay when they are immature, and may continue to excuse this behavior as adults, but what we wind up seeing is an eventual breakdown where the victim realizes the extent to which they were abused and exploited. You'd have to seperate that list between adults who are pedophiles, and those who are not.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adults who abused me as a child and teen were always very adamant that it was my fault, but I never accepted it as right, always fighting back in ways that embarrassed them into stopping. Butter knives, when you are strong enough, can really pack a punch!
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, it wasn't until I was older and cared for a lot of children in a daycare, and then as a nanny, that it hit me how full of shit inept and gross my caretakers were. And how, what they did and how they justified it was a huge stack of bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Abusers will characterize children as being "not so innocent" and deserving of abuse. I have yet to run into such children, and therefore conclude that it is evil adults who project this onto children. And the internet provides easy access to other human detritus who create a place where such behavior is normalized. The recent watching of the DaddyoFive Youtube videos where they abuse Cody (the intelligent compassionate kid in the family) really shocked me. These are the kinds of inept people who are not mature enough to be parents or caretakers.
           </p>
           <p>
            We decided, at some point, that children would be taken care of and raised into adulthood away from profiteering and abuse. Where I come from, children became full-fledged human beings with individual rights in the late 60s! Before that, they were considered the property of their father. In absence of a participating father (my grandmother forbade her son from being a dad) they were (I was) taken away from their mother by the Catholic Church and place with "better" people (over 200K children appropriated during this Catholic societal engineering project from 1940-1970).
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we still want to live within this First World standard where children have basic human rights and live free of sexual, religious, economical and physical exploitation by adults?

             Thanks for the info, your inner sense of integrity of self was put to the test at an early age and proved to be solid ground.

             "We decided, at some point, that children would be taken care of and raised into adulthood away from profiteering and abuse. Where I come from, children became full-fledged human beings with individual rights in the late 60s!"

             Now the pedophiles and cultural Marxists have taken those concepts and turned them around...pedophiles want full, free and legal access to kids.  Marxists/Communists such as Shanta Driver have no problem with the idea of manipulating, grooming, trafficking underage teens and use them to create the impression of 'grass roots' movements, when in reality, it's a world wide tyrannical movement which does not care about individuals in the least, beyond their use as media fodder/propaganda.  There is no way up the chain, that the two groups don't merge and overlap.
