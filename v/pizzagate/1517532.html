<blockquote>
<p>&quot;These resolutions are the result of an extraordinary multinational effort to identify, investigate and prosecute a highly complex and long-lasting corruption scheme that resulted in the payment by the defendant companies of close to a billion dollars in bribes to officials at all levels of government in many countries,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Capers. &quot;In an attempt to conceal their crimes, the defendants used the global financial system – including the banking system in the United States – to disguise the source and disbursement of the bribe payments by passing funds through a series of shell companies. The message sent by this prosecution is that the United States, working with its law enforcement partners abroad, will not hesitate to hold responsible those corporations and individuals who seek to enrich themselves through the corruption of the legitimate functions of government, no matter how sophisticated the scheme.&quot;</p>

            Still wondering what powers are so strong that not actual shots are fired against something Pizza related. Sure it's nice to see some action, could be subtle hint, but is really no-one willing to risk his/her neck to actually break this case open? Someone could die as a hero where actual movies will be made of, when she/he spills all of this out. Is it really worth so much more protecting ones one career than to probably save multiple lives of horribly abused children? How could people, who are able to break this case open, be able to live with themselves after that they knowingly obstructed the investigation by keeping their mouth shut just to save their own ass?
