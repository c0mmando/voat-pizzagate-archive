negotiator Jon Biehl. Some nice comments about S from Biehi and Arias. I will forward another note from Hugo Llorens
with similar message. Best, ck

             Biehi called a little after 1:30 pm to say the meeting with the de facto envoys had been abruptly cancelled -- but
for perhaps a positive reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             Micheletti has asked about half the team to return to Tegucigalpa (Corrales stayed, as "he seeks to confirm that
            </p>
            <p>
             he will not lose his visa"). In the phone call he got from the de facto envoys as they headed for the airport,
Biehl said he detected a positive attitude. The envoys seemed confident they would get M to sign the SJ
Accord. The envoys prmoised to call Biehi late this afternoon with the news from Honduras. If, if, if, if, the
            </p>
            <p>
             news is positive, Biehl and OAS Political Director Victor Rico will leave for Tegucigalpa tomorrow morning to
meet Micheletti, make sure this is not another time-wasting tactic, and get something in writing from him that
he agrees to the Accord and will sign it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just before speaking to me, Biehl had spoken with Arias who expressed cautious optimisim that we might have
a break-through. Arias told Biehl to tell us, that if that happens the United States gets the credit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Arias said the US has played the game exactly right, with the appropriate mix of carrots, sticks, toughness,
unified message, even-handedness and, above all, good timing. Arias said the Europeans have been calling him
            </p>
            <p>
             over the past two days, and have fallen into line with the US; the Swedes, as head of the EU, and have told him
that they will take their cue from the US and will support US actions. Arias, Biehi said, was extremely
complimentary of the "great political instincts shown by Secretary Clinton."

             I asked if the chicken sacrificed to Moloch from one of the earlier Wikileaks dumps might actually mean a little boy was sacrificed.

             Someone responded that there was a poster from HRC’s favorite NY pizza place that had a Solstice celebration ad with roasted chickens. Seriously though, what Solstice (witchcraft) pizza party would need to have roasted chickens on the menu? I’ve never once ordered roasted chicken at a pizza place.

             The place is called Roberta’s Pizza:

             I just went and looked at this post some more. There is a poster of Roberta’s pizza place on the post and it has little kids dancing around a maypole with skull heads, and a skull headed child getting a “face painting” of pizza. The poster is for a Summer Solstice celebration but it features these kids around a maypole. This I have realized is a human sacrifice reference. According to this Satanic calendar, the Maypole dance occurs during one of the 8 Sabbaths on April 30. Since this references the maypole dance I am thinking there must be human sacrifice implied. If you look here:

             30 April May night/Maypole dance April 30 Walpurgis night/Beltane: One of the most important nights on the satanic calendar. Blood rituals and human sacrifice take place.

             Someone else asked if anything special is going on on December 28 on the Satanic Calendar. I think it’s part of the Winter Solstice stuff, but it could be in between their Winter Solstice celebrations and the Druid Feast Day.

             December 22 Summer Solstice: Animal and human sacrifices are made. 24 Demon revels: Male and female sacrifice. 25 Yuletide: Celebration of the birth of the sun as a young babe to the great goddess. The satanist’s own birthday is very important. The satanist says: “Every man is a god if he chooses to recognise himself as one”. (LaVey, the satanic bible). Jan 7 – St Winebald day: Blood rituals, dismemberment. Animal/human sacrifice.

Wow. That made me think of that weird art piece that Podesta had. The human/pig with sucklings. I’m not familiar with how to post images. Maybe someone could dig that up?

Also, Cathy O’Brien talks about how from the time she was a baby her father used to substitute his penis for her mother’s nipple. A “suckling pig” meaning a nursing baby could either be some sort of animal sacrifice reference or child sex or child sacrifice reference. Or maybe they like day old tortillas with gelatinous pig meat a whole whole lot, and everyone planned on traveling by train to a metro station, hopping off and walking 10 minutes to eat a gross collagen filled stale tortilla taco and drink a shot, while bringing along all the extra children they could make available.
