Asia Argento’s Boyfriend Anthony Bourdain Bids Farewell to Weinstein: ‘Bye Bye, D*ckhead’</p>
<p>&quot; Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain bid farewell to Harvey Weinstein in an Instagram post on Friday morning, as the disgraced Hollywood producer turned himself in to New York police to face rape charges.</p>
<p>Bourdain’s girlfriend Asia Argento, an Italian actress, was part of the bombshell New Yorker report by Ronan Farrow in which a number of women came forward to accuse the Weinstein of rape and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Since, Argento has been a fiery and outspoken champion of the “Me Too” movement, recently delivering a blistering speech about her rape at the hands of Weinstein at the Cannes film festival.</p>
<p>Weinstein, meanwhile, turned himself in to police in New York City on Friday morning, and was charged with “rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct” in relation to two women, per the NYPD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bourdain bid farewell to Weinstein will an Instagram post of Weinstein turning himself in, quoting an ominous lyric from Snoop Dogg‘s 1993 song “Murder Was The Case.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor…” Bourdain wrote in the caption to the post, quoting Snoop Dogg’s reference to prisoners making shanks out of toothbrushes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“BYE BYE, dickhead,” he added.&quot;</strong></p>

            So funny how the fake news instantly jumps to Suicide! as the only thing worth publishing. This was obviously murder. He knew too many dark secrets about too many powerful people. His death is a warning to all the others. Keep quiet and you will stay alive. Speak up and we will get rid of you very fast.

            Well, You beat me to it.  I was reading the many statements he made about his disgust of HW.  His twitter statement and insults to HC about her statements on HW did not help.  Yes, it started way back then when he also mentioned his gf Asia as well.  You don't harm a hair on the head of the Clintons and HW especially with the upcoming trial.
