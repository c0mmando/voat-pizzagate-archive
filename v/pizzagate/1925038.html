            Really good update.. this is pretty powerful stuff and also encouraging to see such a well organised group that is doing so much and actually going for and arresting members of the Ninth Circle who seem to represent some of the highest ranked satanic fucks on the planet.
This reminds me that a well organised group of private citizens can actually go in and arrest people and collect eviodence and turn them over to authorities and basically force action.
So yes I feel citizen arrests and such protocols can be used if its gone about in the right way.
I feel there are agents on voat who will always shot down any mention of such tactics because I feel this is something the elite really do fear.
They really fear private citizens taking the law into their own hands. I really feel that.

             Why do you say this.. Are you 100% certain the website and all the content is an elaborate disinfo thing to encourage us to think something is been done so that we don't do anything? I mean is that what your suggesting because there needs to be a specific examination of this.. got evidence?

              No, the "tribunal" needs to provide evidence that it is anything more than one man posting elaborate stories on his blog. Is there any proof of anything ITCCS has actually done? Or is he just a man who knows what we want to hear?

               Here you go.. yes it is real.. it is legitimate.
And a bit of searching on the net confirms this. Why this group would need to prove themselves to members of voat is beyond me. It is up to us to do the digging and decide for ourselves.
And i've found enough to show me these people are a real group of people who are also dedicated to the same ends as us.
which makes it important that we learn more about them and also connect with them in our efforts to share information and so on.

And yes I am just pasting from that website, but there are enough links in the quote below to satisfy anyone that this is legit.

               What is The International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State? (ITCCS)
The ITCCS was formed in May of 2010 at a closed meeting of survivors of church and state terror in Dublin, Ireland. The event was initiated by Nobel Prize Nominee Reverend Kevin Annett of Canada and members of Irish survivorsâ groups.
              </p>
              <p>
               The foundational purpose of the ITCCS is to unite survivors of genocide and child torture across borders, and to mount a broad political, spiritual and legal movement to disestablish the Vatican and other churches and governments responsible for historic and ongoing crimes against children and humanity.
              </p>
              <p>
               The original ITCCS federation was composed of groups from Ireland, England, the United States, Canada and Italy, including the Templemore Forgotten Victims (Antrim, Ireland), the Friends and Relatives of the Disappeared (Canada), and United Against Church Terror (USA). By September, 2013, ITCCS had spread to twenty six countries and over fifty affiliated groups. Its work is translated into thirteen languages. Its affiliates include the prestigious cult ritual and abuse survivorsâ organizations SMART of the United States, and Rete LâAbuso in Savona, Italy.
              </p>
              <p>
               The ITCCS operates from an undisclosed central headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, and from regional offices in Vancouver, New York, Dublin, London and Paris. ITCCS officers and their legal and political advisers generally retain their anonymity for reasons of security and safety. However, the General Field Secretary for North America and Western Europe is Kevin Annett. Other officers include Rev. Joshua Lemmens, Steve Finney and Amy Smart of Canada, Dr. George Dufort of Belgium, Rev. Ciaran Ui Niall of Ireland, and Dr. Colia Clark of New York City.
              </p>
              <p>
               In September, 2012, the ITCCS established a legal arm, The International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ), composed of accredited jurists and lawyers from Belgium, England and the United States. in February, 2013, the ICLCJ successfully prosecuted and convicted former Pope Benedict, Joseph Ratzinger, for Crimes against Humanity in Canada, along with Elizabeth Windsor, Queen of England, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and 27 other officials of church and state. (See the link to the court evidence in this case at
               <a href="http://itccs.org">
                http://itccs.org)
               </a>
               ) Pope Benedict and senior Vatican Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone both resigned from their offices soon after being prosecuted in this ICLCJ indictment.

                I never said they needed to prove themselves to members of Voat; but any reputable agency should have evidence of what they've done. Go to any police website or news agency. They will all have links to articles or pictures or videos that are verifiable. ITCCS has a Wordpress "website" with YouTube videos that show, again, no evidence that anything is actually done by them. Sure, there are interviews with people. I can interview people all day; that doesn't mean I'm actually holding some kind of trial.
               </p>
               <p>
                Be very, very careful of the dangers of confirmation bias. I'm not saying ITCCS is NOT real, I'm saying don't buy into it until you have actual, real, tangible evidence that it's is more than some guy posting on his blog and occasionally uploading interviews to YouTube. Do you fully understand who we are dealing with? What the elites will do to throw you off track? Anybody who comes in saying all of these wonderful things that you're dying to hear - but with no real evidence to back it up - should give you some pause.

                 Yes i fully understand what were dealing with.. been dealing with it for a long time..  this guy is no agent or whatever.. im sure of that.. but thats just my opinion.. 
I know his type and hes very driven and determined and has done a lot of work... He does have a bunch of lawyers and others helping him.
From my digging I can see he is a freeman who has gone down the route of we are sovereign beings and we have a right to freedom and we will exercise that right in various ways.
This guy really knows his stuff with regard to common law courts and human rights on an international scale.
He has set up documents and is meticulous in his dealings with authority and so on.
If you know this stuff there is merit in it. It is directly related to such things as standing up for our rights, legal dissolution of fraudulent debt contracts and using the natural common laws of inalienable rights to demand justice via official documentation. 
We need people like this on our side. When you look deep into all of this freeman info.. it has been attacked very heavily and most people have been programmed to stay away from it or have been led to believe there is no future or hope from to be gained from pursuing freeman law and rights.
However the opposite is true. And the freeman movement has been infiltrated and deliberately watered down by splitting and keeping it separate from other groups.
There is a great opportunity here.. for real legal backing to our actions and what we want to achieve.
And I find is sad that practically know one can see this and that members of this group have fallen for the same lies that have kept freeman information technology from expanding into the truth movement. 
Because its all about contract and agreement by deception they way "they" control the masses. And knowledge of how that works can be discovered in the freeman info in general.
The only way it really works is when a large enough group works together to enact these rights. 
The freeman movement was a huge threat to the NWO and it has been kept under wraps and lied about and marginalized pretty successfully.
