            I know mods will move this to pg/whatever, but, thank you for posting, The_Savant, because with everything going on, I missed this.  Everyday this all looks like a D.Balducci novel, instead of real life.  I know we are here to save the innocents, but, the evil has had so many tentacles outstretched for so long, that all these "crumbs" we are aware of, helps with knowing what we are up against.  I try not to get discouraged, and all I can really do is pray, but each day I am glad that this is being brought to light.  And, I do come here to keep aware, so I am glad when these things come up.

             Glad you got something out of it. I think MF might have stopped squeezing the trigger for a little while, and besides, my posts often involve the cover-up of information to the public or misdirection and I think this should be able to stay.

            Down vote. Everything that happens with "muh Russia" is not pizzagate. If we post all these political squabbles as pizzagate related pizzagate will die and nobody will even notice. That belongs in

            . If we keep posting political news pizzagate will look like a CNN and FOX mirror. The Republican party is full of pedos too and they have not flipped over night.
           </p>
           <p>
            Getting involved in these things only helps pedophiles. Nobody carries this pedo train but us and if we stop the discussion dies.

             If you want to see Republicans get taken down, I believe Cernovich is your man to watch. He tweeted out

              I try not to make a distinction between them when it comes to pizzagate because they are both neck deep in it. If we become political cheerleaders we will lose focus and pizzagate will disappear.
