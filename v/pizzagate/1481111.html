            I only looked into any pizza-gate connection to Denmark for some day so not much yet. One thing I found odd was the internet seem to be almost scrubbed about information. I guess this side of Danish history if something we don't want out. However we do know some things. We know it was legal to have CP up til 1980 and we know the name of the danish pedophile organization (had 90+ members in 97) and the name of the person leading it.
           </p>
           <p>
            That actually tells us a lot. We know they organized. The official group disbanded in 2004 and my speculation is they went to the dark web (ToR)
           </p>
           <p>
            So I suggest we start with him and the group. I have been unable to locate Dan Markussen the leader of the group in any social media. (Help would be appreciated) There is supposedly an article from 2004 that exposed this man and there was an undercover 2001 doc who infiltrated the group. I'm looking for them right now.

            I'm also from Denmark. Maybe we could work together to figure out if there is any pizzagate link to Denmark.
