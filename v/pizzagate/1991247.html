            Here's a way to simplify it for absolutely everyone: Does it cause harm? Yes it does. That means it's wrong. Children who are sexually abused have to live with that trauma for the rest of their lives. It's not uncommon for those with PTSD to have terrifying recurrent memories &amp; to be unable to have trusting, calm, healthy relationships.

             Wow, I hope your the real FBI deal because it sounds like you really get what it's like for the abused.  The memories were better left undiscovered, I was just sort of manic back then.  Now I see too much.  (I don't actually regret remembering, it's just been very hard stuff to look at.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Writing down the memories in whatever form satisfies, is the best medicine I ever found, and it's free therapy.  Gods Green Herb is another big help in resisting mind control and it's consequences.  The CIA promotes all drugs for mind control.... except ....WEED.  The Stoners are out of control.  Think about that twice!    And, wear a wrist watch.  (all this is Kathy's 3 advice items and it works, read PTSD)

            There is a woman not far from me, her son (we've all known since he was a baby) was in for several years for CP,, got out a few years ago, now his long-time Puerto Rican girlfriend is having his baby. The woman is thrilled (she can't wait to be a grandmother). hardly anyone thinks this is a problem. 
This guy was a schoolteacher too. The neighborhood (in denial) say, oh, well his problem was looking at pictures, not actually doing anything. I am sick and flabbergasted. These other people have kids and grandkids. People just don't want to believe.

             Hispanic (Catholic) cultures are much affected by pedophilia.  It's thought that children young enough won't remember and it doesn't matter. This was common in America not long ago.  He needs to be confronted by someone and made to consider the consequences for the child and himself.  I've seen Mexico change on a dime about smoking cigarettes and littering.  It's changed enormously in recent years.  There is hope.  This too can change.

             Yep , unfortunately that's the norm because pedos live double lives it seems . And people have always brushed it under the rug because apparently some think it's normal . They have this delusional thinking that we are all bigots because in their sick minds " everyone likes sex with children"  we are just too bigoted to come out! That's BS I say and a cop out for sure . This will never be accepted by God as normal first of all and I choose to obey him rather than men .  Acts 5: 29  In answer Peter and the other apostles said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.

            I bet you could compile a 30 minute reel of these everyday from world news.  I often wonder - what percentage of the US population are pedos? 5%, 10%, 20%?  Does that mean that 1 out of every 10 people I meet on a daily basis is a pedo?
           </p>
           <p>
            If 10%, that means every 10th person that I meet (and am generally civil to), would get a bullet in the head from me if I saw what they were doing 12 hours later? That's pretty fucked up. Seriously, that's fucking sickening to think about.

             From the website
             <strong>
              1in6.org
             </strong>
             One in six males in the US experienced childhood sexual abuse.  For women it's 1 in 4.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some 90-97% of convicted pedophiles report early childhood sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             EDITED: A very small proportion of the abused go on to abuse, perhaps less than 10%, Now we are down to a small faction of the population, for males about 1 in 60 if my math works right.
            </p>
            <p>
             The pedophiles in society, nearly all are hyper-masculine males, (look for that) are actually few in number, but average hundreds of victims each.  The consequences for adults of childhood abuse are numerous.  Addiction, depression, alcoholism, sexual identify confusion, homelessness, suicide, it's a great big part of the mess we are in.
            </p>

              Thanks Blacksmith21. I've been digging your posts for months. The stats are as good as I can find. Jim Hopper of Harvard U. is the main research source behind the 1 in 6 statistic. Much statistical data is available and is compiled on the site.
             </p>
             <p>
              Roughly half our street people were as children abused sexually. Males on the street are largely military vets. Military personnel are being subjected to amazing mind control techniques now. In Viet Nam, the CIA, MIC process wasn't so complete as it is now, there was anti-war resistance. Our vets today are beat up real bad, they been messed with mentally and don't know what happened. Organizing against the meaningless wars they have been sent into seem pointless.
             </p>
             <p>
              No one will listen. Suicide seems the only option. We have 22 vet suicides each day, 7 days a week. This is roughly four times the civilian rate for the same age groups. Heavy combat service or light no combat service, doesn't make a difference in the suicide rate. The training being given today, is trauma enough. They make you like a robot and then don't un-program you on release.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dragging people into the streets, sounds satisfying, but the mob is soon satiated and goes back to sleep. Perhaps the first one grabbed was appropriate, but the next might be a man whose wife is coveted by another. We have a slow judicial process for a reason.  That was learned the hard way many times.

              I'll give you an Upvoat for that honest post.  I have no idea if the stats are true, nor have I seen one shred of evidence which would dispute it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've seen a lot of your mentioned side affects in other people and wonder how many of them were victims?
             </p>
             <p>
              After "the arrests" if/when they come (phase I), would be phase II: deal with the massive mental health (and mass shootings) issues, largely associated with partisan (brainwashed) liberals.
             </p>
             <p>
              Phase III (from my mouth to God's ear) would be to create a "culture" and environment which allowed victims, and maybe even minor perpetrators, to rehabilitate and reintegrate.  I have no patience for recidivism. Maybe - maybe - that could break the cycle.
             </p>
             <p>
              Otherwise, we may be left with dragging people into the streets...

             I can tell you how to find out.. talk to everyone you come across and see what there reaction is to pedogate . I saw a convenient store owner turn 3 colors when I schooled him on pedos.
