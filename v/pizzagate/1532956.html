<p>&quot;When the Spitzer scandal broke out, the first person this author thought to call was retired <strong>New York Police Detective James “Jim” Rothstein. Jim is a legend. As a cop, Jim took on organized pedophile rings</strong>, arrested Watergate burglar and CIA operative Frank Sturgis, and testified before the New York State Select Committee on Crime. Jim knows all about sexual blackmail operations, which he refers to as “human compromise” (Rothstein, no pagination). To Jim, the Spitzer scandal was a perfect example of “human compromise” (ibid). “It’s like déjà vu,” said Rothstein (ibid). And to Rothstein, GOP operative Roger Stone was the key to the compromising of Spitzer (ibid).</p>
<p>&quot;Watch for this guy Stone,” Jim said. “I saw him in an interview about Spitzer a few days ago and thought I recognized him. I looked back at my old investigations and remembered that he was part of Roy Cohn’s whole thing.” (ibid) </p>
<p><strong>Jim was referring to Roy Cohn’s sexual blackmail operation</strong>. According to Jim, this operation was conducted “under the guise of fighting communism” (ibid). During his time as a police detective, Rothstein had an opportunity to sit down with infamous McCarthy committee counsel Roy Cohn (ibid). <strong>Cohn admitted to Rothstein that he was part of a rather elaborate sexual blackmail operation that compromised politicians with child prostitutes (ibid)</strong>. Roger Stone began working with Cohn when he was the northeast chairman of Reagan’s 1980 campaign (Labash, no pagination). Cohn and Stone had began building an alliance a year earlier when Cohn introduced Stone to mobster Fat Tony Salerno at Cohn’s Manhattan townhouse (ibid). According to the Weekly Standard’s Matt Labash, “Stone loved Cohn” (ibid). <strong>Stone said of Cohn: “He didn’t give a [expletive removed] what people thought, as long as he was able to wield power. He worked the gossip columnists in [New York] like an organ” (ibid).</strong></p>
<p>By his own admission, <strong>Stone is the informant that told the FBI about Spitzer’s use of prostitutes from the Emperors Club VIP four months before Spitzer’s resignation (Bone, no pagination)</strong>. Stone’s operations against Spitzer began in June of 2007, when the republican operative was hired for $20,000 a month by Republican state Senate leader Joseph Bruno to rid New York State Republicans of the pesky New York governor (Labash, no pagination). According to Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, top officials of the Spitzer administration had the state police create documents that would make it appear as if Bruno had misused the New York state air fleet (Matthews, no pagination). Spitzer was waging political war on Bruno. Bruno did not like that one bit and was looking for payback.&quot; </p>

            In reality, there are no 'child prostitutes'.  A child does not have the wherewithal to consent. That is why we have laws in place to protect children.  They are children being raped.

            I guarantee that if the NYPD gets on this thing, they will take no prisoners and those guilty parties will go directly to jail. The NYPD does not play, but have they been compromised? That was always the problem. Whether there's someone who won't let them do their thing, I don't know. We'll see when Trump takes over, but if the NYPD is let loose! Watch the pedos scatter!

            I follow Stone and he claims he met up with said Spitzer call girl at a swing event  and chatted her up into her revealing Spitzer.  He's a scamp and hillarious honest.  Maybe, but..
           </p>
           <p>
            Timing:
Elliot Spitzer as top cop/ Attorney General of NY he was going after financial wrong doing. He was set to make a press conference about the financial mortgage derivitives the NEXT day.
           </p>
           <p>
            My guess.  They were ALL using the same NYC call girls.  They had this card before and only played it when he got dangerous.
