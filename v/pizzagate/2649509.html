<p>STUDY: FIRST VACCINE GIVEN TO MOST AMERICAN NEWBORNS CAUSES BRAIN DAMAGE
Hep B vaccine reportedly hurts brain development, cognition
JB Handley | World Mercury Project - JULY 27, 2018</p>
<p>“This study used the same vaccine and a similar time schedule to those used for human infant vaccination in China. Therefore, these findings suggest that there may be similar effects of neonatal HBV vaccination on brain development and behavior in humans.”

            I have studied vaccines after my child was vaccine injured as a result of the birth dose of hep b. What I learned on the history of this particular vaccine is that it was created with the intention of being used for infants who were born to hep b positive mothers to try and prevent the infection spreading to the baby.  Since he pharmaceutical companies are money grubbing whores they decided to just start giving it to all babies, even if that means it will hurt and kill some.

             I asked my child's pediatrician why babies are vaccinated against an STD and the dumbass had the gall to tel me "well I never really looked at it that way"! He also told me that chicken pox vaccination started because parents were missing too much work to stay home with kids who had chicken pox!!!! Terrible reason to vaccinate a child!

All vaccines have risk. Ask to see the vaccine insert to evaluate the risk for your age. The problem is, is the info true?

            We vaccinate newborns because they could get the disease from their mother who may not know yet she has the disease.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mother to child. Pregnant women infected with HBV can pass the virus to their babies during childbirth. However, the newborn can be vaccinated to avoid getting infected in almost all cases. Talk to your doctor about being tested for hepatitis B if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant
            </p>
            <p>
             The younger you are when you get hepatitis B — particularly newborns or children younger than 5 — the higher your risk of the infection becoming chronic. Chronic infection may go undetected for decades until a person becomes seriously ill from liver disease.

             You are right, I wonder if pre-birth screening of mother would catch this problem  so as to get vaccine if needed.

             A 1999 CDC safety -risk assessment found that comparing children who had received the HepB vaccine containing 25 micrograms of mercury on day of birth compared to a control group who did not receive the vaccine, all other vaccines constant, showed a RR of 7. That means the HepB vaccine group was 7 times more likely to have autism than the control group. These findings should have triggered a thorough safety investigation. Instead, it was covered up. The actual report was obtained through FOIA, TEN YEARS LATER.

These deaths occurred in 39,189 crashes involving 59,373 motor vehicles. Since 1992 the Numberber of fatalities has fluctuated within a fairly narrow range, from about 39,000 to more than 43,000, but deaths in 2005 are the highest since 1990.

            Half a dozen sexually transmitted diseases can infect a fetus or newborn baby delivered vaginally. But I assume this happens to a small maybe even a tiny percentage  of mothers  so why a blanket  vaccine for every baby especially when several of the diseases can be cured if and when.the baby does become infected. There should be a mandatory  screening of mothers at the late stage of pregnancy and a risk assessment done  before  any  such vaccination. And the mother's colostrum should be collected following birth and given to the newborn even if she doesnt want to breastfeed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The dangers of harmful substances is one issue. The other is the sheer number of vaccinations imposed upon babies. In real life, no infant or adult  is ever  exposed to all sexually transmitted diseases together with measles,mumps ,chicken pox, small pox, polio, tetanus, diptheria, all varieties of hepatitus and flu, and so on. Once I added up all the shots and boosters and it came to fifty or more innoculations. It makes no.sense to massively challenge the immune system of a  young and rapidly growing human. It doesnt happen in nature so why do it artificially.  In addition to safety issues we need to rethink the timing of these vaccinations and whether multiple vaccines in a single shot should ever be used.  I sympathize with parents today who have to grapple with.these matters.

             Well said. My other concern is that with the huge increase in autism cases, these children will be especially targeted for child trafficking.

             Sexual Abuse of Children with Autism: Factors that Increase Risk and Interfere with Recognition of Abuse
            </p>
            <p>
             "Two main arguments are made with regard to children with autism and risk for sexual abuse. First, some children with autism may be targeted for abuse by sexual offenders who may view them as vulnerable children. Second, when children with autism are sexually abused, they may show this in ways that get ignored or misattributed to autism rather than to possible sexual abuse."

              Children with autism are often more likely to go off with a stranger. Also, they wild tend to not make good historians or witnesses to relay their abuse to parents or authorities

              We have discussed a vaccine / trafficking link on VOAT before.  Are they creating their own "supply?"

            They are given the vaccine for profits, any stupid reason as long as people obey anyone in uniform.  Just as angry at the stupid people who go along with this.

             Agreed. But if pedophilia is such an epidemic as we think (and I believe it is), it also seems like there would in fact be a rise in this and other stds. Unexplained groups of kids with hep b would surely raise red flags!
