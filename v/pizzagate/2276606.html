            I thought it was odd when Harry and Megan said someone set them up but they did not want to say who to protect their privacy.  Really??? First thing I thought of was this was not an introduction but an arranged relationship for some "higher" purpose.  Harry seems fun to have a beer with but not marriage material.  Megan is a lesser known actress and somehow gets speaking gigs at the UN?? hmmmmm

            Girl is such a zombie and Harry isn't much better for going along with this. The two will have a marriage on paper and exist for the tabloids and propaganda.

             Did u notice Harry kept doing the hiding hand Freemason sign in the photos? He typically always does this. He portrays himself as the down to earth good guy but he’s a Freemason and not to mention his rampages with hookers and blow for years. This Megan broad seems odd as I once read about her child, I think it was an 8 yr old daughter and a previous marriage yet no one ever talks about the child anymore. Where is she? Was that false info? So many questions about who Megan really is.

              Yeah, her mind has been messed with big time. She's vacant upstairs. Probably just attends pizza parties. That's her claim to fame. Don't know about the child. I never followed things that closely, but I should have. Damn!
