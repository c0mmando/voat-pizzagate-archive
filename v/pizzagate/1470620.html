            The holidays arent quite here yet, but IMHO I think they are going to be good for pizzagate.  yes there will be some irreconcilable arguments, but generally a good percentage of people are going to take a moment to look at the evidence that is introduced to them by a trusted friend or family member who is not only insistent, but spooked.  There are also more people who are going to just have that extra time to take a look for themselves since it doesn't seem to be dying.  I think in just a few weeks, there are going to be 20% more people who KNOW.
