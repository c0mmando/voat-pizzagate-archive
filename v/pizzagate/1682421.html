<p>Top Chef season 4 finalist, Spike Mendelsohn, owns three restaurants in Washington, DC: We, The Pizza, Good Stuff Eatery, and Bearnaise, which was awarded two stars by the Washington Post. (Whatever the fuck that means.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All three of these companies, Kookoovaya Inc., Sunnyside Group LLC, and Mendelsohn Hospitality Group, respectively, are or were legally represented by <strong>Andrew Kline</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all three restaurants are on the same block and make up most of the block. Wedged between them are a couple of other business, including a nail salon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We, The Pizza\'s logo is a white, five-pointed star on a black circle. Bearnaise\'s logo is heavily stylized lettering that features several spiraling ends. Good Stuff Eatery\'s logo is a cow who\'s face consists of four circles, each pair containing a smaller circle and a much larger circle next to it. There are also three circles on the cow\'s body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GoodStuffEatery.com\'s homepage says in a very large font, &quot;NOT FAR FROM THE FARM,&quot; superimposed over a photo of a small farm. A tagline reads, &quot;IF WE MADE IT ANY FRESHER, YOU\'D PROBABLY BLUSH.&quot; - <a href="http://imgur.com/NeODj1P">http://imgur.com/NeODj1P</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The website advertises an app called the Good Stuff App. The tagline reads, &quot;Bring on the brainfreeze! Order a handspun shake directly from your phone.&quot; Reviews of the app on iTunes indicate that this app is literally only good for ordering shakes. It doesn\'t allow you to order anything else on the menu. The description of the app says, &quot;Want to know more Good Stuff? Find us at Facebook.&quot; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/good-stuff-eatery/id919137867?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/good-stuff-eatery/id919137867?mt=8</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good Stuff Eatery has locations in Capitol Hill, Chicago, Crystal City, Georgetown, Reagan National Airport, and <strong>Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The menu pages are separated according to location. The menu for the Saudi Arabia location is the only menu where the hand-spun shakes, the same ones advertised for quick-ordering via the app, are at the very top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to Spike, three Mendelsohn family members are among the Executive Staff, who total seven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A section labeled &quot;Our Community Involvement&quot; lists The Childrens\' Inn at NIH, Care, The Michael Mosier Foundation, DC.gov, and DC Central Kitchen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good Stuff Eatery has been featured in The New York Times, Business Insider, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Hill, among many, many others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spike Mendelsohn\'s Twitter account has a flyer for a &quot;poke party,&quot; with the tagline, &quot;Come get lei\'d!&quot; It\'s described as, &quot;A pool side bash featuring Hawaiian vibes, with a variety of poke bowls and tropical cocktails for purchase.&quot; The flyer also advertises &quot;fresh caught fish.&quot; - <a href="http://imgur.com/ZJ2g2Ws">http://imgur.com/ZJ2g2Ws</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spike Mendelsohn\'s Instagram photos depict him with Bill Clinton, John Kerry, Justin Trudeau, and Joe Biden, among others. There is also a photo of Barack Obama sitting at a table in what appears to be We, The Pizza. <a href="http://imgur.com/R4nF5lN">http://imgur.com/R4nF5lN</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We, The Pizza appears to have been on CTR payroll. <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201607159020655370">http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201607159020655370</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I just want to get the ball rolling here. I\'m going to keep looking at these. I can\'t help but wonder about the fact that they have a location in Saudi Arabia. Doesn\'t that at least have to mean that someone who likes the ones they\'ve visted here in the US wanted one in Saudi Arabia, too? What kind of people frequent both DC and Saudi Arabia? And that cow logo bugs me a bit, too. There\'s just something about it that seems off.</p>',
