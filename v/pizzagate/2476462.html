<p><strong>Alison Lawton married FRANK GIUSTRA</strong> in 2000.  They separated in 2008:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Lawton">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Lawton</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alison Lawton (born May 29, 1970) is a Canadian entrepreneur, social advocate and philanthropist. She is the producer of the documentary Uganda Rising and founder of Mindset Social Innovation Foundation. </p>
<p>In 1995, Lawton joined Investor First Financial and began her business career in private equity sales. She focused on the areas of syndicated software, film, television, real estate and tax shelter offerings. In 1997, she founded her own investment company, Winfield Venture Group;[2] a private angel investment and corporate finance boutique.</p>
<p>She also founded IdeaPark Ventures, an internet incubator company that she sold in 2000 to Goldcorp mining magnate, Ian Telfer.[3] At the same time, she became an early stage investor in Vision Critical. Angus Reid, known for social research in Canada, is the company’s CEO.</p>
<p>In November 2005, Lawton was appointed <strong>Chair of the Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS campaign for UNICEF Canada.</strong> Some of her campaign initiatives included producing the <strong>Unite against AIDS concert series and UNICEF’s first Canadian art auction, Unite with Art. The events raise funds for UNICEF</strong>, as well as the consciousness around HIV/AIDS and how it has redefined childhood for millions of children worldwide. Lawton also produced a 25-minute educational documentary for UNICEF; Hope in the Time of AIDS featured Stephen Lewis and was narrated by Pierce Brosnan.</p>
<p>Lawton met Lloyd Axworthy, former Director of the University of British Columbia’s Liu Institute for Global Issues and former Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister, in 2004. He encouraged her to cover the forcible conscription of children in Uganda’s civil war.
After a trip to Uganda she struggled with how to properly publicize the plight of the Acholi children in Uganda and consulted with former <strong>President Bill Clinton</strong>, whom she met while touring Africa with <strong>UNICEF and the Clinton Foundation. On a special request from the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education, she flew to India to present her work and also consult with the Dalai Lama.</strong> </p>
<p>Lawton is funding research at UBC that is studying the discovery, development and delivery of pharmaceutical drugs. The group is creating an online collaborative platform to share ideas for change so that life-saving medicines are more widely and readily distributed to those most in need (antiretrovirals for AIDS in Africa, for example).[14]</p>
<p>Lawton currently sits on the advisory council for <strong>Richard Branson’s foundation, Virgin Unite Canada</strong>, whose mandate is to unite people to tackle tough social and environmental problems with an entrepreneurial approach. In 2009, she joined Branson and other international entrepreneurs on a trip to South Africa to evaluate Virgin Unite projects.</p>

           <p>
            Alison Lawton (born May 29, 1970) is a Canadian entrepreneur, social advocate and philanthropist. She is the producer of the documentary Uganda Rising and founder of Mindset Social Innovation Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1995, Lawton joined Investor First Financial and began her business career in private equity sales. She focused on the areas of syndicated software, film, television, real estate and tax shelter offerings. In 1997, she founded her own investment company, Winfield Venture Group;[2] a private angel investment and corporate finance boutique.
           </p>
           <p>
            She also founded IdeaPark Ventures, an internet incubator company that she sold in 2000 to Goldcorp mining magnate, Ian Telfer.[3] At the same time, she became an early stage investor in Vision Critical. Angus Reid, known for social research in Canada, is the company’s CEO.
           </p>
           <p>
            In November 2005, Lawton was appointed
            <strong>
             Chair of the Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS campaign for UNICEF Canada.
            </strong>
            Some of her campaign initiatives included producing the
            <strong>
             Unite against AIDS concert series and UNICEF’s first Canadian art auction, Unite with Art. The events raise funds for UNICEF
            </strong>
            , as well as the consciousness around HIV/AIDS and how it has redefined childhood for millions of children worldwide. Lawton also produced a 25-minute educational documentary for UNICEF; Hope in the Time of AIDS featured Stephen Lewis and was narrated by Pierce Brosnan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawton met Lloyd Axworthy, former Director of the University of British Columbia’s Liu Institute for Global Issues and former Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister, in 2004. He encouraged her to cover the forcible conscription of children in Uganda’s civil war.
After a trip to Uganda she struggled with how to properly publicize the plight of the Acholi children in Uganda and consulted with former
            <strong>
             President Bill Clinton
            </strong>
            , whom she met while touring Africa with
            <strong>
             UNICEF and the Clinton Foundation. On a special request from the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education, she flew to India to present her work and also consult with the Dalai Lama.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawton is funding research at UBC that is studying the discovery, development and delivery of pharmaceutical drugs. The group is creating an online collaborative platform to share ideas for change so that life-saving medicines are more widely and readily distributed to those most in need (antiretrovirals for AIDS in Africa, for example).[14]
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawton currently sits on the advisory council for
            <strong>
             Richard Branson’s foundation, Virgin Unite Canada
            </strong>
            , whose mandate is to unite people to tackle tough social and environmental problems with an entrepreneurial approach. In 2009, she joined Branson and other international entrepreneurs on a trip to South Africa to evaluate Virgin Unite projects.

            I know someone who used to live in Vancouver who told me many tales of how corrupt the city is. Run by Freemasons and Hells Angels do their dirty work a couple high level HA are Freemasons. Drugs are rampant in the city. In the 90s or 2000s the Hells Angels were involved in some internet Endeavor that made them a ton of money involving porn. Not regular porn but extreme hard core porn where snuff was involved. They used drug addicted prostitutes and tortured them. Apparently many of these women went misssing. Not sure whether they filmed at that Pickton Farm but very possible. It was on the dark web and people could request stuff. No idea about child porn but I was told that at that time and with all the drugs available many kids were hooked and Vancouver had a “kiddie stroll” something called Franklin. Don’t forget there was male DNA found at that pig farm place not just female but they cops called off the search of the property and they never followed through with all the remains. Apparently a drug addicted prostitute claimed she escaped after being held at that farm in a dark room for a few days and was beaten and raped by many men one being a cop in his uniform. Vancouver is one fucked up city like if you put gold nuggets on top of shit it’s still a pile of shit.

              Absolutely the most corrupt city in what we consider the 'civilized ' world.  For starters, the Vancouver Stock Exchange (where Giustra made a fortune off of penny stock) was foreced to shut down due to it being considered at the time, the most corrupt stock exchange in thew world

            Certainly seems that some people think that there was much more to the Pickton case:

            <p>
             Mainstream media like CBC, The Tyee, Vancouver Sun, and Seattle’s weekly, The Stranger, easily uncovered the fact that
             <strong>
              former Port Coquitlam Mayor, Scott Young, and hundreds of other people had attended events at Piggy’s Palace, the party venue operating for several years at Pickton’s pig farm.
             </strong>
             I asked some of those Vancouver rock/punk bands playing in the 1990s what they’d heard about Piggy’s Palace. I was relieved to hear my friends say they had refused to play there because, as one said “even though we’d played some shitty places, we’d heard Piggy’s was totally sketchy bikers, blow, you name it.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Others describe Piggy’s Palace as “rough,” “very very badass.” One man interviewed in 2003 by The Stranger said: “There were lots of women, who looked like hookers…. The party spilled all over the grounds and there were people in the house and in the trailer doing the wild thing. I recall walking by a shack with a 40-watt light bulb hanging over the door and machinery was running inside. Here, I got a death chill. The hairs raised on the back of my neck and my feet froze to the ground. I didn’t want to be there anymore, so I left and walked home.”

             You see everybody knew Willie Pickton. He bought his vehicles at the Vancouver Police Auctions. In the video they said he worked at them.
             <strong>
              That means he had a regular relationship with the police.
             </strong>
             The video omits the drinking establishment he ran called Piggie's Palace. A good night would see 1,800 patrons. They included the mayor. The place was even a registered charity called The Good Times Society raising money for women's groups. With all the drugs and prostitutes it must have been quite the good time. Of course now no one admits going there especially the police. Most damning Willie was called The White Knight in the video for helping the dispossessed. The security at the place was called White Knights Security Services. If I may digress to the latest RCMP scandal with the cop in bondage scenes the Kilted Knight. That seems to be a key word at the farm - Knight. That cop had a role in the investigation too and leads me to consider the possibility of actual police involvement.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the main little jewels they include and then leave out, the wooden stake to the heart, is the role of Insp. Kim Rossmo. He was Canada's fist Ph.D. cop. He devised a serial criminal profiler program. He screamed not only smoke but fire. His superiors refused to listen. They walled him out. They fired him. He is suing for wrongful dismissal. How is it the man most likely to solve the case was removed from it by the 'old boys' network? Maybe it wasn't his academic credentials.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would speculate that Piggie's Palace, the pig farm and The Good Times Society may have played a crucial role in laundering some of the $200 million of drug money in the area. Willie was rich. No one would think twice except me.
            </p>
            <p>
             The most damning piece of evidence prior to the S &amp; M antics concerns the allegations of RCMP Cpl. Catherine Galliford who is suing the force for years of tortuous sexual harassment including senior management. She was assigned to the missing women case. She reported that investigators routinely engaged in sexual liaisons, watched porn, harassed her, and left work early to drink and party. The quotes stopped short as to whether the location was actually Pickton's Piggie's Palace. That is immaterial since they surely weren't investigating Pickton. Cpl. Galliford was told that her colleagues' sexual fantasy involved the following:
             <em>
              “They wanted to see Willie Pickton escape from prison, track me down and strip me naked, string me up on a meat hook and gut me like a pig,”
             </em>

            I am going to Vomit.  I can't even read about charities for children anymore.  They are all suspect in my eyes.  They all have one or pushing one. Every Elite has Found. after their name.  Yes I have suspected UNICEF for over a year now and we know about Branson and his Island and the fact that he owns an Airline.  What a perfect scenario for drugs and trafficking trades.  Who would suspect the Hells Angels to be caught up in CP.  I don't think I can take any more Rabbit Holes.  Even on Easter Weekend.   Yikes!
