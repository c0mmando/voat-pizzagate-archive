<p>Firstly, is her history of online posting. Unexplained uses of leopard/animal prints fill her page. This could be a coincidence or popular clothing style, but she has an apparently obsession with the clothing. She has taken over 10 pictures with it, for unknown reasons. Once you notice it, you\'ll realize that her clothing choices are simple variations. Pettibone also only wears these clothes, making it stranger. These clothes are also very popular among other members.</p>

<p>There are many other examples of wearing variations on this theme, along with others. But that isn\'t the least. </p>
<p>Here is a picture of her that she posted on Instagram. Notice the stripping pole behind it, which occurs in other pictures as well.</p>

<p>Pettibone also has a history of making strange hand symbols in her videos. These are milder examples, but far more exist and can be found with minimum effort. </p>

<p>She has also radically shifted views on multiple issues. Including race, the alt-right, and others. It indicates that her viewpoints aren\'t organic.

            This was one of the funniest post I ever read in this sub. For some reason it made me laugh out loud... especially when I clicked on the "Strange hand signals" links... I mean, what the fuck!? :`) haha! this is so retarded at one point it became funny.

            Its kind of an honor for Pettibone to be attacked by the pedophile occults (AKA CIA).  Think of all the children their too busy to rape while they shill here.

            I wear black pretty much every single day. I have multiple "copies" of the same garments. What does that mean about me?

            That really makes it seem like they've got shill accounts (bots, even) that are showing up to comment sections to voice support for whatever ideology they want to associate with the person, just like they had all these people commenting on Seaman's videos signaling their allegiance to Israel. They want us to dismiss Seaman as a Zionist, so they falsify "Zionist support" in his comment sections. It'd make total sense for them to falsify white supremacist support for Pettibone so they can make her out to be one of them, etc.

            Hey guys - make sure you check the account history of the people posting that Pettibone is suspect. Nearly every single one is between 3 and 6 hours old at the time that I'm making this comment. This is almost certainly a coordinated disinformation attack. I'm flairing this post accordingly.

            I just read that thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            I still don't buy it. I mean, if any of us were getting exposure on YouTube, people could find all sorts of things to point to to question our integrity, honesty, etc. Certainly, we've all experienced getting redpilled rather suddenly and going through a short period of getting a little carried away or being gullible here and there. Imagine if you went through that in front of thousands of Internet users. There'd be people wanting to call you a shill for all the times you were wrong, accusing you of spreading disinfo with the assumption that it was intentional.
           </p>
           <p>
            There doesn't seem to be whole lot of money behind any of these YouTubers, so I think they deserve the same benefit of the doubt you'd give to people you know personally.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hell, I'm in the planning phases of making videos of my own. If I do that and then someone finds out that I act in my own short films or that I agree with this person or that person, will I be called a shill?

            I don't follow her, so I can't comment on her politics/positions, but the clothing and hand signs? No offense, but I'm seriously questioning whether or not you're serious.

            Moreover, do YouTubers really make good shills in the first place?
