            This was well written. Hope everyone can really take the message out of it. This khazar are not of a religion. There DNA links them back to. Ashkenazi and in fact proves as of 2013 not Jewish. 
The origins of this story go back in time to Nephelim and the book of Enoch need to understand the relationship between khazar to 13 bloodlines to Luceferian.

            I am astonished that few people are pointing out the very large number of Jews involved in Pizzagate. I've compiled the following information (mostly pasted from various sources) and verified all of the claims. Jewish names are in bold. The list is far from exhaustive:

              That's why they are called Jews (a modern term) and not Hebrews. Nor are they Judahites, which also means something very different from Jew. Calling them 'Khazars' just confuses people.

                The Jews called Jesus a Nazi in the Talmud (Nozri, Nazarean, Nazirite, etc) and Hitler a Nazi in modern times. It's a term they coined themselves. The German National-Socialists never called themselves Nazis. It's a Jewish mock-term. If you are opposed to Jewish satanism, you WILL be called a Nazi — in ancient as in modern times. This is why the Bible says of Jesus, "He will be called a Nazarean" (Nazri, Nazi, Nazara — modern Nazi).

              Please. This is so old, and so complex, it is best to pull it up from its roots. Donald Trump, even if he is controlled opposition is going to arrest a fuck ton of pedos over the next year, especially if he wants to lead the USA into a Nazi Germany 2.0 (false revolt against the syndicate for the sole purpose of destroying the host country). If no arrests, then a revolution.

               I'm working on that but so far all I see are piles of pedos being taken down, arrests on front pages followed by crickets...  What these sons of bitches is are doing to the children on the physical plane is very bad. What they are doing to them on the spiritual plane is unconscionable and a crime of the very highest order. 300,000 people took to the streets in Belgium, all in white, they shut their government down.  F⃞O⃞U⃞R⃞  Y⃞E⃞A⃞R⃞S⃞  (4 fucking years) later the case went to trial. By that time, 27 key witnesses were dead!

               Insanity is repeating the same actions and expecting a different outcome. How many people went to jail when the Franklin cover-up was exposed? The VICTIMS got more time than the pervert perpetrators. What makes you think this will be any different left to those agents and agencies that have committed the crimes, aid and abetted those crimes or at the very least turned a blind eye?

                I am just trying to tell you that change is coming soon. It is going to be immutably intense. You will be surprised. I promise. I share your impatience.
