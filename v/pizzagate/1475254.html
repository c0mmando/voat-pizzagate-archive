            I think I'm just old. Village voice described the apes as the best "new-wave-masquerading-as-art-punk you'll hear all year."
Not sure why you'd want to cultivate the pedo vibe, but after reading this blog everything seemed pretty mundane.  New wave pseudo art punk, unless someone proves different.

            I saw a really creepy video with Majestic Ape where she does "stand up" at Comet Ping Pong and people actually laugh at the stuff she says, thing is, it doesn't make any sense at all. 
She says stuff like "Russian, yoga pants, principal" and people start laughing like it's the best joke ever. This means there has to be even more codewords people in their circles use to communicate.
