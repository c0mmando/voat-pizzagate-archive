<p>Hallelujah and amen if this is true! #Pizzagate is about to be vindicated and exposed. The #GreatAwakening is upon us and delivered to us on a platter from a VERY unlikely source. I mean, this guy wasn\'t even on any of our radar! Julian Assange, yes! Julian Epstein, yes, he sure was. All sorts of people, but not Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock.com. I didn\'t even know the name of the CEO of Overstock.com. I also didn\'t know he was centrally involved in the Russian hoax because of a connection to Marina Butina, convicted Russian spy. But it turns out, Patrick Byrne HAS ALL THE ANSWERS. Here\'s the beginning of what he says: </p>
<p><em>&quot;Let me give it to you in a nutshell, in a very strange way, by a weird fluke of history, I ended up in the center of the Russian and the Clinton investigations. I have all the answers.&quot;</em> </p>

<pre><code>&gt;Patrick Byrne: I ended up in the center of the Russian and the Clinton investigations. I have all the answers. I have been sitting on them waiting for America to get there.

            Hey! Things are heating up. Just posted on an update to the story. Patrick Byrne goes on FOX and reveals name of the destructive Deep State agent who gave him suspicious orders. Agent's name: PETER STRZOK.

            That's where it is! He turned the documents over to DOJ/Barr.

            I’m very skeptical since you’re saying Bill Barr is going to save the day. Bill Barr through father Donald, has deep ties to exfiltrating energy and technology secrets  to sanctioned countries. His wife and Mueller’s wife have been in a prayer circle for 30 years together.  When Mueller starts his career, he closes down several nuclear sites in the United States.  Peter Strzck his family is also in the transportation of nuclear equipment.  Bruce and Nellie Ohr also. Bruce’s father came from the energy sector wrote all these 800 papers about the nuclear industry. The stuff has deep ties. Epstein working with Doug band to fly so-called diplomats and oligarchs from the Ukraine i.e. criminals, around  when he and Ghislaine are not recruiting other pilots. Drugs for weapons ratline. That’s also why Bronfmans are in this story.

             I think the problem is that all the elites at a certain level consort with each other. If I may use an example, I'd use Epstein and Donald Trump. The fake news tried to push the friend angle, and they were friends at one time, but now they drew from that hoping to cast aspersions on Trump being involved. But the judge releases a transcript of Virginia Roberts-Giuffre testimony and, oh, guess what? She categorically exonerates Trump and says he did not have sex with any of them.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Trump is a good example in other ways. He is hardly pure, and it seems that's what you're looking for. And since you mention the Bronfmans, Clare and Sara Bronfman installed software on their father's computer so that they could spy on him. That doesn't sound like they were on the same page. Really, think about it ... you belong to a country club where one guy is cheating on his wife, another may be on drugs, another is embezzling a little change from his clients or corporation, and another is a pedo who rapes children ... BRAKES! Did someone say a member of the country club is a pedo who rapes kids? You can see where some people might have a problem with this. Especially when you find out that they intend to take over the world and destroy America and make it part of a mall with no borders.

             So I understand your point, but undestand mine. There might be a saint in heaven, but this battle is going to be fought by guys who are a little rough around the edges. And Barr is as gruff as they come. If I met him under different circumstances, I'd be intimidated. If he were appointed under different circumstances, I'd be worried. But right here and right now? He is PERFECT!
            </p>
            <p>
             And one more point, I thought Sessions was doing anything either. Turns out he ripped The Clintons a new one. In one of my posts, I cite an article that goes into the investigation that is going on in earnest in Arkansas. So let's not sell people short until they prove themselves unworthy. You can't go by family ... and you can't go by friends.

              Yes, and he knew that Epstein was into young girls. He didn't have a problem with it, until they fell apart over a real estate deal. His friend and mentor Roy Cohn was a pedo, who had pedo friends, and ran a sex trafficking ring for the CIA. He didn't have a problem with that either.
             </p>
             <p>
              His first wife Ivana socailized with Ghislaine Maxwell. Both Ivana and Ivanka are in Epstein's Black Book.

             <p>
              And I don't want to continue our argument regarding Geoge Nader, but Trump worked with him, although he knew he was a convicted pedo.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump always looked the other way, as long as people were useful for him, or he could benefit. Only when he fell apart with them for other reasons, he suddenly became concerned that they were involved in pedophilia.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is not about purity, it's about decency. Decent people don't have pedo friends.

             <p>
              Absolutely. See my comment above - the federal prosecutors denied justice to the Florida victims, shortly before Barr recused himself, and he fucked Epstein's security up.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a side note, with what do you think they blackmailed him, so that he was appointed AG during the Bush adminstration. The same question applies to Pompeo and Bolton. Pompeo's CIA ran child sex trafficking rings.

              I'd highly recommend reading George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'.

                I think it's pretty obvious how deep he was. In order for him to go to this level, he saw things. I think the only difference may be that he knows it's evil. Everyone else was a monster. Look, you don't know the monster is behind the door until you open it.

            <em>

           </p>
           <p>
            Barr is a swamp creature. Just like Pompeo and Bolton.
           </p>
           <p>
            He worked for the CIA for four years, and his father worked for the CIA predecessor OSS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later he worked for Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the very law firm who represented Epstein during the Florida trial, where he got away with the lenient plea deal. He refused to recuse himself from the new Epstein investigation despite this connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            He only recused himself from the old Epstein case after
            <strong>
             the federal prosecutors had refused to agree to a new trial that the victims wanted, although the plea deal was ruled to be illegal by a judge.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Impossible that he was AG during the Bush administration, without being deeply compromised.
           </p>
           <p>
            There never were any prisoners who committed suicide or 'suicide' at the MCC in the past 20 years; but under Barr's supervision, Epstein died (or 'died').
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             TL;DR - it is Barr's fault if the victims in Florida and New York will not get justice, at least not the way they would have deserved it.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             This totally sucks.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-section">
           </h1>
           <p>
            And Patrick Byrne worked for Warren Buffet, yep, the very same Warren Buffet of Omaha / Franklin scandal ritual abuse fame.
           </p>
           <p>
            He got an award by Ernst  &amp; Young, a fishy company that works for Disney and Amazon. The former CEO of Ernst &amp; Young, Mark Weinberger, is connected to Lady Forester de Rothschild. Like Barr, he served under the Bush administration.

            I have a feeling there are literally millions  of people involved.  What do you do with them all?  It would be hard just to have a mock trial, convict them all of treason, then execute them and throw them in a dumpster.  They are going to fight back and the have lots of resources.  It's a mess.  They should just release the names of the people that they have video proof of harming kids and round them up into a FEMA camp.  They would have to be locked up for life, they are too powerful to ever be free again.

             I also believe there are millions involved. There are in my mind hundreds of thousands who are aware and complicate while the rest are unknowing maintainers. Ex Cia. The folks who know what the nefarious intention and machinations are USE those below to unwittingly act in their uppers behest. Now more than ever those who were unaware of how it works are increasingly becoming aware and at times blowing the whistle or behaving toward common good.

             Yes, for an operation this size, there have to be millions working for them. But just like Epstein's sex slaves had no details about the operation, the trials must concentrate on the leaders of the operations ... and we have a pretty good idea of who they are. They are the ones that have to either be sent to Gitmo or wherever for safekeeping. As to the rest, it's like any other round-up. We read about hundreds of people arrests in human sex trafficking rings, and this would follow that template. Arrest a few hundreds. Trial. Verdict. Next batch. They're small potatoes, and if their ''brains'' are not able to strategize and tell them what to do, they don't really pose that much of a threat.
            </p>
            <p>
             So get the top dogs ... the ones that are really dangerous ... and this is tricky because some of these are placed and sleepers ... but I believe Barr has what he needs.  I don't know who was feeding Trump information all these years, but our POTUS knew what was happening and I cannot wait.

             Well, with all this, Barr and Trump would be idiots to not use this to destroy the Dems chances of winning 2020. I do think they'll wait until a candidate is chosen. Why wouldn't they? The Dems select one and KABOOM! She or he is indicted ... and so on down the line! The DNC will be in shambles with all the indictments.

              It's been years since Podesta's emails have been public. The DNC is the official state party at this time. The only way you'll see Justice for major players is through bloody revolution. Relying on Jew controlled courts is a fantasy.

                 Look, the same way Satanists are not Christians, and the Vatican is not Christian, that's how the Satanists posing as Jews are doing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Netflix now has more propaganda out on this pedo elite cult. They show everyone involved in this CHRISTIAN organization namely: THE FAMILY. There have been more than a few submissions on Voat about this group and they are not Christian.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of course, this group of Satanists posing as Jews knew the towers were going to be hit. Why else the Jew call made to Al Franken? He spoke openly about it. Put it on Youtube. And the detonation was already built into the buildings. That's what they do with these skyscrapers. When they build, the means to implode and bring them down is built into the design so there'd be no need for ''art students'' or anyone else to rig an entire building. What happened on the floors that were occupied? Please. You're smarter than this. Expand your thinking.

                    I don't mean to attack, but you have to agree it's a silly idea.  It takes literally tons of explosives to demolish buildings the size of the WTC and they are most certainly not placed at the time of construction.

                    <p>
                     So Satanists like The Family and the sect that infiltrated the Krishna movement define the religion?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If you want to call them Freemasons, The Illuminati, or Satanists, this is the group we're talking about. They almost always house themselves in someone else's religion, and I believe the Catholic religion goes back farther than a decade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Look, I'm not going to change your mind and you're not going to change mine. You can reply to your heart's content. It doesn't bother me. Like I said, I am here for the kids ... and our country ... or mine ... don't know where you're from. But America and children are worth saving from the elite pedo cabal. We can agree on that, can't we?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Hope so.

             Yes, but Patrick Byrne was speaking to the American public. And he attempted to explain it. When he was talking about who in the FBI was culpable of this fraud, treason, and attempted coup. He even went into Deep State.
            </p>
            <p>
             I give him high marks and a medal for speaking out so forthrightly and ''introducing'' these ideas to the general public who have not a clue! They still think that dossier is real!

             That is true, but there are lots of people getting into cryptocurrency. Assange was doing it, too, no? Of course, he was forced to. I think that's what you're leaving out. If banks try to weaponize money, there can be these huge ''friendly'' avenues that others can avail themselves of.

             Not always a negative, but good thought.

            I actually feel hopeful. There was a change in the air ever since the Mueller debacle and now this. I was waiting for something to confirm it and I really do believe this is it. But I am holding back. I get what you're saying, but, man, I feel it to my core.
