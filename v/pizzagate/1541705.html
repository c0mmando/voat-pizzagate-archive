            Here is an excerpt from Fritz Springmeier's book
The bloodlines of the illuminati
Under chapter 6, the Kennedy family, follow up in the Kennedy family
"Because there is so much disinformation out about the people who run this country, it must sometimes seem rather bizarre that people like me come along and say there is a satanic conspiracy of great magnitude. If Americans were as a whole critical thinkers and would challenge the propaganda that the controlled media gives them, then the false fronts and false public images of their leaders might not get written up so easily as history. There are not many critical thinkers in this nation. There are a great many intelligent people, but not a great many critical thinkers.
           </p>
           <p>
            A conspiracy of great magnitude has had this nation in its grips since the nation was founded, and the controlled press has managed to prevent the general population from finding this conspiracy out. The Kennedy Family has played a role in that conspiracy. JFK gave his life to that conspiracy. The assassination of JFK is one of the best ways to introduce Americans to the conspiracy. Ralph Epperson who gives talks/slideshows about the NWO to groups likes to use the Kennedy Assassination as a method to get people to realize that there is a NWO conspiracy. Interestingly, Ralph Epperson, had as a companion for a while without knowing it, an active Monarch slave who helped him give presentations. It is difficult for those exposing the NWO to get away from being infiltrated. The Monarch mind-controlled slaves are very difficult to detect, especially since most people donâ€™t even know that they exist."

            Wow, well done.  Mind control is a huge part of pizzagate.  Really important to remember that all of the new celebrity/Hollywood illuminatis may have had some form of control, therefore, affecting their millions of followers.  But you know, it won't end well for these useful idiots, as they should be called, they still aren't at the top of the food chain and never will be.
