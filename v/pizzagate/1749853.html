            I believe James Alefantis is the lynchpin of this entire thing. Because think about it, think really, really carefully about this: who would know better all the information about his pedophile clients to whom the children are rented out or sold than the pedophile Pimp????? Of course the pimp would have the most amount of dirt on all of them because the pedo pimp is the link wHicham solidly connects all the Elite Pedo Clients together because they all have the same PIMP in common, who supplies all of them with children for their pedo desires or for whatever else, like a false flag- Sandy hook.
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis IS THE JIMMY SAVILLE OF PIZZAGATE!!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            JIMMY COMMET = JIMMY SAVILLE!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            THINK ABOUT IT.
           </p>
           <p>
            THE SHOE FITS!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            JAMES ALEFANTIS IS THE PEDO PIMP CHILD SUPPLIER!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            IF HE GOES DOWN WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE AND BREATHING, WELL THEN GUESS WHAT? THEY ALL GO DOWN WITH HIM!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS IS WHY NOTHING WAS EXPOSED IN SAVILLE'S CASE UNTIL SAVILLE WAS FUCKING DEAD. THAT MAN TOOK ALL THE DIRT HE HAD ON HIS ELITE PEDO CLIENTS TO HIS FUCKING GRAVE. THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH SAVILLE'S SHIT WAS COVERED UP. I MEAN FOR FUCK SAKES EVEN TGET GODDAMMI QUEEN HERSELF WAS INVOVED IN COVERING UP FOR THAT PEDO SHIT BAG. WHY?? WHY DID HE HAVE THAT MUCH PULL? WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST LET HIM TAKE THE FALL??? MAKE HIM THE SCAPEGOAT AND RID THEMSELVES OF COMING UNDER SCRUTINY??? THEY COULD HAVE EASILY DONE THAT. SAVILLE WAS NOTHING BY HIMSELF. SAVILLE WAS A NOBODY WITHOUT THE INFLUENCE AND POWER OF HIS CLIENTS. HIS POWER LAY IN THE FACT THAT HE WAS THE PIMP TO WHOM ALL THE ELITE WENT TO FOR THEIR PEDO DESIRES. HE WAS THE SUPPLIER TO THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL. WITH THAT ALSO COMES THE CONSEQUENCE THAT HE KNEW THE MOST DAMNING OF STUFF ON ALL OF THEM TOO, IF THEY EVER FAILED TO PROTECT HIM OR IF ANY OF THEM EVER DOUBLE CROSSED HIM AND TRIED TO SCREW HIM OVER.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is exactly why, even, Anthony Weiner has kept what he labeled, "Insurance File" on his laptop. Insurance for what??? Insurance for when If he were ever caught and was being taken down.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're even trying to protect Anthony Weiner for this very reason. Nothing is fuckingredients happening with him even. His hearing got cancelled and now what??? We keep hearing people say they're doing something they're doing something..... all I know is I'm not seeing anything about what they are saying they are doing. I'll believe it when I see it.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Im willing to bet that what Anthony Weiner has in his insurance file,  probably pales in comparison to what most likely James Alefantis has in his "insurance file on all of them" on many, many, more people, than the number of people which Anthony Weiner has in his insurance file.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about all of the people we've connected to Alefantis. Fuck sake look at the long lists of guests to just one of those fucking DC parties mentioned in the Washington magazine, which James Alefantis attended too.

             James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong were red-herrings. There could be stuff there but it's not worth the time and effort given George Webb's discovery of Huma and Hillary's Heroin Rat Line:

             "CHILD SUPPLIER!!!!"
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been here 4 months. I've seen some really fucked up shit. But the trail quickly went cold and now I have the overwhelming feeling that the Comet Ping Pong story was a brilliantly constructed hoax to distract people from the real crimes inside the Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             So you all can certainly keep investigating but you need to ask yourself where the point of diminishing returns is.

            This was posted last night. Why was it posted again? It's strange. It's like people really really really want people to keep talking about Comet Ping Pong.

            The story has moved on from CPP. Mango-gate a.k.a. Huma and Hillary's Heroin Ratline is the new new thing:

            All I can say is: 6 months later he's still going on tv telling people he's a victim and pg is a lie. 6 months in he's still orchestrating these elaborate tv debunking gigs.  Does this tell you people anything? This shit is 100% real and he is at the center of it in DC. No one would go to this much trouble to clear his name after he's done it at least 2 other times. He is guily as fuck and he is desperate to convince people it's fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            He must be under the intense pressure from the Rothschild family and D.C. Elites to do anything he can to change people's minds.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is confirmation that this is 1000% real!!!

            Terrifying Alefantis?  You mean like what you have done and still are doing to little children?  That is terrifying.  Wait until we get your bloomin' arse in jail. Wait until they take care of you there,  They don't like people that do that to little children. I hope you are frightened and terrified out of your mind.
