<p>[some excerpts]</p>
<p>BICHIP IS A MICROSOFT COMPANY Bichip was set up as a Microsoft company and Bichip’s parent company BEZH International is still a Microsoft partner. Following public outcry against Bill Gates’ work on microchip implants, Bichip tried to bury its connections to Bill Gates. They no longer even mention Microsoft as a partner in their Terms of Service. This attempt to hide this connection shows that the microchip implants Bichip and Bill Gates have been working on are for nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>BICHIP IS RAN BY A PEDOPHILE WORSE THAN EPSTEIN Torben Dhalvad, who is Europe’s most notorious and most untouchable pedophile and human trafficker, is on Bichip and BEZH’s board of directors. But by all accounts, Torben Dhalvad is much worse than Jeffrey Epstein the infamous American pedophile billionaire. Dhalvad’s pedophilic trafficking of the underaged involves the sex enslavement of children of all ages including toddlers, infants and babies. There is a disturbing video currently circulating on the dark web of him and other men killing a 13 year old girl for fun. While Torben Dhalvad might be more twisted and powerful than Epstein, his connections to Israel’s spy agency Mossad are more widely known in Denmark. Dhalvad was born in Israel and first came to Denmark as an attache to the Israeli embassy in Denmark. Dhalvad somehow leveraged his initially intern-level position at the embassy to launch Denmark’s first pornographic magazine and then become a powerful child trafficker with his hands in Danish media and Danish tech companies.</p>
<p>MOSSAD KILLED BICHIP EMPLOYEE LISSA ANDERSEN Bichip’s media manager Lissa Andersen was found dead last month on April 28. The cause of death being homicide. As the person who actively went after journalists who investigated Bichip, or Bill Gates’ connections to Bichip, Andersen was privy to the company’s underhanded means of silencing those who tried to uncover the truth about it. She knew too much and her time was up especially now that a lot was coming out to light, and Mossad agent Rita Katz of SITE International Group had her killed to cut off loose ends.</p>
<p>BICHIP’S CEO PROVIDES PRIVATE SECURITY FOR GRETA THUNBERG Finn Rosenkranz Pedersen who is the CEO of Bichip has not been seen by anyone since he contracted COVID-19. Some presume he is dead and Bichip is trying to launder all his vast wealth. Finn Rosenkranz is one of Europe’s wealthiest men and like Bill Gates, he has his money and hands in many ventures including a private security company called Blue Security, whose personnell are all Private Military Contracters. Blue Security provides private security for climate activist Greta Thunberg.</p>

<p>Through the Maersk shipping company , Dhalvad treats thousands of people from all over the world who end up becoming slaves. Dhalvad\'s specialty is not the abuse of humans for slave labor, but a trafficking child pedophile who sells them   as prostitutes and sex slaves...</p>

             For 27 years, the city's famous face, with its backdrop in Algeria, has run a restaurant in the Latin Quarter. But now it's over.
            </p>

             Philip Tahi leaves Latin. He has left the keys to a new owner.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 61-year-old eloquent Dane with a background in Algeria does not know exactly what he wants to do. Pain in his back bothers him, but no more than he expects to take jobs in restaurants and initially help Latin's new proprietor on his way...

              <p>
               Latin has become an institution known in many places. Among other things, I have had guests from Copenhagen, New York and Singapore because they have heard about the restaurant.

              <p>
               It is related to Aarhus being a study city. When the studies are over, people get jobs out of town and return, they often just have to visit Latin, explains Philip Tahi.

              While studying in Aarhus, the Crown Prince came here occasionally, and as he celebrated his 30th birthday under private forms, I was in charge of the food at a party at Marselisborg Castle. I have also talked to Prince Henrik, who has been here a few times where we both enjoyed speaking French. He made a good impression on me. He was gifted, followed well and knew everything about everything, says Philip Tahi.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Also actors, people from showbiz, politicians and other celebrities have come to Latin.

            This smells like disinfo (too much easy evidence supporting pizzagate). We need to vet all the claims made in the original post at bezh.com. For instance:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Later it was uncovered that WikiLeaks had received huge some of cryptocurrency from Bichip. Whenever something monumental is revealed about Bichip or Bill Gates and his microchip implants projects, WikiLeaks always conviniently leaks something “big” that is always just a distraction.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Surely there's a link supporting this contribution claim? Also, aren't bitcoin transactions anonymous?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll give this the "Help!" flair to see if we can get folks digging to either corroborate or debunk the claims made there.

              The post definitely doesn't pass the smell test.  It's the same tactics that the FBI used to legitimize fake intel via MSM.  Circular reporting.

             I agree. I think we need to look into possible 'fake news' stories designed to discredit alternative news .. there's an information war on and looking into this stuff can be quite useful.

             Last week, a Danish company called BiChip announced the launch of a new cryptocurrency which uses a very unusual ‘wallet’: a chip which can be fitted under the human skin. The Copenhagen-based firm is part of a growing movement called Transhumanism, which believes in augmenting human beings with technology to improve upon their natural (or God-given, depending on your perspective) abilities.

             Governments are paying a bizarre Satanist to make microchip implants
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Former Danish Army special forces Simon Sallienjavi, an Internet-of-Things pioneer who is now the Chief Technical Officer at BiChip, the Danish tech company that claims to have made the world’s first internet connectable and distance readable human microchip implant, once made this bizarre statement: “I am the Beast and the end of the Bible, and I promise I will destroy the planet. I am going to get a group of terrible people to run this world, so get ready for my New World Order.”
            </p>
            <p>
             BiChip recently announced that it would be selling its supposedly revolutionary microchip implants to governments only. When we asked Sallienjavi about this, he said that private companies should be prohibited from selling human microchip implants, as he believes in what he calls Centralized Microchipping; which means the government having exclusive monopoly and control over human microchipping. BiChip has already made $10 million from pre-sales of its implants, and has secured contracts with the governments of the US, Denmark, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last time we spoke with Sallienjavi, who publicly claims to be a Christian but is actually a theistic Satanist, he abruptly cut off all communication after bizarrely retorting, “I would love for Jesus to come back so I can kill him again!”
            </p>
            <p>
             This bizarre retort by Sallienjavi was after we pointed out to him how in addition to his satanism, his bizarre statement about establishing a New World Order, and his so-called Centralized Microchipping, would only fuel the fires of the popular conspiracy theory about microchip implants being the so-called ‘Mark of the Beast’ mentioned the Bible. The Mark of the Beast is mentioned in the last book of the Bible called the Book of Revelations. According to Revelations, an anti-Christ figure demands that everyone gets a mark on their hand or their forehead. Anyone without this mark is not allowed to purchase or sell anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Attempts to communicate with Sallienjavi and BiChip after his peculiar declaration have only resulted in us receiving death threats from BiChip employees, particularly an individual named Jash, who is the Head Developer of BiChipCoin, the cryptocurrency token that will be integrated with BiChip’s microchip implants. These death threats came after Jash had attempted to bribe us with large sums of money and cryptocurrency so as not to publish any of the information about Sallienjavi and BiChip that we had.
            </p>
            <p>
             We take the death threats from BiChip very seriously, but we are not particularly surprised, given what we now know about BiChip as a company, and Sallienjavi as the head of a satanic cult deeply embedded within BiChip.
            </p>
            <p>
             32 year old Simon Sallienjavi is originally from Israel and was born in Jerusalem, but grew up in Denmark where he converted from Judaism to Christianity. Oddly enough, his conversion to Christianity fostered a fascination with the occult and satanism. This fascination has led him to starting an ever growing satanic cult, opening a school of sorcery*, and even writing a document on how to sell your soul to the Devil:
            </p>
            <p>
             “If by any chance you find yourself in a precarious situation and need an escape that doesn’t involve suicide, or if you are really bored and think that God is too much of a hypocrite for heaven to be enjoyable, then here is a simple how-to guide on selling your immortal essence to the Dark Lord,” unironically wrote Sallienjavi in his 2016 soul selling guide, that has since been plagiarized by an Odyssey Online writer.
            </p>
            <p>
             But things get even more weird, bizarre, and borderline insane when it comes to Sallienjavi’s company BiChip. The reason Sallienjavi started BiChip with two other associates named Finn Rosenkranz Pedersen and Flemming Bach, is because he actually believes that he is the anti-Christ figure or the Beast foretold in the Bible, and he wants to use microchip implants made by BiChip, as his literal ‘Mark of the Beast’ mentioned in the Book of Revelations.
            </p>
            <p>
             To achieve this bizarre vision, Sallienjavi has been establishing world wide connections with tech leaders, transhumanists and satanists. According to information and documents provided to us by a BiChip employee who is also a member of Sallienjavi’s satanic cult, BiChip has over the years made huge donations to both the Church of Satan and the Satanic Temple.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is odd that both the Satanic Temple and the Church of Satan have welcomed Sallienjavi’s overtures. Both institutions profess non-theistic and atheistic satanism, and as such they tend to vehemently differentiate themselves from theistic or traditional satanists like Sallienjavi who are also referred to as Devil Worshipers. Non-theistic satanists claim that theistic satanism is no different to Christianity as both faiths believe in fairy tales.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite the aforementioned philosophical semantic claims by the Church of Satan and the Satanic Temple so as to distinguish themselves from theistic satanists like Sallienjavi, both institutions have been eager to work with Sallienjavi. Peter H. Gilmore, the high priest of the Church of Satan, has even accepted to be the “surprise” special guest speaker at BiChip’s November 26 event – where other 50 members of his church will also be in attendance.
            </p>
            <p>
             .As for the leadership of the Satanic Temple, which claims to be a more more progressive and non-authoritarian offshoot of the Church of Satan, the documents provided to us show that while Sallienjavi views his dalliance with the Church of Satan as a partnership, he has little regard for the Satanic Temple. But surprisingly enough, the Temple has willingly accepted the role of servant to BiChip, as long as the donations keep coming.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            In an email sent last month on October 16, Lucien Greaves the founder of the Satanic Temple wrote to Sallienjavi, anxiously asking if Sallienjavi was still interested in Temple members attending the November 26 event:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “Please let us know if you are still interested in our attendance and how we might help you popularize the event,” Greaves pleads with Sallienjavi...
            </p>

             Native Dane here. Curiosity got the best of me, so I went and looked up who this guy is. Let's just say there are a lot of logical leaps taken in the nonsense above. Dhalvad was a journalist for a number of years and he was a matter of fact chief editor of an adult magazine for a number of years("Ugens Rapport" slightly more sleazy than Penthouse for reference). After that he started a couple of small companies that appear all to have gone bust. He also wasn't born in Israel, he was born in "Gammel Rye" Jutland(Denmark). I think it's safe to say none of that sounds like "one of Europa's most powerful pedophiles".
            </p>
            <p>
             I then went and looked up Bichip in the Central Business Register. It's a small company that has indeed developed a bio microchip of some description. To give you a scale of how small it is, last years earning was 100,000 Danish Kroner or roughly 20,000$. Again, not exactly something that says powerful organization to me. It could find no mentioning of Dhalvad even being connected to it either.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yeah.. I think we can call this one a hoax.

             Okay, here's an article saying that the whole BiChip thing is a hoax, just like Pizzagate.  I'm wondering if they are trying to discredit the whole Bill Gates and his nanotechnology vaccines just like the 'Pizzagate and Comet Ping Pong was a hoax' schtick..

              That's possible.

              Currently David Icke, who is a CIA asset (imo), is psushing the bs '5G is causing 'COVID-19 narrative'- this way, everyone who will discuss the dangers of 5G in the future will be discredited.

              It sucks.

              He has also invented and been pushing the 'elite pedophiles are reptilians' bs story for decades.

             <p>
              Unfortunately, Epstein victim Maria Farmer seems to endorse him, and even did a painting depicting the elites close to Epstein as reptiles.

              Wow. That was a hell of a confusing article. Almost impossible to follow, and loaded with "evidence". It's a pattern I've seen repeatedly used here, which I'd say is probably from some alphabet agency training manual. Note the very last line:

              The dude seems to be some sort of Satanist, as far as I could follow his posts. He is a contributor on Patheos to the "For Infernal Use Only" blog. Here's another of his recent submissions there, "debunking" SRA:

               Lucien Greaves is actually one of the most well known Satanists in the US, connected to the Satanic Temple (iirc, their spokesperson/leader) who has been pushing the 'Satanists are really nice people, only nice atheists' narrative for years, together with his followers.

               He has also been accused of being a pedo, iirc. You might find some info in our archives.

                I know who he is.  As with any disinformation campaign, elements of truth and reality need to be woven in, in order for the tale to be believable.  Heck, this whole thing
                <em>
                 might
                </em>
                be true in part or in whole.  My issue is that 1) there is zero supporting evidence of any of the aforementioned crimes; 2) the only citations are circular in nature, referencing back to the same or a paraphrased version of the same story and; 3) if Dhalvad was "bigger than Epstein", how come there is nothing I've found to support his alleged trafficking?  There are hundreds, if not thousands of reports from every corner of the Internet regarding Epstein.
               </p>
               <p>
                The story also seems like Jewbait.  Notice the majority of the responses are from the typical 88 "Muh Jew" anons.

                  Which is precisely why disinformation spreads so easily, especially when the target audience won't even take a moment to listen to a source close to the matter, eg: Lucien.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now I'm far from a fan of Lucien and his TST (as expressed in the GA submission), but even I can put that aside for the purpose of reading his article on the BiChip situation. Reading through that recount shows just how ridiculous and subversive the BiChip/Biohackinfo hoax is.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To quote an excerpt from the end of Lucien's post (formatting added for emphasis) in relation to what I quoted from you:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   This Biohackinfo episode is easily the most elaborate and complicated display of absolute ineptitude that I have ever witnessed.
                   <strong>
                    I can only assume that they actually think their ploy is clever and that
                   </strong>
                   <strong>
                    <em>
                     it will somehow prove convincing to a wider audience.
                    </em>
                   </strong>
                   They just may even be delusional enough to truly believe that their manufactured revelations will cause — as they put it — a “geopolitical shitstorm,” though to what end I can only still just speculate. One would pity them for their troubled idiocy if it were not so visibly stained with antagonistic malice. They created marketing materials for a fictitious product. They created a company and a villainous CEO. They managed to get media to pick up a press release. They manufactured a hoax conference. They put a massive amount of work into a complicated plot that was simultaneously so absurdly poorly-thought.
                  </p>

                 <p>
                  Indeed, judging by the unfathomably high amount of upvotes, it seems that both yourself and Lucien were right, Vin. This did prove convincing to a target audience because a lot of people just want to be told things and as I said they won't listen to sources they've been taught to reject.

                  Now we can all go back to hating Lucien/TST for whatever reason suits us, but I'm glad he took the time to lay out this BiChip bullshit. Most importantly, I remind you all to reconcile the attempted smear of Wikileaks by association with BiChip's alleged (and likely real) donation to them, with the fact that Biohackinfo, "USA Hackers" (the two who originally began the smear over the donation) and BiChip are quite plainly working together and tried to create a situation which they could spin as "Wikileaks is connected to 'Satanists'!".
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If we're to believe for argument's sake, that the donation is real, that's 12,000 in bitcoin (which potentially equates to far more in monetary value, depending on the currency) which was pumped into this smear/hoax
                  <em>
                   at a minimum
                  </em>
                  . Who the hell has that kind of money to spend on a smear? Who is really behind BiChip et al? What is their motive against Wikileaks? How does the Microsoft -&gt; BEHZ -&gt; BiChip relationship fit in to the picture?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   What, if any, motive does Bill Gates have to smear Wikileaks?
                  </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <em>
                   Yes, I think it looks like the whole entire point of this is a smear against Wikileaks and an attempt to sully communities like pizzagate with yet another steaming pile of disinfo. It is possible that this is damage control related to Microsoft (2 birds one stone: smear Wikileaks and discredit criticism/suspicion of Gates – considering that Gates is known to have used Epstein's jet and to my knowledge has refused to explain, and that the article in circulation centers on claiming that an enigmatic figure is a bigger/worse pedophile than Epstein), though I cannot be sure at this time.

                    Oh look, a &lt; 7 hour old account is trying to validate the divide over Wikileaks and convince everyone that there's not enough evidence to say Assange is alive or dead despite the many journalists who have seen him alive in the court room (we even had a photo leak which nearly got the person who took it in a lot of trouble), despite his lawyers and current Wikileaks Editor in Chief confirming he's alive and facing trial, despite the ongoing attempt to extradite him by the U.S...
