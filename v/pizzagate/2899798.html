<p>DETROIT (ChurchMilitant.com) - Father James Martin is trumpeting a pro-gay online store that happens donate to pro-abortion charities.</p>
<p>On Twitter Monday, the Jesuit celebrity priest recommended two products by a small online store that sells handmade jewelry.</p>

<p>One of the products the recommended is the &quot;Rosary of Modern Sorrows.&quot; Each decade has a suggested intention, and the beads are color-coded to symbolize the intentions. Leftist social justice talking points are prominent among the intentions. For example, the second decade is made with blue and green beads to call to mind &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and &quot;stewardship.&quot;</p>

<p>But the theme of the fifth decade has caused a firestorm on social media. The beads for the last mystery are rainbow-colored, and the suggested prayer of intention makes the blasphemous claim that God created homosexuals as they are and that this orientation — which the Catholic Catechism calls &quot;objectively disordered&quot; — is &quot;good&quot;:</p>

<pre><code>We pray for a welcoming of LGBTQ people by all churches, temples, mosques and synagogues. We pray for LGBTQ couples, their children, and extended families. We pray that they may be supported and loved, with full acceptance as people truly created in the image of God, a creation that God saw as &quot;good,&quot; and who deserve to live every aspect of life to the fullest.

<p>The organization selling this set of Rosary beads is Contemplative Rebellion, a social justice-themed online store that sells Christmas cards depicting the Holy Family alongside Colin Kaepernick earrings (and bracelets).</p>
<p>Christmas Cards   <a href="https://contemplativerebellion.com/collections/contemplative-rebellion/products/holy-family-christmas-card-set">https://contemplativerebellion.com/collections/contemplative-rebellion/products/holy-family-christmas-card-set</a></p>
<p>Kaepernick Earrings  <a href="https://contemplativerebellion.com/collections/contemplative-rebellion/products/colin-kaepernick-earrings">https://contemplativerebellion.com/collections/contemplative-rebellion/products/colin-kaepernick-earrings</a></p>
<p>Contemplative Rebellion gives a percentage of proceeds to non-profits. Many of those listed on the site\'s &quot;Charities We Support&quot; page are notoriously left-wing. Some are pro-abortion.</p>
<p>Included on the list are Women for Women International, Polaris and the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>Women for Women International is a charity where women from more developed countries can give money and aid to women in need in other parts of the world. But the international non-profit also promotes contraception and abortion and has partnered with Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>Polaris is a group that, among other things, claims to fight human trafficking. But Polaris is also pro-abortion, having denounced Republicans in the U.S. Senate for defending the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal Medicaid funding for abortion (with the typical exceptions for life of the mother, rape and incest).</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is a radical leftist group that claims to fight racism, discrimination, hatred and extremism. In its early days, the SPLC indeed fought in the courts against the Ku Klux Klan. But in recent years, the SPLC has been accused of smearing conservative political opponents — including Christian pro-marriage organizations, and even Church Militant itself.</p>
<p>The SPLC is also pro-abortion. In 2009, it denounced the pro-life activists at Operation Rescue as &quot;militant anti-abortionists.&quot;</p>
<p>While adding a pro-gay prayer intention to the Most Holy Rosary, Contemplative Rebellion is more true to the original with the Muslim prayer beads (known in Arabic as tesbih) and Tibetan Buddhist prayer beads (mala or japamala in Sanskrit) offered in its online store.</p>
<p>The small startup also sells a rainbow-themed wrap bracelet called &quot;Love is Love is Love.&quot; The product description on the website states, &quot;Dedicated to the beautiful, brave LGBTQIA parents who love each other and love their children, and decide to raise them in the love and light that every child deserves.&quot;</p>

<p>Pizzagate Related because here we have a Roman Catholic priest spreading normalization of the gay life which is against the Church\'s Teachings, and he  is clearly in favor  of desecrating Our Blessed Virgin\'s Rosary, and the SACRILIGIOUS Art Work.</p>',

            Father Martin is a fraud, 
Check out the Crucifix on the rosary. Depicts Jesus with his arms folded, not outstretched.
            <br/>
            This is a satanic mockery of our Christ .
           </p>
           <p>
            Christ was crucified with his hands outstretched, as an sacrifice for out sins. 
This fake cross denies the willing atonement that Jesus made for our sins.

             I just saw it!  OOH, I wish I could upvoat you 100 times.  I am going to check it out He is blasphemous  and what he is doing is a Sacrilege.    What do you suppose that means?  Jesus with his arms crossed.   To cross the arms means you are closed to discussion, is what I found on the internet.  In other words, Christ is not inclusive?  This priest is a heretic.  Does anyone know what this signifies?

              <em>
               any
              </em>
              depictions of Christ, as I consider them idolatry. But I'm not a Catholic, so that's part of it ;)
             </p>
             <p>
              Exodus 20:4-5
             </p>
             <p>
              Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
             </p>
             <p>
              To me any visual representation of Christ is deification of a man's interpretation. And it causes divides in believers as we dont actually know what Jesus looked like. (The whole black Jesus vs white Jesus debate over "skin of bronze"). From what I can tell, the Catholic Crucifix clearly shows a European Dude.
             </p>
             <p>
              Buuuut, looking at it from a Catholic perspective, I can understand what you are seeing. Symbols mean things. And changing the crucifix is a definite symbolic attempt at subverting the "
              <em>
               traditional
              </em>
              " Catholic Church

               Thank You for responding.  Since you are not Catholic I think you also see the devastation the death of the Catholic Church would mean.  Death of All Christianity is their goal.  There was at one point a Black Christ statue in Mexico somewhere and it was confiscated.  Sick.   I don't care what color they made him but if THEY change it now I will be as suspicious as HE77.  Note that it says the goat symbol is the devil.  Good Grief.  All of this scares me mainly because of as you say, the Traditional Catholic Church.  It is the closest thing we had to the beginning.  Not saying all of the bowing and adoring is good but it depends on what is in the heart of the person.  For me it means a closeness to Jesus.  Never really idolized him.  Love is what comes to mind.  This is all very frightening to me.

                 Yep.  It's not really a good idea to be too much of a holy roller because it usually drives others away.  We know of the one in the family that has religious stuff on every wall and talks about it all the time, well usually the Children turn out the opposite.  Better to live a life of love for yourself and others with minimal adoration  &lt;3

               The first link made me cry.  Tears of Sadness.  The second one was frightening.  So many that are not Catholic pay no attention to this.  They don't seem to understand this will not only be the death of Catholicism but All Christianity.  We must all band together and fight for our right to Worship God.  Those that have Crosses and Bibles and Prayer Books hide the now and tell no one what you have.  Treasure Them. I shall never abandon you

            Sorry Carmencita, I am not seeing how a fag abusing the Rosary is related to the sexual abuse of kids. This is only indirectly related and really doesn't help our investigation at all. I'll give this the 24 Hour Grace flair, though, in case there is some connection I am missing.

             We could consider that Father Martin is allowed to continue his heresies, and promote the gay ( and pedophilic ) agenda by his bishop  Cardinal Dolan. 
Dolan supports Vogue magazine editor and he attended the Metopolitan art mockery of the Catholic Church.
We know Vogue uses models who appear to be starved to death, beaten ( I forget the name of the photographer whose instagram was filled with these children.  It was on VOAT months ago.
Catholic Church has been infiltrated by pedos, Masons.
Priests like Dolan, and Martin are very aware of the filth and ignore it.

             At the very least it helps to map out the gay-pedo-satanist network.  Fr. Martin is definitely a bad actor trying to normalize homosexuality in the Catholic Church.  I think 80% of the abuse cases in the Church were male-on-male (i.e. homosexual) in nature.

              True, but that's still a very indirect connection. We've never accepted submissions on that basis, because the community decided early on it was just a vector for shills to exploit to discredit and dismiss us. Hence the direct relevance requirement. If there is any evidence that dude is supporting rehabilitation for pedo priests (and thus might be using funds raised from rosaries to help them, for example), I would be willing to leave this up. But if it's just he's gay and most pedo priests are gay...that's not enough. This will have to go in

               How about this 2018  Catholic Conference on LGBT issues (featuring James Martin) which features a photo of a childs hand and adult hand finger walking towards each other along a rainbow? It obviously implies pedophilia in context of LGBT "rights"
              </p>
              <p>
               Father James Martin was appointed in 2017 by Pope Francis as a consultant to the Vatican's Secretariat for Communications (Vatican PR)
              </p>
              <p>
               He is also editor at large of America (the Jesuit magazine). The Jesuits just yesterday named 111 pedophile priests they knowingly protected.
              </p>
              <p>
               After he was appointed by Francis to be Vatican PR, he publishes this article explaining away the pedophilia crisis in the church, while assuring the readers, that the church is now more "rigorous"

               he's not only normalizing homosexuality, he is loyal to the church despite the sexual abuse revelations
              </p>
              <p>
               And he is using coded imagery of kids and adults in relation to LGBT issues.

                , please edit that into the main body of your post as evidence this is pizzagate relevant, and I will remove the flair.

                   Thanks so much.  He is horrid and it is important to out these guys because they try to pass themselves as quite the opposite of what they really are. I am waiting for him to trip himself up again.

                     Never again.  I felt like I drank a vat of beer and I only had an apple cider.  I was so worked over by the crowd.  Body to body.  We had to hang on to each other to stay together.  All mostly young people drinking kegs of beer.  Yeah everyone thought i drank, they couldn't believe a crowd could do that much damage.  LOL.

            I found this interesting , a teacher was recently fired in VA for not calling a transgender student by his preferred pronoun . I can’t make a post myself because I don’t have enough ccp.

            The Bible clearly states that being gay is wrong. Many times over, but gays don't want to be told they are bad or wrong in the eyes of God, so we have to normalize/gayify everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have friends who are gay, they are generally great people, but they are not godly.

             Yes, I have a far removed family member.  They are exemplary except for being gay.  If I remember correctly he was an altar boy and mother was very religious.  Possibly abused.  But yes he is one of the kindest people I know.  Not married and all that stuff and dresses like a heterosexual male.  You would never guess.
