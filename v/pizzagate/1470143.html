            I'm kind of surprised that they didn't already "suicide" Alefantis and blame it on pizzagate, perhaps they thought they would test the waters first and see if this false flag incident might be enough to rally suffidient pressure to stop pizzagate.  "Suicide"ing might still be plan B.  Unless of course Alefantis has a dead man's switch which would have to be commonly known among their circles.

            They have an event tomorrow night, with potentially a thousand people turning up in support of them. So that's a big question in itself: Why are so many people keen to offer their undying support to such an innocuous pizza restaurant which they'd previously never even heard of? Anybody with half a braincell would stay the fuck clear of that show.

            The possibility exists that they would fake such an action and sell it to the public as real.  I'm sure they have a number of scenarios to consider.  They actually have computer programs to help them decide what to do.  It's called Sentient World Simulation.
