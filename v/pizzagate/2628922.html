<p>PD: Arizona baseball coach accused of molesting children over 2-year span</p>
<p>CHANDLER, AZ - An Arizona man who coached baseball at a high school and for club teams has been arrested and accused of molesting children over a span of two years.</p>
<p>It is the second time he has been under investigation by Chandler police.</p>
<p>Richard Allen Gallegos, 53, was arrested  under suspicion of multiple counts of molestation of a child, sexual conduct with a minor and attempted sexual conduct with a minor..</p>
<p>Police said the alleged encounters happened between 2009 and 2011 and involved children ranging in age from 11 to 14 years old.</p>
<p>Two former players, , described multiple sexual encounters with the coach when they were younger, police said.</p>
<p>Chandler police said Gallegos was the subject of an investigation on similar allegations in 2009, but police did not have enough evidence to charge him with a crime.</p>
<p>At the time, he coached baseball at a club in Ahwatukee and volunteered as a coach at Seton Catholic Preparatory High School in Chandler, police said.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix confirmed in a statement that Gallegos was a volunteer coach at the school from 2009 - 2011, and that they are cooperating with authorities.</p>
<p>The school said police do not believe any of the alleged incidents happened at the school.
The Diocese of Phoenix is committed to providing a safe environment where it values and honors every individual as created in the image and likeness of God. Great efforts have been made to put systems into place to keep our young people safe,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>In a post-Miranda interview with police, Gallego admitted to knowing the victims but denied inappropriately touching them, according to his arrest paperwork.</p>',

            Ball and Ba'al are similar for a reason. Baseball is a Masonic sport. The players run from diamond to diamond, and diamonds are an important symbol in Judeo-Masonry. Most sports are Judeo-Masonic in origin if look into the symbolism. "Golf rumors" is something that one has to search with caution.

             DISGUSTING!! I mean if there is ANY POSSIBLE CHANCE what so ever then I think they should weigh in the caution of the child and fire the person suspected of such vile acts..Imagine the kids that would have never been abused had they weighed in the caution of the child. I mean anyone that cares about kids should understand this and take it as a pre requisite of working around them. I dont know too many people that have multiple accusations that arent true made about them just saying..

               I am sure that MANY LEOs schools and work places are just shitting in this metoo movement that doesnt seem to want to just let it go anymore. If anything good came from the millennial generation it was this. Though at times its hypersensitive better to weigh on the side of caution when it comes to these things as the days of letting it go unless it was rock solid proof let MANY OTHER ABUSES TO HAPPEN. Like a red carpet welcome.

            They believe the incidents did not happen at the school. Did he do these things at some cabin or summer home and make videos?  Why did they not go further with that investigation last time.  Is LE involved.  Oh how sweet.  The school honors every individual in the image and likeness of God.........Really?
