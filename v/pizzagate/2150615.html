            Wow - Great job pulling this together.  I had a feeling.  Unfortunately, it's the same feeling when I see anyone involved in anti trafficking, Haiti, child abuse, CPS, foster, and adoption.

            I was thinking the same thing about the who PA connections - Sandusky, Jackass crew, Bucks County, Bucks Camping &amp; Fishing, etc.  I have a sneaking suspicion that PA may be another hotbed.  But then again, where aren't there hotbeds?

            Then changed it to Thorn in 2012. Wonder why?

            The other odd thing, AK seems to be the go to person to also raise social media to the masses sometimes hiding behind the guise of charity type causes. As we know, social media has become SJW platforms and the spread of propaganda. Here, AK promotes MySpace. AK &amp; DM we're BIG players in promoting Twatter when it first came out.

            DNA Foundation- main purpose is REAL ESTATE and implementing laws for "second chances". Reminds me of the California SB 1322 which basically legalizes child prostitution under the guise that the victims shouldn't be punished. These are the type of laws DNA is pushing. Never mind the fact if a child prositute is caught, the cops can't go after the pimps bcuz it is now LEGAL that the child is prosituting. They can only arrest the pimp if caught in the act.

             Kutcher told police that he went to Ashley Ellerin's home the night before and knocked on her door, but no one answered. He peeked through the window and saw what he thought was spilled red wine on the floor. He then left. Ellerin was found dead by her roommate early the next morning. She had been stabbed dozens of times, and her head had been nearly severed from her body.

            I'm gobsmacked that with all the posts on Voat about these two people no one has thought to link to all the past work.  That actually helps it not to get lost.  I guess re-discovery has its uses too.

             I was watching the show "silicon valley" a few weeks ago, and one of the ongoing subplots had a guy develop an ap that was supposed to identify food by picture alone. Turns out that it was only useful in identifying hotdog or not hotdog. After knowing about Thorn, this obviously all about the technology that Thorn is using. I think it was in season three. Silicon Valley also has a Satanist character, a blood transfusion boy, and a lot of other pizzagate material. I highly recommend it.

            Ashton couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  He has zero acting capability, talent or charisma.  It's almost embarrassing watching him try to act.   Like most talentless, boring hacks not willing to accept that their station in life will be commensurate with their abilities, Thorn has to join the luciferian freemasons if he's going to get anywhere. If he had to depend on his intelligence, wit or talent, he would get nowhere. The freemasons are a bunch of sorry-assed losers with micro-penises who are acutely aware of their patheticness and nothingness but know that the freemason brotherhood will give them a hand up to a place they would not otherwise reach.

            No one has mentioned the very weird, sudden death of AK's ex, Brittany Murphy...or the death of her husband a few weeks later.... He dumped her for Demetria Guynes, ( Demi Moore... whose mother sold her to men!!!! and died of drink, after being a shameful annoyance to her daughter).... Ashton?.... His name is Christopher... all the fake names.. ever seen his TWIN BROTHER????.. Demi was married to Walter Bruno...* Bruce Willis.... * but even Walter Bruno is not his real given name.... These people are all connected, and not at all what they appear to be..... Demi was married to Freddie Moore back in the early 80's, I believe....... ever look into that guy?.... you guys are just scratching the surface..... why do you think these celebrities are in such a panic?.... all someone has to do is blame one of them for blabbing and they get the dirt nap... its ugly, for real.... I actually feel sorry for some of them; the ones that didn't have a choice....they were born/sold into it..... but the ones who had a choice and chose this filthy life can rot in Hell.

             This would make a great post. I hope you'll consider doing that. We need to collectively focus more on the Hollywood pedos. If normies get a dose of reality via their favorite actor/idol, it might be a solid blow to Cognitive Dissonance.

            : Can you please add the rest of the sources to this post? All of the claims in the first two paragraphs need links supporting them -- even if it's just to a previous Voat thread on the topic (as long as that thread has links supporting it). Otherwise, we are going to have to remove this per Rule 2. But I will give you a little time to add them. Also, you need the link to "I remember reading an article...".
           </p>
           <p>
            EVERY important claim needs a link, or this looks like one of the baffle with bullshit disinfo posts (which I know you don't want).

              No. It wasn't Ashton Kutcher. But, he was a co-star in something she was in at the time. I think Kutcher was 19 when she got with him.

            she may have his ear but he still does what he thinks is right. She wanted him to stay in the Paris Climate Accord, he didn't. He may trust her but i would hope you could trust your kids. I just think that while she may want something that doesn't mean she is going to get it even if she is his daughter.

            Have you ever watched Two and a Half Men?  Not my favorite program.  I tune in once and a while to see if AK is on just to see if I catch anything strange.  Believe me it takes everything I have to watch.  He was lying on the sofa with his laptop when they showed the screen and there low and behold was a scene with a bunch of gussied up people with ball gowns and masks and all decked out.  I was in mortal shock.  That was it.  Nothing mentioned.  I turned it off.  What was the point of that I wondered.   Also here is another tidbit about him I found:  Was once so poor, he donated his blood for money while attending the University of Iowa. Have you ever wondered, did he ever try to get fresh with any of Demi's daughters.  I think about it once in a while whenever their names come up.  I will never forget that other strange moment when he blew Butterfly Kisses to John McCain while testifying to Congress regarding Thorn.  The items included in the post prove that he is very involved with McCain and I often wonder if McCain is his handler. Truthfully AK has always turned my stomach.  McCain too, really.

             Some people were suggesting that he had an affair with Rumor right around the time he broke up with Demi. There are some very suggestive photos of those two. Here's one example:

             I remember when Ashton was on Real Time w/ Bill Maher back in 2008 and he said the election was tough for him as he really liked both McCain and Obama.  He's sketchy to say the least.

              To say the least.  As I said he makes my stomach turn, and I mean that lightly.  He makes my skin crawl and I would cross the street to avoid passing him.  Demi Moore must have known he was a pedophile and yet she married him, having 3 young daughters.  Shameful, that's  what they are.

            the day Ashton Kutcher testified before congress on child abuse and trafficking is the day I know he was part of the vile network. the first thing he did was blow a kiss to John McCain. Weird. AND he had on this strange red pin which I don't know what that was but it gave me a vibe. There is a video of Demi Moore at a birthday party for a 12 or 13 year old boy where she french kisses him and his parents are right there and they do nothing. Disturbing as well.

              It probably has to do with levels of Satanism/Secret Order levels.  Top dogs like the pope and Anthony Podesta get to wear the red Prada shoes.  Mid level one like AK get to wear a red "X" or something like it.  It would interesting to identify the piece and see who else wears it.  It may break open some other leads.

               I think they all should be marked with a branded P for pedo on their forheads so no child will go near them and maybe a sp for satanic pedo. Creeps are making our world evil. They must be stopped branded and locked up.

                Just came across this-- apparently Max Spiers was found with a large red mark on his forehead after he died. It was 3 inches long by 1 inch wide. If he was assassinated for telling the secrets of the elites and investigating A Queen Oh's pedo ring, might they have left their mark on his forehead like a calling card? Here's a recording of Max's mother talking about it, as shared in someone else's video:
