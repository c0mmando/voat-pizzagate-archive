<p>&quot;Actor Matthew McConaughey was featured in an anti-human trafficking video with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released Friday.</p>
<p>“When you hear the words human trafficking, you probably think that is something that only happens to people in other countries,” Matthew McConaughey said. “But the victims of sex and labor trafficking can and do come from anywhere including right here in Texas. Texans–men, women, boys, and girls, are forced into a horrifying form of modern-day slavery everyday.”</p>
<p>“Right now in Texas, there are more than 300,000 human trafficking victims and 79,000 minors and youth victims of sex trafficking. The office of the attorney general tracks down and prosecutes those responsible for this atrocious crime. But we can’t fight this alone. Texas needs your help,” Paxton says in the video.</p>
<p>“Let’s put all the eyes of Texas on the fight against human trafficking. You can help by recognizing the red flags, and reporting suspicious activity to the National Human Trafficking hotline,” McConaughey added.</p>
<p>Though McConaughey has expressed certain liberal views before, he’s certainly more down-to-Earth than many other Hollywood celebrities.</p>
<p>Following President Trump’s Inauguration, McConaughey said that Hollywood should “embrace” Trump’s presidency.</p>
<p>“Well, they don’t have a choice now. He’s our president. And, it’s very dynamic and as divisive of an Inauguration and time as we’ve had. At the same time, it’s time for us to embrace and shake hands with this fact. And be constructive with him over the next four years,” McConaughey said.&quot;</p>',

            We had a janitor at work at few years back, said Matthew McConaughey was his cousin.  He looked a lot like him.  He was a good ol' Texas boy.  It would be nice if Matthew was a good guy.  But hollywood is so very messed up, you have to wonder about someone as successful as he is.

             THat's not how the world works- And Matthew McConaughey HAS told a lot of what He knows- By his amazing performance in True Detective. He was amazing, Because He had a lot of
             <em>
              "Real World" Context
             </em>
             , to basis His role on.
             <em>
              I get it, It's just a Hollywood Production- But It's basically A true story
             </em>
             -
             <strong>
              And Sheds light on Some shady shit- In an extremely Real way.

             <strong>
              There are a shit ton of Series on Netflixs right now that Are exposing the deepstate in ways We've never seen before.
             </strong>
             It's unfortunate that many of the Vocal people on this forum- Always jump to the conclusion that, "THEY ARE TRYING TO NORMALIZE THIS SHIT" or "THEY ARE MOCKING US"......
            </p>
            <p>
             It's Ironic that You never Hear anyone apply that logic To Stanley Kubrics eyes wide shut.... We can all agree that he was trying to expose the shady shit.... But It seems That unless You get Suicided- No one Gives you the benefit of the doubt.

            <p>
             Also, He Has Told us what he knows, BY NOT ATTACKING Trump... He Knows what Trump Is up against, And Considering He's only one of a few, To not hop on the Anti-Trump train- Let's not Direct Energy At Him. He's far From the bad guy.

              Edit: Admittedly, I really Need to stop Speaking In absolute terms when it comes to only a handful of comments- I'd like to think that the majority of people DO give a lot of these people/shows the benefit of the doubt.

              I personally believe that anyone who is as famous and as highly paid as Matthew McConaughey isn't allowed to reach that status without joining a fraternal order of some kind, which eventually will always lead to them having to perform A. acts of pedophilia and B. human sacrifice. If someone is a very well-paid millionaire actor, you can bet your bottom dollar that they didn't just HAPPEN to reach that status: they followed the rules of the Brotherhood and were propelled to that status by their Freemasonic handlers.

               I'm not talking about Matt Specifically when saying this..... But "joining  A fraternal order of some kind" Has A wide range of Meanings.... I mean, You could Be BORN into a Franternal order of some kind.  THAT is where the majority of actors Come from...
              </p>
              <p>
               It's not that they grew up in a random house hold, moved to hollywood, And got famous- A lot of them Have Very prominent Parents, HAVING NOTHING to do with Hollywood... Hollywood Is is simply  a facet of the deepstate.
               <sup>
                (or Shadow Government..Whatever you want to call it.... behind the scenes Elite, Fuckery.. I hate saying elite because the fuckery trickles down the lowest level.)
               </sup>
              </p>
              <p>
              </p>
              <p>
               But yeah- I don't really Know Matt's early childhood, Other than what he's mentioned in interviews. Maybe you're right, he joined it, Maybe he was born into it- Maybe he was the Few Random people to conqur hollywood without selling his soul.... Those People do exist....
               <sup>
                In my opinion of course.
               </sup>
              </p>
              <p>
               For example,
               <strong>
                Denzel washington comes to mind
               </strong>
               - He had a fucked up child hood-
               <sup>
                In my opintion
                <sup>
                </sup>
               </sup>
              </p>
              <p>
               And has his deepstate roots-
               <sup>
                In my opintion
                <sup>
                </sup>
               </sup>
              </p>
              <p>
               But he aint a bad dude. He doesn't fuck kids- He Hasn't sold his soul to the devil- And he almost always Exposes The Deepsate, (or shadwo government- or whater)  eveytime he opens his mouth in an interview.
              </p>
              <h2>
               So my point is- you can get In hollywood, By Joing the Cabal, But you can also be born into.... ANd BORN INTO, doesn't have to be litearl... You can simply be a child victim, that Is now given a chance to shine in hollywood- SHINES- but doesn't engage in the shit.... But they aren't a threat beacuse They are guilty of simply NOT Exposing what they were once victim to...

             <p>
              Thank you, Spez. You've pretty much nailed exactly how I've felt about the narrative, especially the production, cast and writer of shows like True Detective
              <em>
               (don't underestimate Harrelson too, he's a good dude).
              </em>
              You're also as self-critical. Nice alternate McConaughey spelling, by the way. :P
             </p>
             <p>
              There was speculation a while back as to MMcC's wife being in some weird occult stuff, but I could only gather unsubstantiated hearsay. As for recent series like OA, TD, etc... I've been obsessed with Pizzolatto's work and was researching a lot of referential, inspired, &amp; real-life cases while reading PG concurrently, so I've got way too much to say about it
              <em>
               (you can see
               <a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/deeper-meaning-true-detective-season-one/">
                https://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/deeper-meaning-true-detective-season-one/
               </a>
               )
              </em>
              . But I would hope to encourage anyone who's interested to watch both seasons of the show, and see it for how it analyses human psychology and criminology. As a dramatization/documentation of the real world, in the same way Sicario or WACO is.

              <p>
               But my Point For writing this comment, is to ask if you are the author to the link you posted? if so, then I'm going to be sending you some shit.....
              </p>
              <p>
               That being said, Dude, I Couldn't agree more regarding true detective as a whole- Both seasons. 
I never understood the hate..... well, I mean I did- Simply because Harleson and Mcchonahuyeu Are hard to fucking beat. But I also think it's a combination of Season 2, Hitting A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO HOME....
              </p>
              <p>
               Like seasons one, was true.... But It takes place in lousiana...season 2, Takes place in california- It his so close to home, they had to make up a fucking city for the Setting of season 2.
              </p>
              <p>
               So again- Season 1, Was most certainly The better cinematic Production- But I think a lot of hate on season 2, Stems to the Bluntness of the Plot line-(corrupt COps straight up murdering good cops etc.) In addition to having a setting that Hits too close to home.

                Hey, FUCKYOUSPEZ, sorry to respond so late, and apologies again for the name; I should have guessed it was a dig at reddit's management
                <em>
                 (I didn't know he got caught altering comments himself, thanks).
                </em>
               </p>
               <p>
                Once again, it seems we're pretty similar, in that you're just as self-analytical, you're likely prone to over-thinking, you've a keen sight for reality and it's distorted, meta-cognizant depiction in entertainment, and I've the same feelings towards season 2. Honestly, I can't get enough of that brooding atmosphere and I could watch tenfold more hours of it. Frankly, I don't think I've ever identified with a character as strongly as I have Rust, in all my life
                <em>
                 (though still in my twenties).
                </em>
                And I don't mean his behaviour so much, although he's very reminiscent of my philosophical, previously suicidal brother. I've never been to the States, I've never travelled, but I share a lot of fatalistic views, if accidentally. Not to mention an interest in the paranormal, the more off-beat side; missing children, wilderness, caves, pseudo-history, native folklore.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm sorry to say that I'm not the author of that article, but please feel free to send anything my way. I'm just as obsessed with the themes and parallels behind it, and I'd love to see anything you have. VC has a few more essays like that and I've collected similar references in the past. I guess I don't have much more to add on this voat topic, but it's nice to read from you and I think you're a cool guy. Glad for your input.

             SunajAeon- THat's not how the world works- And Matthew McConaughey HAS told a lot of what He knows- By his amazing performance in True Detective. He was amazing, Because He had a lot of "Real World" Context, to basis His role on. I get it, It's just a Hollywood Production- But It's basically A true story- And Sheds light on Some shady shit- In an extremely Real way.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are a shit ton of Series on Netflixs right now that Are exposing the deepstate in ways We've never seen before. It's unfortunate that many of the Vocal people on this forum- Always jump to the conclusion that, "THEY ARE TRYING TO NORMALIZE THIS SHIT" or "THEY ARE MOCKING US"......
            </p>
            <p>
             It's Ironic that You never Hear anyone apply that logic To Stanley Kubrics eyes wide shut.... We can all agree that he was trying to expose the shady shit.... But It seems That unless You get Suicided- No one Gives you the benefit of the doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, He Has Told us what he knows, BY NOT ATTACKING Trump...  He Knows what Trump Is up against, And Considering He's only one of a few, To not hop on the Aint Trump train- Let's not Direct Energy At Him. He's far From the bad.
