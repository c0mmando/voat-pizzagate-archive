             ”Russians are major investors in French vineyards, but it’s the Chinese who have made headlines with their rapid acquisition of Bordeaux châteaus over the past three years. Bordeaux’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIB) has a desk devoted to helping Chinese investors in the region, but denied any firsthand knowledge of money laundering. “We are just intermediaries. There are intelligence services that follow these transactions very closely,” said Emmanuelle Fragnaud, project manager for the Chinese market at the CCIB.”

              Thanks for posting that. It's quite a tale. I wonder why no one posted that here last summer?

              The fact that the only two people this guy really dishes on are Roger Stone and Cole Romney, and he dropped this to /x/ the day before Maxwell's arrest, makes me think this is disinfo similar to the Shareblue "hacked Comet pizza menu" offering a "Haitian Special" we saw pushed here shortly after Trebillion reported the Comet server to DC Police and the FBI. Particularly since he didn't actually see Stone, but a "big man wearing a bull's head mask, with a Nixon back tattoo" which he later Googled and conveniently found dozens of MSM features on Roger Stone. Classic example of persuasion by confirmation bias.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do we have any corroborating evidence that Stone traveled to Little St. James?  Is he in the flight manifests?
             </p>
             <p>
              I also found it rather unbelievable that he remembered the EXACT gps coordinates of where he delivered Cole Romney's dead woman years ago.  Riiiiiight.
             </p>
             <p>
              And then there's the fact that he began his tale with "

             <p>
              Isn't it interesting that the press covered the "Driver's" allegations about Stone, but not about Cole Romney, who he claims killed and disappeared multiple young women?
             </p>
             <p>
              And isn't it interesting this whole revelation got so little traction?

               Did a bit more digging on "Cole Romney". This looks like disinfo as well, as there is no record of such an individual related to Mitt, as is implied.

            Hunter keeps a ferocious schedule. All that sex, drugs and flying all over the place. How does he find time to do any work for Burisma? Oh that's right, he does not actually do any work for anyone. He just picks up the loot for Pop.

              Covid-19 did not begin in China as the media would have you believe, it began as early as October 2019, possibly even April 2019 in Wisconsin and Illinois, and it was covered up as E-cigarette deaths.

               As readers will recall from the earlier article (above), Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists and pharmacologists have determined that the new coronavirus could have originated in the US since that country is the only one known to have all five types – from which all others must have descended.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wuhan in China has only one of those types, rendering it in analogy as a kind of “branch” which cannot exist by itself but must have grown from a “tree”.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Taiwanese physician noted that
               <strong>
                in August of 2019 the US had a flurry of lung pneumonias or similar, which the Americans blamed on ‘vaping’ from e-cigarettes
               </strong>
               , but which,
               <strong>
                <em>
                 according to the scientist, the symptoms and conditions could not be explained by e-cigarettes.
                </em>
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               He said he wrote to the US officials telling them
               <strong>
                <em>
                 he suspected those deaths were likely due to the coronavirus
                </em>
               </strong>
               . He claims his warnings were ignored.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cases involved in the outbreak of severe lung illness associated with vaping products were
               <strong>
                first identified in Illinois and Wisconsin
               </strong>
               in April 2019.

                  Have been here so long following the excelkent work done by you and others!  I remember being brand new and quite overwhelmed/intimidated by the voat pros and the shills — and the chalkenges involved in discerning who was who.  Seems like recently, yet now I am a long term lurker and see so many fresh young questioning viaters!

              It will be great if something substantive comes from your work, but even if not, your work alone distinguishes you as a solid MVP.
