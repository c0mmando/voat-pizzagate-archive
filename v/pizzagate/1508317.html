             Dave Stone admits to being David Flintstone and Bif Skipman in a recent interview, but denies any connection to Cheesybay:
             <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/David_%22Flintstone%22_Stone#Interview_with_David_Stone_on_this_story">
              http://pizzagate.wiki/David_%22Flintstone%22_Stone#Interview_with_David_Stone_on_this_story
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Bif Skipman's facebook references a "CHEESEBAY" in its ridiculous bio, but not a direct reference to "cheesybay", which is the actual eBay seller.
            </p>
            <p>
             Really, the only "hard" evidence that Dave Stone is connected to cheesybay would be the "Grand Poobah" reference and the testimony of his former employee, but I'm unable to find any reference to being a "Grand Poobah" on cheesybay personally. On top of that, the former employee's Reddit history seems to corroborate methamphetamine use and bizarrely irrational behavior and paranoia (such as slaughtering his neighbors chickens and posting near-incoherently about it).
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been into the cheesybay legend for years, and honestly no matter how hard I try there's no compelling evidence yet connecting it to David "Flintstone" Stone of Island Distillers.
            </p>
            <p>
             On a final note, it should be mentioned that the former employee has since left working for Island Distillers and hasn't made any further statements.

            It's also not ruled out that Dave Flintstone (an obvious alias) is a name borrowed in the aftermath of the other Dave Stone's death.

            It's not clear yet that it's a false connection. Admiral David Stone died suddenly and unexpectedly (in his 50s) with no immediate cause of death given, four months after his scheduled meeting with HRC. The company Stone Harbour was formed by he and Jim Blom, and soon after he died, but the name was kept. Jonathan Sorrell was a large investor in Stone Harbour up until just after the 2016 election. He sold hundreds of thousands of shares two weeks after Hillary lost. This is covered in another post, but I don't have time to track it down right now.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Retired Rear Adm. David M. Stone, who once headed the Transportation Security Administration and was the first federal security director at Los Angeles International Airport in the critical months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, has died. He was 57.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stone's untimely death occurred over the weekend, several days after attending an awards ceremony for TSA employees in Arlington, Va., agency officials said. He had traveled to the event from his home in Bangalore, India, where he worked for Cisco Systems Inc. as a senior executive in charge of safety and security.
             </p>
             <p>
              The cause of death was not available Wednesday.
             </p>
             <p>
              Shortly after retiring from the Navy in April 2002, Stone was appointed federal security officer at LAX, the nation's third-busiest airport. At the time, LAX had been identified by state and federal authorities as one of the nation's top potential targets for terrorists.
             </p>
             <p>
              During 11 months on the job, Stone established the security standards required by Congress as a result of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. His work represented one of the most ambitious security overhauls in the history of U.S. aviation.

            WHat about the alleged email about the sleeping partner and mr potatohead? Can't find anything on that on the Flintstone page.

             Because it was taken from David Flintstone's email and not actually part of any official leaks, and I wanted to keep them from being confused. The sleeping partners email is strange, but it's not criminal and there's no clear association to any persons of interest

            Nice presentation! 
So is this correct:  Cheesybay is still out there as an unknown but probable seller of CP, and Admiral David Stone (deceased) has yet to be researched?

             Yes and yes! I wanted the Admiral to not be confused with David Flintstone since there seems to be a great deal of that already and this means the owner of Cheesybay still needs looking into.

              I added the admirals obit, and hope to look into him a bit more soon. The connection to TSA and 911 is intriguing.
