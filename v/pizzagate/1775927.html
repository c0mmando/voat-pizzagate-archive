<p>Hole\'s guitarist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Erlandson"><strong>Eric Erlandson</strong></a> is an especially interesting name regarding <strong>pizzagate</strong> studies. He is of Swedish, German, and Irish descent and related to Martin Luther. During his college years, he worked for the now-defunct <strong>Licorice Pizza record store</strong> chain. In the late 80\'s he advanced to <strong>Capitol Records</strong>, where he managed <strong>Paul McCartney\'s, Tina Turner\'s</strong>, and various other artists\' royalties. Related to kids, he co-produced &quot;Milk Carton&quot; by The <strong>Grown Ups</strong>, a raw riot of an album by a group of <strong>14-year-old girls from Santa Monica, California.</strong> Ms. Love and Mr. Erlandson got into reunion in 2014 with some other names from the original Hole setup, so the relationship is alive between them at least on the music/business level. They didn\'t have much to say to each other for a decade before that.</p>
<p>Another name from Hole is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/10/brody-dalle-interview-im-not-going-to-be-held-down">sexually abused (Guardian, 2014-04-10)</a> child <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Dalle"><strong>Brody Dalle</strong></a>.

<h2>My conclusions</h2>
<p>Even such a quick peek into the music industry expands the saying <strong>love, sex and rock\'n roll</strong> into <strong>drugs, child rape and heavy metal</strong> (not saying all metal is bad music, there are great artists too). Young girls are lured into drugs and abused, career as an artist is provided easier after giving mouth to a manager or a producer, steady career can be expected if you keep your mouth shut on certain issues. Why this is important regarding <strong>pizzagate</strong> is that the current practice in the industry might not have changed at all. The seriousness seem comparable to the issues in the film industy. My tip to the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever there\'s a successful band with underaged kids, it\'s worth checking if there\'s any connection to child abuse.</p>

            Intelligence community uses these scenes as drug networking machines. Grateful dead for LSD grunge for heroin. In the background of these bands is a multimillion drug trade that surpasses the record sales but you can push it all harder when you control the media machine that promotes your records.

            One of the most personally disturbing parts of all this for me is it's connections to the original riot grrrl movement, something that I was very much involved with 25 odd years ago....it was a scene that was pretty much based around teenage girls making their own art....some of those people now seem to be involved in the DC/seattle/portland pedosatanist art world....some of the names that have cropped up here I actually knew back then.....
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still working out what that connection means....certainly looking back there was some stuff in common with the pizza music scene....though it was
            <em>
             far
            </em>
            more innocent and positive....that said there was always a focus on teen sexuality in riot grrrl....I believe originally it was just a DIY punk thing (remember this was before the internet...people had to make their own entertainment)...but the presence of young girls attracted both media attention, and "other" attention....some seem to have been sucked into something far darker in the time since....
           </p>
           <p>
            The last couple of years have seen me reevaluating a lot about my worldview, this part really hits close to home though....strangely I found a box of fanzines and the like from those days in my garage recently....I shall be revisiting them to see if it helps me make more sense of this...it's a strange feeling, maybe having been around at the start of this "culture" (though of course, the pedo connections go back much further into music history)

             Did you meet Kathleen Hannah?  I really like her music, although I disagree with her politics, I have much respect for her talent....I just discovered her music about 2 years ago because of a random Google search, I had always wondered who the cutie dancing in the Bull in the Heather video was.  My other music video crush (the hottie in the Bust a Move video) didn't go on to do much.
