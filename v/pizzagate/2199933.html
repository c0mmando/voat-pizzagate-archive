            half Million for a single speech is not that outrageous on the speaker circuit.  Sarah Palin who would be less in demand and less appeal to foreign audiences was getting 100K a speech for a while.  Been Bernanke gets 400K when he speaks in Asia.

             Just wondering what multiple truckers from Logan Utah are involved with that they are dying on Wednesdays... and now you are suggesting that I am mentally ill for having questions, huh.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since you are such an expert on everything and now on psychology, tell me, what is it called when somebody keeps making excuses and tries to distract attention away from other peoples crimes. There is a massive 18 or so lawyer investigation into fake Russia Hacking and yet no credible evidence has been produced except a fake piss dossier; meanwhile more and more  evidence, scores of suspiciously dead people, and now an eye witness (who was threatened by FBI) indicates real Russia/Clinton Foundation crimes. Who is the delusional one here?
            </p>
            <p>
             So you defend your criminal cabal by calling me crazy. I am not inventing any of this, and asking questions is that illegal or insane behavior?
            </p>
            <p>
             Even if I am crazy, these crimes that you are so in denial of, they are still real and your lies and your tactics are pathetic.

              I was not doing that.  The availability heuristic is not a symptom of mental illness.  It's a cognitive quirk that we all share.  We are far more irrational than we realize.  We all have a lot cognitive quirks that feel convincing to us, but it's often us fooling ourselves rather that actually getting at the truth.   It's actually requires some work to recognize this glitches in ourselves.  What I was pointing out was a method of testing if your question is valid, if it stands up.  It's a part of critical thinking.  To actually do critical thinking you need a grounding in some of these cognitive quirks that make us believe our own stories.
             </p>
             <p>
              You claim I am trying to distract from crimes.  What I am doing is asking for evidence that stands up scrutiny.  The grand allegations are not supported by similar grand evidence.

               Perhaps if witnesses were constantly being killed off by things like instant sarcoidosis, two shots in the back, or barbells to the throat, the evidence not be so deeply buried.

              It is for a hedge firm that wants the cache of bringing in a former US President.  And it's in line with other speaking fees like I just pointed out.
             </p>
             <p>
              And there is no evidence whatsoever of any quid pro quo regarding this speech.  Steve Bannon's guy Peter Schweitzer had to admit this.  He had zero evidence of speech fees buying any influence.  And for good reason, it's a piss poor theory.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Hedge Firm had nothing to do with UraniumOne.
             </p>
             <p>
              Paying money to Clinton wouldn't even get you anything.  She didn't have control over whether or not this deal went through and it's a lie to claim that she did.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Nuclear Regulatory Commission could have killed this deal or perhaps forced UraniumOne to sell off its US subsidiary before the deal went through.  They are independent and don't work for State. They didn't the approval the transfer of the domestic uranium recovery license and they explained to Congressmen who asked that since they don't have an export license, this was not a risk to US National Security.  UraniumOne was already owned by a foreign company, it was just going to be owned by a different foreign company.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nor did Hillary Clinton control the interdepartmental Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.   In fact, it's the Treasury Department that heads CFIUS and its members span the US government.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The members of CFIUS include the heads of the following departments and offices:
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Department of the Treasury (chair)
Department of Justice
Department of Homeland Security
Department of Commerce
Department of Defense
Department of State
Department of Energy
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy
The following offices also observe and, as appropriate, participate in CFIUS’s activities:
             </p>
             <p>
              Office of Management &amp; Budget
Council of Economic Advisors
National Security Council
National Economic Council
Homeland Security Council
             </p>
             <p>
              None of these 15 departments objected.   Did someone at the Department of Defense or National Security or Homeland Security also get paid off? Did Bill have to split his speech fee with them? Is it some great conspiracy?  Or did this transaction not threaten US National Security.  ( UraniumOne accounted for 2% of domestic uranium production last year, btw.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh and Hillary Clinton herself did not take part in any CFIUS discussions on UraniumOne or anything else.  The Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs did.  He said he never discussed any CFIUS issues with her, nothing was every raised to the Level of the Secretary.
             </p>
             <p>
              Geez, that 500K would sure have to buy off a lot of folks.  I'm sure by the time everyone got their cut it was peanuts.

              Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Trthat held the sensitive job of transporting Russia’s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of Mikerin’s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.
