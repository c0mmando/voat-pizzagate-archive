            I build games for my kids on Roblox.
           </p>
           <p>
            The developers community is aware and is trying to remedy the situation by having all developers put a chat filter into the scripting of their games. Failure to do so means unfiltered games are pulled until fixed.

             What does Roblox do to protect my kids’ safety and privacy?
            </p>
            <p>
             At Roblox, we believe everyone should have the right to imagine, create, and play together in a safe, family-friendly environment. This means we take kids’ safety and privacy very seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
             Roblox is committed to fully complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) to ensure the privacy of our users age 12 and under and prevent them from sharing personal info via chat messages or in-game. Although users age 13 and older can adjust more account settings and have an expanded vocabulary list, Roblox employs a filtering system and moderation team to help keep players safe and restrict sharing personally identifiable information.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also strive to protect our players’ safety by proactively filtering inappropriate content and acting against anyone who is in violation of our Rules of Conduct. Players can report inappropriate chat messages or content by using our Report Abuse system, which is located throughout the site and in-game. In addition to reporting any rule violations, players can also completely block others from chatting or playing with them in-game or on the website. You can block other players on the website by visiting the offending user’s Roblox profile, clicking the three dots that appear in the upper right-hand corner, and then clicking “Block User” in the drop-down menu. You can also block players in-game by clicking on their name on the leaderboard, and then selecting “Block User.”

            Here's the note in the developer's forum.http://devforum.roblox.com/t/improving-the-safety-of-our-community/33201
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hello Developers,
            </p>
            <p>
             To better protect the community against inappropriate behavior, text filtering is now required for all in-game messaging. As many of you know, this has been an informal policy for quite some time. But to appropriately ensure the safety of the Roblox community, we need to formalize this policy and enforce it. We want Roblox to be a safe place where everyone can socialize and play.
            </p>
            <p>
             Text filtering (previously known as chat filtering) will now be required for ALL text input in-game. For those unfamiliar with it, text filtering scans any user-input text for inappropriate or harmful language. This is not limited to foul language, but all communication that could be considered harmful or personal information. This applies to every instance of user-generated text in your game, not just chat. Pet names, signs, admin messages, or any user-created text stored in datastores are just some examples of user-generated text that must be text filtered. Note: You will most likely not see your own input text filtered locally. This can be very confusing, so I want to mention this system explicitly. However, ANY text input by a user that can be accessed in any other session or is ever viewed by another user will need to be filtered.
            </p>
            <p>
             We’ve begun flagging games where user input text is not filtered. These games will be suspended until these issues can be fixed. But please note, there will be no permanent moderation action taken on your profile or your game based on this.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are happy to help you make the modifications needed to comply with this policy change. Please take a look at the video below which discusses how to use text filtering. If you have any specific questions about how to do this in your game, please contact us at
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c9adacbfbbaca5a8bda0a6a7ba89bba6aba5a6b1e7aaa6a4" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">

             Introduction to Text Filtering
We are also actively working to improve our detection algorithms and we understand that some of these flags could be false positives. If you think you’ve been inappropriately flagged, please let us know and we’ll work with you to inspect your game.
            </p>
            <p>
             We realize this requires work on your part to address -- and we are grateful for that. We don't succeed unless you succeed, but we all need to keep everyone in our community safe. We will be rolling out other policy changes in the future relating to filtering enabled (FE), specifically non-FilteringEnabled games will not be available to players under 13 years old. We will be following up with additional information on FE in a future post. We are actively working to make sure that implementing FilteringEnabled is easier and a clearly understood process.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are hoping measures like text filtering and any future updates will help us build an increasingly engaging, safe, and fun community for all Robloxians.

            So, at least the community is addressing it, and trying to remedy it. Just need to train people to act as mods and report douchebaggery. Would rather clean the shitstains out of the system than shut the system down.

            Any kid game with chat features is banned in my house for this very reason. I played one of my child's  Ipad games that had a chat feature and it was non-stop sex talk and asking ASL and asking for their "kik" number. It really makes you wonder why these companies would think having a chat feature on a kids game is a good idea.

            My 8 year old nephew plays this free game on Xbox.
           </p>
           <p>
            Always saves a bunch of video game clips of this and other games.
           </p>

            I always click on them and give him a like.

            Saw one where someone made some type of gay disco bar that he was wandering around in and maybe interacting with others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Didn't pay much attention to it honestly at the time as it was pre Podesta phishing scam release (never call them hacks, he got phished like a bitch).
           </p>
           <p>
            I know my brother saw this too so I am sure he has it under control, but now I feel compelled to go back and watch that damn gay disco video again and see exactly what is going on.
