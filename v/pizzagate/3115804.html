            Yes, he is totally correct. Vaccines are poisons and are killing and maiming children, and anyone else who is misinformed enough to accept their administration. The so-called Vaccine Court has now paid out over 4 BILLION dollars to Americans and their children who have been injured by vaccination.  This is huge attempt to cripple and dumb down Americans. People like Bill Gates, the eugenicist, are behind these programs. Not to mention the fact that Planned Parenthood is providing the fetal tissue they use. Wake up!!!!

             Nearly all modern vaccines are contaminated with DNA fragments from various animals and from aborted male and female fetuses. (2)
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems highly unlikely that a loving God would intend to have fetuses harvested, processed, and injected back into the bodies of pregnant women, infants, toddlers, and children. And surely, God did not intend to have His children place their faith in a one-size-fits-all medical intervention based on a (secret) combination of human sacrifice and cannibalism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Contrary to commonly accepted dogma, vaccines are dangerous. Vaccine researchers—fully aware of this fact—design “safety” studies to hide vaccine injury and death. Rather than compare new vaccines to an inert placebo, researchers compare them to another vaccine, vaccines, or toxic vaccine ingredients, such as aluminum, which scientists routinely use to induce autoimmunity in laboratory rats. The result of these experiments is known beforehand: at least 2% of vaccine recipients in both the test group and the “placebo” group will experience serious adverse events. Researchers write off the injuries as “New Medical Events” unrelated to the test vaccine or to the toxic “placebo.” I repeat for emphasis: Researchers intentionally injure, and sometimes kill, healthy children who would not have been injured or killed, had they been given a legitimate placebo. The FDA licenses new vaccines fully aware that industry “safety” tests are nothing more than scientific treachery. (3)
            </p>
            <p>
             The ritual of vaccination is an assault on decency, individual health, families, and on the human race. The DNA in vaccines of both fetal and animal origin has the capacity to insert itself into the DNA of vaccine recipients. (4) Vaccines currently in development will intentionally and permanently alter human DNA and the human genome. (5) Consequently, we may be among the last of our species who are fully male, female, or even human.

             2 Merck vaccine scientists (who worked on mumps vaccine) have a qui tam lawsuit against Merck for defrauding the government regarding the true efficacy of the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain. They claim it has become less effective over the years and did not actually meet FDA standards, resulting in increased outbreaks amongst the vaccinated.

              FILM TRANSCRIPT (You Tube Video taken down/blocked) NOTE: I personally saw the film where he says this.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Dr. Len Horowitz: Listen now to the voice of the worlds leading vaccine expert Dr Maurice Hilleman, Chief of the Merck Pharmaceutical Company's vaccine division relay this problem he was having with imported monkeys. He best explains the origin of AIDS, but what you are about to hear was cut from any public disclosures.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: and I think that vaccines have to be considered the bargain basement technology for the 20th century.
             </p>
             <p>
              Narrator: 50 years ago when Maurice Hilleman was a high school student in Miles City Montana, he hoped he might qualify as a management trainee for the local JC Penney's store. Instead he went on to pioneer more breakthroughs in vaccine research and development than anyone in the history of American medicine. Among the discoveries he made at Merck, are vaccines for mumps, rubella and measles...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: Tell me how you found SV40 and the polio vaccine.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: Well, that was at Merck. Yeah, I came to Merck. And uh, I was going to develop vaccines. And we had wild viruses in those days. You remember the wild monkey kidney viruses and so forth? And I finally after 6 months gave up and said that you cannot develop vaccines with these damn monkeys, we're finished and if I can't do something I'm going to quit, I'm not going to try it. So I went down to see Bill Mann at the zoo in Washington DC and I told Bill Mann, I said "look, I got a problem and I don't know what the hell to do." Bill Mann is a real bright guy. I said that these lousy monkeys are picking it up while being stored in the airports in transit, loading, off loading. He said, very simply, you go ahead and get your monkeys out of West Africa and get the African Green, bring them into Madrid unload them there, there is no other traffic there for animals, fly them into Philadelphia and pick them up. Or fly them into New York and pick them up, right off the airplane. So we brought African Greens in and I didn't know we were importing the AIDS virus at the time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Miscellaneous background voices:...(laughter)... it was you who introduced the AIDS virus into the country. Now we know! (laughter) This is the real story! (laughter) What Merck won't do to develop a vaccine! (laughter)
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: So what he did, he brought in, I mean we brought in those monkeys, I only had those and this was the solution because those monkeys didn't have the wild viruses but we...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: Wait, why didn't the greens have the wild viruses since they came from Africa?
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...because they weren't, they weren't, they weren't being infected in these group holding things with all the other 40 different viruses...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: but they had the ones that they brought from the jungle though...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...yeah, they had those, but those were relatively few what you do you have a gang housing you're going to have an epidemic transmission of infection in a confined space. So anyway, the greens came in and now we have these and were taking our stocks to clean them up and god now I'm discovering new viruses. So, I said Judas Priest. Well I got an invitation from the Sister Kinney Foundation which was the opposing foundation when it was the live virus...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: Ah, right...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: Yeah, they had jumped on the Sabin's band wagon and they had asked me to come down and give a talk at the Sister Kinney Foundation meeting and I saw it was an international meeting and god, what am I going to talk about? I know what I'm going to do, I'm going to talk about the detection of non detectable viruses as a topic.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Albert Sabin...there were those who didn't want a live virus vaccine... (unintelligible) ...concentrated all its efforts on getting more and more people to use the killed virus vaccine, while they were supporting me for research on the live viruses.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: So now I got to have something (laughter), you know that going to attract attention. And gee, I thought that damn SV40, I mean that damn vaculating agent that we have, I'm just going to pick that particular one, that virus has got to be in vaccines, it's got to be in the Sabin's vaccines so I quick tested it (laughter) and sure enough it was in there.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: I'll be damned
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ... And so now...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: ...so you just took stocks of Sabin's vaccines off the shelf here at Merck...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...yeah, well it had been made, it was made at Merck...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: You were making it for Sabin at this point?
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...Yeah, it was made before I came...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: yeah, but at this point Sabin is still just doing massive field trials...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...uh huh
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: okay,
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...in Russia and so forth. So I go down and I talked about the detection of non detectable viruses and told Albert, I said listen Albert you know you and I are good friends but I'm going to go down there and you're going to get upset. I'm going to talk about the virus that it's in your vaccine. You're going to get rid of the virus, don't worry about it, you're going to get rid of it... but umm, so of course Albert was very upset...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: What did he say?
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...well he said basically, that this is just another obfuscation that's going to upset vaccines. I said well you know, you're absolutely right, but we have a new era here we have a new era of the detection and the important thing is to get rid of these viruses.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: Why would he call it an obfuscation if it was a virus that was contaminating the vaccine?
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...well there are 40 different viruses in these vaccines anyway that we were inactivating and uh,
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: but you weren't inactivating his though...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...no that's right, but yellow fever vaccine had leukemia virus in it and you know this was in the days of very crude science. So anyway I went down and talked to him and said well, why are you concerned about it? Well I said "I'll tell you what, I have a feeling in my bones that this virus is different, I don't know why to tell you this but I ...(unintelligible) ...I just think this virus will have some long term effects." And he said what? And I said "cancer". (laughter) I said Albert, you probably think I'm nuts, but I just have that feeling. Well in the mean time we had taken this virus and put it into monkeys and into hamsters. So we had this meeting and that was sort of the topic of the day and the jokes that were going around was that "gee, we would win the Olympics because the Russians would all be loaded down with tumors." (laughter) This was where the vaccine was being tested, this was where... so, uhh, and it really destroyed the meeting and it was sort of the topic. Well anyway...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: Was this the physicians... (unintelligible) ...meeting in New York?
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman...well no, this was at Sister Kinney...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: Sister Kinney, right...
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...and Del Becco (sp) got up and he foresaw problems with these kinds of agents.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: Why didn't this get out into the press?
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...well, I guess it did I don't remember. We had no press release on it. Obviously you don't go out, this is a scientific affair within the scientific community...
             </p>
             <p>
              Voice of news reporter: ...an historic victory over a dread disease is dramatically unfolded at the U of Michigan. Here scientists usher in a new medical age with the monumental reports that prove that the Salk vaccine against crippling polio to be a sensational success. It's a day of triumph for 40 year old Dr. Jonas E Salk developer of the vaccine. He arrives here with Basil O'Connor the head of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis that financed the tests. Hundreds of reporters and scientists gathered from all over the nation gathered for the momentous announcement....
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Albert Sabin: ...it was too much of a show, it was too much Hollywood. There was too much exaggeration and the impression in 1957 that was, no in 1954 that was given was that the problem had been solved , polio had been conquered.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...but, anyway we knew it was in our seed stock from making vaccines. That virus you see, is one in 10,000 particles is not an activated... (unintelligible) ...it was good science at the time because that was what you did. You didn't worry about these wild viruses.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Edward Shorter: So you discovered, it wasn't being inactivated in the Salk vaccine?
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr Maurice Hilleman: ...Right. So then the next thing you know is, 3, 4 weeks after that we found that there were tumors popping up on these hamsters.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Len Horowitz: Despite AIDS and Leukemia suddenly becoming pandemic from "wild viruses" Hilleman said, this was "good science" at that time. "

             US GOVT ADMITS PAUL OFFIT’S ROTAVIRUS VACCINE CAUSES DEADLY ADVERSE REACTIONS
            </p>
            <p>
             "One of 3,415 new rules (which surely should’ve been in place when rotavirus vaccines first began being administered) officially adds intussusception to the Vaccine Injury Table for rotavirus vaccines under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rule states:
            </p>
            <p>
             The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program allows a family of a child, a person, or their estate to receive monetary compensation if they experience a vaccine-related injury or death after receiving a covered vaccine. Currently, no adverse event is listed on the Vaccine Injury Table for rotavirus vaccines. However, recent data point to a small risk of intussusception, and the rule amends the Vaccine Injury Table to provide for this adverse event.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rotavirus vaccine is administered at two, four, and six months of age in combination with other vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the VAERS Database at the time of writing this article, of the nearly 11,000 adverse events reported in children under three after receiving a rotavirus vaccine, there are 532 incidents listed where a child under the age of 3 received a rotavirus vaccine and later presented with intussusception. (Note: there were actually 542 cases, but age was unknown in 10 of them.)"
            </p>
            <p>
             "This particular vaccine has always stood out as especially controversial considering both its revolving door, conflict-of-interest origins and the fact that the FDA admitted in 2010 these vaccines were contaminated with DNA from two pig viruses.
            </p>
            <p>
             First, about those pig viruses (via the National Vaccine Information Center):
            </p>
            <p>
             On May 7, 2010, the FDA announced that RotaTeq vaccine was contaminated with DNA from two porcine circoviruses: PCV1 and PCV2.  To date the vaccine manufacturer, Merck, has not given any information regarding if, or when, PCV1 and PCV2 will be removed from this vaccine.  Although PCV1 has not been associated with clinical disease in pigs, PCV2 is a lethal pig virus that causes immune suppression and a serious wasting disease in baby pigs that damages lungs, kidneys, the reproductive system, brain and ultimately causes death.  The FDA recommended temporary suspension of the use of Rotarix vaccine on March 22nd after DNA from PCV1 was identified in Rotarix, but did not call for suspension of the use of RotaTeq vaccine after PCV2 was found in RotaTeq. On June 1st, NVIC called on Merck to voluntarily withdraw RotaTeq from the market until PCV2, especially, is removed from the vaccine."

             "Stanley Alan Plotkin developed vaccines in the United States during the mid to late twentieth century. Plotkin began his research career at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he studied the rubella virus. In pregnant women, the rubella virus caused congenital rubella syndrome in the fetus, which led to various malformations and birth defects. Using WI-38 cells, a line of cells that originated from tissues of aborted fetuses, Plotkin successfully created RA27/3, a weakened strain of the rubella virus, which he then used to develop a rubella vaccine. "
            </p>
            <p>
             "In 1957, Plotkin planned to volunteer for the US Air Force rather than be drafted for military service in the Vietnam War. According to Plotkin, he wanted to join the Air Force to learn to fly planes. But because of his medical training, Plotkin instead served for three years in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia.
            </p>
            <p>
             As an officer of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, Plotkin studied anthrax at the Wistar Institute. Plotkin later revealed that he requested that specific appointment because he hoped to work with the new director of the Wistar Institute, Hilary Koprowski, who had developed a preliminary oral polio vaccine. Polio was a common childhood disease that caused flu-like symptoms and sometimes affected the central nervous system, paralyzing some children. In addition to studying anthrax, Plotkin also studied the poliovirus in Koprowski's lab. He researched alternative, experimental polio vaccines and tested the new polio vaccines in the Belgian Congo, later called the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Throughout the 1960s, Plotkin strove to develop a vaccine for rubella at the Wistar Institute. Plotkin built upon work conducted by virologists Thomas Huckle Weller and Franklin Allen Neva as well as Paul Douglas Parkman, all of whom isolated strains of the rubella virus in 1962 in the US. In the early 1960s cell biologists Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead at the Wistar Institute developed the WI-38 strain, a human cell strain created using aborted fetal tissue. WI-38 cells, named after the Wistar Institute where they were developed, were among the first non-cancerous human cells that could be maintained for long periods of time without substantial degradation, making them well-suited for laboratory research. Using WI-38 cells, Plotkin cultured a new strain of the rubella virus called RA 27/3, a weakened strain of the rubella virus, which he and his research team then used to create a rubella vaccine in 1969."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Throughout the 1980s, Plotkin continued to develop vaccines for infectious diseases. In the early 1980s, Plotkin created several experimental vaccines for chickenpox, caused by the varicella virus, though those vaccines never made it to public production. In 1988, Plotkin published the first edition of Vaccines, a textbook detailing the history, theory, and creation of vaccines. The US National Foundation for Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, considered Vaccines, in its sixth edition as of 2013, to be the authoritative textbook in the field of vaccinology. Plotkin continued to seek out new vaccines, and in 1988, he published a paper for a preliminary vaccine for rotavirus, which causes severe diarrhea in infants and young children."

"DID ARMY CAUSE ANTHRAX OUTBREAK IN MILL?
Documents related to '57 research project leave unanswered questions"
Published: 10/07/2002
             </p>
             <p>
              "Today, WorldNetDaily presents the first of a two-part report on the federal government’s involvement with anthrax. In this story, WND investigates a 1957 outbreak of anthrax in a textile mill that happened to be the site of Army experiments on a vaccine for the disease. Tomorrow’s installment examines the federal investigation into the post-9/11 anthrax attacks."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Anna was stunned by her husband’s sudden death. He was only 49 years old. She had never seen Antonio sick before. She didn’t know what to tell her seven children. Anna buried her husband three days after he died. The church was full of Antonio’s friends and relatives, but nobody from management at the Arms Textile Mill attended Antonio’s funeral. Nobody, at the time, told Anna that the Arms Textile Mill was the site of tests being conducted by the Biological Warfare Laboratories at Fort Detrick, Md. It would be another 45 years before Anna ever heard about the tests."
             </p>
             <p>
              "In an amazing coincidence, at the same time as the deadly Arms Mill outbreak the manufacturing plant was the site for tests using an experimental vaccine. Tests on the mill workers – who were considered at risk for anthrax due to handling animal products such as goat and sheep hair – had begun quietly in May 1955 and were sponsored by the Biological Warfare Laboratories of the U.S. Chemical Corps at Fort Detrick. The prototype vaccine tested at the mill had been developed by Fort Detrick scientist Dr. George G. Wright. The vaccine was briefly produced a few years later by the pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, today Merck and Co. Inc. Company head George Wilhelm Merck was a principal advocate for biological warfare in the 1940s and 1950s and was a founder of Fort Detrick. Wright’s vaccine is essentially the same serum administered today to American troops and others at risk of anthrax.
Nearly a half-century beyond the Arms Mill outbreak, no definitive scientific explanation or cause for the epidemic has been discovered."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Speculation that the Arms anthrax epidemic may not have been a coincidental occurrence has been the subject of quiet debate among scientists for years. In 1999, former United Nations official and BBC correspondent Edward Hooper published a book entitled, “The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS.” Buried deep within Hooper’s 1,070-page opus is a brief section that concerns the Arms outbreak. Hooper’s research inadvertently led him to the incident through his unrelated interviews with Dr. Stanley A. Plotkin. At the time of the Arms tests, Dr. Plotkin worked for the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, Wistar Institute, and was assigned the task of medically evaluating the outbreak."
             </p>
             <p>
              "The 1959/60 annual report for the Commission on Epidemiological Survey, part of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, contains the minutes of a meeting held on March 23, 1960, which was largely devoted to anthrax. Dr. Harold Glassman of Fort Detrick (whose assistance had been acknowledged at the end of the Plotkin/Brachman paper) was the main speaker, and he opened his address with a review of the anthrax organism, including ‘ease of preparation and stability in storage and as an aerosol.’ He was especially interested in air-sampling studies at the Manchester mill and with the case of a young military volunteer who had died of inhalation anthrax at Fort Detrick in 1958 after receiving a series of inoculations of killed and live vaccines, including one against anthrax. [Glassman] stressed the fact that the Soviets appeared to have recently developed an attenuated anthrax vaccine for humans, and said that there was an urgent need from the U.S. side for ‘an examination of the protective properties of various vaccine preparations.’ Clearly, the Manchester [Arms Mill] vaccine trial had not provided all the answers.” After this, Hooper added that a portion of Dr. Glassman’s presentation “was omitted from the minutes, presumably for security reasons.”"

              And Judyth Baker , in her book, Me and Lee, explains how she worked on inserting the cancer virus into vaccines. Mary's Baby also is about this subject. The takeover by the rockefella's in the 30s of our medical system also is important........as the real healers like osteophaths were driven out......numbers reduced and mostly wealthy could even go to med. school. The wealthy believe in status quo, don't rock the boat...after all , that mindset got them rich......There used to be such a  very high incidence of death of mothers during child birth.......after Pasteur found out about the germ link, washing hands prior to delivering babies was encouraged. No big deal right? Most doctors laughed at the thought of washing hands back then as being important.

            I don't know who this guy is, but as an ex Mormon myself, I'd love to point him to some evidence of just how deep the subversion of the church goes. A temple full of false idols just opened in Rome... Look into "the socialist roots of the Mormon church"and compare them with Mitt Romney....

             "Godfather of Vaccines Admits to Experiments on Orphans and Handicapped Children" — Humans Are Free – January 18, 2019
            </p>
            <p>
             "The development of our vaccines is clearly under question, which is further described below. The following was taken from a video of Dr. Stanley Plotkin under oath.
            </p>
            <p>
             In it, he admits to using orphans, mentally handicapped kids, babies, children, and populations that have been subjected to colonial rule for vaccine testing."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Based on my research, some examples could be the first nations populations in Canada, who were used in testing by pharmaceutical companies, as well as the US MK Ultra program. This is extremely unethical, and it’s something that’s still happening in places like Africa and India.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Have you ever used orphans to study an experimental vaccine?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Have you ever used the mentally handicapped to study an experimental vaccine?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: I don’t recollect ever doing studies on mentally handicapped individuals. At the time, in the 1960s, it was not an uncommon practice.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: So you’re saying — I’m not clear on your answer. I’m sorry. Have you ever used the mentally handicapped to study an experimental vaccine?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: What I’m saying is I don’t recall specifically having done that, but that in the 1960s, it was not unusual to do that. And I wouldn’t deny that I may have done so.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Well, there’s an article entitled “Attenuation of RA 27/3 Rubella Virus in WI38 Human Diploid Cells.” Are you familiar with that article?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: In that article, one of the things it says is 13 seronegative mentally retarded children were given RA 27/3 vaccine?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: Okay. Well then, that’s, in that case, that’s what I did.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Have you ever expressed that it’s better to perform experiments on those less likely to be able to contribute to society, such as children with handicaps, than with children without or adults without handicaps?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: I don’t remember specifically, but it’s possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Do you remember ever writing to the editor of “Ethics on Human Experimentation”?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: I don’t remember specifically, but I may well have.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: I’m going to hand you what’s been marked as Exhibit 43. Do you recognize this letter you wrote to the editor?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Did you write this letter?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Is one of the things you wrote: “The question is whether we are to have experiments performed on fully functioning adults and on children who are potentially contributors to society or to perform initial studies in children and adults who are human in form but not in social potential?”
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Have you ever used babies of mothers in prison to study an experimental vaccine?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             ATTY: Have you ever used individuals under colonial rule to study an experimental vaccine?
            </p>
            <p>
             DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can watch the full testimony below, it’s the first video in a 9 part series on this Youtube channel."

              Looks like Stanley has a nice FDA approved NEW HEPATITIS B shot- just for the sexually active OLD FOLKS- 18 and up!

             <p>
              NO SALINE DOUBLE BLIND PLACEBO USED. They just compare one vaccine with another. HOW CONVENIENT!
They obviously know that the HepB aluminum adjuvant was a PROBLEM...so Plotkin got in on the "novel immunostimulatory sequence adjuvant" at the ground floor.

              Just hope you don't end up like the 529 with a Table 9 serious adverse event.....Hey, who decided that the 529 was really 1????????

PLOTKIN ALSO ADMITS 76 HEALTHY ABORTED FETUSES USED TO DEVELOP VACCINES. BABY TISSUE WAS HARVESTED AND CUT UP. see 44:03  to 46:06 and   46:15 to 46:38
Plotkin uses CATHOLIC CHURCH to defend his use of aborted fetuses in vaccine development. Says Catholic church says he will go to hell for using fetuses to which he says, "WHICH I AM GLAD TO DO"   46:48 to 48:00

              OOPS! Plotkin forgets to disclose in his curriculum vitae (presented to the attorney of the defendant) that he consults for Sanofi, Merck, GSK, and Pfizer. All vaccine manufacturers- a conflict of interest. He is being interviewed as an expert witness to the court in a vaccine related case. SEE 42:20 to 48:04

             The connection is fascist........Hitler ran on being a socialist , lost the presidential election of 1932 , but was fascist...In 1933 he was appointed chancellor but made himself a dictator...........After WWII , HQ moved from Germany to America. Pope just met with mormon leaders but in the past mormons were known as a cult. Big shake up in vatican...pope in name only. Cardinal Pell in charge of finances, read money laundering, was sent to prison..........maybe this is only about money...but this is the important link between catholics and mormons...From the book, They Thought They Were Free, the 14 points of fascism...https://www.favreau.info/misc/14-points-fascism.php. This is the top of the pyramid on pedophilia.
