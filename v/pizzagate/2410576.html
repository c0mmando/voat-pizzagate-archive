            Pandas are pretty common imagery throughout Washington DC as their zoo has giant pandas and there are only 26 zoos worldwide that have giant pandas.  And particularly common in this area as the zoo is straight down the street.

               Proximity is what makes them suspicious.  I would bet my last 5 bucks that every business on that block is part of the club.

               That being said, they are a well known kitchen company as is the bath fitting company.

               Yes, having pandas is an exclusive at the zoo.  Lots of local businesses around the zoo incorporate panda imagery into menus, etc.  The problem is the block CPP is located on is 3.1km from the National Zoo.  There is no tourist traffic there.  Panda context.
              </p>
              <p>
               Think about this though, if you were in a wealthy, pedo-dense neighborhood, who would you call to work in your house?  Bonded and pedosured?  Also makes a good cover to plant cameras in houses (stretch).

                The zoo connection also stood out for me and YES I too remember a zoo near CPP.  This is a mecca for supply of children.  Also when there are shops that are connected on 1 block, you have to wonder, does one person own all that real estate?  CIA, SA.  Same MO possibly. Yes, it would be a perfect set up.  Nothing with these people is a stretch of the imagination.

                 The fact that the entire 5000 block was owned by a Saudi company and then sold [insert memory hole details here] to Klein, I think, casts suspicion on the entire block.

                 The zoo itself has not been scrutinized.  Given the age of the zoo and penchant for DC tunnel digging, it wouldn't be crazy to think there may be physical linkage going up Connecticut Ave.

                  That's pretty good memory actually.  Most def there could be linked tunnels.  From what we have read there are tunnels all over this country and even linking Armed Forces Bases.  Btw, where are our comments.  I can't find them in the thread.

            Good finds! I tried making my own thread on this finding I made but somehow I can't find it. I am not sure if anyone touched on this yet, but DC streets as well as some other major cities around the world have so much ancient occult symbols embedded into their designs and architecture. I have been studying symbolism for quite some time. Here we have Comet Ping Pong as well as Besta and other establishments right on the upper point of this inverted pentagram. It would be interesting to look into the other stars in the map. There is a Star of David to the left of this star.
