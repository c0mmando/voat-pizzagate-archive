            Having served for two years in an unrelated AmeriCorps program myself, it's interesting that you bring that up. It has definitely crossed my mind a time or two that some of these programs--particularly those in mentoring and education literacy--may very well serve a much more sinister purpose. It is especially troubling when you consider the fact that a lot of them (Teach for America, for example) provide support to K-12 schools in economically disadvantaged/low-income areas. In no way is that to say that all who serve in these programs have ill intent, but rather, it gives certain individuals access where they wouldn't have had it otherwise.

            It's definitely worth looking into, given the history of the program. The idea for a national volunteer network was originally proposed by John F. Kennedy and came to fruition under Lyndon B. Johnson's anti-poverty platform + the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Early programs such as VISTA and the NCCC were ultimately designated under the AmeriCorps umbrella in 1993; a division of the newly-created Corporation for National and Community Service signed into law via the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. In addition to AmeriCorps VISTA and AmeriCorps NCCC, the act also allowed for the establishment of AmeriCorps State and National programs. As a result, communities of all shapes and sizes, in all 50 states, may utilize stakeholder partnerships to apply for and obtain AmeriCorps funding through the CNCS (and thereby establish local or state level AmeriCorps programs to fit the community's needs).

            Oh, and did I mention that Bill Clinton signed the National and Community Service Trust Act into law?

            I think the Judge Timothy Nolan case is part of a larger pedoring that is much like the Franklin/Boystown/Boy Scouts scandals. The judge lives in California Kentucky and guess what is also in California Kentucky which is not a large city? Holly Hill Children's Services is ALSO in California Kentucky... AND there is a current case of Louisville KY metro police and "Young Explorer Program" and so we begin

            Priest banned for molesting girl gets a new job as director of teen pregnancy center
           </p>
           <p>
            A Catholic priest who was accused of sexually abusing a 16-year-old girl has been appointed as director of a teen pregnancy center, prompting activists to call for him to be removed from the post.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Detroit Free Press reported on Monday that Rev. Kenneth Kaucheck was named director of the Gianna House Pregnancy and Parenting Residence in Eastpointe.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the paper, “the center takes in teenagers and young women who are pregnant, assisting them and any children they might later have.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The report said that Kaucheck was removed from two churches after the Archdiocese of Detroit determined in 2009 that he had sexually abused a 16-year-old girl who he was counseling in the 1970s.

              Icke exposed Jimmy Saville and Ted Heath as serial pedophiles in 1998 - Icke had the last laugh. About the reptilian stuff - take it as an allegory. Anybody who would have Tony Podesta's art is not human anyway - if you know what I mean, and unlike Fake Jones, David never sold out to any party.

             Well, TPTB have made a serious effort to try and infiltrate our schools with pedos.  There is a reason for this and I am sure you can figure it out.  Why do you think they have tried to poison our feelings about teachers getting paid too much and calling them slackers? To be able to fire them and replace them with others that get paid less and are not screened.  This is what we ended up with.  We have to get rid of them.  That means starting with the lawmakers. Out You Rats.

               Yes,  and think of how many people are aware of this.  I wonder if there are people walking around thinking about it, but don't know what to do about it or the think they are too afraid to bring it up?  Or do you think the public is just totally out there somewhere. Totally clueless.
