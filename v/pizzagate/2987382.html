<p>I\'m sure a lot of people here know about Katy Groves. She is the MKULTRA survivor who has been putting her testimonies of her life and the abuse she has endured on Youtube for over a year now, she has over a million followers on her channel. On January 3rd, Katy Groves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhNqCf5RvP0">posted</a> a video where she publicly named both her mother (Susan Groves) and her father (Kevin Groves) as her abusers. Katy has stated many times on her videos that both her parents have subjected her to a lifetime of extreme sexual abuse and mind control since birth, as part of the larger MKULTA program. Voat users have documented in <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2973357">other posts</a> that after Katy publicly named her parents on January 3rd,  her father Kevin Groves scrubbed his name from his <a href="https://clinicalpsychologistdallas.com/">website</a> for his Psychological Counseling service in Austin TX. I also searched the Psychology Today website, I know a previous <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2952692">poster</a> had found Kevin Grove\'s profile on the website. I could not find his profile on the site at all today when I searched, so he must have scrubbed that too. The rapid scrubbing of identifying information by at least one of the parents (Kevin), is very suspicious to say the least.</p>
<p>Katy\'s last video upload was on January 10th, which is 11 days ago at this point. The last thing I want to do is raise alarms without real evidence, and clearly like all of us I pray that everything is all right with Katy. I know in the past, just looking at Katy\'s channel she has had a couple weeks at a time or more between posting videos, so I guess an absence isn\'t completely unusual for her. </p>
<p><strong>Still I very very much think that after Katy publicly named her parents on Youtube, and considering her large following on Youtube, us in this community need to remain vigilant about Katy. This is just a proposal to the Admins here, but would any of you consider putting a &quot;sticky&quot; post about Katy on the top of the Pizzagate subverse, at least until we have confirmation that Katy is ok??</strong> I definitely understand this is just my proposal, but I definitely feel like we need to do something to at least show that we are aware and concerned.</p>
<p>Would definitely appreciate folks thoughts, thanks.</p>',

            I'm going to say a few things that some of you won't like, but hear me out. When listening to, or reading about this woman, you absolutely must take into account her mental illness, which she has admitted to in earlier videos. I, for one, don't believe that what she is saying is true because there is so much 'mental illness' in what she says and does. MKULTRA is like the fashionable secret government experiment that everyone loves to bring to the fore when any kind of fuckery is going on, but I've said before: MKULTRA supposedly ended in the 70's, had hundreds of sub-projects, and was superseded by other projects, MKSEARCH is an example. The age of Katy Groves does not match up with the timing of MKULTRA. If she was subject to experiments then it would have been a different name by then, lets say MKSPARROW as a fake name example. Therefore, she would be talking about MKSPARROW and wouldn't know it by the name of MKULTRA. Then on top of that, she knows so much about it and what was going on, lots of details. The whole point of the mind control experiments was to make it so that people were manipulated or altered without them knowing it! This suggests to me that it's something she's read about, mixed with mental illness delusions, and she's ran with it, got great feedback and attention for it, and it has then snowballed. So that's me trying to think critically about this.

             I only watched one of her videos, and thought that she really suffers from DID, also the actions of her parents after she made her last video were odd.

            <p>
             That's what I asked myself when I saw her video, and we had a heated discussion about the alleged mind control project 'Monarch' she says she was a victim of.
            </p>
            <p>
             How would a mind control victim know the name of a program they were in?
            </p>
            <p>
             So I think it's like OP said, I guess she just chose the names she stumbled upon when doing research on the internet (MK Ultra and Monarch), and has been using these names.

             Not calling you a shill, but I have a few thoughts. Clearly when anyone makes extreme claims, you always need to look for outside validation. The behavior of her parents is weird to say the least, but beyond that we can only judge based on what Katy has said.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know it is possible that Katy may be suffering from schizophrenia or some related condition, and that could be an explanation. However, watching her videos, she seems to be very consistent in basic details of her life, like the basic times and dates she was enrolled in (and not enrolled in) middle school, high school, and community college.
            </p>
            <p>
             If what Katy is saying is for real, then the abuse she went through deeply fragmented her mind (conscious and subconscious) into multiple personalities, or "alters" (Katy calls herself "polyfragmented DID"). In her videos, Katy goes into extensive detail about the work she is doing to try to reintegrate her alters into one consistent personality.
            </p>
            <p>
             Amongst the ritual abuse survivor community, you definitely hear other stories of survivors trying to reintegrate their own fractured personalities, so Katy is definitely not the first person to describe this sort of thing. Again, I get that without outside validation, we can't    separate delusional thinking from a genuine attempt to recover from extreme trauma. Still, Katy strikes me as very intelligent, the actions of her parents raise red flags, and I definitely think we should be concerned till we know she is safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, in regards to Katy always referring to herself as "MKULTRA": I get that MKULTRA was a real government project that was supposedly stopped a long time ago, etc. But at this point, the term "MKULTRA" has kind of become a "catch-all" phrase for things associated with mind control, ritual abuse, etc. If Katy is for real, I could definitely understand why she and fellow survivors may refer to themselves as "MKULTRA" since the term is fairly well known, even if it isn't technically the specific government program they themselves may have been victim too.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I guess those are my thoughts, God Bless.

              I think that's a fair enough reply.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm just very dubious about people supposedly remembering all the details of such things. There's a woman that I posted about before whose name escapes me at the moment. She was part of the mind control experiments and she only found out much later after getting access to documentation. She had no knowledge of her experiments at all, worse still, she had no knowledge of her life before the experiments: they had wiped her mind clean and she had to learn to live all over again. That one has the documentation to back it up as well.

               Hey guys, I just wanted to say this was a good exchange; I think all the points raised were fair and interesting, and you maintained respectful intent, more importantly. Katy's situation is incredibly complicated, and I think she knew for better or worse that she needed to do something drastic like naming places or people involved in order to heal or legitimize the condition. I was extremely grateful that she did, though I'm wary of an exceeding aftermath. In the end, the results from this disclosure are exactly what help determine the reality for those skeptical and convinced.
              </p>
              <p>
               If the parents come out appealing to the public with the claim that their daughter is mentally disturbed and needs help, that's an interesting and somewhat typical response. If the parents hide, avoid contact or start scrubbing their info online, that's also typical but indicates a denial to confront the massive accusations from their own daughter, or reluctance to face up to the internet's defence of her.

            I’d love to see a sticky about Katy also. This is a big deal. Here’s my post from 3 days ago that got barely any traction...

            KatyGroves is linked to pizzagate as she is exposing pedophile elites or pillars of the community— her parents and abusers.
           </p>
           <p>
            After she named her father and mother the dad changed his website and his address to say Dallas.
           </p>
           <p>
            But you can see the original address that he had linked to his website before on the OG post. It’s also still on yelp and a few other places online. Anyway... it’s also the address of these ladies who help kids with trauma. Seriously. His name is no where on the website but it’s the same address. Same building. Same suite.
