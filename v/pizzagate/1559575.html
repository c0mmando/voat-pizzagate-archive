<p>New member here. I have been keeping close watch on the development of the pizzagate into a world wide citizen investigation into the most horrible crime and corruption imaginable. While there are probably low level law enforcement that agree with us, the systemic corruption runs far too deep for them to expose their own leadership. I am optimistic that with time the truth will be exposed. This is why I have decided to get involved at this moment. </p>
<p>I have mostly remained on the sidelines doing my own research into possible connections and I believe I have found an important one. </p>
<p>I use to frequent another popular conspiracy forum named godlikeproductions. Some of you may be familiar. A small amount of research into this site shows it is clearly a heavily controlled and monitored. Instant ban from the website for even mentioning the word &quot;Tavistock&quot; for example....</p>

<p>When you first enter the website there is a user agreement you must agree to. If you look at the bottom of the agreement it states the sites laws are governed by a country named Jersey. I found this odd, that a conspiracy site would choose this small island for its governing laws. </p>
<p>So I did a little digging. Turns out Jersey is one of the most corrupt, controversial countries I have come across. This country is essentially a tax haven for the rich. It also was rocked by a large scale sex abuse scandal and government cover up not long ago. Check this out.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_child_abuse_investigation_2008">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_child_abuse_investigation_2008</a></p>
<p>&quot;The story starts years ago with a child abuse scandal, which was written about a fair bit in the mainstream press in Britain and Jersey, but amid allegations of a large-scale, systemic cover-up by the Jersey establishment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are no checks and balances on power and the abuse of it.  This is obvious each time one tries to make a complaint against any member of the government.</p>
<p>With such an absence of controls, such an absence of accountability, the ordinary decent people of Jersey are helpless.  Intentionally or not, the system has allowed corruption to flourish to such an extent that those seeking to combat it are the ones open to scorn.”</p>
<p>This is nothing short of an international scandal. Perhaps surprisingly, or perhaps not, I can’t find anything at all about it on the Jersey Evening Post’s website&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Among all the world’s offshore tax shelters – the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Gibraltar – the one at the top of the list is Jersey. While most everyone has heard of New Jersey, “old” Jersey has long eluded the spotlight. A 5-by-9-mile island just off the coast of France belonging to the British Crown, Jersey would rather be known for its delectable Jersey cream, cows and potatoes than its propensity for hiding billions. Yet walk into any bank on the island and anyone, not just the superrich, can open an offshore bank account without depositing a cent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Private financial wealth grew to $122.8 trillion in the past year, according to the Boston Consulting Group’s 2012 global wealth report. Breaking down those numbers, the UK territories and Switzerland, locked in heated competition to store the world’s growing pool of riches, house roughly $2 trillion each. Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, sits squarely in the driver’s seat, conservatively representing at least $5 billion a square mile.&quot;</p>

<p>The Journalist Who Was Arrested for Investigating a Pedophile Orphanage</p>
<p>&quot;Jersey is an island of around 100,000 people nestled into a cozy nook between Guernsey and the coast of Normandy. It\'s mostly been recognized in recent public memory for its potatoes and the fact that it\'s basically in France but everyone there speaks English. In 2008, however, small human remains were found at Haut de la Garenne, a former orphanage on the island. A subsequent investigation exposed a history of sexual abuse at the orphanage, tainting the good name of the people of Jersey in the world\'s media.</p>
<p>The list of suspects in the case included British government officials and—according to the detective who led the three-year child-abuse probe—media personality Jimmy Savile was also investigated by police, four years before the full extent of his crimes would eventually be exposed. The problem is, because Jersey is self-governing and has its own, slightly unorthodox court system, decades of possible crime against children in the orphanage may remain almost entirely hidden, unexamined, and untried. Since the initial media Mardi Gras, international interest has faded and locals who have continued searching for justice—including bloggers, senators, and police—have been shouted down.&quot;</p>

<p>This is just the beginning. I have a feeling this place could possible be the center of the money laundering aspect of this international child abuse ring. What I need help with is find connections to what we are seeing unfold here in the United States. Connections to the Clinton Foundation, Podesta Leaks, Epstein, Trump, Panama Papers, politcians and private corporations to make a few. We are looking for any and all possible connections to this scandal. Thanks for reading and keep up the good work everyone.</p>',

            I am convinced the Royals are somehow involved with this Island.  Does anyone remember a post on here about 1 or 2 wks. ago about the Queen tweeting out her remorse about Royals being involved in some of these acts?  Then it was reported that she would be quarantined for 2 wks. Well she has been awol for an illness and was just finally seen back in action.  I maybe wrong but it just does not pass the smell test.

            "Private financial wealth grew to $122.8 trillion in the past year, according to the Boston Consulting Group’s 2012 global wealth report. Breaking down those numbers, the UK territories and Switzerland, locked in heated competition to store the world’s growing pool of riches, house roughly $2 trillion each. Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, sits squarely in the driver’s seat, conservatively representing at least $5 billion a square mile.In the island’s glittering capital city of St. Helier, surrounded by yachts, champagne lounges and diamond shops, financial services professionals pack the streets, lined with nearly every global bank and a sprinkling of hedge funds -- the multibillion-dollar hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management and bulge-bracket bank Morgan Stanley (ms, -1.51%) are just two examples."     I have included this account of an article in Forbes Mag from 2012.  Reason being it also includes info about Romney and his holdings and whether he has holdings on the Island.   He skirts the issue.  Also I have seen some people talking about the island as a quiet gossipy town.  Not according to Forbes.  It is loaded with yachts, etc.  There is a lot more going on here than meets the eye.  I think there could be valuable information here, that is why they are steering interest away from it. The assets of the island are predicted at 5B per sq. mi?  This is in 2012 folks.  I am sure that amount has risen by now.  Dig Dig Dig!!!  I am just getting started.  I am just learning.  Those of you that are more experienced please have at it.

            Yeah, I've seen this one.. Remember the child sculptures in front of a house, nearby the pedo-center... eech.  It's like people there were talking in code, using the sculptures.

             Ive seen sex, sea &amp; satan by pie &amp; mash films too.  When I saw the child statue that abromovich threw blood over in spirit cooking and the child statue outside Alefantis blue house next to Peagus &amp; Trolley park I was reminded of the Jersey house statues.  I did try &amp; search for child effigy, child garden statue suppliers but was unsuccessful.  I wonder if there is a online store supplying these that could be hacked to get their peso customer list.

             I think the Royals are involved.  We know that Fiona Barnett has implicated them and also that Prince Andrew is involved with Epstein.  There is a connection I am sure.  We just have to find it.  I know that I saw Lord Mountbatten on a list as well.

             OK, nothing came up when I clicked on Vice.  I did click on All snapshots from host and there were a couple of articles trying to normalize and soften the aversion to pedos.  WTH?  One was about Canada and I have read articles about JT having been a victim of MKUlatra.  This stuff is really being spread all over and they mean business.  I think you are on to something with this Island.  The trick will be trying to get reputable info since the elites have been good at hiding.  But also they have been pretty confident that many will not believe it.  We have to nip that in the bud once and for all.
