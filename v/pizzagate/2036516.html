<p>In 2013, Disney made the news about MagicBands (MB).  MB\'s are the microchipped bracelets applied to every visitor and child on admission for the purpose of paying for purchases while placing their MB\'s within millimeters of the readers or when using the FASTPASS+ Line.  Then came online reports of people returning home from vacation and discovering that in their online MyDisneyExperience account, there were not only those Photo Pass pictures taken when the MB\'s were scanned but also photos while on rides.  The problem is that MB\'s are not scanned or &quot;swiped&quot; at rides.  So, these MB\'s are able to be read at long distances.</p>
<p>Also in 2013, Disney made headlines when a Congressman asked if this technology could be used to exploit children.  Disney CEO Iger &quot;responded vigorously but this was not the national press the company usually seeks out.&quot;</p>
<p>More recent news from May 2017 speaks of Iger being &quot;pushed&quot; to run for President.  Iger is &quot;intrigued&quot; with the idea.</p>
<p>Would it really matter if this information about the MB\'s resurfaced today, making headline news?  Would that deter people from going?  No, it would not, because millions have become  mindless slaves over the last 60-70 years, and The Deep State is responsible.  They have accomplished probably close to 75% of their goal, and unless a shake-up/shake-down resembling a tsunami and earthquake combined occurs, the remaining 25% will be accomplished in no time.</p>

            I did a teardown on one of these for informational purposes.  There is definitely a short range RFID (NFC) antenna and a longer range powered antenna.  I could not identify what they were using for the longer range.  My guess is that this would be somewhere in the 100 meter maybe 200 meter type of range.

            .... a lot of cruise lines are using these as well.  The people that developed them for Disney went on to develop the Carnival Cruise Lines version.

            We are one step away from all being RFID chipped so they can track our every movement.  We are definitely (as a society) ok with all the tracking and intrusion for the sake of convenience &amp; technology.

            Went there this Christmas. My youngest child's pass didn't work so we had to use a fingerprint. And a picture. :/

              Yeah, what's odd to me is if a young child is with an adult....records show the ticket is paid for/active....why not just activate the band without fingerprint or picture....neither of which I needed, ever. Why do they need a CHILD's fingerprint??? luckily it didn't work (supposedly) so they used mine in its place. Whole thing makes no sense if you ask me.
