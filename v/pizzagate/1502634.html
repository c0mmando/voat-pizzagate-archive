<p>“The North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) was formed in 1978. It was inspired by the success of a campaign based in Boston\'s gay community to defend against a local witchhunt.”</p>
<p>**“NAMBLA\'s goal **is to end the extreme oppression of men and boys in mutually consensual relationships by: 
building understanding and support for such relationships; 
educating the general public on the benevolent nature of man/boy love; 
cooperating with lesbian, gay, feminist, and other liberation movements; 
supporting the liberation of persons of all ages from sexual prejudice and oppression. 
Our membership is open to everyone sympathetic to man/boy love and personal freedom.”</p>
<p><strong>“NAMBLA is strongly opposed to age-of-consent laws</strong> and all other restrictions which deny men and boys the full enjoyment of their bodies and control over their own lives.”
So basically they are using the Gay and LGBT Blueprint to gain acceptance of Pedophilia and reduce/Eradicate age of consent laws.  See below for More Evidence. </p>
<p>“The issue of man/boy love has intersected the gay movement since the late nineteenth century, with the rise of the first gay rights movement in Germany. In the United States, as the gay movement has retreated from its vision of sexual freedom for all in favor of integration into existing social and political structures, it has sought to marginalize cross-generational love as a &quot;non-gay&quot; issue. The two movements continue to overlap, amid signs of mutual support as well as tension”

<p>“Such is the case with the homosexual agenda and pederasty (defined by the North American Man Boy Love Association - NAMBLA - as love between a man and a youth of 12 to 18 years of age). As the homosexual movement moves forward with its agenda of imposing acceptance upon every American, those wanting to see the same rights afforded to adult-child sexual relationships ride their coattails very closely.”

<p>*<strong>Media</strong>
The liberal media and elites are likely to be pushing this agenda more and more, as evident in articles by the  New York Times and thestar.com, in recent years.
<strong>“Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime”</strong>
“The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibit discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals with mental disabilities, in areas such as employment, education and medical care. Congress, however, explicitly excluded pedophilia from protection under these two crucial laws.” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014050440/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20161014050440/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html</a></p>
<p><strong>“Is pedophilia a sexual orientation?”</strong>
“Dr. James Cantor of CAMH has shown pedophilia is like a sexual orientation — a deep attraction that cannot change. Now, pedophiles who have never molested children are seeking social acceptance.”
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151029070422/http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2013/12/22/is_pedophilia_a_sexual_orientation.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20151029070422/http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2013/12/22/is_pedophilia_a_sexual_orientation.html</a></p>

           I will not link the other magazines on Archive.org I Just used screenshots as you will see in the link towards the top of the page.  There is nothing illegal there but even so they cannot be archived as they are already hosted as files on the site.

            That first link was just a stroll through the surface of some of the dark parts of the Web. Yeesh. Very good that all that info is collated as such though. I had no clue these people were organized enough to be maintaining online magazines.

            It blows my mind that the FBI or police do not just get a subpoena for the list of subscribers to these magazines.  Then just do surveillance of their homes or get subpoenas for their computers.  Seems as easy as catching drunk driver's leaving a bar parking lot.

            great work than you for putting this all together... after the TransMania TransAgenda bullshit of the last few years, there are very few aspects of society to break down for the Critical Theorists of the Frankfurst School (Cultural Marxism).

            Really useful post, and a lot of work.  Thanks.
More verification of the symbols and the widespread mainstreaming of pedophilia.

            Anyone else notice how International Boy Lovers Day falls on the solstices? Many pagan and satanic festivals and celebrations take place on those days. It seems the pedos are into the pagan calendar.

             1 of the pictures asks to light a blue candle, im not sure on what date but coloured candles are very very relevant to satanism and especially invocation and contacts with demons/devils/fallen angels. i have studied this years ago extensively before i came to Christ. but in my opinion this is spiritual satanism and not the same as the satanism practiced by the elites.

              Lucifer's color is blue. Electric blue. Demons also show up in a blue aura. Those of us who have seen Hell, agree that it has a blue aura. USE BLUE.

              *"Prayer" in Satanism is very different from what the populace has been indoctrinated to believe, given the xians and other enemy programs.
