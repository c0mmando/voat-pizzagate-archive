<p>Well, just like the shills are saying, there\'s nothing to see here. Nevermind that Bourdain had a TREPANNING COLLECTION? Yes, trepanning was the ancient art of drilling into one\'s head to remove afflictions, and Bourdain was just such a normal guy that he wanted to keep these tools around! Even went to museums that featured them and tweeted /joked about learning trepanning at home! </p>

<p>Anthony Bourdain loves trepanning tools. For the uninitiated, trepanning is the ancient and dubious art of drilling a hole in someone’s forehead to combat anything from migraines to seizures to depression. The notorious chef/TV host/author owns enough of these antique tools to be called a collection, which we find both disturbing and perfect. When queried as to why he loves these items, he replies that it’s the same reason he loves scotch: both are handmade. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hilarious ... just hilarious ... </p>
<p>and it doesn\'t explain those tools. Nor does it explain why CNN is normalizing cannibalism with stuff like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/">https://medium.com/</a>@vinnyguarino/cnn-host-eats-human-brain-seriously-e00555201f98</p>
<h1>CNN Host Eats Human Brain. Seriously.</h1>
<h1>Cannibal News Network</h1>
<p>Reza Aslan is a regular fixture on the set of CNN but a fresh face on the international cannibalism scene. To give you some context, Aslan is hosting a new program on CNN called Believer. The premise of the show is essentially Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown but focusing on religion instead of food. For the most part.</p>
<p>In the first episode, Aslan visits with the Aghori sect of Hinduism. When you think of tribal cannibals that still walk the earth — these are those people you’re thinking of. During his stay with the Aghoris, Aslan smeared a human’s cremated ashes on his skin, drank alcohol from a human’s skull, and yes, he ate a piece of a human brain.</p>

<h1>=========</h1>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://voat.co/user/shewhomustbeobeyed">@shewhomustbeobeyed</a> just gave me a heads up on an update. CDAN just posted a story that some are alleging pertains to Bourdain and his fiancee Asla Argento</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/06/four-for-friday-she-didnt-go.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/06/four-for-friday-she-didnt-go.html</a></p>
<p>Four For Friday - She Didn\'t Go</p>
<p>It was supposed to look like a murder/suicide. That had been the plan all along. The plan that had been in place since March. Then, as she began to get more and more attention and acclaim, suddenly her schedule was too busy and she couldn\'t make it. What to do, what to do? Improvise. Do what they always do. Make it look like all the rest they have done, but also make sure they send a message to her. Apparently they sent her a picture with no words. Just the picture. I\'m guessing she got the message. In the next few weeks we will see if she ignores the message or continues to be brave and fight the good fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went to Twitter to my fav CDAN researcher and sure enough found something that would contradict Argento\'s official statement about Bourdain\'s death. </p>
<p>Official statement: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/enews/status/1005118735663976448">https://twitter.com/enews/status/1005118735663976448</a></p>
<p>Asia Argento is speaking out following the death of Anthony Bourdain: &quot;He was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything but official:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Anthony Bourdain posted a picture with Asia Argento last week in Hong Kong. Then he goes to France and she gets photographed on Monday in Italy looking cozy with an Italian journalist. Now the photos have been &quot;pulled off the market&quot; b/c of Anthony\'s death. Strange. Very strange.</p>
<p>Apparently Asia Argento and journalist Hugo Clement were first photographed together on Sunday, although they were also photographed on Monday as well. (Photos of her in white shirt are from Sunday, black dress on Monday)</p>

<p>Argento’s recent Instagram story, posted around three hours before Bourdain’s death was first reported, was a photo of herself wearing a ripped t-shirt that read: </p>

<p>Argento’s Instagram story has since been deleted.</p>

<p>Lydia Tenaglia left a life in the ER to follow the \'Kitchen Confidential\' chef around the world. Now, she\'s getting into feature films with her documentary about Jeremiah Tower.</p>
<p>Remember Trauma: Life in the ER? Somebody had to stand in those emergency rooms getting sprayed with blood to get that footage. That was Lydia Tenaglia.</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of blood and guts. Sitting in the emergency room at all hours of the night,&quot; she tells me over lunch at what might be the ugliest diner in New York. Tenaglia now produces Emmy-award winning shows for PBS and CNN, and this month her directorial debut, Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent, opens in theatres across North America.</p>

            Reza Aslan is a regular fixture on the set of CNN but a fresh face on the international cannibalism scene. To give you some context, Aslan is hosting a new program on CNN called Believer. The premise of the show is essentially Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown but focusing on religion instead of food. For the most part.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the first episode, Aslan visits with the Aghori sect of Hinduism. When you think of tribal cannibals that still walk the earth — these are those people you’re thinking of. During his stay with the Aghoris, Aslan smeared a human’s cremated ashes on his skin, drank alcohol from a human’s skull, and yes, he ate a piece of a human brain.

            It was supposed to look like a murder/suicide. That had been the plan all along. The plan that had been in place since March. Then, as she began to get more and more attention and acclaim, suddenly her schedule was too busy and she couldn't make it. What to do, what to do? Improvise. Do what they always do. Make it look like all the rest they have done, but also make sure they send a message to her. Apparently they sent her a picture with no words. Just the picture. I'm guessing she got the message. In the next few weeks we will see if she ignores the message or continues to be brave and fight the good fight.

           I went to Twitter to my fav CDAN researcher and sure enough found something that would contradict Argento's official statement about Bourdain's death.

            Anthony Bourdain posted a picture with Asia Argento last week in Hong Kong. Then he goes to France and she gets photographed on Monday in Italy looking cozy with an Italian journalist. Now the photos have been "pulled off the market" b/c of Anthony's death. Strange. Very strange.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently Asia Argento and journalist Hugo Clement were first photographed together on Sunday, although they were also photographed on Monday as well. (Photos of her in white shirt are from Sunday, black dress on Monday)

            Lydia Tenaglia left a life in the ER to follow the 'Kitchen Confidential' chef around the world. Now, she's getting into feature films with her documentary about Jeremiah Tower.
           </p>

            Remember Trauma: Life in the ER? Somebody had to stand in those emergency rooms getting sprayed with blood to get that footage. That was Lydia Tenaglia.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Lots of blood and guts. Sitting in the emergency room at all hours of the night," she tells me over lunch at what might be the ugliest diner in New York. Tenaglia now produces Emmy-award winning shows for PBS and CNN, and this month her directorial debut, Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent, opens in theatres across North America.

             I mean, I'd give a pass to someone who rubs shoulders with celebrities, but when all this? Oh, hell, no! Something big is going on. Oh, and funnily enough, he was even touted today in somebody's post as being in the #metoo movement. I had to laugh at that one. Someone .... can't remember who .... said to the people to be really careful were male feminists.

            This part may be my favorite. Jealousy, hostility, ridiculously fact free. It's got everything.  This woman is a bitch for what?  Producing TV shows?   He was a penniless pauper?  He was the executive chef at a popular restaurant and had just written a best selling book.  He got the book deal based on a New Yorker article that went viral.  He had a deal for a second book.  The dude had established his celebrity already.  She came to him because of his success as a writer.  TV would make him a household name, but he was already known all over the culinary world.

            Rockefeller sponsored him. Nuff said, the guy was a walking turd. No he is a dead piece of shit. Sorry to everybody I clowned for jumping to conclusions yesterday. I should have shut my peter pan lips. Of course the loser was one of them, he had a tv show. I'm not so smart myself some time. Fuck Bourdain. Hope they eat him and it gives them gas and they stink like Hillary.

            On hanging: it is not pleasant.  It will leave an unsightly corpse that will be discovered by someone.  It's lethality is lower then that of a drowning but larger then that of "Poison by gas" due to the propensity of being discovered.   The best "solution" is to use an inert gas to replace your oxygen intake while still allowing you to inhale something.  This tricks the lizard brain into thinking it is still able to inhale and thus, nearing the cusp of death, there will be no "death dance" or contortions of the face.  The last thing a suicidal person wants to leave is a burden.  I mean, that is the point of getting out.  And here, we see someone who, all in all, is a relatively intelligent person, who has access to the internet, choosing his "GO method" as this?  Perhaps it was a matter of convince, or a sudden depressive compulsion to end it all with the available tools ready.  I won't rule that out, but here is the real question.  Why would Anthony, Kate Spade, Stephani Adams, Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, Mark Salling and Robin Williams and the Canadian Billionaire couple (Sherman/Honey)  all choose this exit method?  All of these people have money.  Hanging is either an opportunity method (as in, I'm wasted and looking to go, oh hey, a rope) or a poverty method (Cant afford the 50$ at wallmart for helium).

            Also, if you are reading this and thinking of taking the big sleep.  Don't.  It's a permanent solution to impermanent problems!  Or, at the very least, you will never know how great things become.  "Oh, but they wont!"  Well, you'll never know now will you?  Thanks for reading.

            Jesus, the man's body isn't even cold yet and the Pedos on Voat are already throwing him under the bus that will inevitably and thankfully kill them all.

            Anthony's latest wife/gf claimed she was raped by Harvey Weinstein so he is certainly in an around the elite pedo circles, but the timing of all of these "revelations" about Anthony seems to have an agenda behind them. No doubt the man had his demons in early life which were too deep for him to ever fully get rid of.

             You are entitled to your opinion, but nothing about Bourdain was real. he was a carefully constructed character playing a part.

             No accolades here, but him dying brings me no joy whatsoever.

             Wonder whether he could have said the same thing about the deaths of others?

             I think you're picking up on the role he played. He positioned himself as this cynic so he often didn't give sterling reviews to things, and for some reason, and I don't know why, we give cynics credit for being more honest? Yeah, I put that question mark there because it's human nature to dismiss compliments and remember the guy/girl who sarcastically told us we suck.
            </p>
            <p>
             So that's how he was written, and that's what made him effective for the Pedophile Elites to pull out of their back pocket and use. His incredibly opinionated voice lent credibility to whatever narrative he was given to handle. Don't believe the facade. Nothing's real and it's all done with smoke and mirrors.

            I hate how we will never really know why he committed suicide, just like how we don't really know why with many other celebrities that choose this freak way of leaving the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really hope there is not some secret celebrity cult that makes you famous for several years and then makes you commit suicide as some sort of contract deal.  I think I just wrote a new black mirror episode.

              I really hope there is not some secret celebrity cult that makes you famous for several years and then makes you commit suicide as some sort of contract deal. I think I just wrote a new black mirror episode.

             This would fit. In one of the articles I ran across, he kept talking about how he'd always been poor and in debt when that producer pitched a TV show. Another rags to riches story. Some people would do anything for fame and wealth, so maybe. Could be that he got rich because he was initiated in the cabal, and that sort of fits also. His girlfriend was raped by Weinstein. But I'm not buying these rags-to-riches stories anymore. I'm done believing them.

              Rags to riches through hard work is one thing.

             <p>
              Rags to riches in becoming a popular celebrity can be forced onto the public.  Just look at how the music industry works with a pretty face and a behind the scenes song writer, or just look at someone famous for a popular event like Tommy Wiseau from "The Room".

               So many people would love to have it happen to them, but sometimes the choice boils down to what they're willing to do for fame, money, power ... Suspect it's what's behind the meteoric rise.

            I just looked at her Twitter. Don't know when exactly she heard about Bourdain's death, but she seems to have tweeted stuff totally unrelated to his death even hours after he died. Weird.

            Couple things, Asia's "fuck everyone" t-shirt featured Sid Vicious, Bourdain was a notoriously huge fan of early punk rock and of course the Sex Pistols.  So I have no doubt it was about, directed at, or inspired by him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sid of course stabbed his gf Nancy to death during a drug binge (he said he didn't remember), then tried committing suicide a couple times right after then, then OD'd and died.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sid's mom revealed she believes Sid and Nancy had a SUICIDE PACT because of a note she found in his pocket after his death "We had a death pact, and I have to keep my half of the bargain. Please bury me next to my baby. Bury me in my leather jacket, jeans and motorcycle boots. Goodbye."
           </p>
           <p>
            So that all fits with what you said OP.  Bourdain even had the drug problem.

             What's to say Sid Vicious wasn't an early [insert an entertainer]?  The attitude is definitely punk.  He's the same age as Rollins, Jello, Iggy, etc.  Live fast die young.  Yet some survived and got wise and off the drugs.

              Iggy is older.  He's prepunk.  He's 14 years older than Henry Rollins.

              I subscribe to theory Sid did not kill Nancy.  Several folks at at the party they were at report a sketchy ny guy hanging around who didn't seem like a punk.  Sid supposedly nodded off and woke up to Nancy dead.

                No.  prepunk is like where punk came from.  Nobody called the Stooges punk rock because the term punk rock didn't exist then.
               </p>
               <p>
                I thought it was not really in use until Punk magazine started in 1975.

                 Looking this up

                , I see actually the term was floating around early than I thought.
               </p>
               <p>
                But these examples from that wiki link, show that in early 70s the concept of a punk rocker really didn't exist.

                Iggy is punk. I've never heard of Pre-Punk only Proto-Punk. The Kinks, New York Dolls, The Velvet Underground, Even the rolling stones has been considered proto-punk but this is according to wikipedia.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Stooges is also on the list so yea Iggy Pop is considered proto-punk in the sense that punk wasn't definied and Iggy was doing his own thing, or was at the onset of it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Punk (which was supposedly pushed by the CIA, as all major genres are including 90s britpop bands like Oasis.) itself is going to form a more concrete genre and subculture and I guess you could say the ramones and sex pistols played a big part in that.

                 LOL - I was gonna bring them up.  But they are punk.  The only band I would let fly as "pre-punk" would be MC5.  Punk is about the attitude GFY at the time.

                  Okay good point. I would say that Velvet Underground is proto and Stooges is punk. Modern Lovers is proto, new york dolls, etc. Proto-punk were hipsters of their day, hated disco, etc. I think you could describe proto-punk as artsy garage rock. It isn't punk it just was something slightly similar before it. post-punk came before goth and that is stuff like Joy Division. Actually lots of early goth bands were just post-punk, I'm not sure when the genre name goth came around.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Oh wikipedia claims that the first proto-punk song is the 1963 version of Louis Louis by The Kingsmen and they were like a garage "beat" band, beat being some 60s genre. I'm a fan of Surf Rock and while this isn't that it definitely is of that time. I don't know The Rolling Stones' entire catalog but they're listed as proto-punk I presume because they did rock and experimented. Here is the Louis Louis song

             Hey, UppadaVoat for you, and thanks for this.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's very complete and seems to seal the deal with what happened. The thing that's a mystery is if the heads of the Cannibal Elite are ordering these things. If they are, are they getting rid of people who could hurt them? Or that they feel are loose ends? It's confusing because anyone involved could hurt them. So maybe it's the level someone's on? Hypothetical: Maybe Bourdain witnessed ... actually saw The Kenyan or Skankles doing committing a crime. If that were the scenario, then maybe they're being taken out on that basis? And according to entylawyer, Asla didn't follow through. So does that mean someone will follow through for her?
            </p>
            <p>
             But what you've said hits the nail on the head. Thanks, again.

              All fits in. Back in the day H.G. Wells wrote Time Machine where protagonist whisks into the distant future only to find out that human race had subdivided itself into Morloks - subterannean dwellers who run things via machines and the idiotic Eloi - who are bred like cattle (literally) then taken down and eaten! Wells was Freemason, and perhaps he was telling us what was going on. Most of the West is run by literal Satanic/pedo/cannibals. It's a fact. Question is - will public ever become aware of it?

               Absolutely. I have to believe they will. The thing is that they had to be prepared. It's why the news is leaking slowly. But the big drop? It will reverberate throughout the world because this is a worldwide conspiracy and too fantastic to believe without absolute, definitive proof.

                I just watched Total Eclipce (great podcast) Andy (PHD in political science) took Sawyer apart. He said that even if he was threatened (Which I am certain he was), Craig like a true veteran should go down in flames. Urbanmoving did several videos as did VOP. It was damage control time and like good little lap dogs all the shills were put in place to do the Rothchild/Soros bidding.

                 Oh, so Ubanmoving a component in this VOP operation. Didn't realize it. Is this on FB? You can see how I have no dogs in this fight. I really wasn't even following this story too closely until this foodfight broke out on Twitter. Since all the supposed ''friendly'' pizzagating investigators were involved, I got involved. Had no idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm keeping my fingers crossed that VOP hits paydirt and uncovers something so compelling that it forces the FBI, immigration and whoever else to investigate. Hope it validates them and discredits all these shills/disinfo P'sOS.

                 To begin with, NO ONE would put their children in a hotter spot in the desert. If you're escaping the sun, you put the in the most well-ventilated area you can find. Just parenting 101.

                  Andy on Total Eclipse (great truther channel) does a great in depth coverage on Sawyer and why he flipped - just like Alex on PG. I actually tweeted to Sawyer recently to stay safe and a day later he flipped. We have to remember who we are up against! We live in a world where The Queen knighted Jimmy Saville!!!!

                   Yeah, but there are people who don't flip. Those are the ones I admire.

                   I believe Sawyer was dirty from the get-go. I remember that he was talking about filming and helping ONLY children outside of the US. He was focused on international human trafficking. I raised the question of why he wasn't working within the US and right then he got on my radar, but there was never anything concrete. Just more little hints. It wasn't until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Yup, he's a burner phone and the elite made him blow his cover. Quite a few people did and I just love when they expose their sorry asses.

                  VOP latest video tells us that it is moving full throttle. Hundreds of border security patrol, Ranch owner....conbat vert, they are combing acres! This will go big. Deep State cover up tactics (the ones they used for CPP) will not work here! PIzza/Pedogate will break big time.

                   As for the rest, it's awesome. Just awesome. VOP are real heroes. And everyone joining in, too. As I've said, I hope they hit the mother lode. I hope they discover something so compelling that it does break this whole subject of child human trafficking wide open.

            this kike constantly celebrated that "white people wont exist in 50 years" and that cant wait for whites to die out and turn "cappuccino" colored -- but what bothers you is that he's "trying to normalize cannibalism."

            there is no creature more naïve or treacherous than white women.  this thread is exactly why all the Jew World Order orgs we post about prioritize "womens rights" to the point of literally imposing quotas for govt representation.

              Poor Donkey. Being rejected by white women your entire life has made you really bitter. It might help if you tried to accept that it will never happen. Just stop trying. Maybe that will give you some healing.

               ^lmao, unable to fathom someone thinking unselfishly about the future of their race because loyalty and abstraction doesnt come naturally to women, she instinctively resorts to sexual shaming and brigading.
              </p>
              <p>
               A woman's behavior is more predictable and less complex than a dogs.  That's why you will never do anything but further prove my points.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why do you suppose horoscopes are exclusively a female thing? Because deep down you know you aren't meant to make your own decisions -- you are passive creatures who exist only to give birth, and now you refuse to even do that.

               Truly white women are the worst of God's creatures.

            Yeah that's pretty sick and wrong (and kinda awesome at the sane time he had those drills) But i think Kate, Chester, Chris, Anthony and others are just being murdered and not committing suicide. And i'm scared of the net shutting down in a few days or something and false flags soon. Real soon. I'm scared. I'm really really very very scared.

             Don't be scared. I say that even though there are very real fears. The thing that's scary would be if you didn't know all this. It would be if Skankles had won and she finished destroying America. We would have pedo overlords and not even know it until it was too late. Our children would be damaged with hormone blockers, and the state would have very likely taken over the parameters of how we raised them. The crazy porn study classes are just examples.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hold on, grit your teeth, and pray for this to be over ASAP. Once the drops are made and the evidence exposes these heathens/devils, we'll know the storm will soon be over. And imagine when the papers will have to print the truth and how nice it'll be to talk to our neighbors again.

            Starting to think AB is hiding out with the likes of Chester , maybe when one of their own get caught &amp; will be exposed , it's time for them to "retire" to a paedo resort.

            In defense of the Aghoris , they don't eat human flesh normally , only ritualistically  from a corpse, they don't kill people to eat.

            They harvest hormones like human growth hormone  out of cadavers.  Tons of ftm trannies in the world abuse HGH and T. HGH comes from human brains.
           </p>

            The super lucifarian trannies like bourdain probably collect the pituatary glands themselves and do satanic rituals before injesting it.

             I guess the Instagram Argento posted 3 hrs before Bourdain's ''suicide'' is deleted.  I hope someone got a screenshot of it.

             In times like these, not getting distracted is key, and an open mind is invaluable. Unless you know someone personally, you don't know too much about them except for portrayed persona. I have been suspicious of Bordain since the first shows though. Always remember, it is Hollywood, and without that where would we be as a Nation?

              I was trying to connect the dots in my head. But you're right retaining a laser like focus is important. However it is easy to be distracted given all the eletronic stimuli.  To all the investigative brothers out there, stay safe.
