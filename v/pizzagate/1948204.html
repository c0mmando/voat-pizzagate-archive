<blockquote>
<p>Q. Did you participate in the kidnapping of <strong>Johnny Gosch</strong>?</p>
<p>A. Yes</p>
<p>Q. Tell us about it.</p>
<p>A. It was through a guy named  <strong>Emilio</strong> that I had met several years before while my family lived in <strong>Carter Lake</strong>, which i had met him down in, there\'s a, I don\'t even know what name of that park is, I think might be <strong>Levi Carter</strong>, not really important, it\'s between the pond and big actual lake and stuff.  I met <strong>Emilio</strong> through a kid thatt I had met down at the park and stuff. His name was <strong>Mike</strong>, or we calling him <strong>Mikey</strong> too sometimes, but mainly <strong>Mike</strong>.  He was approximately my age. And he told me about his friend and stuff. And when they, in talking to me and stuff they found out I had been abused and stuff, <strong>Mike</strong> had and stuff, he went, told <strong>Emilio</strong>. It was at this point that <strong>Emilio</strong> started to begin to use me to go to these, not really parties, but just like, like child pornography, that\'s what his main thing was making child porn.  That\'s how he basically supported himself.  It was shortly after that that they asked me to go on a trip with them <strong>Des Moines</strong>.  And I believe that was around Labor, September, we left on September 4th of 82. And we went to Des Moines. We stayed there in a hotel which I, all I know is it was on the, on the west side of Des Moines. And we, they went through what they were going to do. At first I didn\'t know what they were there for. The first thing, this one guy came in and says this is the one. And I at that point still had no clue as to what they were talking about and stuff. They said that, you know, they were going to take this kid, they were going to kidnap him and stuff. And I was a little bit upset. And I said that I wasn\'t wanting to go along with them.  And I\'m going to try to tell this in the best order that I can so that it\'s complete and put all the personalities together because I think in the past it\'s all been broken up. And I think what I need to do is put it altogether finally. And I can do that, the other personalities couldn\'t.  What happened was when they took us to Des Moines, after found out, it was still early in the afternoon.</p>

            Very nice work, and thank you for the link to the court transcripts.  I downloaded them.  I think it is worth mentioning that these transcripts are from the case when Bonacci was suing Larry King in a civil lawsuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, as per this recent post:
            <a href="https://archive.is/haJmf">
             Larry KIng
            </a>
            was reportedly found to currently be living in Virginia and on the board of directors for a children's opera -- Opera Nova.  He has since been scrubbed from their website as well as their Facebook page.  (Thank you to Orange_Circle for archiving this link.)
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, since Larry King was reportedly the king pin of smuggling children to DC from Nebraska, I can't help but to wonder whether his alleged current presence in Virginia has anything to do with the high numbers of missing children in that state.   Afterall, when one changes geographic locations, one usually seeks to gain similar employment in a field in which one is most accustomed.
           </p>
           <p>
            **Could Lawrence E King Jr. still be "finding" kids for the DC devils aka elite? **

            The details that Paul Binacci is able to remember are amazing to me. I have heard that when people's minds are shattered as Paul's was, they have the ability to absorb and retain huge amounts of information. I imagine this would be one side effect that the pedo-creeps regret.

            It's certainly possible, but have you found any connections yet? Sidenote: I really do hope we get some more answers about The Finders in the future, whether through FOIA requests, death bed confessions, court testimony or whatever, it's all just so weird.
