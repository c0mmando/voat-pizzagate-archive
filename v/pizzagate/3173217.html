             Notice, never once did he deny the allegations. He pretended surprise and disbelief he would be asked those questions but he knew the questions were coming. So it's complete portrayal. He's acting. He's putting on a show. The fake laughter, he's pretending the allegations are ludicrous. That smug look, that's called duper's delight. He's lying, he knows any sane person knows he's lying, he doesn't care because he's just going to keep denying the allegations. It's a "fuck you!" to the person asking the questions.

              If you watched Leaving Neverland, Wade Robson and James Safechuck talk extensively of how MJ twisted what he was doing as coming from a pure and loving place.  MJ convinced them what they were doing was "not dirty" or inappropriate.  MJ normalized his abusive behavior so when he speaks publicly against the allegations, you can see how he is compartmentalizing what he has convinced himself to be loving behavior and the "dirty" allegations.  It's so disturbing.

               Exactly right. That's what these sorts of people do. Remember Comey? A Higher Loyalty? Same shit going on there. I have a perve Uncle who used similar tactics. (No, he didn't get to molest me cause I would run from him but I know for a fact he molested my older brother and repeatedly raped my four year old sister. Next year he tried me but it didn't work)  But, when I really got an insight into his mental make up was a few years back when he used the bible to convince me to murder a cousin. I listened politely, nodded my head sagely like "um humm" and then ignored him. Later told his PO everything he had been up to. Got his dealer put back in prison and his ankle monitor turned back on with renewed house arrest. LOL. Fucker lost his mind when he figured out what I did to put him in check. Fucktard bastard even had his pious church going wife defending his meth manufacturing as justified self treatment for pain. Faked pain. Fucker couldn't even remember which arm supposedly had chronic pain and switched arms one day. LOL.

                 Don't be sorry for me. I learned valuable lessons from all the abuse growing up. I learned early on that people can be dangerous and evil. I learned to not trust those who are in authority over you and to question their motives. Sure, I had to relearn those lessons a few times again.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sadly, my sister went on to become a chronic meth user after my uncle introduced her to the drug. She then drifted from that to eventually just hooking up with any guy who could provide drugs but along the way she ruined the reputation of men who would have been better off if they had never met her. She became a habitual liar and manipulator. I refuse to even let her near me or speak to her and my friends won't let her on their property.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My brother was abusive early on because, well, it's just his nature but being abused just made him worse. Neither one of them ever learned to be functionally literate so I can't blame them too much for who they are. At least my brother is a somewhat productive person in life as he does lawn care but after a few times of him ingratiating himself into my good graces and then turning on me for his own ego I learned to never allow myself to be involved with him. If it was legal I'd sooner kick him in the balls than talk to him so it's better I just avoid him. Currently I've heard he became a church goer but had a run in with another parishioner after he talked abusively to the man's crippled wife. The man threatened that if he ever spoke to his wife in that manner again he would get a thrashing on the church steps. Recently he flew out to meet our long lost mother who told the care giver that she never wanted to speak to him again. Dang, that made me laugh for some reason. Even our own mother who abandoned us can't stand him but she begged to speak to me on the phone. Instead I wrote her long letters after she apologized for her abuse of me as a toddler and told her I forgave her wish in her last days she knows she has my forgiveness. I carved her a very nice cane from an orange tree, polished it to a high sheen and sent it too her. Her care giver told me she went all over the hospice boasting that her favorite son made it for her. Being called her favorite son is the best revenge I couldn't have thought up in my wildest dreams.

            Michael Jackson was a pedophile. Why the fuck are you idiots actually down voating the truth? He wasn't a victim, he perpetrated rape on kids. When I heard the news he was dead, I danced and sang "ding dong the witch is dead" Fuck MJ. He was just another Hollow-wood freak.

             Thank you, this is the correct answer. I had someone almost throw a drink at me a few weeks ago when I stood my ground and said he was a pedophile. Sure, he was a great entertainer too - they’re not mutually exclusive!

             Oh, but Oprah (friend of Weinstain) said he was cool. Some of these morons were in love with MJ so there's that. They can't accept the truth that a kid who grew up totally controlled and terrorized by his dad would grow up to be a freak.

            TLDR? I don’t have time to watch that long of a doc. Bobby fisher, pro chess player, says they smeared MJ so hard because they wanted the rights (that he owned) to the Beatles. Right after he dies, boom, Apple was promoting the shit out of the Beatles. More to that, but I’m on mobile atm

             That of course could be a motive to off him with drugs but what MJ said and what that boy said revealed a sexual predator. What sort of adult male tells a boy that if he loves him he will share a bed with him. That ties everything together for me. The secrecy is another huge factor. Why would you share your bed with young boys, over and over again? Tell a child they have to sleep in a bed with you to prove your love? Do you know any normal parents who tell their kids that? I sure don't.

               I'll imagine you did it in your heart. I'm not really here for points. Unlike lefties, I don't go on and on about "It's for the kids" but I really do care. I just don't spout off about it.

                 You're right. I just didn't see it as being something special. A child should never need to "earn" or "prove" his love for the parent. It's our job to prove we care by constantly nurturing, guiding, and being ever watchful for our children's safety and well being. Sure, we must at times give them a chance to learn unhappy lessons, delayed gratification, withholding treats when they don't live up to a bargain.

                 I stayed for several years in the second house a coworker owned right next to her own house. Her boyfriend was so negligent it was worrisome but when she asked me to do landscaping on the property in my spare time her son invariably would spend most of his day with me. What a monster he was but there was never a day he didn't make me laugh. He was always trying to manipulate me so I played psyop wars with him, reverse psychology and all sorts of things to get him on track. At by four years old he was following me around all day, learning the names of every tool I owned, bringing them too me, learning different screw sizes and picking up trash. I taught him to demand to be paid. Oh yes. I drummed that into his head and he caught on like a shark. He loved sweets so I had to sort of wean him off a bit with head games. He had to learn to get money since I was teaching him to pay for his own things when he went to the store with me. He had to ask his dad permission every time and I taught him to ask for money. (heheheh, let that dead beat dad learn what it's all about too!".) His dad learned to never deny him a trip to the corner market! One day, I reneged on his pay of chewing gum. "Oh kay, I don't work". You bet I paid up. Best day ever, we stopped on the way back to watch a couple guys doing some sewage work and the contractor came over to say hello and chatted a bit with me. Little monster kept quiet for a bit then looked the guy straight in his face and said, "Stop talking and go work!". We almost died laughing. I taught him well.

                  I was going to say I hope you have Children for you seem to have a good sense about them. But as long as you are spending time and giving of yourself and your time to at least one of them you will bring about change in the world.

                   I had a daughter who my ex got custody of in a bitter divorce. She remarried and moved 2000 miles away to Georgia. They didn't tell me where they had gone and no one would tell me for five years. By then my daughter was ten and had already, unknown to me been raped by her stepfather. I visited as often as I could but each time my ex would be verbally abusive to my daughter. I guess getting even with me for ignoring her? I just didn't like talking to her as she loved to try to bait me. Rub my nose in her "success". Eventually when my daughter was just a month away from her 18th birthday she begged me to help her come to California. I asked her to stay on till the semester was over and then I would pay for her ticket to leave. My ex and her husband found out and holy hell started. I broke off contact for a week to let things cool down and my daughter hung herself. So yes, I care deeply about children because I know once they are hurt, sometimes they just never come back. There is a great evil in this world that seeks to destroy the best and brightest. Those who are the most decent and innocent. That evil wishes to drag down the innocent and load them up with guilt and despair and there are plenty who work with this evil to do the same. I believe my ex and her husband broke that poor girl down and told her I didn't care, there was no way out. So she found her own way out.

                   Foolish Christians will tell you to forgive. Somethings can never be forgiven and shouldn't be forgiven. I could forgive my ex for anything she said or did to me but taking it out on our daughter, Unforgiveable. I've never spoken to the ex since then and and I never will. There's nothing more to say to her.

                    I am so sorry for your loss.  I just recently lost my husband, but a Child, well I can't even imagine that.  I also have an ex and he played many mind games so I certainly know how that can effect your life.  As far as forgiving, many people have told me I should let go.  There was domestic violence that I cannot forgive.  I have met him over the years because of weddings, etc.  I cannot forgive.  So I completely understand your decision.  No one knows the deep pain you have suffered.  But do not let them define you.  Do not let it take over your life.  Find an outlet for what has happened.  Help other Children maybe by helping them read.  I did this many years ago and it was so very rewarding.  They so much need people like you.  I may revisit this myself after I get through my grief and settle in my new digs.  I think by helping that Child you have already started on your way.  I can recommend you say The St. Michael the Archangel Prayer.  The long version, for the evil church doers have a short version.  It combats the evil Satan is doing in the world.  I truly believe in evil and good.  There is so much more evil in the world since I grew up.  There is a reason for that.  My Mother in law used to say The devil has such a hold on this world.  She was not a Church goer but she was a good person.  I will keep you in my prayers.  You are a good person too. +

                     I am Messianic Jewish. I came to that faith first by ancestry and then by long tedious study. Going through loss caused me to reexamine everything I grew up with and assumed to be true but also led me to study for myself and reach my own conclusions. Never again will a pastor, church or any clergy have the power to teach me what is free and available to all.

                      I don't judge people by their religion.  If people are kind to others and live a good life I do not judge.  Muslims are now considered radicals and many have left the Catholic religion because of the sex abuse so they have become disgusted.  This has caused a huge exodus from all religion which is really sad.  Why people have to believe they have to push their religion on others is beyond me.  I asked an Irish friend of mine if she believes in God or the devil and she said No.  This was shocking to me and explains why there is so much evil in this world.  Most Christians have always believed in Satan.  Now he has caused us to doubt his existence.  A relative told me she blames God for the evil in this world.  Why does He allow such evil and horror to exist she says.  OH DEAR. We are in huge trouble.  We really don't need priests and Imams, etc.  We can communicate to God or Allah one on one.  The middle man is not necessary.  But some need that.  But we should never let them take over our thinking so much that they have power over us. I agree.

                       Kind of strange you would equate a satanic religion such as Islam with Christianity. Have you read the Koran? The Hadiths ? Allah is Satan. The evidence is widely known by Muslims. Christ also declared this when he stated that Satan was the father of lies. The Koran notes Allah as the greatest deceiver. Deception is part of the Islamic religion while the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob declares, "Am I a man that can lie?". The God of the Israelites declares that he cannot lie.

                        You are talking about the radicals.  There are people that do not practice that part of the religion.  Just like some Catholics don't know anything about what is going on behind closed doors.  I truly believe that people of every religion have radicals and those that are on the outskirts and not into the deep teachings you speak about.  I have worked with people of all religions and they were not bad people.

                         Once again you are buying into the popular lie.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Look into the depths of Christianity and the teachings of the Messiah. You will find no calls to behead unbelievers, burn them at the stake or do anything more than walk away from those who will not accept the gospel. Therefore, any fundamentalist Christian who reads scripture as it is, will be peaceful and kind and avoid disturbing others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Now go read the Koran and read the examples of Mohammed's life in the accounts recorded in the Hadiths.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Over and over the Koran calls for cutting off people's heads, fingers, hands and feet. Throwing gays from roof tops. Spreading their religion with the sword and terrorism. No, those who follow these doctrines can not be considered radical. They are fundamentalists. The Koran endorses violent jijad and terrorism. Right at it's heart this is all part of the religion. The koran endorses deception. You have  bought into the big lie about Islam. Name me one Christian church here in America that has engaged in such behavior? Show me in the New Testament where it teaches that believers are to wage an unrelenting violent jihad against unbelievers. Can't do it, you know you can't. But all over the Koran are calls for violence. I can show you dozens of videos of Muslims beheading, mutilating and terrorizing other people. When they run out of Christians they are just as pleased to terrorize their own people.

                      Thank you.  It has been extremely hard.  It would have been easier to take had he been a horrible person, but he was the kindest human being I have ever known.  Many others have also expressed this to me.   I have had such wonderful words of kindness sent to me.  This has helped a lot.  Thank you again.  I never thought about how I would feel someday if he passed before me.  We never discussed it because it was even too painful to think of.  We were that much in love and still are.  +
