<p>I want to walk readers through this really slow and &quot;explain like I\'m 5&quot; -ish.  I have learned that a hasty post, done improperly does no one any good.</p>
<p>First let me say that <a href="https://voat.co/user/RebelSkum">@RebelSkum</a> has done a fantastic job on the <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page">http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page</a>.  Kudos!  If you have not visited there yet  please do so, it is a real wealth of information.</p>
<p>But it was his recent post here about Sen. Bob Menendez that brought my attention to something else which seems relevant to the Pizzagate / PedoGate investigation:
<em>New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, still serving, under 2yr investigation for child trafficking  in Dominican Republic</em>
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1619555">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1619555</a></p>
<p>As most of us know Dominican Republic is one country on an island that contains only one other country, Haiti.  When the 2010 earthquake struck Haiti, dozens of US based NGOs (Non Governmental Organizations) swept in.  Not all of these had the best interests of Haitian victims in mind.  The Clinton Foundation and Sen. John McCain\'s IRI being just a couple of examples of NGO bad actors <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1567335">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1567335</a></p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/topics/haiti_earthquake">Democracy Now</a> : </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On January 12th, 2010, Haiti was devastated by a massive 7.0-magnitude earthquake, causing of one of the worst natural disasters in history. Up to 300,000 were killed and more than 1.5 million left homeless</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was in this chaos that these bad actor NGOs saw their opportunity.  Parentless children / orphans were the spoils that they sought.  And in some cases, such as that of Clinton Foundation-linked bad actor <a href="https://steemit.com/silsby/@psychanaut/laura-silsby-child-trafficking-in-haiti-with-ties-to-clinton-is-now-laura-galyer-working-at-alertsense-amber-alerts">Laura Silsby</a> they were caught smuggling children.  Note the number of children Silsby was caught with: 33</p>
<p>Silsby was caught at the Haiti / Dominican Republic border.</p>
<p>How does this all relate to Sen. Bob Menendez you might ask?  Well it\'s notable that Sen. Menendez\'s legal troubles relate to alleged Dominican Republic underaged prostitutes.  His disgusting sexual preferences were revealed by <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2013/01/dominican-prostitute-says-democrat-menendez-likes-youngest-and-freshest-hookers/">Gateway Pundit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FOUR DOMINICAN HOOKERS Confirm They Attended Sex Parties With Sen. Bob Menendez</p>
<p>“That Senator also likes the youngest and newest girls,” the woman wrote on April 21, 2002, according to an English translation provided to The Daily Caller by a native Spanish speaker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, it was Sen. Menendez who launched a campaign in 2010 to fast-track Haitian adoptions. From his own <a href="http://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/201001ltr_HaitiAdoptions.pdf?">Senate website</a> he can be seen advocating for abandoning the traditional process for adoptions in favor of a less safe and thorough regime.  It was signed by 33 Senator co-sponsors who I will heretofore call the &quot;Menendez Gang of 33&quot;.<br />

This was <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0125/Haiti-earthquake-reignites-debate-over-fast-tracking-adoptions">controversial</a> at the time, and for good reasons.</p>
<p>This number 33 struck me as interesting since we just recently happened to have a contributor here <a href="https://voat.co/user/wankatanka">@wankatanka</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1618839">mention the fact</a> that, according to an FBI insider - &quot;FBI Anon&quot; of 4chan fame - <strong>33% of U.S. Government In A Pedo Ring</strong></p>
<p>Note also that 33 is a highly important number in the secret societies.  Make of this as you will, but I am guessing the Menendez, Haiti, Dominican connection will prove to be important.  That is all for now. Have a good night everyone</p>',

                Hi.
               </p>
               <p>
                That article does not show a connection to the Clinton Foundation and pretty much confirms that there was no connection before she got arrested.
               </p>
               <p>
                Hillary and Bill Clinton took an extraordinary interest in Silsby’s case from the moment she was arrested and almost immediately stepped in on her behalf.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's also inaccurate.   The State Department is involved when people get arrested overseas.  It's routine.  Clinton did not "immediately step in on her behalf."   Clinton let the Haitian courts deal with her.  After they convicted Silsby and she was released, the State Department helped get her out.   Some of the others arrested with her were appealing to Secretary Clinton to step in and she said, we have diplomatic relations with the Haitian government and you should go to the consulate to deal with this like any other case.
