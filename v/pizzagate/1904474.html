<p>Powerful prep schools encourage a &quot;cool&quot; drug culture that exists alongside an insanely strict cram study culture. Kids turn to drugs to deal with the pressure of extreme competitiveness, and while drugged they are easily persuaded to let an establishment figure groom them for future political power, in exchange for pedophile sex. Everyone is scared of blackmail, and naive anti-drug conservatives play their part in helping the drugged up kids keep quiet about what\'s happening. Many of them even give their kids drugs so they get good grades, but it never occurs to them that it\'s from sleeping with the teacher instead of studying harder.</p>
<p>The burnouts who never make it into the elite universities become complete bums, the kind of degenerates who make up antifa or other weird SJW cults. The few real insiders that make it out of these schools shower them with lucrative government contracts and hush money and as much state muscle as they need to keep operating.</p>
<p>I think pizzagate is more noticed than in the past, because the internet has allowed for a lot of clueless upper middle class parents to network and figure out why their kids are strange docile little zombies after being sent to highly ranked &quot;prestigious&quot; college prep academies. The ones who willingly send their kids to these places are like the Christians who let the Muslims raise their children as eunuchs or janissaries, or the ones who castrated their children so they could perfectly sing choir at the Vatican.</p>',

             It's bizarre how virtually everyone finds castrati horrifying, and yet homosexuals adopting children to be brainwashed into becoming transsexuals is now perfectly acceptable and progressive.

             People believe what the elites want them to believe. That's the consequence of schooling.

              Listening to Alessandro brought inner tears/he 'feels' sad.  Maybe just my subjective impression but in comments I see I'm not alone.  Thank you for another red pill and the link.

              Transsexuals...eugenics in full swing...aided and abetted by the hormones in the food/plastics/and various other contaminants that throw the body into chaos.
              <br/>
              All perfectly acceptable.

            I have Gatto's book 'Dumbing Us Down.' Great work. Didn't know he was exposing this aspect of 'education' as well. Never watched his videos - can't wait. Thanks for posting.

            Great post. Notice how Princess Diana was eliminated before William and Harry would get their grooming. This is true aim of homosexual agenda (I have nothing against gays, I am against the agenda) - gays adopting kids - plant seeds of perversion early on, much easier to groom them. Donald Trump might be the first heterosexual president since JFK - that's why so many arrests in such a short time. Henry Makow has an excellent article about the homosexual/pedophile grooming of students that has become a tradition passed down from the ancient Greko/Roman model. Expose this filth and we expose the NWO Illuminati - bunch of evil losers as Trump called them. Great post! Keep em comming. 
We are getting very close to the underbelly of the beast. Do not let Kathy Griffin stunts distract you - they are in a panic mode and there is no Barack, Hillary, Comey or Lynch to cover their asses.

            Drugs that you take to improve your study results, like Ritalin or speed, don't make you vulnerable for easy persuasion. Far from it, actually. Amphetamines generally make you more aware, alert, aggressive and self-conscious. And why engage in sex against your will to get these drugs, if all it takes is an ADHD diagnosis any physician is eager to give, as it gets him a nice bonus from the pharma boys?

             Kids reared on Ritalin are later reared, lolz, on crystal meth. They're being primed for easy future addictions, with gateway drugs that start out as something to help them grind through meaningless studying, but that later make it easier to take up the hard stuff. Normal people who try meth once, contrary to the propaganda, usually never want to touch the stuff again.

              Bullshit. You haven't got a clue what you're talking. Kids with AD(H)D who are properly treated with medication have a far lower chance of becoming addicted to hard drugs. Kids with untreated AD(H)D are very susceptible to drugs, and run a (much) higher risk of becoming addicted.

            Interesting points - but I know the prestigious LA schools (Brentwood has been mentioned here in relation to Pizzagate suspects) demand in the region of $30,000 in annual fees for non-boarders, and have a lot of celebrity and business elite children in the student body anyway. The upper-middle class are never truly invited to the big party. They are just there to make up the numbers and pay the fees. They may well be more academically successful than the inner party, but they are not ever destined to be fully part of the same crowd.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems more likely the drug use is a way of dealing with the messed up way they were raised; to erase or manage their memories of abuse. Like others, Brentwood attracts wealthy non-elite parents, and there will always be some experimentation with drugs etc. The inner party elites don't really need to go to university, since they can simply go into the family business, or the "culture creation" industry while waiting for the payouts from their trust fund etc. Write for a fashion magazine, go into photography, or the music or film business, even if on a meagre salary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly I see this cult as a breakaway civilisation. Most of the non-elite children at these expensive schools turns out to be fairly "normal" in the end; they have pushy parents who are social climbers but have fairly weak occult knowledge.

            Some of these elites and people like the Royals believe this sick stuff is a right of passage and also a way to keep their lifestyles going.  They rape other people's kids and some rape even their own.  This keeps the pedo culture going.  Eton in the UK a school all the English Royals attended, is loaded with pedophile professors I am sure.  Now there is an investigation.

             There was a post on voat about an elite 18 year old Eton College member caught with over 2000 pedophilic images and videos involving such horrors as babies being raped by Dogs!!! He got off scot free - 3 months community service. His dad is a wealthy lawyer who represented Goldman Sachs. I am sure it was a masonic court - a sham. This is not a natural predilection - I can speak for myself and my friends - we were all into playboys, the allure of a sexually mature woman was captivating. It is the same for women.  Anything to do with children (not to mention little children) was part of another realm. This is a learnt behaviour - it's the pedo power structure. It is passed down generations. Look at the Podesta Brothers - and Brian Podesta at NCMEC - it's circle! Another post on voat shed light on UK Government, virtually all homosexual/pedophiles - including Tony Blair and Child murderer Ted Heath. This is the Illuminati - expose them and you expose their much overrated boogieman that we have come to know as NWO.

              You should be awarded a Comment Award!  You have just educated our Normies and reconfirmed in minds that are not quite sure as of yet.  I highly agree with everything you have said.  The bad thing is they are trying to rape and get others to rape as many children as possible to create more of the same and to be able to continue their heinous acts and Monumental Billionaire Empires.  Yes, we all had those normal urges while growing up, but we kept them in check and they were with people of similar ages and humans.  These people (I hate to even call them that) must be exposed and stopped asap.

            "I think pizzagate is more noticed than in the past, because the internet has allowed for a lot of clueless upper middle class parents to network and figure out why their kids are strange docile little zombies after being sent to highly ranked "prestigious" college prep academies. "
           </p>
           <p>
            These are not "upper middle class" families.  "Upper middle class" kids CANNOT AFFORD to go to "highly-ranked prestigious college prep academies.":  Those kids are of wealthy "elite" families.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wealthy elites KNOW what is going on in these schools; many parents are alumni themselves.  The formal education at these schools only reinforces what goes on in the family, at HOME, and in their social circles.
