            Uh, maybe I am missing something, but I read it as they ran the server (kept it up) in order to catch all those downloading the CP, right?  Or am I just tired and not reading this right?

            Sorely tempted to agree with you here.  Comey got his hands dirty while on the board of HSBC as demonstrated here:

            An organization rots from the top down.  Sad to see our once-respected FBI fall to this low.  BUT there's a new Sheriff in town now, let's hope they clean things up!

           <p>
            There is plenty of evidence that they most certainly are investigating, including this recent post from Jason Chaffetz:

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Please try to keep unsubstantiated claims out of posts on

             Yes Chaffetz said he was investigating (although he didn't specify what specifically in regards to Hillary and I have not heard him mention PG).  Back in November there was supposed to be a big press conference over Weiner's laptop and the 650,000 emails on it.  Nothing.  No arrests, nothing.  Weiner isn't even arrested for sexting an underage girl.  He is sent to rehab which he doesn't even complete.  Today I pull up the Drudge Report and what do I see, 1)  FBI probing sundance cyberattack (thinking the Russians might be involved).  2) FBI reviewing phone calls between General Flynn and the RUSSIANS.  General Flynn I believe knows about PG and is sympathetic to our cause.  So why is the FBI chasing that stupid narrative about the Russians?  And why are they hassling him about calls he made to the Russian ambassador?  They hassle him over phone calls but give Hillary the hands off treatment when supposedly they have tons of incriminating info on Weiner's laptop.  Not to mention says nothing when Barry gives a huge pallet of untraceable money to Iran.

             You are correct, I shouldn't have said they won't investigate.  I should have said, I have lost confidence that they will actually investigate Weiner's laptop.  Maybe they did investigate and decided to sit on it and do nothing.  Maybe the white hats are waiting for a further regime change before they move forward ( I hope so).  I'm just going by the fact that supposedly they have all of this incriminating evidence and nothing has been done in over 2 months and today on Drudge there were THREE articles about the FBI.  2 of them involve the stupid Russian narrative and the third involves them running their own CP site.  Which to me seems like we are going backward, not forward.

               David Steele videos
              </a>
              ? These two former intelligence agency guys both say Weiner's laptop has loads of stuff on it, the emails have been given to certain members of Congress, and the FBI will finish the investigation just as soon as they are no longer being blocked by the DOJ, which has refused to give them the power to subpoena witnesses.

               Yes I have head/see Steve P.  and I like him very much.  Hadn't heard about David Steele.  Where do I find his video?  I so want to believe what you are saying.  Erick Prince made it sound like there were a series of arrests coming in Nov.  But ever since I have yet to hear of any follow-up from Eric Prince.  Just crickets.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks for sharing as I would like to hear more of what these guys have to say.  I could use some encouragement about this.
