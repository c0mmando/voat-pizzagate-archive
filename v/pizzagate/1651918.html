<p>Project VIC is part of a global strategy to develop and implement streamlined methods to investigate child sexual exploitation. <a href="http://www.icmec.org/project-vic/">http://www.icmec.org/project-vic/</a> <a href="https://archive.is/2EOx4">https://archive.is/2EOx4</a></p>
<p>It is basically a collection of all the child sexual exploitation videos and photos ever found.  In the hands of an agency that is not even government based.  Their propaganda states that &quot;Project VIC is a collaborative effort between ICMEC, law enforcement and industry&quot;. There is an elaborate system of identifying each of these photographs on hashtags and other complicated numerical IDs. **You will love their philosophy: Victims First – No Child Left Behind. ** (Another thought:  Where is all this data housed physically?)</p>
<p>From their website: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What exactly does Project VIC do?
First, Project VIC compiled all existing online child abuse images into a single repository. Each image, whether still or video, has a unique identifier known as a “hash value.” Using the hash value allows investigators to quickly rule images in or out of their searches. {My Interpretation:   All items are individually marked so that copies of items will be flagged. No passing off someone else’s work as your own.}</p>
<p>Project VIC participants have organized and compiled detailed lists of their own image collections using these hash values. {Their OWN IMAGE Collections???}</p>
<p>Project VIC also commissioned the creation of an “image hash cloud,” which is available to investigators around the world. They download the “master image hash lists,” which contain the identifiers of highly vetted, known images of child sexual exploitation. Law enforcement personnel also are able to expand the database by uploading new hashes they have seized. {So this database access is cloud-based, where you can get the master list of the content. And the members can upload new stuff anytime.}</p>
<p>To make the image hash cloud effective, all involved need to have the ability to contribute back. Project VIC protocols allow for this because the technology is governed by OASIS, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards. This ensures that technology tool providers can adopt – and their data will be compatible with – the Project VIC ecosystem of technology tools. {With privately developed technology, everyone will need to get the tech tools needed to work in the system.}  
</p>
<p>In the fall of 2015 Project VIC launched a new initiative, Project VIC-International, to promote and grow the information sharing of Project VIC data and innovations.
Project VIC has already started work on a bridge to major data sources at INTERPOL and Europol.  Other countries have adopted the Project VIC model of information sharing, and victim centric approach to investigations including the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. {What an interesting group of international information partners.}</p>
<p>What is ICMEC’s role?
We serve as the Administrative Coordinator and International Outreach Coordinator for Project VIC. To that end, we:
•	Coordinate domestic and international outreach and expansion efforts;
•	Vet countries/foreign entities for possible participation in Project VIC;
•	Coach and mentor countries early on regarding Project VIC through roundtable discussions and assessments;
•	Deploy hands-on trainings to introduce investigators to Project VIC and the workflow of tools used to combat child exploitation;
•	Assist with developing custom and individual Project VIC strategic plans for interested countries;
•	Facilitate the donation of Project VIC technology tools; and
•	Convene an International Technology Summit with all Project VIC participants to gather international requirements and innovation ideas.</p>

<p>This certainly seems like a massively expensive system to develop and maintain.  I cannot even guess the amount of funds that went into this.  They must have a lot of success identifying victims and perpetrators, right?  According to their website:  250+victims identified, 125+perpetrators identified.  {Really, that’s all?? Even Ashton Kutcher claims more than that!}</p>
<p>This info is from a different site-stating how many images VIC has handled: Image Submissions and Analysis: 
--Have categorized and quality controlled 1.5million into three categories. 
--An additional 2.5 Million files have been collected of which 2 Million are unique. 
--Additional images are being worked on so the set can be increased. (pdf source below)</p>

            Why are all of these systems based on identifying children rather than the criminals and the organisations and infrastructure that are built for this global grid of child abuse and trafficking ?

            Why on earth are there all these NGO's and non-Profits?  It's because they operate without oversight and have almost no compulsion to report financials.  I don't care for ICMEC, NCEMC or Thorn.

            Good post. I was just browsing on the ICMEC website, and I ran across this little gem.
            <a href="http://www.icmec.org/global-missing-childrens-center/international-parental-child-abduction/">
             http://www.icmec.org/global-missing-childrens-center/international-parental-child-abduction/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, the page is ICMEC's work in fighting "international parental child abductions' They define this as being when a parent tries to take their child(ren) into another country without proper documentation. Who exactly would be the most likely parents to move their children with insufficient papers? My guess is poor people from war-torn places like Kosovo, Sudan, Libya, and Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the page, they are working towards:"A more consistent and uniform implementation of the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction."
            <a href="https://assets.hcch.net/upload/conventions/txt28en.pdf">
             https://assets.hcch.net/upload/conventions/txt28en.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Article 13 jumped out at me as being particularly key to this piece of international law... Again we are most likely dealing with poor people, so the parents can essentially be railroaded into losing custody to either state, and in many cases the children end up in group homes, at least for a period of time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also on this page, "In 2010, we co-hosted, along with the Permanent Bureau and the U.S. Department of State, an International Judicial Conference on Cross-Border Family Relocation." You can read it here:
            <a href="https://assets.hcch.net/upload/decl_washington2010e.pdf">
             https://assets.hcch.net/upload/decl_washington2010e.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, it is just adding a lot more ways for governments to scrutinize and exercise complete control over families. It's weird to me, because I was expecting to find that they were trying to eliminate red tape (as a way of moving in immigrants), but it's all about getting more people involved in family courts wherever they have jurisdiction. To me, this looks like an administrative way to get kids into state/NGO institutions.

            I am wondering if Kutcher is compromised or if this is a typical case of "keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"?
           </p>
           <p>
            If PG teaches us something, it is the fact how good they are in covering in plain sight.
It would be in their best interest, just like they infiltrated childcare and adoption units, to know how Thorn works and to know which pics/movies are already burned or compromised.
           </p>
           <p>
            Child trafficker Silsby is working at Amber Alert. Why not work with Kutcher's Thorn - and maybe even support him? Give him the programmers he needs... Be at the source of the investigation database...

            We need some pill size information made + users on board to get it trending. If we throw Ashton &amp; Thorn under the bus, people might realize what sociopaths these people really are.

               You would be surprised to learn how many people believe in the "This would be better, because you could track your children" theory. It makes me sick to my stomach to know that we are still surrounded by an overwhelming amount of zombies.  We still have a long way to go before we can say we're going to be fine. So much work ahead of us. Prepare to double-down and work hard.

               I posted this comment "Over my dead body" on a YT video about a case of kidnapped girls from the UK in reply to this comment: "Please, people get your kids micro-chipped" and you wouldn't believe the amount of negative replies and feedback I got from it. I mean wow! Just wow, people are asleep and don't know what's going on! I just ignored the replies after a while because it was getting ridiculous. This is why I keep fighting everyday now. Not only for the children, but because so much more people need to know the truth.

               I know, just wondering if it might be acceptable.  Problem:Solution.  Your negative reaction makes me feel better.
