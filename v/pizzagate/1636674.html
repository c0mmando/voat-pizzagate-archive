            you linked the wiki that I think more people should post their finds on. Since that can be considered a bit of a tiny hassle, I think people should be offered the opportunity to have a place to post their finds which they think can be on the wiki.
In fact, 99% of the relevant pizzagate subverse posts can be on wiki. Only about 1% is really picked up on by an admin.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, any relevant stuff should have a place namely
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewiki">
             v/pizzagatewiki
            </a>
            , that can be posted there by people who have something relevant but for any reason don't want to become a wiki admin to add it themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            There, the admins can more easily choose from what information they think should be added. Which is much less time consumning than browsing this current subverse. If enough people make it their habit to link relevant posts to my proposed subverse; to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewiki">
             v/pizzagatewiki
            </a>
            , the admins will not have to miss out on anything at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of stuff here is too meta, if you catch my drift.

              We already have some better ones. PizzaGateUncensored, PizzagateUnedited, PizzaGate2.  What you need is a place that won't censor and allows discussion amongst the researchers on the posts. This place deletes most of the credible, informative posts. You need to have more discussion and better archiving to further your investigations. This is not a place that allows that.

               Do you actually understand anything I am tring to say.
              </p>
              <p>
               I want a place for the wiki's admins to go if they're looking for new relevant things to add to the wiki since this current subverse is too meta, and too time consuming.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's not just that the wiki is running behind, it's that a lot of activity is useless with all the double posts and stuff that gets deleted and stuff that will never be seen by the admins.
              </p>
              <p>
               It'd be nice to have a subverse dedicated to stuff that the admins most ceraintly wouldn't want to miss out on; it's their task to adapt the information and eternalize its availability, all in the context of the wiki.
              </p>
              <p>
               This makes it easier for people who are entirely unaffiliated to the wiki to contribute as well, filter out relevant stuff, post it in de wiki subverse, and the admins are to compile the data, facts, whatever they come up with. It's mostly the little stuff, the small details that get buried in here, that can be very helpful in the articles, that need constant updating as new facts emerge.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's not about discussion, or mod integrity, it's about wanting to prevent even the littlest bits of information from disappearing into oblivion.
