            This producer now is involved with a new theatre group in DC called SeeNoSun, a company that says its mission is to produce plays “that explore human monsters and the unspeakable acts they commit.” Alexandra Tyding is closely tied to these groups and the associated (disgusting) "interactive" plays.

            I don't think it's a code list... I think it's a word counter for something.  The highest numbers are for words like "the," "of," and "and" while the words with the lowest count at the bottom of the page are all words I've never used. . . And I play a lot of Scrabble.
