<p>President Donald Trump on Monday denied that federal agents along the US-Mexico border used tear gas on child migrants, but photos and videos show women and children migrants were among those caught up in an incident between border agents and a migrant group that rushed a border crossing Sunday.</p>
<p>At the White House, Trump said that border agents involved in the incident “had to use (force) because they were being rushed by some very tough people and they used tear gas.”</p>
<p>“Here’s the bottom line, nobody’s coming into our country unless they’re coming legally,” he added. Trump also said the Mexican government “wants to see if they can straighten it out.”</p>
<p>The President later also denied that the tear gas was used against children. However, video and images of the scene also showed a cloud of tear gas that sent people running and screaming, including families with young children.</p>
<p>Video   <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/25/us/san-ysidro-port-of-entry-closed/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/25/us/san-ysidro-port-of-entry-closed/index.html</a></p>
<p>“Is it OK to use tear gas on children?” a reporter asked.</p>
<p>The President responded, “We didn’t. We don’t use it on children.”</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said, per protocol, the decision to fire was made by agents on the scene using their professional judgment, and also per protocol the incident will be reviewed. He also described CBP as having responded with use of force to primarily adult males throwing rocks.</p>
<p>McAleenan told reporters earlier Monday that as many as 1,000 people that were part of a migrant caravan traveling through Central America and Mexico sought to enter the US illegally.</p>
<p>Closing the border crossings “prevented a dangerous situation from getting worse,” McAleenan said.</p>
<p>He added that according to CBP’s initial report, 69 people were apprehended entering the US. McAleenan said he was not aware of any successful illegal entries by caravan members into the US.</p>
<p>“[CBP] effectively managed an extremely dangerous situation involving over 1,000 individuals who sought to enter the US unlawfully in large groups. They did so safely and without any reported serious injuries on either side of the border,” McAleenan said.</p>
<p>Sunday’s incident marked an escalation of tensions that have been mounting since groups of Central American migrants began arriving in Tijuana a few weeks ago on their journey to attempt to gain entry to the US. The incident began with a march to the border that organizers said would be peaceful. In response, CBP deployed additional personnel to San Ysidro, California, on Sunday in expectation of demonstrations on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>McAleenan said individuals breached the border fence to the east of San Ysidro and some went west and sought to enter through the Tijuana River channel. He described “assaultive behavior” by some migrants in both locations. Border Patrol agents countered using “less lethal devices,” which included tear gas and “other projectiles,” but not rubber bullets. He said CBP does not have rubber bullets in its inventory on the border.</p>
<p>Four agents were hit with rocks, but because of their protective gear they were not seriously injured, McAleenan said.</p>
<p>Sunday\'s melee closed one of the world\'s busiest international crossings, San Ysidro Port of Entry, near San Diego, to vehicle and pedestrian traffic for several hours. By Sunday afternoon, CBP reopened crossing lanes in both directions to pedestrians and vehicles.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, the President tweeted that the US &quot;will close the Border permanently if need be.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other side of the border in Mexico, Tijuana police had arrested 39 people by Sunday night, the agency said on Facebook.</p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee\'s top Democrat, New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, said in a statement that the incident on the border &quot;is not a surprise, and this administration\'s shoot-from-the-hip border policies have only complicated the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our laws allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum at our southern border, but there is really no clear policy on how to do that,&quot; Nadler added. &quot;And that kind of confusion inevitably leads to desperate incidents like those we saw yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>NOPE.  Here is a Video showing Otherwise that the tear gassing of Children was probably staged.

             Around 500 migrants were reportedly involved in the rush. This after U.S. authorities reportedly detained an additional 69 migrants for illegally crossing the border on Monday, after Mexican border officials reported arresting 39 migrants in Tijuana earlier that day.

             500 migrants in the rush......didn't look like a huge stampede to me.  people milling around behind that woman and 2 Children........   MSM will keep this up they don't back down easy.

            ' they ' whoever organised the migrant caravan were waiting for the travellers to reach the border and when they did they took the opportunity to stage a disturbing photo naturally with a woman and children and then rueters who are fake news released it and probably fooled most of the people unfortunately

             So the woman didn't know you think?  Still she had Children that looked like they were not hers.  It could be she was married to someone much lighter than her.  There are people in certain areas of Mexico that have blond or light brown hair and fair skin.  But this is unlikely.  Still those Children look like they were not loved by this woman.  She would only bring them all that way if she cared for them.  Or they were taken.  I feel so sad for those Children.  Something is seriously up with the diaper and the flip flops.   Wonder where are those Little Babies?

             Agree.  Unfortunately I have seen it on TV and it is nothing like what is in those videos.  Nothing.  And the children would be seriously hurt and screaming loud and covering their eyes.  These people are totally immoral.  I can't even find words horrid enough.  What did they do to them to make them cry like that in the pictures?  Scare the HE77 out of them?  God Awful.

            I couldn't even read it all, makes me so angry.
People, adults, whomever...brought innocent children to a dangerous situation.  Never should of happened.
Second, said people put those children in front, further endangering them..

             I totally agree.  They are creating a lie and putting it in front of people in their dens and living rooms.  But wait!  Why don't people notice what is being done to those Children?  They are endangering their lives in order to create a lie. It's so Obvious.   All to create FAKE NEWS.

             Yes, the camera man is a huge tip off and the guy standing still by him.  Tear gas is horrid and people have to clear it out with milk is what I have read.  Why aren't people rubbing their eyes?  And why are those Children so unclothed?  What is the point of that?  Children coming all that way do not come without shoes.  There is no way a mother that seems to be so worried about her Children would bring them from Central America without shoes.  So sad what they are putting those Children through.  Child Abuse.

              for exposing Pegasus Museum. I doubt ANY of them are laughing. They tried to silence us multiple ways multiple times and merely succeeded in creating a public record of media coverups that continue to fuel citizen journalism even now.

             she thought they were going to die because of the gas they inhaled, the small cloud of smoke near the ground is nothing like tear gas.  People need to wake up.  Hopefully these pics and memes will Wake some more Sheep from their Sleep.

              Wasn't the tear gas deployed on the US side of the fence? Doesn't tear gas make much more smoke/haze?  Aren't tear gas contains bigger?

               hehe thanks, darkknight111 blacksmith21(got them mixed up) :P and I agree, they can say what they want, opionions are just that....opinions, but when they start to use abusive or offensive language, we can do without that. ESPECIALLY when all we are doing is trying to expose these sick pedos. You do great work Carmencita :D

              WOW.  Well, that is why I usually ignore him.  He is probably the same alt as Donkey and he has threatened me in the past, including making a horrid post about me.   So really I don't answer people that don't treat me with respect.  They don't have to agree with me, just respect me. That's some record.

             PRECISELY!  If anything the 'mother' should be charged with child neglect and putting children in harms way, and if it is proved she is not the 'mother' she should be charged with kidnapping and child trafficking! They get off scot free and never seem to pay for their obvious criminal activities.

              What I am trying to say this is a Set Up.  They Staged it.  The camera men standing around, etc.  People standing around in the background while this woman and Children are the only ones gassed?  Crazy.  We talked about that yesterday and now well, we see it happening before our eyes.  STAGED.

                Yes, that too  The effects are much more horrible than they show, if it was tear gas.  We are the ones they are also being smoke bombed, in a different way.  Can't make this stuff up.
