<p>If you download the document numbered 47080: 47080_1.4 a FB Savin.doc, there is very interesting information about the pedo political crime industry.</p>
<p>One particular interesting quote states that pedos pay for children through buying pieces of art. This explains why the art industry has paintings and other art works on sale for thousands to millions of dollars. </p>
<p>Here is the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My family is raped for my entire lifetime &amp; I’m almost 50 years old &amp; not a single officer, except Ryan Russell was listening or acknowledging &amp; Ryan is nopw mysteriously dead &amp; I believe police Chief Bill Blair instructed &amp; organized the death to occur in the same manners he has been trying to kill me. It is likely that a very high price will be paid for the dress &amp; it will include the cost of the dress &amp; the cost of the monarchies raping Charlie’s babies included, the same as how pedophiles pay for the children through the canvas painting industry. People wonder why an ugly painting will sell for millions? The answer is right under own noses. Michael Jackson didn’t  want all the paintings he had to purchase. There are storage costs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also interesting, is on PJW\'s recent video about &quot;Modern Art&quot;: <a href="https://youtu.be/PRWJcrRO0GM">https://youtu.be/PRWJcrRO0GM</a>, I commented how the art industry is a great way to launder money, and which became the top comment: <a href="https://snag.gy/sOvIP6.jpg">https://snag.gy/sOvIP6.jpg</a>. But after it became the top comment it was &quot;randomly&quot; removed while the all other top comments remain, even though mine had more likes than even PJW\'s pinned comment: <a href="https://snag.gy/EZS5qz.jpg">https://snag.gy/EZS5qz.jpg</a></p>
<p>If you go back to that same WikiLeaks Stratfort link above and download the document numbered 47096: 47096_1.5 FB Ryan Russell Evidentary.doc, you can read some interesting information about how pedos work as a gang to systematically attack and even kill anyone trying to expose them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience pedophiles can very easily murder and prefer it as a first resort. I see pedophiles working with transplant surgeons, funeral homes, police, children’s aid societies, organizations of assistance, judges, politicians &amp; more.</p>
<p>As a result no one cares about the children &amp; turn their back on their conscience. That is why 6 years later, I’m still asking the police to save my daughters life &amp; they don’t respond &amp; I see one after another of connected murders happening &amp; still no one listens because the pedophiles have spread out of control. When pedophiles attack there are so many of them against one, operating in teams / gangs &amp; it becomes near impossible to prove the truth. Pedophiles have been doing this same sequence of events to get caring parents out of the way for a very long time. This pedophile &amp; necrophile team / gang principle is what the foreign &amp; phantom monarchies bring as an infestation while pretending to be royal</p>

<p>Maybe we should use their methods, and begin to coordinate our efforts to systematically expose each and every pedo elite!</p>',

            She is hard to read at times.  I'm no shrink, but I think she'd do better if she wrote 5 paragraphs, paused for awhile and came back at it.  One can see how her mind begins to snowball and become overwhelmed.  This   *could  be signs of emotional trauma, or maybe poor education.   ??

            Ytube  and  voat comments are filled with people who can't grasp why certain things are inappropriate to others, for example pgate issues.

            I don't think a nurse could flash 10 patients a day and become a mass beneficiary.  It would eventually be discovered, according to this commentary it was discovered.

           <p>
            You think Canada is open for any crime and USA, UK, Australia,  the EU in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and on and on,  do you honestly think any other country political corporate  governance  isn't psychotic?
           </p>
           <p>
            You think a government with Obama's, Bush and Clinton's insanity,  not to mention  a lot of  what I"m seeing from Trump, isn't psychotic?  If that  doesn't  come under the heading of  ''open to any crime'''  then I don't know what is.
            <br/>
            Can you see the forest for the trees here,  it's all the same crap different package.

            Sorry to hear of your traumatic experience and that you were triggered.  (I get triggered in here all the time; l know how tough it is.)

            Virtually every one of these pedos are affiliated with some "child/sex abuse fighting" government-sanctioned NGO.  It's disgusting but it makes sense -- it's the perfect way for them to "hide" in plain sight and collect intel.  Gotta keep up the public front!

            None of this will ever end until people stop worshipping the "pillars of soceity."  The "pillars' are actually the CRIMINALS.

            Absolutely, it's used to launder money. I had this thought quite a while ago and now here's the proof. It just seemed such a natural, intuitive way for the money to change hands.

            Old news, but good to refresh. The mechanizations have been exposed for some time now, and it is obvious to even the blind that the FBI would have to be the village idiot to not know what is going on, when the rest of the planet knows how the child farming system works by now. The conclusion being that the FBI is in on it. The only people that can resist our corrupted criminal authorities are the President and his cabinet. They have done nothing but guarantee Comey as FBI director. Hardly inspires confidence.

            Canada is notorious for  public experimentation... not saying that means she's legit, but just saying it may mean she's out of control.

            I'm cautious about these things given the fact that anyone who underwent  high levels of abuse are likely psychologically damaged and unsound.  I would actually expect damage and psychosis.    I think a brilliant deviant might use  it as a sympathy poor-me technique to gain fame in other areas.  I'm not sure this person is that brilliant.

            As a small gallery owner I don't know of nor ever have run across any child trafficking. We in a small market city for art, not big sales. But I do know the modern art world can be full of snobbery and elitism. Though all the gallery owners I know are very nice people who try to help artists and we all struggle to make a buck like everyone else. This money laundering is most likely on the big auction houses like Sotheby's and Christies where they sell the big money art.

            The Art World is a nepotistic circle jerk of homosexuals and satanic pedophiles.

            I would be the only female in the room and my job would be to serve drinks to these men. And I would overhear time and again, the eldest gay curator say to the youngest gay professor, "so who's the next hot young gay artist to be graduating from such and such?" "Oh that's so and so," would come the reply. And sure enough so and so would become the next hot artist with all the commercial shows.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I brought up the nepotism, I said, "if you weren't gay men, if you were any other group, if you were straight men, you would have been shut down already," I was replaced with a fresh young gay.

             I noticed years ago that gays were a new preferred minority group in hiring practices. If you are a well qualified straight and in the running for a job against a faggot, you will most likely lose.

            I read through some more of those documents from that email and now have a headache. They're all over the damn place. Who in the hell is forced to read through that?! It's like reading something a schizophrenic wrote. Not that it doesn't have good info in there, but you have to be willing to read through some absolute nonsense to get there.

            Yes!  I read some long extensive article about the art world as a front for laundering definitely for drugs but why wouldn't it be the same for the more lucrative human and sex trafficking trade?  And FBI Anon-talking about the cards that was a very interesting thread. It really does help connect the dots as far as how the revenue stream can change hands and be covered up

            Just mentioning you are underage would result in PEDOleak back in the old chatroom days of the internet. Even if you were young,  claiming to be older was protection from these sickos.

            We can easily do this and so much more.  We should lure them into etc.  Etc.  Etc.

            If only there was anybody/anysite we could trust fully.  That's the only issue.  We can identify all the socialmedia PEDOS within a week. They can't help themselves

            .  I  have previously submiited information regarding Stratfor/Global Intelligence Files to pizzagate encouraging everybody to review.  You have managed to break-through with an excellent submission. This entire Wikileaks dump reveals a wealth of info, but it appears that nobody comments on it...ever.  Actually, I find that very strange.  What are the reasons for ignoring?

           <p>
            would u have thought someone saying the  US government is involved in human trafficking/pedophilia/organ harvesting is nuts?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or that the CIA literally is watching you...nuts
           </p>
           <p>
            I would have.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now everything that is nuts, seems to have truth to it. Conspiracy theories are more fact than fiction, the mews is more fiction than fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's face the 100% truth...the gov has been fucking with our minds since birth.

              Notice how many of these pedos are "small business owners?"  The type of business -- well, aside from food-related ones like pizzarias and donut shops that are signalling -- doesn't really matter.  They launder the money through the business so the business is basically just a front.  This is a favorite method for drug dealers -- see Walter White's car wash.  :)
