<p>Yesterday it was revealed lawyers for Epstein\'s victims were considering bringing a lawsuit to pressure Andrew to give evidence in the long-running scandal.</p>
<p>David Boies, chairman of a high-profile New York law firm, claims \'there is too much evidence\' connecting the Duke to the paedophile financier \'for the allegations to simply go away\'.</p>
<p>He said the prince was \'continuing to delay and obfuscate\' over repeated claims he had sex with one of Epstein\'s teenage victims.</p>
<p>Mr Boies urged Andrew to agree to an informal interview, as it would be the best way for him to \'advance his interests\' if he \'really has nothing to hide\'.</p>
<p>The lawyer said he has asked to interview the prince and is willing to travel to London to make the process more comfortable for him.</p>

            There are several pics of Epstein, Prince Andy and Maxwell with Trump. Bill Clinton admits he took four around-the-world trips with Epstein on Epstein's plane. On one trip Ron Burlkle joined them. The trips were allegedly to further Clinton Foundation business — extorting donations from or doling out money to locals. You'd think there would be many pics and vids, by local media or local citizens. "Former US President Clinton and Associates Visit Phucket to Open Orphanage." That sort of thing.

               There was an accuser who was a scammer, as I recall the story was first shopped around for $$$ to the tabloids and they didn't bite. And later several  further attempts were made to give DT bad press before the election by attempting lawsuits, one was filed by a patent lawyer, one was where the defendant represented herself.  A case was dropped, dismissed, refiled. If I recall correctly at some point the effort involved a Bush donor/bundler behind the scenes reviving the failed story/case.  I don't have that info and beyond the following info, I am not going to be rehashing this already hashed out story against Trump.

               Regarding the Katie Johnson accusations

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                It was thrown out of four civil courts, because when they tried to contact "Ms. Johnson," the address she gave turned out to be fake, as was her phone number. In fact, everything written on the document was fraudulent.
               </p>
               <p>
                But it was enough for the Clinton machine to muddy the waters and create a false equivalency between Bill Clinton's documented real-life, authenticated victims (who've been around for decades) and Trump's shadowy, invisible, just-appeared-for-the-campaign victims . . . who conveniently melted back into the Ether after the election.

               Two earlier suits were filed over the same alleged events.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The first suit over the alleged rapes was filed in federal court in Riverside, California, in April by someone acting without an attorney and using the name "Katie Johnson." That suit named both Trump and Epstein as defendants
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsequent news reports raised doubts about who filed the suit. Johnson claimed she had just $300 in assets and that she was living at a home in Twentynine Palms, California, but Radar Online reported neighbors said the home had been foreclosed upon and vacant since its owner died last year.
               </p>
               <p>
                U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee dismissed that case in May 2016 , ruling that Johnson's complaint didn't raise valid claims under federal law. Gee, an appointee of President Barack Obama, noted that the suit cited a criminal statute that doesn't give rise to civil damages and that the civil statute Johnson cited only applies to actions based on "race-based or class-based animus."

               I think Trump did figure out Epstien, the  Clintons, and many others, and that is why so many high level people want him gone. Trump is a womanizer like me, but maybe does not like that kind of behavior. We shall all see, but why would they even be asking for Andrew to testify if they did not have something to catch him on?

                Well, since his good friend of and mentor Roy Cohn ran some of the CIA child rape and sex trafficking operations before Epstein did, I think he was tipped off regarding Epstein, and was too prudent to go to his island.

                 It can get kind of complicated, but I have a feeling Trump is still keeping some enemies close for a reason. I am sure you are familiar with the quote that is highly disputed, but the concept is much older than a 70's movie. Sun Tzu - Wikiquote, Chapter XIII · Intelligence and Espionage. He might have acted on some rumors a long time ago, and sent private investigators that we don't know about. He runs everything through lawyers as a rule. If he really was part of this group of people, then why would he not just sit back and let Hillary win? All speculation at this point, but I am sure everyone can agree that there is something going on that is the opposite of Jimmy Carter's Presidency on a, 'boring to exciting', scale graph.

                  Yes, it's all speculation. Trump was a friend of the Clintons, invited them to his wedding with Melania, and even donated to the Clinton Foundation.

               It was acceptable in theater and TV, at least until a few years ago, for cast members to be totally naked not only in dressing rooms but backstage or in hallways for quick costume changes. There are pics of Eminem for one example, so it wasn't that long ago.

                I am not complaining about the girls and women being naked; I am complaining about a man who intentionally walked in and stared at the girls and women in order to enjoy himself.  Because he thought he could away with it as he was running the beauty pageants.  And these were dressing rooms where otherwise no men were allowed in.

                Then he even bragged about it.

                That's really not so hard to understand.

               You believe Trump knew and condoned that Epstein was running an international tween/teen prostitution racket presumably for an intelligence agency to blackmail businessmen, politicians and others? Or that Epstein Trump knew that Epstein liked 'younger' women (without knowing the rest).

                I believe that Trump knew that Epstein was sexually attracted to and sexually exploited underage girls.
               </p>
               <p>
                About the rest I am not sure. Given that Barr has intentionally denied justice to the victims, let Epstein either escape or get murdered, and is covering everything up now, Trump knew at least from the moment he became POTUS.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think he knew that Roy Cohn, his close friend and mentor, was running blackmail and child rape and trafficking operations; and that he just didn't care.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, he chose Mike Pompeo, the former head of the CIA sex trafficking and child rape operations as his Secretary of State.
               </p>
               <p>
                He has also been a friend of Naomi Campbell's ex-boyfriend Flavio Briatore, of underage girls orgy fame (=&gt; Berlusconi) for three decades.
               </p>
               <p>
                Briatore had ties to Epstein, Epstein even brought Virginia Giuffre to Naomi's birthday party in France (there are pics) when she was Briatore's gf.
               </p>
               <p>
                Me thinks he sought the company of too many child rapists and sex traffickers.

            The pics were taken at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump and Melania gave a party for Prince Andrew, joined by their buddies, sex traffickers Ghislaine Maxwell, and Epstein.

            Meanwhile, poor Andy claims he is the victim of a 'witch hunt'.

             Trust the Truth.....Agree ...ley lines are key.....maybe why it is darn near impossible to find a good map with ley line crossings , which potentiate power. Used to be common knowledge among all strata of society...but like so many things have been covered up by our so called educational system. Also the area in Bimini where planes and ships disappear supposedly the lost continent of submerged continent of Atlantis. They had advanced weaponry that I think our govt. wants to duplicate....it was their undoing . The two states that rigged the 2000 election, Fl. and Ohio are huge mafia hang outs. Fl. is very very close to Bimini.....as well as Cuba........maybe why Russia set the missiles up there when JFK was in office. It was an outrageous thing to do.
