            Hm.  This must have been added somewhat recently (within the past few months).  I read the whole wiki page a few months ago, and don't remember that being in there.
           </p>

            <p>
             A pediatrician who examined the three child witnesses in the retrial of McMartin Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey testified this week that she found physical evidence of "blunt force penetrating trauma" consistent with sexual abuse in all three.

           <p>
            So there was actually evidence of abuse.  I stand corrected on that.  The question becomes separating the truth from the nonsense (I think we can agree no kids were flushed down toilets).  I think logic suggests that IF a vast tunnel network under the school existed, its existence would have been conclusively confirmed when people went looking for it (not to mention how obvious any attempt to fill in such a tunnel system would have been).  The question I have now is specifically how the claims of children being flown across the country to be abused by elites originated.

            Source? Maybe some of them did, but that's no way of determining whether or not abuse actually happened.  As far as I'm aware, there was zero evidence of any abuse, other than testimony that was basically coerced out of toddlers by leading questions.  (When the jurors saw how the children were questioned, they rejected the validity of the testimony.  The way they were questioned actually went against state guidelines even at that time).

            I met him back in 1996 and he was very helpful just because some things that were going on with me. He had a lot to say about a lot of things not just FEMA camps etc. Much in fact of what he told me back in 96 is now considered true, not a conspiracy. Some stuff he got a bit out there with and I know people like Stew Webb had a big problem with him. I visited his apartment in Vegas and it sure didn't look like he he was living the high life. Don't know what to think about him other than he had a lot of information back then, most of it now accepted as truth

             No, it's the one that got started when a crazy woman (who admitted she was mentally ill) noticed her toddler had constipation or something.  Look it up.  The investigators basically coerced a bunch of toddlers into saying they were abused (and their stories included things like being flushed down toilets and riding in hot air balloons).  It's the classic case that spawned the whole "false memory syndrome" concept.  Ted Gunderson is a disinfo shill trying to make us look like nutters.

              Millenial Falcon -   I live in California where McMartin elementary used to be and it is absolutely TRUE.   The entire "false memory syndrome" is what pedos use to discredit their victims!    There was even an investigation done by Dr. E. Gary Stickel (of UCLA) and his opinion was that TUNNELS DID EXIST.  "Among a host of  telling signs, Stickel pointed out to Perez that the soil used to back fill the tunnels was FOREIGN to the local area. The grade, composition, and mineral makeup of the soil was geologically DIFFERENT from the adjacent, undisturbed soil.."      To say that dozens of pre school kids can MAKE UP the fact that they were being raped and that animals were killed in front of them to scare them enough not to talk  IS JUST PLAIN WRONG MAN!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              Seriously!  WTF Millenial?
             </p>
             <p>
              If you think McMartin is a hoax, then you must think Franklin Credit Union is a hoax too!
             </p>
             <p>
              You are supposed to be the leader of this thread - research McMartin more please!

               They found what some thought was evidence of tunnels (read: confirmation bias), but it was just plumbing conduits and previous construction on the site that predated the preschool.

               The rest of your post is just appeal to emotion.  Look at the facts of the case.  Also, one of the toddlers who made up an abuse story (to satisfy the coercive investigators) apologize publicly years later as an adult.

              Nope. literally hundreds of kids came forward in that case and all almost told the exact same story.

              Mcmartin case was legit and "false memory syndrome" was invented at precisely that time to discredit the investigation and bury the story.

            That's COINTELPRO disinfo shill Ted Gunderson.  He has been a promoter of just about every bogus theory one can come up with: reptilians, FEMA internment camps, a United Nations army taking over the United States, "pineapple bombs" at Oklahoma, no-planes on 9/11.
            <strong>
             His aim was to discredit conspiracy research
            </strong>
            by introducing fake evidence, "poisoning the well," giving talks to groups of conspiracy researches to get them to adopt bad evidence and false "tinfoil hat" versions of their theories (e.g. "no plane at the Pentagon"), in order to discredit the true general claims (e.g. 9/11 = inside job) with the general public.  For example, he promotes the McMartin Preschool case (well-known case of false allegations) as an example of an elite pedo ring.   I've seen a lot of people claim he was poisoned with arsenic, but (1) I've never seen any evidence of this, and (2) it makes no sense, because it would have to have been done very gradually, as he died of cancer.

             I completely disagree. Mcmartin case is the pinnacle example of satanic ritual abuse and the lengths elite can go to cover up a story.

             Also, he's right. There is no plane that hit the pentagon.

              There is a place in Mo. The Castlewood Treatment Center which has patients that remember some really strange ritualistic memories that they are claiming never happened.  These are adults now.  They do past life regressions, exploring things that happened in the past, which during this time can be altered.  Yes it is possible to achieve.We know the satanic abuse has occurred.

              I'm with falcon on this one. Gundy was 82 and homeless he wasn't murdered at all. The only spook to say he was murdered was Lucidi who is a crank.
