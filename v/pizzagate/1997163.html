            I hadn't seen that bit about Israeli art students and it's more damming evidence of Israel's collusion. It's shocking because I only found out the truth behind 9/11 this past winter. I'm learning new parts of the story everyday.
           </p>
           <p>
            It goes without saying that whenever the truth about 9/11 is made public all support for Israel will immediately disappear. Israel will be on their own after that. There's a lot of resistance to BDS but that's going to evaporate in a New York Minute.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I had to guess I think Israel will become a pariah like South Africa and it will be sued and sanctioned out of existence. I was a strong supporter of Israel for most of my life. I'm a Protestant by religion. At this point I'm seriously thinking Jesus Christ is about to drop kick Israel in the balls and spread them to the four corners of the wind again.

            It's kind of spooky if it happens around 2060. That would make a nice round 2000 years since they were expelled the last time. Back then it was the Romans. This time it will be the entire world.

             There are several emails from Huma Abedin to Clinton about the situation. I know you already know that and all anybody has to do is look and no I won't do your homework and no you don't "win" because I refuse.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Yes, and you apparently don't understand any of these emails because none of them prove your case.   None of them indicate Clinton knew Silsby beforehand.  It's routine that the State Department monitor cases Americans arrested overseas particularly high profile cases.  Consular services to Americas overseas are a basic function of the State Department.
           </p>

           <p>
            You claim I'm not serious, when you refuse to provide evidence for your claims.  Not only am I serious, I am correct and not paid by anyone for this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the Amanda Knox case from 2007?  The America who was convicted of murder in Italy before she was exonerated?   The State Department was following that case from the beginning as well.  As they should, as would be routine.  This is proof that this is a routine function of the State Department that predates Clinton.  For more proof search Wikileaks for AMCIT, it's the term they use for American citizen and you will lots of emails looking into AMCIT arrested overseas.

            <p>
             Newly released diplomatic cables reveal State Department officials regularly monitored Amanda Knox since the day after her arrest and through her conviction for murdering her roommate.
The cables (PDF), released as part of a formal Freedom of Information Act request and made available  to seattlepi.com, reveal that U.S. embassy officials in Rome reported to the Secretary of State's Office in Washington, D.C., on a regular basis regarding "Amcit Amanda Knox" (American citizen Amanda Knox)

           <p>
            As for the Silsby case, it's quite clear how that information got to Clinton.  Here are the first couple of emails on the case, before any knew Laura Silsby's name or any of the Americans arrested.  They were just 10 AMCIT.  The first email is from "Haiti TaskForce1I-(CA) Consular Affairs"

             I am seeking more information about this but want to let you know before the 5pm call that 10 Amcits were reportedly
arrested by Haitian police near the DR border with 33 Haitian children whom they reportedly planned to take to an

             The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). Bill Bistransky found the attached "Plan

            Mossad were the hired help. And to be honest they're the one group that actually had a understandable reason to participate. A new war against radical Islam would helped them greatly. That's why those Israeli's were dancing on 9/11. They knew America entering the war Israel had been fighting since 1949 would lead to a rout. Syria today is the best example of that.

            Bush, Rockefeller, the Rothschilds, the Crown Agents and the American Mafia had no moral excuse to do what they did.

            All charities, foundations, trusts - any non-profit - needs close oversight, checks &amp; balances and regular audits. They've been used as fronts for criminal activity for a LONG time. Because who would suspect anti-human trafficking activists of being human traffickers? When you address this level of deception, you're dealing with the true scum of the Earth.

            It absolutely did not.  And those are from Clinton's emails that came out way earlier than Podesta's which led to pizzagate.  Clinton was not entangled in it whatsoever, the emails make quite clear no one on Clinton's team had ever heard of Silsby before she got arrested.  Just that they were 10 American Baptist Missionaries arrested.   Do you not know that helping Americans travelling in other countries is one of the main things the State Department does?   That Consular Services includes helping Americans arrested in other countries.

            Because that explains everything in Clinton's emails regarding Silsby.  You're atrributing Silsby's crime to Clinton and that is dishonest, because there is no evidence Clinton ever heard of this woman.

            In terms of code and "clandestine activities."  Do you mean illicit or illegal actitivities because they are not the same thing.  You and I are both involved in a clandestine rights now because we are both posting under pseudonyms.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for code.  You can't simply change what people said by making up a code and use that code of evidence of Illegal activity.  It's ridiculous.  You just made up the evidence and the proof based on nothing.

            Those hankies are a potential "smoking gun" if they can be procured.

            Luminol reacts with hemoglobin. Might want to test for blood on those hankies too given rape has a high chance of inducing "oriface bleeding" in its victims.

              Yes that is it. In this post he discusses A.Dover as well. Dover posted on Voat personally about his knowledge of Child Trafficking...MK Ultra. He was involved in the Hampstead Cover-up in the U.K.  with the two children whose stories were leaked.
             </p>
             <p>
              He had direct knowledge and documents implicating "the crown" itself and members of his family. He was on Voat for a few months but was found dead as he predicted.

                Yes it is mind blowing it connects everyone including the crown (royals) the Clinton Foundation, the child trafficking but also the ongoing MK Ultra training of chosen children as seen in the Hampstead case. Many of us were involved in this research from the beginning and these huge threads disappeared eventhough the eyewitness Aaron Dover was directly posting on Voat and stating he would be killed. He died at age 42 just four months later.
               </p>
               <p>
                Here is research just on Hampstead (U.K.) alone through the years.
               </p>
               <p>
                Please research archive links of Hampstead children interviews by police, medical reports detailing they both had internal injuries from sexual assault, these were leaked on-line in 2015 by insiders to get the truth out. Their father (accused) Ricky Dearman worked with Clinton Foundation in Haiti.

            The handkerchief could really be pizza (non kid) related. I guess if you collect handkerchiefs, they have series that come out. That these maps highlight different places, for instance a golf course handkerchief highlighting all golf courses on a map, etc... People collect them.

            JimmyLionstar1,
           </p>
           <p>
            I just wanted to make sure you knew there's a twist to that Sandler/Podesta
            <a href="http://www.kimnoble.com/Nowheretorun.jpg">
             "pizza related"
            </a>
            handkerchief.
           </p>
           <p>
            The realtor didn't add in the "pizza related" when she emailed Susan Sandler. The realtor just said she'd found a handkerchief. Susan Sandler added the "pizza-related" herself in the email she sent to John Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people miss that fact but it's incredibly suspicious given Susan Sandler added in "pizza related" without ever having seen the handkerchief. That's not a smoking gun per se but it's completely rational to be suspicious considering "Cheese Pizza" is a known Pedophile code word for child porn.
           </p>
           <p>
            AreWeSure and I have been over this many times. AreWeSure assumes Susan Sandler must have talked on the phone with the realtor at some point and was told the handkerchief was "pizza related".
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would AreWeSure give Susan Sandler the benefit of the doubt? Easy. Susan Sandler is a rich white person and they're incapable of committing such a heinous act as child rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            AreWeSure I guess Susan Sandler's automatic exoneration would be "white privilege"? Isn't that the term these days? We don't want to live in a society where rich white people are above reproach right? You tell me.
           </p>
           <p>

              It's all in the email. Read it going oldest to newest and you can clearly see the only reference to "pizza" is from Susan Sandler to John Podesta:

              Don't be fooled by AreWeSure. He's not objective and is not here to discover the truth. AreWeSure is here to brow beat Deplorables.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course the great irony of AreWeSure is the fact he's the poster child for Useful Idiocy. Anthropologists will study the likes of AreWeSure for years in an effort to better understand
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds">
               mass delusion.
              </a>
              AreWeSure represents an entire class of American who's above the Truth. Facts don't matter to AreWeSure. Any decent from from the Party Line is called "lying".
             </p>
             <p>
              Rememeber that one AreWeSure? I presented the theory WTC 7 was brought down by
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1966675">
               controlled demolition
              </a>
              and you called the evidence "lying". Lol, I almost wet my pants. Speaking of WTC 7 you never address the two pieces of evidence dealing with Larry Silverstein. Remember 8 and 9?
             </p>
             <p>
              8) WTC owner Larry Silverstein* used the common building demolition term
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p34XrI2Fm6I">
               "pull it"
              </a>
              implying a decision was made to bring down WTC 7 on purpose. Again this points to a controlled demolition and not a collapse due to fire.
             </p>
             <p>
              9) Larry Silverstein has made several slips of the tongue implying he had advanced knowledge of 9/11 the most egregious being
              <a href="https://youtu.be/j-_WYHwUtcI?t=20">
               this one.
              </a>
              Why would he start designing the replacement for WTC 7 a full year before 9/11?
             </p>
             <p>
              It's time for you to address Larry Silverstein's comments AreWeSure.

               Hmm.. that is interesting thanks for pointing it out.
              </p>
              <p>
               On the topic of 9/11 WTC .. anyone with a brain can see that a the house´s would not tubule in to the ground in free fall speed. it would have tipped, there is most mass downwards. The houses should have tipped. (Thats my view). I am not saying explosive here.. I am just pointing out that all 3 houses tubule in to the ground. The odds of not one of the buildings not tipping to the side says something is not right.
              </p>
              <p>
               And i am not saying AreWeSure has no brain. ill let you be the judge on that :)

            I realize Schwartz is a common Jewish name, but wonder if Jacob Schwartz, busted with Child Porn, is related to both Zach Schwartz and maybe George.

            This is related to pizzagate because  we know that The Sandlers  were mentioned in the JP emails and are connected to the Clinton Foundation.  Herb Sandler sent an email about dominos and cheese on pasta and the famous "handkerchief email".

             You know what I find weird AreWeSure? The fact you are not bothered by Hillary Clinton's $20+ million phosphate mining deal with the King of Morocco. Eric Braverman was so bothered by it he quit the Clinton Foundation but not you.

             Do you know what phosphorous can be used for?

             White Phosphorous Weapons.

             You are a Limousine Liberal who doesn't give a fuck about poor people. You like high end napkins and fancy furniture. But when Hillary Clinton is busted selling phosphorous to Bulgarian weapons factories you don't miss a heartbeat.

             Someday when this is all over you're going to have to deal with your willful ignorance of some of the worst crimes in American History. But until then there is one thing I am very sure of:

             in case you didn't know it AreWeSure is the most naive person on planet Earth right now. If you find yourself dumbfounded someone could be so gullible you're not alone. I've been dealing with this shit for the past 6 months. The best was when AreWeSure told me $6 Pakistani Mangoes were worth the 500% mark up over its Mexican rival.

               really, because I've heard from about 15,000 commercials on tv that opioids are supposed to induce constipation.  you should recheck the origin of your mangos.

              I think the dominoes email is fairly easy to decipher, but the point is, they are strangers to you.  They are referring to shared experiences that you are not part of, so it's reasonable to assume you won't understand 100% of what they are saying.
             </p>
             <p>
              So that is not strange to me at all.  I don't know these people I don't know how they normally speak.  There no basis at all to assume they are speaking in code.   And this is the start of pizzagate.   The emails themselves are not the source of the suspicions.    The emails were viewed suspiciously from the start and thousands of emails were combing though and a few "strange emails" were picked out.   It's not a way to get to the truth.

                Me.  Yes.  I own a few bandannas.  And on the occasions I have to wear a suit, I'll use plain white handkerchiefs.

               <p>
