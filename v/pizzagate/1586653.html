            I agree, what is more simple than we are all one? The basic tennent of the truly initiated. Initiation from God occurs outside of lodges, it is experience. Your experiences that lead you to understand language was a form of initiation, and via that you became capable of expressing your opinion to myself and others via the internet over vast expanses of the planet (the internet being another form of initiation). I am not for secrecy or for complication, I am for revelation in the form of understanding the mysteries that were hidden from us by the secret societies, it is not complicated as they would have us believe, understanding leads us back to the truth that we are ALL children of God. Those who do not understand history are destined to repeat it.
Edit: Plus, if you're all about simplicity, then there is no life more simple than that of those indigenous populations who are still living in harmony with nature. I'd be interested to see how you would fare without the complexity that surrounds you enabling to live a very comfortable lifestyle and the time to communicate your message. That lifestyle incidentally comes at a cost.

            We need to stop investigating the Clinton Foundation and all this Comet Ping Pong stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to look further into the past--hundreds of years ago. This is definitely ancient.
           </p>
           <p>
            When we find the ancient clues we will have solved pizzagate.
           </p>

            We need to focus all attention on something other than the present and all the facts people have gathered and look deep, deep into the past.

             You are right. Skull and Bones is fairly recent but that place grooms our leaders. They practice black sex magic and possibly worse... Many of the powers that be practice ritual black magic and blood sacrifice. For those that disbelieve they are a soul experiencing a body, it's bad enough; people, especially children are brutally murdered.
            </p>
            <p>
             The perpetrators certainly believe every living thing embodies a spirit. This is why they drink the blood of the victim's last heart beat, they consume the life force of the individual. Magicians practicing blood sex magic strike the death blow at the moment of orgasm allowing them to utilize the victim's spirit for their own sick power or as a gift to a particular demon or the Devil himself. Either way, the soul's journey is high jacked making it the worst of crimes.

             Search throughly enough and you will find answers long proclaimed by conspiracy theorists. It is the work which is part and parcel for the Illuminati driving the NWO agenda as put forth by the upper echelons of the Free Masons as handed down by the Knights Templar. Of course all roads lead to Rome as the Vatican is and has been doing the same.

            In the documentary "Where is Johnny?" it directly links "Conspiracy of Silence." Both of these documentaries go hand in hand with pizzagate. My question is, in the documentary "Where is Johnny" where was this house at that Paul Bonacci took investigators to that had the children's names inscribed on the support beams. Seriously, that whole section had SO much evidence regarding all of it. This documentary and Conspiracy of Silence to me proves without a doubt authorities cover this up and know more than what we're being told. Just like the part where they interview the FBI and he refuses to talk about the Johnny Gosch case. I completely disagreed with the statements at the end where the guy says "The Catholic organization is an example of an organization that isn't bad, but has bad people. Just like the FBI." Seriously, if there was an organization that consistently lied about evil things happening just to protect the organization as a whole consistently, then the organization as a whole is all bad. If you want to rid your organization of evil, you be open and honest about what happened and you completely purge that organization of the things that made it evil. You don't spend BILLIONS of dollars to cover up and hide your bishops and priests. You expose the culprits in the FBI who were involved in the evil doing. This builds trust with everyone to show your interest is still the protection of the innocent. With the FBI, it goes back to MLK when they sent him a letter trying to frame him for being sexual deviant and say if you don't kill yourself we're going to start this smear campaign against you. I trust no ONE in the FBI until they come out openly with all the Pizzagate cover up.

            Pizzagate made me realize that the devil and a demonic hoarde exists and is very active. The political elite harness that power through their evil rituals. I also believe in god more than ever, it's about time his power is harnessed and justice wielded, and children liberated.

            The only way to ascend is to destroy the self serving ego, in service of the greater good. Anyone who claims otherwise is a fraud and part of the deception.....and possibly involved in the cycle of abuse you mention. However genuine service doesn't have to occur within a mystery school, they are not all frauds, and mostly not all on the material plane, with no desire to sacrifice anything for anyone (since all is God and God is all). It is good you are researching this stuff, keep going, it will help you know both your enemies (and friends) better.

            Why are some people doomed to have such tragedy in their lives? It's amazing that, after 7 years of abuse and brainwashing, this kid still had empathy enough to find the courage to do for somebody else what he never got up the nerve to do for himself. It is such a good example of two completely different types of people and demonstrates also how crucial it is for children to have kind and loving parents in the first few years of life - those years are formative in a way the years from around 5 onwards aren't. If you're shown love enough as an infant, you'll maintain a reservoir of love for others that you'll pass on throughout your life.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is one of the reasons child abuse is one of the most abhorrent crimes - not just because it is the violation of complete innocence and vulnerability, but also because how you treat a young child now has a knock on effect on behaviour down through generations. Every incident of child abuse is a planted seed that grows like a dark weed, winding in secret through the centuries, choking out love and happiness at it goes. And that's how we've ended up where we are now, investigating this enormous systemic disorder, seemingly impossible in scope. Child abusers should have the longest sentences because it really is the most evil crime in my opinion.

             Considering that this whole elite pedophile group is starting to gain more and more attention- esp. in Europe- I am wondering if Noreen isn’t doing the same thing Paul Bonnaci did in the 80’s- setting herself up to look like a liar in order to help discredit in people’s minds the whole pedophile group, hoping for the same outcome- as if she is deemed a liar, then this whole child abduction and trafficking ring gets dismissed as false. What I know for certain- based on my personal experience with Noreen Gosch and this group of pedophiles, is that Noreen IS a liar, and this group of elite pedophiles is REAL. Just because Noreen Gosch and Paul Bonnaci are liars doesn’t negate this fact even in the least.

            Lengthy, but incredibly credible interview that I listened to recently:

            Everything in it is consistent with our own experiences (involves those in power (politicians, business, police), massive cover up, eliminating people who are getting close to the truth. Look at how this topic has been treated by MSM and TPTB. The most logical explanation is the same one behind her son's story. Look at the DC Police claiming to have investigated when they did no such thing. Suspicion heavily includes those in the DC Police and local FBI office (remember Arun Rao and the instagrams).

            Yes but it was a hell that the individual had a CHOICE to go through, these kids do not. The mystery religions were a way to destroy the ego, the elites subverted it to feed their own.

             From what I understand, on their return from the Crusades, the Knights Templar brought with them 'secret knowledge' most likely involving the worship of Mollok (sp?) They incorporated this 'magic' and symbolism into the cathedrals they built. This pedophile, sex, blood sacrifice ritual was also brought into the inner sanctums of the Catholic religion. Of course the ruling elite and monarchy was involved and still is to this day.

              Almost. The Catholics killed off the Templars, and took control of their organisation, what would become the Freemasons. Baphomet (John the Baptist) had his legacy stolen just like Christ. Remember MOST of history was written by the victors.

                I don't need to. There are thought forms both benevolent and malevolent. Moloch is definitely the latter....my theory is that the word molest comes from its name (no proof though). However, if you're trying to imply that all occultism is a tool for these malevolent consciousnesses, then you'd be wrong. There are two sides to every coin. Its like saying a gun is wrong when it can both murder and protect the innocent. Any sourse of power is only as moral as those who weild it.

                 I wasn't giving you the info to say this is what to think. I was just giving this information on Molech himself. Either way, Molech is evil. It was a god used to sacrifice children to. There is a right and there is a wrong. Despite what the spirit of the world tells you, or tells the rest of the world, it is not a point of view. Molech is evil. There's nothing you can do with Molech that is used for good. It can't be compared to a gun either.
Old French: Molester
Latin: Troublesome - Molestus
Latin: Annoy - Molestare
"To Cause Trouble, to Vex"
late Middle English (in the sense ‘cause trouble to, vex’): from Old French molester or Latin molestare ‘annoy,’ from molestus ‘troublesome.’

                   You're right I switched your wordage around. It's my dyslexia. And yes, Molech is def. the latter. I agree.

                      Don't have Netflix. Thanks though. If you aren't aware of it, "conspiracy of silence" is an awful but informative doc. on YouTube related to the matter.

                       Dude! In this documentary which came out in 2014 I believe, they talk all about Conspiracy of Silence! I was blown away. Seriously, Pizzagate investigators need to watch this documentary because it's a huge piece of the puzzle.

                         I could not believe how much the Des Moines PD was trying to discredit everything after that guy had come forward, showed them the house where they kept children, the children's names were inscribed on a post in the damn house, and then he described her son to a T. Totally shows these people were covering for something other than their own ass.

               Interesting note about John the Baptist. Da Vinci's drawing of John the Baptist was androgynous. I thought it was an occult message, but couldn't decipher it.

               As an aside, everyone writes history, while the winners revise it. Not to nitpick, but some of our greatest findings were preserved relics from those who lost their battles.

                Androgyny refers to the spiritual (male) and physical (female). Both are holy and part of God. The symbol is misunderstood by those out of balance, focusing on sexuality. Hence how satanist dig it for all the wrong reasons. I could not agree more with your last part.

                 I've recently come to understand the alchemical wedding that takes place within the mind, when the masculine and feminine aspects are active and in harmony. What didn't occur to me was that the Dark vulgarization of the sacred alchemical wedding was the base consciousness (i.e., ego-self, or satanic) interpretation of Baphomet...if I'm understanding you correctly. This is very interesting, indeed. Thanks for the clarification, kind soul!

                 Edit: that also helps me understand Da Vinci's painting.

                  Thankyou! Its not often I come across others who understand beyond the "ALL occult is Satanism" which almost literally couldn't be further from the truth. Take it easy friend :)

            Looking into the Gosch case is what started it all for me.  Gosch led to Franklin and down the rabbit hole I went.

             That whole thing was so rotten. The police found cards with the name, preference and addresses of 30,000 child porn subscribers and sent the cards to the State Department. WHAT?

              Those cops should be in jail for covering up for the criminals. In fact they too should be investigated and charged with pedofilia as well simply just for hiding evidence.

             Same with me. Started out one day bored and watched the documentary on Netflix Who Took Johnny. Never been the same since. It changed EVERYTHING. the proof is there. Paul Bonacci was a huge influence and I believe all of his testimony 100%. Sounds crazy but it's true. Sadly...

             Yes, thank you. If one looks deeply enough into the Gosch story you'll find an interview with Noreen where she states her husband may have been involved. She goes on from there to never ever mention him again and he becomes ghost-like. David Shurter said he has partied with Mr. Gosch at pedo clubs. She is not a saint.

              You may want to look a little deeper. Her husband was definitely culpable in her son's disappearance. He went so far a to hire a look alike wife to go meet with public officials. She does everything in her power to make a case for the children and for Johnny, very little of it is about 'her'. Seriously, look again.

               If she was doing that she would mention that her husband may have been involved rather than endlessly epeating the lie that he was plucked off the street by a stranger and no one knows why. If you protect a suspect then you are an accessory to the crime.

                She further reveals that there are literally catalogs of children pedos can choose from. Akino and her husband had her child abducted! Listen to a more current interview for fuck's sake! Her life has been threatened, powerful people have told her to shut the fuck up..  You know what? Fuck off with your bullshit antiquated lies, meat sack.

                She calls her X-husband out as fully culpable! Initially, she was unaware of his guilt and so her narrative changes over the years as she learns new information. If you'll take the time, I'll find you a link?

               I agree with most of the things you post but you are way off on the Gosch case. There are many people online discrediting her and trying to make her appear crazy because they are responsible. Her asshole husband was in on his disappearance and she had absolutely no idea until well after he was kidnapped. Her husband is at this moment GONE as in disappeared off the face of the earth. She has not seen or heard from him for years after she found out he was involved. She found out when a couple of the Franklin kids were shown pics of Johnny and his dad was in the pics and they recognized his dad. Noreen was beyond shocked. He had hired a PI and a woman who looked like Noreen to go visit Paul Bonacci in jail and the FBI to conceal evidence so Noreen would not find out the truth about johnnys disappearance. The CIA and Aquino paid big money to kidnap him from pics the kidnappers took of him some months before. They specifically wanted a clean cut family kid who was never abused for CIA MK Ultra mind control programs, pedo blackmail on politicians and kiddie porn. The life he must have had was pure hell. His mom did everything in her power including hiring her own PI and pushing the FBI and Americas Most Wanted to investigate. She had numerous death threats against her and things happening to her home. The police chief didn't investigate because he was Alicia Owens pedo predator in the Franklin Scandal. I personally believe Jeff Gannon is Johnny Gosch but he would be killed if he released his information to the public. Noreen Gosch is a heroic woman who has spent her life fighting for justice for her son and other missing kids. DO NOT SLANDER HER NAME. There is so much more but this is just a bit so you get the idea. Shills on this blog - yes, shills all over Noreen Gosch name and story online to discredit her and make her look cray - YES but don't fall for it. Peace.

                I don't believe for a second Jeff Gannon is Johnny Gosch. She has to know that. That's my only point. She should have spoken out and stopped the rumor from taking hold, but chose not to. I would never trust anything she had to say after doing that. We disagree. As for Noreen, she's been through hell. And I don't believe she had anything to do with her son's disappearance. Thanks for the explanation.

                 I just think there are way too many unexplained time gaps with Gannon including his college years no one knew of him etc, lack of personal pics, his unexplained family, his White House passes which were way too conveniently given to him with no articles or journalism degree, i need more answers and hard evidence to rule him out. They don't discuss it anymore and Noreen can't comment because his life is on the line, that's what u do have to understand. So many Franklin victims have been murdered. Gannon never took a DNA test either. Noreen only goes on camera for awareness to the cause of child trafficking NOT for herself, no way, she is definately NOT a narcissist. I do want to say we can definitely agree to disagree as long as we both know the facts as I do respect your work on here. Keep up the fight to bring Pizzagate to justice. Thanks :)

             On September 5, 1982, Noreen's son Johnny was delivering his Des Moines Register Sunday edition paper, when two men approached him. He was thrown into a vehicle and was kidnapped.

            This reminded me of jokes and rumors from my child hood in the '70's about men in black cars coming to get you. Does anyone else remember that?

            Noreen Gosch has never given up searching for her son Johnny. She knows the underbelly of this horrid organized crime ring. She has changed State laws to protect children and gives seminars and interviews to inform people and still, she holds on to finding her missing exploited son. She is a wealth of information. Someone should contact her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another Voater suggest an "It's not your fault" campaign aimed at getting kids off of the streets and back home. We need to do this, many of them like Paul Bonocci have a great deal of freedom but they have been forced to commit crimes leading them to believe they can't come home. Should this campaign be launched it will be up to us to intercede and demand the DOJ not attempt to prosecute these victims!
           </p>
           <p>
            Noreen's seminars need to be viewed by every parent and care giver of minor children. Waiting around for the cops in the city-state of the District of Columbia or in any of the actual United States to do the good and right thing is like waiting for the fox to bring the chickens home. Knowledge is power. Let's overpower the bad guys!
