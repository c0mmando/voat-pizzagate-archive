<h2>During his speech, he is going to commit to building a \'Museum Of Remembrance\' of sexual abuse crimes.</h2>
<p>Scott Morrison <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/22/national-child-abuse-apology-morrison-to-commit-to-museum-of-remembrance">will commit</a> to a new museum to raise awareness and understanding of the impacts of child sexual abuse as the centrepiece of what will be an emotional national apology to the survivors of institutional abuse in federal parliament on Monday.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people are expected to be in Canberra for the apology, a symbolic gesture that follows the horrific findings of the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Julia Gillard, the prime minister who set the royal commission in train, is expected to attend.</p>
<p>The prime minister will commit in Monday’s speech to a museum that will be a place of remembrance and reflection, as well as a place cataloguing the events leading up to the royal commission and the national apology, with the scope of the project to be worked out in consultation with survivors.</p>
<p>Morrison will also commit to reporting to parliament each year for the next five years on the progress being made implementing the recommendations of the royal commission.</p>
<p>He will also establish a national centre of excellence in partnership with states and territories to raise awareness and understanding of the impacts of child sexual abuse, and support the services being offered to victims.</p>
<p>Cheryl Edwardes, the chair of the reference group for the apology, a former Western Australian attorney general and the chair of the Independent Advisory Council on Redress, told Guardian Australia that Monday would be “a very important and emotional day for survivors, and for many of their families and friends”.</p>
<p>Edwardes met on Sunday with survivors as they arrived in Canberra for Monday’s event, and she said people were “very appreciative of the opportunity of being here to listen to the prime minister deliver the apology”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>She said the museum had emerged from the consultations around the country. “One of the key things was survivors wanted a memorial – a place to go and sit and reflect – and a place that will put these tragic circumstances in a place so they could never be forgotten, so that children would not be put in a position in the future where their accounts of abuse would not be believed.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edwardes said the reporting to parliament was high on the priority list of survivors.</p>
<p>The government has thus far accepted 104 of the 122 recommendations addressed to the commonwealth in the wake of the royal commission. A spokesman for the prime minister said the other 18 were being “closely examined, in consultation with states and territories”.</p>
<p>More than 80 of the recommendations of the royal commission related to a redress scheme for survivors, that all the states and territories have now signed on to along with the Catholic, Anglican and Uniting churches, although the scheme is not without criticism.</p>
<p><em>The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull pledged to deliver the national apology in June, and set the date for 22 October to coincide with national children’s week.</em></p>

            People need to watch the video of the apology. It is much much more than that. He mentioned ritual abuse.

            I don't keep up with the politics of Australia, but from the looks of this, it is a good thing.  Very little is done to lift up the Victims/Survivors of Sexual Abuse.  This will bring some attention to their cause as well.  We need more of this to combat all the normalization, denial of satanic ritual abuse and other crimes that many say do not exist.  Thank God I hope this brings some peace and closure for them.

               Yes. The Australian compensation scheme has many flaws, and it doesn't work yet, many survivors are desperate, but at least they had a Commission, a public apology (fwiw), and will have a museum. It's only a starting point, and a starting point with flaws, but most other countries are far, far away from that.

                Kind of a foot in the door.  It is good they are doing something, but it is always just never enough.  As if they are afraid too that they will be pummeled with backlash.

             I don't think so. Many survivors wanted to have a monument, and a place of remembrance, where they would be able to go, and where the crimes are documented.
            </p>
            <p>
             Survivors will also be able to influence the way the crimes are presented in the exhibition IIRC.

            Does anything think ScoMo would willingly help Trump close the sex trafficking rings?
           </p>
           <p>
            I just saw a promo from SBS about a new Dateline episode called
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sbsnews/videos/309909259827815/">
             "Evil in Paradise"
            </a>
            about child sex rings in the Dominican Republic. I was surprised because SBS is very left and I wonder if they're just trying to compete with Channel 7's Tonight investigation story about child sex rings in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Deep State is for sure at play right now in the Wentworth by-election - but are they trying to keep ScoMo out of power or in power?
