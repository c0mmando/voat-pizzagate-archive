<p>The article discussed how the foundation has mis-used and diverted funds intended for trafficking.  It also mentions:</p>
<p>&quot;John McCain\'s controversial sources of funding and the arrest of a number of past campaign workers on charges such as child abuse and drug trafficking.&quot;</p>
<p>Further breaks down the McCain Institute:</p>
<p>&quot;The McCain Institute for International Leadership is a think tank established in cooperation with Arizona State University. The primary focus of the foundation is combatting human trafficking and promoting a new generation of &quot;national security leaders.&quot; The McCain Institute has hosted a number of speaking events over the years, with speakers such as Joe Biden, Ben Affleck, Hillary and Bill Clinton, Governor Chris Christie, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe. Board members of the McCain Institute\'s Human Trafficking Advisory Council include Ashton Kutcher, co-founder of anti-human trafficking group, Thorn. The Institute\'s Board of Trustees includes Lynn Forester de Rothschild, former general David Petraeus and Joseph Lieberman. Factoring in board members, employees and interns, the McCain Institute has 80 employees assisting their operations in various capacities.&quot;</p>
<p>Then goes on to explain that the McCain Institute is not spending its endowment on human trafficking:</p>
<p>&quot;A review of the McCain Institute\'s filings with the IRS reveals that they are not, in fact, spending any of their endowment on combatting human trafficking, or apparently on any other expenses. In 2012, the McCain Institute received $8,685,619 in donations, gifts and grants. Yet their expenses were a mere $500,000. In 2013 they again, only contributed $500,000 of their endowment. In 2014, the McCain Institute received $1,305,000 and donated $1,500,000. All of the donations made by the McCain Institute in 2012, 2013 and 2014 went to the Arizona State University Foundation, a group which appears to have nothing to do with human trafficking. Why McCain is not spending his foundation\'s endowment on anything, let alone anti-human trafficking efforts, raises questions about where the cash is actually going and what it is being used for.&quot;</p>

            How much time is Trump going to get to drain the swamp before someone takes it upon themselves to perform some vigilante justice? I don't understand how McCain, Hillary, Obama, and the rest of the swamp aren't being investigated and arrested. If the dominoes don't start falling soon, there are going to be a whole lot of very angry people.

            I posted this article about the McCain's Institute annual private meeting. This secret meeting is a bilderberg type event, with some of the worlds wealthiest and powerful people in attendance at a remote area in Sedona. Its called the Sedona Forum. Rothschilds, Clinton, Tony Blair, Ambassador of Saudi, Iraq and many others, Bush's ambassador at large who oversaw his human trafficking division Mark Lagon, minions working for george soros, lots of cfr members and a trilateral commission member with ties to podesta. Possible pedo Senator Flake, pedo enabler and friend of dennis hastert...sen Ben Sasse, Thorn, NCMEC and so many others. This may very well be the new bilderberg.

            I will say this though.  The knowledge that I have gained in the last 8 months specifically has given me the ability to understand
            <em>
             why
            </em>
            the world is the way it is.  Why things are ugly and people can't get along and 9/11 happens and people are ugly to each other.  I finally feel as though I understand the world, and in that understanding I am no longer fearful of the future.  Either things will clear up, or I will continue my life with this new found understanding of my surroundings.

            Well I don't see a reward coming in the near future.  And if it is, it'll be the people who were in the public eye about it.  Assange, Dotcom, HoneyBee, Pizzagate Angela, VL, I think they may get recognized for that.  The little people won't be.

            I believe there are many good people willing to do just that.  I wonder if there will be monetary sentences and fines when they are charged and found guilty.  That is something we should demand.

            Well, if we do not get any notoriety or money, we can feel the warm glow from helping and freeing our children.  I spend anywhere from 6 to 10 hrs. a day now for 3 months.  Was a lurker for sometime now a researcher too.  Thanks for what you have done.

            Probably right.  The CIA (Pappy Bush) had a hand in JFK killing.  Probably Bobby &amp; MLK as well.  This has to end this time.

            Interesting timing how McCains "Foundation" all of a sudden trotted out Kutchner as proof of his good works in child trafficking as people were zeroing in on him.  Feeling pressured McCain?  Starting to sweat?  What's in YOUR closet John?

              tsk tsk tsk.  One begins to think most foundations are nothing more than fronts for something.  Interestingly enough, Kutchner played the part of a child who underwent traumatic childhood experiences, including being forced into child pornography, and had memory loss/blackouts/PTSD.  (Butterfly Effect movie).  Typical MK Ultra mind control programming.  Quite often you find the child actors who are mind controlled have played in films about this kind of stuff.  I've been looking at this stuff for over 11 yrs now...the patterns are easily discernable after awhile.

              How McCain keeps getting elected is a mystery.  Arizona needs a thorough vote fraud check.  And this info needs to be disseminated widely.

               That was a very interesting movie indeed. Really liked it back then, will have to watch again with current knowledge (as so many others)
              </p>
              <p>
               It did have a clear DID aspect now that you mention, even if the child abuse was mild and rather lame. Probably for studio audiences but the real gravitas escaped me because of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the gist is very, very close to what we are talking about here.

               It's almost like these people gain a creative edge by exploiting their (sick, twisted, cruel) experiences during early childhood.

                I haven't watched a movie the same since I started researching all this stuff a decade ago (mk ultra, satanism, pedophilia, etc.),  Now instead of mindless download of data pushing their agenda, my brain is busy watching for the symbolism/innuendo and their blatant agenda pushing.  Makes the movie even more interesting to watch actually.

                He keeps getting elected because of the stupid 2 party system. If you are are a Republican you have to vote for mccain (AKA treacherous cunt) or you voat for the opposition democrat.

                 We need a real conservative to challenge him next election.  Unfortunately he was just recently re-elected I think.  Better to hope he gets convicted of something soon!

              That does not look like Kerry in some recent photos.  Body double perhaps?  Botched botox?  Horrible plastic surgery?
