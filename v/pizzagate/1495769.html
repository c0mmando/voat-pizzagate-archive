<p>Two photos of Syrian children in a CAGE, dressed in orange jumpsuits.  Credits indicate they were taken in Douma, Syria in February 2015.<br />
Here are the two photos (the fire designation was simply to differentiate between the two photos and no significance is intended.)</p>
<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/qz2z4kfw7/">https://postimg.org/image/qz2z4kfw7/</a> (without fire)</p>
<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/6xkg07lrb/">https://postimg.org/image/6xkg07lrb/</a> (with fire)</p>
<p><strong>I’m sure these photos will get scru66ed pretty quickly from G3tty1mages so get your own scr33nshots if you want to save these photos.  These will be great meme backgrounds!</strong></p>
<p>You have seen the photos; I am going to give you my interpretative breakdown of the two-sentence caption below these photos. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Syrian children wearing orange jumpsuits stand inside a cage on February 15, 2015 placed near the debris of a building destroyed in bombardment by Syrian government forces on the rebel-held Damascus subrb of Douma, during a protest to denounce the continuing killing of civilians in the Syrian conflict and the failure of the international community to stop the carnage.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whew!  What a long run-on sentence!  Let’s break it down: 
We know they are Syrian children in a cage. [ They are NOT refugees in a foreign land in a refugee camp.]</p>
<p>The cage was “placed” near the debris of a building.   <em>[And notice the word “placed” in reference to the cage location.  That means somebody (either the government or the rebels) put it there specifically for a reason.]</em></p>
<p>This nearby building was destroyed in a bombing by Syrian government forces. <em>[Who is shooting at who?</em>]
There was a protest going on. 
The protest was to denounce the continuing killing of civilians in the Syrian conflict. 
The protest was also apparently to blame the international community for failing to stop the carnage.</p>
<p><em>[Is there any other photographic evidence of this protest with further information about the subject of the protest?]</em></p>
<p>Next sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“During the protest organised by Syrian activists, the children were immitating Jordanian air force pilot Maaz al-Kassasbeh, who was reportedly burned alive by jhdists from the IsIamic State (IS) group, an act that was condemned by MuIsim and Western leaders. AFP PHOTO / ABD DOUMANY (Photo credit should read ABD DOUMANY/AFP/G3tty Images)”&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, the Syrian activists organized the protest.  <em>[Who are the Syrian activists?</em>]</p>
<p>The children were imitating some airforce pilot<em>. [by setting themselves on fire, perhaps? Wtf does this even mean? Were they flying around like airplanes with their arms extended and wouldn’t sit down for lessontime?]</em></p>
<p>This airport pilot was reportedly burned alive. <em>[reportedly? Burned alive?]</em>
The J-IS group burned the airforce pilot.  &gt;[Why did the group burn the airforce pilot?]</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The act was condemned by leaders. <em>[What leaders? What act?]</em></p>
<p>There is NO reason given for these children to be locked up in a cage. and this caption said nothing about nothing.</p>
<p>Focusing on the Photographs:</p>
<p>What is the significance of the taller children with headbands and different colored clothing?  Are they handlers? Do you see the small child in the bottom right hand corner?  Please, researchers, grab these photos now and look closely.  Save your copy before the pics are gone.  
</p>
<p>Do the photos hold any clues?  For example: 
How is the cage moved? Is there some sort of machinery that moves it? Can you see anything else in the picture that would support the suspicion that kids are transported in this cage? Where else is this type of cage used? What industries? How would the cage fit into other knowledge?</p>
<p>What is the demeanor of the children?  Do they appear bored, scared, happy, resigned?  
</p>
<p>Some are holding signs. What do the signs say? Can someone zoom/interpret? 
Why are all these children dressed in orange jumpsuits? And why the fuck are they in a cage??  Are the kids the subject of the protest?  Are civilians being killed by their own gov3rnment forces, to create more orphans?  Were the protesters asking for society’s help in this heinous human trafficking problem in Douma, Syria? </p>
<p>(Just a reminder that this is a photo of Real KIDS in CAGES! It should PlSS you off!) So please someone make a record of them. G3tty8itch doesn’t archive well for me, but I’m a novice voater. apologies for crappy formatting.</p>',

            The jordanian pilot that was captured was burned alive in a cage while wearing an orange jumpsuit. NFSW/NSFL -

            Some say it is fake though. Pretty impressive production values compared to execution videos of years past.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think pretty much all the ISIS execution videos I have watched were with the victim wearing bright orange jumpsuit. Many of them were in cages too, like the people they drown.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think they use frontloaders to move the cages.
