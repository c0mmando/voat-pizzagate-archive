            You are correct, but why are you so upset about the idiots, kids and shills here? They will change nothing.
If Trump and his people are determined to take it down, they will do so.
Don't waste energy on idiots.

            This is complicated keep in mind that laws need to be rewritten, with stronger penalties which means congress needs to included...The Supreme Court needs to be in place, the CIA and FBI need to clean house. Not to mention DOJ. This is a huge ring that is everywhere. For those of you that think low level offenders don't matter, you have no idea what you are talking about. They are all-interconnected and work together. They Protect each other.

            Looking at pizzagate in the broadest possible way, I feel the first effect of it is to get people to understand how evil our society is.  The second effect is for people to see how they are personally complicit in it.  That comment may shock some, but our very willingness to hand over our necessary tasks, that we should be doing ourselves, to others, to agencies and government, makes us complicit.  If we were responsible about having children, there would be no orphans to take advantage of.  If we took more active roles in government, there would be fewer wars that create the devastation and opportunities for trafficking.  If we raised our children ourselves, they would not be in schools and daycares that take advantage of them every which way.
           </p>
           <p>
            And so, waiting for 'justice' is a part of that mindset of putting our responsibility in the hands of some authority and expecting them to do our job.  But our job is to wake up and take up our responsibilities.

            I think the main problem with the push back you seem to be getting is your kind of obnoxious to be honest.   And the whole let me gather up my three comments on another post and make a whole different post is kind of a grandstanding.  What you think doesnt deserve a its own thread.  Try doing some research and linking to an article or something of value instead of just spouting off.

            I have complete faith in Trump, and it's not even worth discussing what will happen if he's not on our side. I'll tell you why, because if Trump isn't a true patriot like we think he is and is just a stooge, then it's game over. If that is the case, pizzagate and anything else doesn't matter anymore because we're screwed. The only thing to do then is to start loading your guns because the only option left is a civil war to take the country back.

            If they start at the bottom doesnt that just buy the elites time to scrub more shit out and buy them time to save thier ass? with how much has come out about clintons and others i think he should have gone straight after everyone we found to be involved in pizzagate already. we didnt start a subverse based on the bottom of the totem pole did we? it all came out about powerful players. so why isnt he going straigh after them? makes no sense to take out the bottom to get to the top to me, honestly. I'm slowly starting to think its all just to make it seem like shit is being done when it isn't in reality. but time will tell. I want to be wrong so bad.

            This post could have been inteligent instead it is simply a frustrated tantrum with name calling. Sucks to be you because I don't agree with anything you are blathering about, but since you chose to carry on in this manner, I won't converse further. Get your act together or you ill be ignored by all for your obnoxious, "you must all be stupidly ignorant" nonsense. That simplistic trolling has no value in this forum. Downvote.

            This. Trump is aware of pizzgate and Soros and other potential financers meddling in the US. All the pieces are falling into place, but the admin has a lot on it's plate, meanwhile, forces are resisting with every fiber of their being. Unfortunately, we have no timetable for all this mess to go down, but the element of surprise is on his side. Additionally, we saw him sign an EO going after cartels and sex traffickers on National Pizza Day ( the media didn't celebrate with us at all if you noticed). To be honest, I think if he wants to go after the top dogs the 650K HRC emails need to be released and it doesn't even have to look like DT is on a witch hunt either.

            OP, I see what you are saying and don't disagree....
           </p>
           <p>
            ...but we have NEVER seen anything like this before. These pedos have always existed, but in this day of the internet, things are different. I know the internet is not new, but this level of collaboration and communication via sites like Reddit/pol/Voat and YouTube is changing the game by the day.
           </p>
           <p>
            And now we have elected a president that EVERYONE seems to hate. The enemy of my enemy is my friend..? Whether DJT is the real deal or not, only time will tell...but I totally understand people's frustration.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could this all happen fast, in a blinding fury of arrests and indictments..? It's possible. Keep in mind, Bannon is currently a top and trusted advisor to Trump. The same guy who took the helm from his peer, Breitbart, back in 2012 when he "died of a heart attack" and his coroner suicides shortly thereafter. He's obviously as red-pilled as they come. They've likely been building a case for months, of not years. The Weiner emails are the smoking gun and they've had months to process them and prepare.
           </p>
           <p>
            That all said, the silence of those in power positions tells me that there is something in the works. They're probably being careful not to tip their hand. The odd behavior of people like Ben Swann and Milo Y is also very intriguing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand both trains of thought. Let's just remain patient and stay diligent. We are slowly winning the war of information...

             yup. And Alex Jones, to that list. These folks have been assured serious action will happen, please dont screw it up for us by being too vocal. There may also be a concern of too much prior publicity lending the podestas legal team the old 'we cant find a jury who isnt biased' defence

            Likely it would be a dumb move to go straight for the Pedo elite and organ trafficers. He needs to get all the ducks in a row, build up acceptance and intel by doing peripheral busts, and wait till the Libtards have got over the shock of losing. Otherwise he risks too much, including being accused of using the law to attack opponents.

            I have a wait and see attitude.  He might have realized he needs the supreme court to proceed.  Look what just happened with his ban of immigrants from war zone countries.  Courts actually ruled that non citizen immigrant wannabes are protected by the US citizen's bill of rights.  Probably why Trump just announced he's gonna redraft the order.  A 4/4 Supreme Court wouldn't overturn anything.  and the WHOLE effin Govt is compromised.  I'm not fully convinced he is a good guy, but he might be.  I really don't like most of the snakes he's surrounded himself with.  But maybe he needs snakes to go into the swamp, i dunno.  I'm gonna let him get his judge approved and watch every move with a microscope.  If nothing happens in a few months it's gonna start looking like only the peasants with their pitchforks and clubs are gonna be able to drain the swamp.

            Same with when President Trump didn't comment on whether or not he would arrest HRC. I mean, when he said during the debate "you'd be in jail" people were making Hitler comparisons, saying all this ridiculous stuff. If he were to say he would... just imagine what would happen. This doesn't happen overnight. Yes, we've go to keep on pressing.. but high level arrests don't just happen.

            People need to just compile all the evidence and send it to the FBI or appropriate law enforcement agency. And wait. If Nobody and I mean Nobody on the list is picked up in a year, then you go wide with the data. If some have been, but only a few, then contact the local law enforcement for each case and provide the info. I've submitted over a dozen. If on Valentine's day 2018, there are zero arrests off of my list, you will find a link in every post of mine to a website detailing everything I found. Until then we sit tight.

            You sure as shit should not be expecting anything in the first 6 months, let alone the first 6 weeks. You are absolutely right. This will be a long, slow process. Anyone who is stomping their feet and yelling about how nothing is happening and how Hillary and her crew of Pasta Pedos hasn't been arrested yet is either ignorant or has an agenda. Their actions are just serving to demoralize those looking into it, whether that is their intent or not. Not me specifically, but the less experienced who don't know how the justice system works.

             I agree that it's a long process.  However, I expect at least Alefantis or one of his friends to be arrested soon- soonish.  Hillary Clinton may never be charged with anything.  I really don't think Trump will go after her.  I know that infuriates people but it's my opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
             With that being said, I don't think it's very nice to curse out everyone that is disappointed.  Many thought they were getting things together before sessions was sworn in so that arrests could be made once he was sworn in.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, they have the emails and huma and wiener's computer and they have had that for a good while, so it's reasonable to assume that arrests could be made sooner rather than later.
            </p>
            <p>
             Furthermore, we had seaman tweeting like a crazy person that household names were going down.  I know, I know - it's Seaman- he's a reporter, Not law enforcement.  BUT in situations such as these, human nature is very powerful.  People put their faith in him in an effort to replace the negative emotions experienced with feelings of hope.  Pizzagate brings to the surface some ugly evil stuff, so for months our emotions have been responding to the ugliness and evil.  Naturally some may have hung their hats on seaman in an effort to surrender the negative emotions.  This stuff can be taxing and many needed to rest from it and believe seaman.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, trials are long.  Yes.  Most know this.  But the time leading up to an arrest isn't long.  They don't have to prove guilt in order to make arrests.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the trump administration wants to throw us a good bone to appease us, they should arrest podesta or Alefantis.

              I say go for the head of the snake.  Look at Iraq.  We "win a war" [election] topple the dictator [Saddam/Hillary] round up the henchmen [Podesta, Weiner, Alephantis, etc]  Drag them through the courts - their lives are ruined.

             I said it in another comment I made in this post:  To kill a snake this big, you start by pinning it's tail to the ground. Stop it's freedom of movement. That makes you better able to start moving towards it's head. After you pin it's tail to the ground...best case scenario, you watch as it wraps it's own body around itself. Think about how many of these low level people are spilling on their masters, and then it just goes on up the line. Good agents in the government have probably just been sitting there waiting for someone like Trump to just let them do their damn jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the slowness...if Trump just starts arresting the Clintons tomorrow....I mean...do you expect people not following pizzagate to understand why? We need to collect damning evidence and make it public to the point "the public" is demanding their arrests.  Otherwise "the average person" screams, "Trump is literally Hitler!!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact, maybe that's what these "Trump is moving so slow" posts are trying to get us to pressure him to do...It makes me wonder.

              Instead of trying to wake people up with the most horrific of crimes, child rape, I think we should be using more of a scatter shot approach and waking them up with the blast pattern and Federal Agent casualties from OKC; with the WTC bombing where they swapped a dummy bomb for a live one; with the USS Liberty attack and stand-down order by President Johnson; with all the little things that lead all of us down the rabbit hole. Don't drop 911 or Pizzagate as your initial redpill. It forces normies to shut down their brains out of shock.

              We have nothing but time right now, might as well ease people in so when it does hit the news, they are already thinking for themselves instead of having CNN think for them.

            Many armchair prosecutors who are unaware of the full complexity of the situation are pissed because Sessions and Trump aren't working according to a timetable set by some anonymous guy on 4chan possibly from the FBI that nobody here has ever met personally.

            Back in the real world, I bet child rapists like Pedosta, I-Love-Infants, Chucky-Cheese Schlonger, Slick Willie Clinton and many others need a diaper change with every new report of pedos being arrested.

            I don't think anyone here has experience in bringing down a global pedo ring, do you? Its not fruitful to be asserting that other people here are ignorant, stupid or idiots.  They are asking legitimate questions, no need to get angry about them. I voted for Trump, and hope he does prosecute the people involved in the pedo rings. But we will wait and see.

             Oh dear god...just reply to the substance of my argument or not at all....If none of us are experienced in taking down a global pedo ring, and if that means we can't offer anything important, then what's the freaking point of this place? Don't get pissed off just because I'm trying to bring some common sense back into this place. Trump is doing exactly what he should be doing to eventually go after the head of the snake. Pin it's tail first...then work your way up to the head. What pisses me off isn't that people disagree with me...What pissed me off is that they're attacking the very man doing what they want, because they don't understand he's doing what they want. And if they're doing that...they're a detriment to their own cause and they don't even know it.

              One issue I take with your argument is the assertion that you start with low-level pedos and work your way up the chain.
             </p>
             <p>
              Is it possible that there are simply parallel universes of pedos, for lack of a better analogy?
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not convinced your garden-variety pervert/pedophile getting busted will open any doors to the inner sanctum of the elite DC/Hollywood kid-fucking child-murderers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Could there be a link somewhere..? Yeah, possibly. But to assume that low-level CP guys suddenly snitch on _______ (insert DC/Hollywood perv here) is a real stretch.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sickos are sickos. The high-level ones have their own circles that are well-protected and I doubt there is much crossover with the blue-collar pedos.
             </p>
             <p>
              I could be wrong...but I'm just pointing this out because I see this as a crack in your logic...

               I kind of agree - I support the thrust of this thread, but I wonder at the wisdom of 'pinning the snakes tail' first.
Appreciating the time court cases take, but when you catch a snake you grab it by the back of the head.
Slowly working your way up the chain, if that's the plan, gives the snake time to wriggle, worm and maybe bite back.

               Trump may well be assassinated before he gets up to the head. I think his first act is to arrest a high profile republican, let that sink in to the public's mind for a week, then arrest podesta etc

              Maybe you can help me figure this out. Hillary email archive 2001 is showing this in Wikileaks. I keep finding it in 2001. Don't know why it is dated 2001, typo or trying to hide: EVIDENCE -- IN THE RECENT CABLES AT LEAST --- THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO DECEIVE THE PUBLIC OR ITSELF.

              You are the only one being pissed on here. You are not brining common sense to this place with your ranting and raving. Until recently, Trump was a Hillary supporter. He hung out with Epstein.  There are claims he had sex with under age girls.  He also is a person the constantly flip flops on positions. You may have a statue of him in you living room, but please appreciate that some of us are more circumspect. I hope and pray he does something, but will not be surprised if nothing happens.

              many are wondering if trafficking rings like the ones busted over the past week are busted all of the time, but the busts go unnoticed because the general population doesn't notice because we aren't normally so tuned into the news of trafficking arrests.

              I'm not saying I think this.  I'm saying it's a valid scenario to ponder

               The rules themselves are fine with me, how they're being enforced is a separate issue. Over time you get to see how "shills" (for lack of a better word) use places like voat/reddit.  When you understand how they use it, the rules we have make sense to me. Making this place a text post only place requires a focus on substance instead of style. Many of the sites/videos people link to here are from people who are doing this with no experience after they get home from a 40 hr per week job. Their style may not be the best, but that doesn't mean their substance should be ignored, and that's why we have many of the rules we have.

            For a campaign that ran on convicting Hillary Clinton and promised to prosecute it certainly seems like it's not going to happen and trump supporters have a right to be mad.

             Why does it seem like it's not going to happen?  It's not even been a month, and they're arresting all the low level people. As I said, that that's how you start taking them down. As I said, this is exactly how you'd expect them to proceed if they were planning on taking them down.

              At the very least, there needs to be a public announcement that there is an investigation.  The people involved know it anyway so it's not like it will spook them.  Otherwise, Trump &amp; Sessions may have an unfortunate plane crash or golfing accident and it could be decades or centuries before there's another opportunity to take down these elite rings.

               hello,  agree with the original poster, they are starting at the bottom first (at least that sounds fair to me) Just ponder on the fact I do not think anyone has saw John Podesta since late Dec. and the story about Hillary Clinton being turned around at the airport seems true (I have heard it from a few sources). So starting with the tail while the head panics- yep! It seems to be going logically to me.

            I don't see why asking legitimate questions is met with such hostility in this /v/. If someone asks something just answer them if you know the answer. It makes the case you're trying to make look that much better. When people get mad and start freaking out over someone doubting something or asking questions it makes me really suspicious. If you're confident in your claim and evidence just answer them with the evidence and let it speak for itself.

             I am answering, literally...I'm answering, but I just happen to disagree. And that post wasn't used to "ask a question" it was used, overall, to make a point. A point I disagree with, which I'm letting me known.

              I'm not talking about you specifically btw. Just in general with my experiences on this /v/ anytime I ask a question or show doubt in anything at all.

               I would rather you just respond to the substance of my post and actually say anything about the points I brought up.  Complaining about your general opinion of this /v/ has nothing to do with the points I brought up in my post.
