She said she was sold from the age of three onwards, as this was a way for her father to make money.  The abuse was taped and then sold for profit.  She would be taken to someone\'s house, stripped naked and put into a room, while her parents took money from other adults. They would then form a circle around her, pass around a cup of blood, and then each person would take it in turns to abuse her in whatever way they wanted.  Included was chanting and swaying.  Jeanette\'s mother would then mop her up in a towel, dress her and take her home. </p>
<p>The only sacrifices she saw were of babies and children. Her grandfather ran a farm where all the sacrificing took place.  From the ages of three to nine she witnessed multiple murders of babies and children by her grandfather and other seniors in the cult.  The baby would be laid out on a concrete slab. First they cut across the throat, and then cut the torso. They would also cut off limbs and cut the tongues before the murder.  Children were often put on meat hooks in the barn and the blood collected in buckets beneath the children.  She would be hung over a mass grave, threatened she would end up there if she ever spoke of the abuse.</p>
<p>Children were either cult kids used for torture and rituals or abducted children. Care homes would load children into minibuses arriving at the farm.  Babies would be thrown into the ground. Sometimes they would be taken out of the pit and burned.  Bigger bodies were taken to the forest to be buried.</p>',
