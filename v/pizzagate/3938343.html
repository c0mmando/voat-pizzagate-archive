She said she was sold from the age of three onwards, as this was a way for her father to make money.  The abuse was taped and then sold for profit.

They would then form a circle around her, pass around a cup of blood, and then each person would take it in turns to abuse her in whatever way they wanted.  Included was chanting and swaying.

<p>The only sacrifices she saw were of babies and children. Her grandfather ran a farm where all the sacrificing took place.  From the ages of three to nine she witnessed multiple murders of babies and children by her grandfather and other seniors in the cult.  The baby would be laid out on a concrete slab. First they cut across the throat, and then cut the torso. They would also cut off limbs and cut the tongues before the murder.  Children were often put on meat hooks in the barn and the blood collected in buckets beneath the children.
