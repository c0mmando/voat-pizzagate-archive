After reading about Never Trumper Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska squealing about rebuilding civic trust and health in the wake of Trump\'s tweets about Obama covert activities to undermine the election, <a href="http://archive.is/z4Ctj">http://archive.is/z4Ctj</a> , I searched to see if Ben had a history of places connections to pedophilia.

&quot;Fortunately for Sasse, House ethics investigations are steeped in secrecy with no transparency so if he did cover up the abuse, which many reliable sources allege he did, he got away with it.&quot;
Is anyone doubts that that pedophilia and pornography is just business as usual for too many of our elected officials, consider this: <a href="http://archive.is/xOHDl">http://archive.is/xOHDl</a>  
</p>
<p>&quot;...that’s not the end of Ben’s association to pedophilia. He always seems to be one degree of separation away from pedophilia in the where he’s worked. ..In yet another brush with pederasty and pedophilia, the one-time chief of cybersecurity for the Department of Health and Human Services, Timothy DeFoggi, was convicted for “engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography, and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography in connection with his membership in a child pornography website.” Sasse’s overview of the HHS programs overlapped for a year while DeFoggi’s surfed the web for kiddy porn.&quot;
But that is not all: &quot;Ryan Loskarn, the chief of staff for Senator Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee, was arrested at his Capitol Hill home for possession and distribution of child pornography. Sasse was the chief of staff for Nebraska GOP U.S. Representative Jeff Fortenberry when Loskarn also worked in the House.&quot;</p>

...NBC News 4 in Washington, D.C., identified over 100 “egregious” cases during the past five years where federal employees watched porn for hours during the day or required an inspector general investigation into their porn habits at work.

            It's not plausible as a joke that a government employee was paid a six-figure salary to wank to child porn -- in the office -- for half of each work day.  But in reality, that shit actually happened, and not just a little.

            Ben Sasse also worked for Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, who was also a convicted serial child rapist. This article shows how ben sasse was suspected as being an enabler to child rape.

            Ben Sasse was also a guest along with Jeff Flake, rothschilds, soros minions, clinton, and many other powerful people in a new private meeting we seem to have just uncovered. Its almost like we found a new bilderberg group hosted by John McCains, McCain Institute. Its called the Sedona Forum. Here is my post on it. If you can help dig that would be awesome!

            There was a post today on the Sedona Foundation.  It is run by McCain. I believe  Ben Sasse was on the list of participants.  Enough Said.
