<h1>Paris Jackson &amp; Seth Green Alleged Victims of Actor Threatening Shootout with Cops</h1>
<p>An actor who allegedly choked Paris Jackson and accused Seth Green of pedophilia is now the focus of a police investigation, on the heels of threatening a shootout with cops  ... TMZ has learned. </p>
<p>Additionally, we\'re told he allegedly grabbed Paris by the throat about a month ago during a game night party. </p>
<p>The final straw for police was a threatening tweet he posted last Wednesday. Kappy said, &quot;In light of the interesting traffic happening around my house I want to make something CRYSTAL CLEAR: while I am a VERY strong advocate of peaceful disclosure, make no mistake, assets are in place and if you kill me or even try, it will rain .50 cals in the Hollywood Hills.&quot;</p>
<p>We\'re told the threat of a .50 caliber bullet shootout was enough for LAPD to open the case.</p>

             I think they'd first have to say something tangible .... prove they knew something. Alleging SS is  a pedo is pretty much the same thing the pizzagate community is alleging, but there is NO PROOF. There is not  scintilla of proof ... only connections, conjecture, weird photos, instances of him being in the right place at the right time. So I don't think anything would happen if they were a nutjob offering no proof. It's too easy to send the guy to prison for making false statements.

              There have been people trying to call out the Hollywood perverts for years like: Elijah Wood, Corey Feldman, Corey Haim.  Mel Gibson tried.  Their alleged Satanic cult appears so tight that it’s been inpenetrable. - but it’s starting.  I watch some like Reiner (who Travolta once sued for sexual harassment) and DeNiro (arrested 1998 for pedophilia in France) and a few more of these unhinged mouths plus the dang Podesta art collection and emails and the crazy FAR LEFT Democrats STRONG connection to the vile folks of Hollywood and the music industry and anymore - I’m believing me some Kappy.

            Agent provocateur. Send someone in with zero credibility, and make all these crazy claims, and then have him implode that makes everyone forget about the real stuff that is happening. now anyone that tries to root out pedo in Hollywood will be lumped in with this lying POS.

             This needs to be the top comment. I don't understand why people on forums like this keep falling for the same scams. Leave that stuff for normies/sheeple.  By now, one needs to have developed a 'nose' for psyops.

              I feel I must address this: Regarding the Paris accusations. I reached out to her privately yesterday and told her I didn't want her to be involved in this situation. This is a textbook case of character assassination. That being said, there is A LOT more to the story...

              He could have Paris Jackson’s private info how do you know he doesn’t? I think of her father Michael and how he was destroyed for being a pedophile. Since I have read he was trying to protect the children from all the other pedophiles. So in that regard, if this is what Isaac Kappy is doing, then its potentially reasonable that he would be in communication with Paris Jackson . Again how do we know? We don’t. But it’s just as plausible and reasonable as not.

              The whole story about Seth Green was beyond retarded as well. Why would Seth offer up a house and a car (or whatever the claim was- it was a lot of $$$) just to get this clown into pedo shit? What does he bring to the table they don't already have with producers, directors etc.? He is a nobody and would be a complete liability for them.

               The only thing that came out was that they were friends. Which is probably why this idiot got involved in something like this. They're laughing at us behind the screen and now they have another nutso that threatened people and made unfounded accusations. It did out Crokin as being an absolute loser. I can go on Twitter and RT interesting tweets having to do with pizzagate. I mean, come on! Other than defending her friends in PedoWood, I see nothing that she's brought to the table, and she's done harm. Getting aboard the Kappy Train was just stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
              </p>
              <p>
               Oh, and I did want to emphasize what the tweet in the OP said. It mentions that Kappy surfaced after Sarah Silverman was responding to a Renegade post. It was something like him not being that anonymous, and KAPOW! Kappy emerges!  Sarah Silverman is the scummiest of the scum. You can bet there's a connection there.

            Approximately 14 minutes in.  Kappy looks more grounded in this than I’ve seen him look or sound before. I’ve chocked that up to him VERY LIKELY being probably scared out of his mind - that it took a ton of adrenaline (adrenochrome) for him to come out on this.  For what purpose? Even reading that letter he wrote to Seth and his wife Clare shows me that he cared about their friendship but he absolutely have abhores what Hellyweird allegedly hides in their underbelky.

            I am personally going to wait on pronouncing Kappy a crazy lying n’erdowell OR the gutsy (albeit crazy) voice crying out in the Hellywierd wilderness. When I saw him on Alex Jones today I thought he looked relatively grounded. (Note: First time ever I’ve watched an entire Alex Jones show. He appeared much crazier than Isaac Kappy did. Very rude man.). I couldn’t say that about Kappy before (he earlier seemed wired on meth or? Whatever hiding his giant pupils behind sunglasses) but I gave him the benefit thinking this man has got to be scared out of his mind. Now I’m tending to think that big bucks are being spent to shut him up and make him appear as though he’s crazy. I’m going to wait and see.

              What part of not following you blindly but choosing to wait, observe, assess., and make up my own mind bothers you?  Soros does not pay people for thinking on our own.  He does however pay lots of people to create chaos and doubt —— including writing inflammatory things on forums.  Not saying that’s what you did but your immediate attack of me for not wholeheartedly agreeing with you feels very ...... ready?  ....... crazy far left.
