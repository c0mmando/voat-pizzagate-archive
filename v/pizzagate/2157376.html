            So Stone should flip to his dinners with satanist Marina Abramović .  Ask if he's running low on blood, urine, and semen for his late night snacks.  Maybe she does takeout orders on her spirit cooking.  Podesta's emails didn't get that specific.

            I think Alex had bad timing and a lawsuit, but honestly if he hadn't had said what he did, I don't Besta would've gotten the attention it deserves. Plus I think he has made up for in many ways, he has a hive mind thats full of brilliance.

            Not a single reply to your post made any sense... aside from the vegan joke (lol) so, we're either dealing with people that are too dense to understand the topic or they are intentionally misdirecting.

            brings up a good point, while not direct, Podesta just acknowledged a link between the Comet emails and his own leak. The Alex Jones apology had nothing to do w/ Skippy, yet here he is using it to cover his own tracks.

             What are the Comet emails?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also the Alex Jones apology does seem to have to do with Podesta.
            </p>
            <p>
             First thing to note, is that Jones could have contested this.  If what he was saying was true, he would face no damages.  But since what he said was false, under Texas Law Jones had 30 days (from the time Alefantis's lawyer send his letter) to issue a public retraction or he would face punitive damages. So he has several things to address about Alefantis or he would have to pay him millions of dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
             He makes a specific apology to Alefantis and his statement is tailored by his lawyer to address Alefantis's concerns or else he would owe punitive damages. But even still he also makes it clear that he has taken down pizzagate stories that don't even mention Alefantis.  Specifically he walks away from the claim that Podesta's emails had code words.

             <p>
              Last fall before the Presidential election, a large number of media outlets began reporting on allegations arising from emails released by Wikileaks that appeared to come from John Podesta, who served Presidents Clinton and Obama and was the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
              <strong>
               Dozens of those stories and articles raised or discussed theories that some of Podesta’s emails contained code words for human trafficking and/or pedophilia.
              </strong>
              Stories also included allegations connecting members of the Democratic Party with a number of restaurants involved with a child sex ring. These stories were cited and discussed in social media and went viral on the Internet.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             The volume of stories was substantial, generated national headlines and came to be known across the country as “Pizzagate.” We at Infowars became a part of that discussion.
             <strong>
              We broadcast commentary about the allegations and the theory that the emails contained code words.
             </strong>
             We raised questions about information in Mr. Podesta’s emails and the Comet Ping Pong restaurant. We believed at that time that further investigation was necessary.
             <strong>
              In December 2016 we disassociated ourselves from the “Pizzagate” claims and theories
             </strong>
             , a position we reiterated last month after being contacted by Mr. Alefantis.
            </p>
            <p>
             ....
Here’s what we have done to clarify to the public. Months ago we took down the majority of broadcasts/videos including ones that only mentioned Pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             ....But the Pizzagate narrative, as least as concerning Mr. Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong, we have subsequently determined was based upon what we now believe was an incorrect narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
             He had tried to make a half assed non-apology earlier that month, one I'm sure his lawyer told him wouldn't be sufficient

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              February 24, after receiving Alefantis' letter, Jones posted a rambling, nearly an hour long video to Infowars in which he offered a tepid retraction for his coverage. He asserted that he had little to do with the dissemination of the conspiracy theory, which he suggested was promoted by the mainstream media as a diversion.
"I kind of picked up when the Washington Post, New York Times, all them said -- when I wasn't even covering it -- everybody says a pizza place is doing this to kids. And I was like, we never covered it," he said. "A pizza place? And I went, whoa, they're in the news diverting us from all this other big stuff."
......
Jones eventually got to the retraction, acknowledging a basic fact that proves Pizzagate false. The conspiracy theory has held that the supposed sex ring was run out Comet's basement, when in actuality the restaurant doesn't even have one.
"Yes, I retract that about Ping Pong pizza. There's not a damn basement. I don't think Alefantis is a pedophile. I've already said all that," Jones said. "But it's not an apology. I'm covering this giant thing going on because of the Podestas and the stuff they're involved in."

             <p>
              The collection of emails that show private event invitations and make mention of political events/fundraisers @ CPP. Also made reference to the "PizzaPAC" for donation collections. This led to the discovery of various questionable images, codewords, comments, art work, musicians, etc... as you already know.
             </p>
             <p>
              The apology issued by Infowars was semi-anticipated. Alex Jones repeatedly stated that he didn't want to cover this in the first place... and that it was a very dubious topic that needed substantial vetting/more evidence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Joe Biggs forced InfoWars into the limelight on PG from coverage of the "Pizza Menu" topic - which was an obviously fake document that was crafted with such laziness, the author forgot to even fold in codewords.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then the InfoWars audience forced Jones' hand into PG coverage. All of it was simply regurgitating what was already discovered by Reddit/Chan/Voat. There was no real effort on the part of IW/AJ to dive into any kind of primary research/interviews/acquisition of additional leaks.
             </p>
             <p>
              Knowing full well that it was purely circumstantial (and still is), why WOULDN'T he issue an apology as per the obvious advice of his lawyers? I doubt he could have compelled them to testify on the meanings behind the social media commentary, artwork, context of the musicians, promotional pieces, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lack of concrete proof = Apology and retractions... something our glorious media needn't worry about, no matter how erroneous their reporting/accusations are.
             </p>
             <p>
              The adherence of the "CPP doesn't have a basement" line is absurd. You know as well as we do that there's a hell of a lot more than whether or not a basement exists in a pizza shop. Besides, it was later discovered that this "basement" in question may have actually been Pegasus Museum - care of R.O. - who was subsequently threatened by JA for exposing this. And given JA's propensity to threaten legal actions against individuals who make false claims, I'm rather certain that "he could have contested this". But JA did not contest the threats, nor the fact that his threats were reported to the authorities.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for Podesta being looped into the apology itself? Just summarizing what was covered and mentioning Podesta's emails in a generic statement in advance of the apology to JA doesn't make the cut IMO.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you still believe that those strangely worded emails, the multitude of individuals that understood these strangely worded emails, and (more importantly) the frequency of them, mean absolutely nothing? That seems naive. If they are so easy to explain, why has no explanation ever been offered?

               Texas also recognizes Libel Per Se. Calling someone a pedophile is libel per se.

               For Libel Per Se, you don't have to proof any harm was done to you.  If the person said it and it is not true, they are liable for damages.  I read somewhere a defense for libel per se would be as simple as showing you have never been convicted of the crime they accused you of.  So all Alefantis would need to do to win his suit is show he was never convicted of child trafficking.

                The adherence of the "CPP doesn't have a basement" line is absurd. .....Besides, it was later discovered that this "basement" in question may have actually been Pegasus Museum - care of R.O. - who was subsequently threatened by JA ....

              <p>
               I think it's really funny how the Pizzagate community walked away from the basement thing once it was shown not to be CPP.  Then they acted like it was the media that came up with this line as opposed to PGers who spent many hours looking for a basement....It's at Pegasus!
              </p>
              <p>
               Threats?   R.O.?  Is this the pizzagate gear guy or someone else?  Because if anyone from this community had real evidence of Alefantis making threats.  They would get a real news story out of it.   In terms of suing people, probably makes sense to go after the big fish, media figures and companies hosting defamatory material.  Why pay a lawyer to go after some guy nobody's ever heard of and give his claim publicity?

               He said he rejected the theories.  The theories that are mentioned are: "theories that some of Podesta’s emails contained code words for human trafficking and/or pedophilia."   He specified mentions they disassociated themselves from the theory that Podesta's emails contained code words.

                Do you still believe that those strangely worded emails, the multitude of individuals that understood these strangely worded emails, and (more importantly) the frequency of them, mean absolutely nothing? That seems naive. If they are so easy to explain, why has no explanation ever been offered?

              <p>
               Of course.   There is absolutely no code used whatsoever in Podesta's emails.  As for the multitudes of individuals these emails were not read in a neutral manner.  Most everyone encountered these emails in context of politics.....one of the most powerful emotional activators of confirmation bias we know of.  Someone who believes Clinton or Podesta is the devil is going to try to put the worst spin possible on what they read.  These emails were pushed in a hotbed context of a group of conspiracy thinkers looking for "What can find to most damage Clinton."   I believe some of this original research was absolutely and clearly a hoax.  The list of code words is surely fraudulent.   Not add in Pedophilia.   A more emotional topic that politics. Add that to politics and it will be the rare person who responds completely rationally.  Now the next group of people to learn about these emails, learned after the first group went to work.   They read these emails in the context of something was discovered, a shocking scandal was uncovered.  That there is a known, existing list of codewords and these were used in Podesta's emails.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why was no explanation offered?  Do you believe that really would have changed things? You actually have to do work to make the emails look evil.  You have substitute in the list of fake code words for them to seem sinister.  Do you think explaining anything to folks using such motivated reasoning would believe you? Do you think it would have been a useful way to spend time as you're running campaign.
              </p>
              <p>
               My favorite example of the Hoax codes words is pasta with walnut sauce.   What does this mean to you?

               As for deceptions and hoaxes relying on emotions, read this story of a piece of fake news got 6 million views.  There's nothing in doubt in this case.  The author admits to completely making up his story using a fake photo.  6 million views.   This is confirmation bias and motivated reasoning in action.  People wanted to believe this was true.
