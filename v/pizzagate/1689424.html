<p>Original article is from 2008 but author has added updates.  Some 34 for MSM and
20 for Alt Media: &quot;Added to this in 2013 is an additional list of 20 tactics used by the alternative media, which, as it turns out, has been almost completely subverted by the superclass and intelligence services. In terms of reliability the alternative media is a thousand times worse than the mainstream. With the mainstream media a viewer, listener or reader primarily has to worry about the 1 percent that is not being reported or is being spun. With the alternative media, one has to worry about the 99 percent that it does report, because that\'s the amount of nonsense and spin going around.&quot; </p>
<p>I think the author, Joël van der Reijden, underestimates the fissure that Pizzagate investigation has opened up.  No longer are people fully trusting either MSM or Alt Media.  Add to that a third pillar, the latest manifestation of Psywar, which is the 24/7 protest intended to drown out discussions and take out the new Administration.  This unprecedented level of insanity indicates a MAJOR blow to the &quot;Supernational&quot; class as they scramble for ways to prevent the truth about the sheer scope of their evil deeds from getting out.
Relevant to Pizzagate, we are learning to be skeptical, and on guard of all ways the investigation can be undermined.  Also, the site itself includes info on child abuse rings BUT CAUTION!!!!!! is order, articles may include NSFW, plus it\'s so Fing sick, remember you can\'t \'Unsee&quot; it .  Regarding one article, while there is good info, but I wish there was a censored version because I didn\'t expect such horrific photos to be part of it.  :(</p>
<p>But getting back to the Psywar Manuel:

One of the most familiar ones:
&quot;4.  Imply that conspiracy theories are literally made up out of thin air and that there never was any significant evidence to support any of them.<br />
Additional explanation: Be as condescending as possible by taking on a parental role. Fill your news reports with words like &quot;paranoid&quot;, &quot;urban legend&quot;, &quot;folklore&quot;, &quot;myth&quot;, &quot;fantasy&quot;, &quot;imagination&quot;, &quot;legend&quot;, &quot;gullible&quot;, &quot;hype&quot;, &quot;hoax&quot;., etc. Works better the more grades and authority you have. &quot;
Today these words are conveniently encapsulated in the term \'Fake News\'</p>
<p>Also note, I don\'t agree with Joel on his take about the use of the term NWO, which he disregards outright.  I have found the term useful, when talking about what he terms as the &quot;SuperClass&quot;.  Potatoe Potato LOL

            Just my humble gal-on-the-street observation, but people are becoming smarter about whether something is true or not.  Also I have noticed more are comfortable with a wait-and-see stance and so they don't get headaches anymore if something isn't black or white at the moment while they await more info for a pattern to emerge.  Thanks to mainstream news lies and wikileaks, they no longer blindly respect authority.

            I wouldn't get too worried about the MSM's recent departure from reality. The giant cluster fuck we've been watching for the past 3 months is going to wrap up directly.
