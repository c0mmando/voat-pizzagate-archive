            Not only investigate before calling, but take a step back before investigating (in some cases).  Unfortunately the code words and symbology are VERY common.  Not every Hollywood agency or international corp with a spiral-esque logo is hiding something (or at least, they aren't necessarily hiding something related to this investigation).  The hierarchy of tip/evidence priority should probably begin with money and relationships, with symbols and artwork somewhere near the bottom (placing code words in the middle, possibly near the top).  Thoughts?

            Contacting the police won't do anything. Let's focus on the investigation.
