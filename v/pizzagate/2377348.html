<p><strong>The latest insanity of the deranged Left: Alleged child rapist says he “self-identifies” as a nine-year-old, so it’s not really rape</strong></p>
<p>Posted on February 4, 2018 by Ethan Huff	</p>
<hr />
<p>A 38-year-old Chicago man who recently confessed to sexually molesting three underage girls between the ages of six and eight appears to be trying to capitalize on liberalism’s acceptance of the “gender spectrum.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Joseph Roman is reportedly claiming that he self-identifies as a nine-year-old trapped in a grown man’s body, which using liberal logic means he’s simply a misunderstood “trans-age” individual who’s being unfairly persecuted and discriminated against simply for being “different.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Roman’s multiple acts of sexual assault against young girls aren’t, in fact, crimes, based on liberalism’s ever-evolving tenets of tolerance. They’re just unique expressions of the vast gender spectrum – representing just another “beautiful” shade of color in the rainbow of sexual identities.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is the conclusion one would have to come to, of course, in order to be consistent in LGBTQ+ ideology. Who’s to say that Roman is a criminal when all he’s doing is “being himself?” We mustn’t judge him or discriminate for embracing his “sexual identity” as a pre-pubescent child, the left-wing narrative seems to claim.</p>
<hr />
<p>When Roman was caught molesting an eight-year-old girl while her family wasn’t present, he wasn’t committing a heinous act of pedophilia (according to liberal ideology). He was simply “expressing himself,” and doing what comes “naturally” to him, right?</p>
<hr />
<p>Or how about when he took advantage of another young girl who was staying with him while her hard-working mother worked the night shift? This was simply “kids being kids,” seeing as how Roman self-identifies as a child.</p>
<hr />
<p>If this all sounds nuts to you, or is making your stomach churn: that’s the point. None of these scenarios are actually happening in the case of Joseph Roman. But they very well could in the not-too-distant future, if “gender spectrum” madness takes its progressive course into “trans-ageism” and other bizarre realms.</p>
<hr />
<p>The good news about Roman is that the courts are still regarding him as a pedophile, as he’s now being charged with a Class X felony – the most serious felony on the books besides first degree murder. But will it always be this way?</p>
<hr />
<p>As you may recall, a 52-year-old Canadian man decided back in 2016 that he was going to change his gender identity to become a six-year-old “girl” – complete with a child’s dress and a pacifier.</p>
<hr />
<p>Formerly known as Paul, he suddenly became a “she,” adopting the new name of “Stefonknee Wolscht” as his new monicker. And the family this deranged individual lives with reportedly accepted it all, referring to their new “daughter” as a “little girl” who plays with their other actual children.</p>
<hr />
<p>In a more sane world, Paul (or whatever he’s calling himself these days) would have been immediately shipped off to a mental institution for deprogramming and serious medical intervention. But in this brave new world of gender “fluidity,” this dress-wearing lunatic is being embraced (at least by some) as just another normal person.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you can’t see the slippery slope with all of this, then you’re just not paying attention. If Paul or Stefonknee or whatever can simply decide to be a little girl and receive acceptance, then what’s to stop this same unhinged individual from demanding acceptance of whatever form of sexual perversion might go along with it?</p>
<hr />
<p>It seems as though it’s only a matter of time before such madness is pushed as “normal,” which is why the gender “fluidity” hoax needs to be nipped in the bud now. The truth that must be reiterated is this: There are only two genders, both of which are biologically defined, and age is a fixed thing that can’t be “changed” merely to suit one’s liberal fantasies.

            I think there's something likely going on like that with this man, who identifies as a "six year old girl," and the couple who "adopted" him. There are children in that family, including a girl. Why would a couple "adopt" the man if the whole thing wasn't sexual in some way? The "adoptive parents" really seem to have something wrong with them too. On top of it all, how can Canada's child protective services allow this man to live as 6-year-old girl with real children there?

            Well, let this asswipe follow his "age identification" bullshit to its logical conclusion.  If he identifies as a 9 year old, he is no longer able to live independently as an adult.  He needs to be appointed some foster parents (preferably one of the shitty ones who only want to take him in for the extra money and who really enjoy molesting adults who identify as 9 year olds).  He will no longer be able to work (child labor laws, after all).  No voting, no driving, no R rated movies, no alcohol, no smoking, no credit cards.  He must be home-schooled because compulsory education laws would require it -- but as someone who acts out sexually with his "peers" he would be expelled from traditional school so it will have to be done at home.  His foster parents and/or courts would be in charge of every aspect of his life.  They can make decisions about his life without his input.   He could be forcibly medicated or hospitalized because, as a 9 year old, he can't make rational decisions about his own care.  His foster parents could screen all his media with child filters -- only age 9 and under appropriate media.  Curfews.  Chores.  Bedtimes.  I mean, if he somehow manages to get people on his side with this crap, let's call them out on the utter insanity of what they are actually buying into.

            Of course this is rape -- 
However, pedophiles often are cases of "arrested development" - kind of frozen in time.
As I recall reading this would often happen to young boys -- maybe 14 who were enrolled in 
RCC seminaries.

            Just want to mention here that I was looking at Scientology which went back to back with Raytheon ads at 
Super Bowl .... and it seems likely to me that Scientology and its ability to beat accusations and scandals
may mean that it's a CIA Mind Control operation.  Similar to the Jim Jones operation.

             I think Michael Jackson is a prime example of this.  I've no doubt young Michael was raped repeatedly as a child and that led to his pedophilia.  But, while I feel great sympathy for MJ as a child, I have no sympathy for MJ as an adult.  If you have gone through sexual abuse and you make a choice to do the same thing to a child yourself, you become the monster.  Unless you have an extremely low IQ where you do not have the mental capacity to understand what you are doing is wrong, there is never an excuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pedophiles, because they do groom children and force the kids to keep it a secret demonstrate that -- no matter what their mental age might be -- they know the difference between right and wrong.  If they didn't, they would try to have relationships with kids openly.  If they are aware enough to know that society wouldn't allow it, so they have to do it secretly, then they are aware enough to know that they should be getting psychological help before they hurt a child.

              Hi Scarlett --
             </p>
             <p>
              I've heard quite a few times from people who have been sexually abused -- both here and on other websites --
who make clear that they do not and will never sexually abuse a child.  It's important to make clear that MOST of 
those who are sexually abused do not sexually abuse children.  There are a percentage who do, however.
MOST do NOT.
             </p>
             <p>
              CIA's MKULTRA is no joke -- there are many ways to lose your free will -- and MKULTRA programming was one of them.
Often, children were turned over to the CIA by fathers who had been sexually abusing them.  This makes very clear that
pedophiles seem to find one another and trade information, that the CIA knew this -- and beyond that, the CIA formed plans
to REWARD the fathers financially.  CIA also ran an "Academy for Pedophiles" out of another location very close to Langley.
There, they taught pedophiles how to "groom" children.
In the CIA cases, children were so tortured and sexually abused that they developed split personalities -- or "disassociation" in order to find ways to continue to exist.  Probably only the CIA knows how many ways a pedophile can be created and programmed and most of the MKULTRA/MONARCH programs were destroyed by Dir. Richard Helms on his retirement.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've often said that Hillary and Bill Clinton also seem to fit the profile of the kind of kids who were turned over to the CIA.
You can see the threads of dealings with the CIA all throughout their lives.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for Michael Jackson, his father seems to have been notorious for raping his offspring.  I think it depends on the individual child and also the levels of torture and sexual abuse that they suffer to say exactly how it effects them.  And, again, I think we have to acknowledge that this is an individual thing and we really don't know the impact on any child.  I do recall reading that any kind of beatings and abuse will scar the brains of young children.
             </p>
             <p>
              We can only try to listen and understand what survivors of torture and sexual abuse tell us about their lives.
If you're familiar with Fiona ... Barnett? of Australia and her revelations ... you feel that even trying to absorb what
she is telling us about her own torture and sexual abuse and what she witnessed of murders of others will blow out 
your own mind!  At least that's the way I felt at times in reading or watching her story/You Tube.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know that since at least 1978, studies have made clear that heterosexual males are our sexual abusers of 
children -- but this information has NOT yet reached the public.  I would suggest that has happened because 
"Christian" teachings reach a very wide audience and the Church had already created hatred and intolerance
for homosexuals so it was very easy to believe the Vatican's lies.
             </p>
             <p>
              I say 1978 because I just happened to catch a review of the 1978 murders of Harvey Milk and Mayor Mosconi in SF
at that time, and someone relates the studies which made clear at that time -- and perhaps earlier -- that it is indeed
HETEROSEXUAL males who are our sexual abusers of children.  That information is essential for the public
to know, yet MSM fails to make that clear to parents.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't know if you happened to be reading anything about Uma Thurman's revelations, not only about Weinstein ...
but also about Quentin Tarantino.  If you have been, you might have noticed Tarantino's ridiculous attempt to bail out
Roman Polanski today, suggesting that his rape of a minor wasn't rape because it wasn't a "knock down battle" ... !!!
Not familiar with his work, but hard to understand why women accept these roles where they're "spit on" and "choked"
-- even when it's later couched in the idea that these women fight back and are heroes, my view of women and their 
battle to lift their oppression is that it has been tens of thousands of years of non-violent revolution.  But in this case, Tarantino as the director, went even further in personally taking over the role from the action so that he could personally "spit on and choke" Thurman.  Whether misogyny is just so ingrained in men that they are blind to it, I don't know, but we are seeing this alleged blindness or willful arrogance as patriarchy begins to unravel in these revelations from women here.  And while our press certainly isn't covering all of the abuse and sexual abuse against women and children all over the world, we do get to hear some pretty horrific stories of gang rapes, even of children,around the world by men.
             </p>
             <p>
              Certainly we can see from the KKK and other violent men's groups that males who are "white supremacists" -- who reject female equality -- and who are filled with hatred for Jews, AA, homosexuals and others ... can still call themselves "Christians."

            II certainly hope that he has had conversations with these childrens parents that would be of adult in nature...This coupled with his never telling the parents of this change in age would certainly indicate that this is a get out of jail (he hopes) free card and not a serious change of heart.

             If the court buys this excuse for child rape then we have to demand that the judges be arrested. Enough is enough. We should also bitch about high level powerful pedos getting a slap on the wrist while the little people practically get life in prison.

              Time to stop fearing being accused of being a hater and do what is fucking right for children. If I hear another case of an abuser walking because the minor was able to consent or worse I will seriously be ready to start a purge squad of my own!!

            It's VERY simple. Whatever you have between your legs, that is what you are. If you identify as a girl you get your fuckin dick cut off, otherwise you keep it and shut the fuck up.

             Just an FYI, it is not completely a "liberal" problem.  There are plenty of conservative pervs, too.  Just look at that guy in Alabama who had people coming to his defense of raping underage girls with the excuse that Mary was underage when she married Joseph.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am a liberal (in the old school sense of the word) -- meaning that I believe that the Constitution protects the rights of others to make choices and live lifestyles that I would not choose and of which I may not even approve.  However, it has to be consenting adults who are in their right minds and capable of giving informed consent.  Personally, I am actually pretty conservative in my values and beliefs, but I am not comfortable passing laws to restrict how other people live, as long as they are not harming anyone else in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will own the fact that sexual extremes have been pushed by "liberal" groups, but I think we are really talking about a subset of liberals (the rest are guilted into accepting it by the adoption of science as the new religion) -- and mainly those liberals who aren't truly liberal at all but rather are seeking to destroy civilization in order to eventually install a one world dictatorship.  These types of liberals actually work hand in hand with the subset of "conservatives" who are following the same blueprint with the same end game (basically the Protocols, which regardless of whether or not Jews are actually the driving force behind it, it is clear that they are valid and are being implemented by some group).  The vast majority of us are outside those groups.  We are true conservatives or true liberals and, while we may have very different concepts of how things should be, we are both coming from a place that wants America to succeed and thrive.  We aren't enemies, at all.  In fact, I think if we had honest dialogue, we'd find that we have much more in common than we think.  That is part of the game plan, though, to keep us at odds with one another so that we don't focus on the people who are really the true enemies of America.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry, I know it was off topic, but I think lumping all liberals and all conservatives together and making it a left/right division misses the point that we are really talking about a Luciferian elite (on both sides of the aisle) vs. the rest of the American public.  If we keep pointing the finger at the other half of the population, we aren't being specific enough about who the guilty really are.  And by making the other side defensive, we actually are closing them off to listening to what we have to say.
            </p>
            <p>
             But you are right about Are_We_Sure.  Absolutely a shill who even refuses to entertain the possibility that wealthy and powerful people could be involved in pedophilia and using their influence and power to cover it up and avoid prosecution.

              Wonder if I should be using the term "Progressive" (far left, often SJWs) when talking about people like Are_We_Sure. Personally, I think he's actively trying to cover for these luciferian bastards, ie an active accomplice.
