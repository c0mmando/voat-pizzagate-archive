            Sorry for posting 1 month after the fact but I had been thinking about this lately. Cartoon Pizza also made the Christian Kid's show "Hoop Dogz."

            I have seen a lot of Christian TV shows during my time and I always felt like the creators of this show weren't the hardcore Christians that usually make these types of shows. In the behind the scenes interviews, their knowledge of the Bible seemed lacking. I could be wrong but I just thought I would share this with you.

            Doug is another children's show produced by Jim Jinkins, a Cartoon Pizza key figure.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a video out there that a character in Doug is a pedo, and I think it makes a good case:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOmPHGpJ29g">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOmPHGpJ29g
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The suspected pedo's name in Doug? Mr. Dink. As in Pinky Dinky Doo. Who is Dink, does this cartoon character resemble one of the employees of this company? What is the inside reference to "Dink"?
