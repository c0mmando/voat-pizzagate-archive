            It makes me think that Watergate was a setup to get Nixon.  Liddy, son, et al are the Jesuit hit squad - like MS13, but with degrees - and they did the dirty work of the Deep State. Like the rest of them, they are the product of Catholic kid fuckers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Iran-Contra was a set-up too.

              It makes me think that Watergate was a setup to get Nixon. Liddy, son, et al are the Jesuit hit squad - like MS13, but with degrees - and they did the dirty work of the Deep State.

             This is too ridiculous for even you to believe.   Watergate was a setup to get Nixon?  You know there are actual tapes you can listen to?   The Watergate conspiracy, of course, went way beyond the that hotel robbery.  Here's Nixon personally ordering another break in on the Brookings Institution

             Here's Nixon ordering the coverup of Watergate.   You know who he got to help in the coverup?  The CIA.   He had the CIA tell the FBI to back off.  This is what caused Deep Throat to leak.

             H.R. Haldeman kept a diary, the conspirators admitted to their crimes afterwards.   There's a BBC documentary from the 90's with a lot of the original conspirators explaining exactly what crimes they committed.

             MS-13 is being hyped beyond belief.  They are far from the biggest or most dangerous gang in America.  They tend only to prey on immigrant communities through extortion.  They are not big in the drug trade and they are not unified.  There's the same number of them as there was 10 years ago.  A ProPublica reporter who had been reporting on them for years, said some of the leaders on Long Island were teenagers who still had to work fast food jobs.

             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              I spent three years at American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies chronicling the MS-13's criminal exploits for the National Institute of Justice. Our study proves that MS-13 is neither a drug cartel nor was it born of illegal immigration.
             </p>
             <p>
              That misconception is fueling failed U.S. policies that, in my assessment, will do little to deter MS-13.
             </p>
             <p>
              But our research found that MS-13 is hardly a lucrative network of criminal masterminds. Instead, it is a loose coalition of young, often formerly incarcerated men operating hand to mouth across a vast geographic territory.
             </p>
             <p>
              MS-13 was born in Los Angeles in the early 1980s, when scores of Salvadorans, many of them fleeing the country's civil war, arrived to California. Like other Latino immigrant groups, the new arrivals formed a youth gang of the sort proliferating in L.A. at the time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then as now, MS-13 acted as a surrogate family for its members, though not a benign one. MS-13 created a collective identity that was constructed and reinforced by shared experiences, particularly expressions of violence and social control.
             </p>
             <p>
              ....
             </p>
             <p>
              Inept at drug dealing
             </p>
             <p>
              What MS-13 has not done is establish any real foothold in the international drug trafficking market.
....
One reason MS-13 has failed so roundly at becoming a drug cartel is that it is more of a social club than a lucrative criminal enterprise. Its members benefit from the camaraderie and support that comes with membership – not the heaping monetary rewards that never arrive.
             </p>
             <p>
              Entrepreneurs who hope to leverage its network for their personal financial gain see the same strong resistance that scuttled Comandari's plans.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps more critically, MS-13 is a decentralized organization with no clear hierarchy. The gang is broken into local cells called "cliques" – or "clicas" in Spanish – that are more loyal to each other than to the various leadership councils that operate around Central America and the U.S.
             </p>
             <p>
              Put simply, it has no leader. So what looks on paper like a tremendous built-in infrastructure for moving illicit products across borders is actually a disparate, federalized organization of substructures with highly local, even competing, interests.
             </p>
             <p>
              Finally, MS-13 is mostly about immediate gratification. It helps members eke out a living and get some perilous criminal thrills. That's why extortion is a staple. Complex supply chains? Not so much.

               Strawman arguments abound in this subvoat and it's weak.  Asking people to explain how they came to believe outrageous theories that have zero evidence presented to bolster them is not giving a pass to abusers.  That an informal logical fallacy was your initial response is telling.

                 You remember that stupid advertising campaign I see. He believe's it as part of official/empirical history. Contradicts himself in saying that conspiracy theorists are often skeptical of everything, but extremely gullible to misleading information. How can that even be possible? If he was not around, I guess I would be more active in shooting down theories, but why bother when we have a professional?  Haw haw.

               Most conspiracy theory believers are both highly cynical and highly gullible which is why fake news site and hoaxes are so prevalent among "truther media."  It's why Alex Jones can sell stuff like this at 3x times the mark up.

                Regardless, watching what is playing out in the news, right in front of us - State, FBI, CIA, DOJ, etc. - all complicit in fabricating evidence in an attempt to frame Trump.  If they are doing it now they absolutely could have done it then. The difference is that the fram and coverup were successful in Watergate.  Of course some went to jail.  Just like current actors are going to jail. Those who kept their mouth shut - Liddy - were rewarded with success.  Keep your concern trolling to yourself.
               </p>
               <p>
                No one gives a shit about AJ anymore.  A lot of the the talking heads are falling by the wayside.  The truth is already in front of us.  We see it happening and looking back changes all previously held notions.  We don't need a pundit to interpret the facts for us.  We can see it in press releases, trusted Twitter sources, OSINT aggregation, DOJ press releases, police blotters, and best of all 40-something thousand sealed indictments and rising.  Those are FACTS which cannot be ignored.  Current, relevant, timely facts.
               </p>
               <p>
                The JFK CIA files?  Plenty of strong, new evidence to support multiple shooters and a coverup.  Pictures of Hitlers doppleganger in Argentina in '52?
               </p>
               <p>
                You can continue playing devil's advocate.  But that isn't going to alter the preponderance of evidence emerging hourly 24x7.  The jig is up and we are applying the pressure now.  And it's about to get a lot more painful.  You know it and I know and everyone here knows it.

                  Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.

                  The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  **This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump **- helped along by Aras and Emin.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.

                  Thanks Rob I appreciate that. I am on the road at the moment but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back?

                 Trump's campaign manager who was at that meeting, promised a Russian Oligarch personal briefings on the Trump campaign.  That Oligarch is close the highest levels of the Russian state and was sanctioned by the US government this year.   After Manafort promised this updates, he took a secret yacht trip with the Russian Deputy Prime Minister to discuss the "American Problem,"  the US Sanctions on Russia, the same topic of conversation that Trump Jr discussed in Trump Tower.
