            Correct on the Tony Podesta assessment. Oligarchs and fellow power brokers who have far more interest in geopolitics and big business than pedo art meet every two years at the Biennale in Venice, and that includes the DC families the Luzzattos and Cafritzes. It could alternatively be Tony Podesta and former Ukraine PM Leonid Kuchma.

            My guess is Podesta. Regarding the other big name, here's another odd CDAN post . It's an older post, no longer on line. I happened to have a copy because the story was really creepy and sent it to a friend. Why was this taken down, I wonder? Too close to home maybe.

             #13
            </strong>
            This actor is A+ list. Barely. He has had some paycheck movies as of late that have not done well which may have dropped him to A list. I guess he is a permanent A lister. He is married. If you look back at the past few years, you start to see the whole wife and marriage thing might be more of a cover than an actual marriage. I’m not talking about a beard exactly. I think a few years ago there was a crack in his carefully constructed facade that came this close to costing him everything he has. It would have been a far worse result than even anything Mel Gibson has gone through. At some point in time, people will probably forgive Mel Gibson. No one would ever forgive this kind of behavior. Another thing you notice when you look back is that our actor seems to have completely transplanted his friends. He did a cleaning. Much of it was done by his wife, but it was not just a wife not liking the friends, it was wife coming in to try and save everything. The thing is though, the friends that have been replaced by the wife were the non-celebrity friends. Most of the celebrity friends dropped out of the friendship when they saw what the actor was doing. He might have been able to hide it from the world, but, he couldn’t hide it from them. Why? They were there when it happened. Well, not watching it happen but were at his place for a party. They were all questioned by the police about what they knew and what they saw. As far as I know, none of them saw anything. The thing is, they heard the questions being asked. They heard about the 16 year old found close to death. The 16 year old fell off some type of cliff. Naked. In the middle of the night. The 16 year old had been with our actor. At some point, one of the actor’s friends decided he would take a turn. The scene became violent very quickly and the 16 year old managed to make a break for it. In the pitch black night, the 16 year old fell off a cliff. How did they get there? Did anyone see anything? The police were there in the middle of the night, knocking on the doors of the actor’s guests. Most of them probably knew about the other teens and the parties our actor and his friend liked to have with the teens. That fake Mr. Friendly act he uses to appear charming barely masks a sociopath beneath. How many of his past relationships ended shortly after some violent outburst that was chalked up to something innocuous? Nobody ever questions him. He is a movie star. The victims in the relationship were paid their fee and sent on their way with huge consequences if they ever talked about anything they saw or heard. Not a peep has ever been uttered by them. Not one word. A combination of fear and pain and blackmail and the loss of the money he gave them along with a gold bracelet to remember him keeps them mute. It shouldn’t. They must have seen him with other teens. The younger the better, but always legal. It is why he confines his activities to his time outside the country. It is also why he spends so much time in a place where the age of consent is frighteningly low. Bribes and a huge payoff saved him last time. One of these times though he is going to get caught. Things will go too far and someone will be willing to talk on the record about it. George Clooney (Italy’s age of consent is 14) (friend: Rande Gerber)

             Long time lurker here...Hi...appreciate your work so much.....Have long suspected George Clooney of being a violent pedophile. Stuff I have read..His father was Jesuit..... Angelina Jolie became very angry when Brad Pitt came home from Clooney's house with a black eye. He said he got caught in a hot tub drain. ...he seemed to be falling from grace, looking pale  , not healthy....then the marriage.He never looked happy or anything close to a normal human being. And most importantly, his movies stopped selling.Then the motorcycle accident because a car turned suddenly in front of him.Sometimes when people are more of a liability to their owners , they end up in a tragic accident.

            Except dual citizenship won't help in terms of extradition to the USA. There are few nations that do not have extradition treaties with the USA. Someone with dual Italian citizenship might be able to tie up the extradition process in court for a few years, but criminals get sent back (e.g., Ira Einhorn, murderer, located in France in 1994, sent back to the USA in 2001).

            Not sure about Clooney but just occurred to me that if someone is uninterested in females but offered women, the younger you can get a girl the better bc they basically look like little boys. Also, who’s to say they aren’t little boys with wigs just to make things seem “better” in transit. That’s a stretch, just brainstorming out loud.

             Over the years I've come to believe that all actors are gay unless proven otherwise. I'm thinking it's the same with pedophilia and fame. I'm not a court of law. The French courts assume guilt until proven innocent, if I remember correctly. I'm more like the French system when it comes to Clooney and all the rest. It's sad, but that's where I stand at this point.

              All criminal courts in the world presume Guilt until you can prove yourself Not Guilty.

              Any time an arrest is made and prosecution happens the Court system presumes you are Guilty.

            Tony had a home in Venice where he hosted a lot of important people for parties.  The other part of the story is that he would get perks in the form of young um companions when he bought certain art.  We've said here all along at PG that art collecting is often a way to launder money, for example the pimping of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            ETA there was also the issue of Tony hiding a lot of his purchases from his wife.  In the context of the kind of perks he would get with these purchases, it puts another spin on things.

            There have been whispers of Clooney and one picture taken at his villa of a young girl.  It has been rumored also that he and Randi Gerber are a serious item accepted by many in Lake Como.  Some gays can be pedos so who knows.  Besides what other big star has the connections that he does.  Also yes, this is Tony who has a restaurant in Italy and is a huge art collector.  Remember a few years ago Berlusconi got in trouble with some young Middle Eastern girl I think was around 17. So yes, birds of a feather, you know the rest.

             Zahia Dehar on instagram Zahiaofficiel is the girl who was a young teen who started in an underage prostitution ring with celebrities and athletes. She was 16 when caught with a soccer star and was frequently with Berlusconi and his young girls including Ruby the Heatstealer a nickname he gave to the 13 yr old at his “Bunga Bunga” parties!!! Zahia was around 13 or 14 when she first started going to the Dubai for prostitution with sheiks and major money men. She is now living in France and has many men paying for her very expensive lifestyle. If u check out her circle of friends and some of her live feeds she doesn’t deny being an escort and wears masks, changes her look and travels frequently. No doubt she’s been to a number of their elite occult sex parties. Originally from Morocco and Muslim estranged from her parents. Major famous fashion photographers have photographed her and she had her own lingerie line. How was any of that possible besides elite well paying Johns. Hard to find out the real story of what happened to her in her childhood from the MSM articles available.

              Oh Thanks! for that refresher course.  I had forgotten her country.  Yes, I do remember there were more girls made available and she was connected. Yes, I remember the Bunga Bunga Term too.  What a name.  I bet George was at least at one of them or more.  I am sure that Amal is fine with all of this too.

             Carmen, I forget if we talked about that picture from George's accident in Italy.  How eyewitnesses said there were several people with him including security.  If you look at one of the pics, an older security guy is there but there is also a teenage boy kneeling next to him.  The boy doesn't look like security - no way they would let a random teenager kneel next to him - and he doesn't look like an EMT.

              We assume that the man next to the boy is security kneeling there, but it could have been a concerned motorist and his son.  And you could as well be correct, he could have been with him. Also we should keep in mind that there are some pedos, although not that many, that seek out both sexes, they are that sick.  I prefer to label them  bi-pedo.  Either way, whatever they are called, it is all sick.  And he seems to be playing both sides of the fence. Randi and kids.  Wonder if Randi is too.  Data Lounge seems to know about Randi and George, but no mention of the kids.  They do love their idols over there.  Yes, there were a couple of posts on here about the accident and DL covered it too.

            When the metoo thing broke Clooney said something like he should have said something about Berlusconi's parties and the age of some of the guests. He claims he was at one but left after a short while.

            Sounds right.  Apparently Clooney's been appointed an honorary citizen by Laglio, the village in Italy where he lives.
