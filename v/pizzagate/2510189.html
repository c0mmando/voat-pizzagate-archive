<h2>R. Kelly has been dropped by his publicist, lawyer and assistant.</h2>
<p>In the wake of new allegations.</p>
<p><sup>By SALVATORE MAICKI</sup></p>
<p><sup>April 21, 2018</sup></p>
<p>R. Kelly has been dropped by his lawyer Linda Mensch, BBC <a href="https://archive.is/x7qg0">confirms</a>. They also have reported that Diane Copeland, who has worked as Kelly\'s executive assistant for over a decade, resigned from her job at the top of the month. That\'s not all, though. His publicist, Trevian Kutti, told Rolling Stone earlier today that &quot;effective April 16, 2018, I no longer represent Mr. Robert Kelly.&quot;</p>
<p>Their departures come mere weeks after the BBC aired a new documentary titled R. Kelly: Sex, Girls, and Videotapes, which unveiled a litany of new accusations of the cult-like environment that Kelly created for the women in his life. A number of artists have spoken out against him in recent weeks, including Jack Antonoff and Vince Staples, who <a href="https://archive.is/cjKr1">described</a> Kelly as a &quot;fucking piece of shit&quot; at Coachella last weekend.</p>

<h2>R Kelly: Inner circle desert him following \'sex pet\' allegations</h2>
<p><strong>Two high-profile women have resigned their roles after new revelations emerged in a BBC Three documentary</strong></p>
<p><sup><strong>Ben Zand</strong></sup></p>
<p><sup>20 April 2018</sup></p>
<p>Two high-profile women within R Kelly’s inner circle have resigned. The news comes following the revelations made in the BBC Three documentary R Kelly: Sex, Girls And Videotapes.</p>
<p>Fresh allegations have also arisen against the singer, claiming he “knowingly and intentionally infected” a 19-year-old woman with an STD.</p>
<p>A criminal complaint has been lodged against him, and Dallas police have said they are investigating.~~</p>
<p>~~I highlighted one particular allegation, from his former girlfriend Kitti Jones: she claimed R Kelly groomed a girl from the age of 14. Kitti had confirmed for the first time that she was part of R Kelly’s “sex dungeon” where she was forced to have sex with him and other people on “more than 10” occasions.</p>
<p>She believes some of the girls in the \'sex dungeon\' were underage, and talked about an encounter with R Kelly where he told her that he had been “training” one of the girls from the age of 14 to be one of his “pets”. Kelly has previously denied these claims, calling them false and defamatory.</p>
<p>Kitti Jones said, “I saw that this girl was dressed like me, that she was saying the things I’d say, and her mannerisms were like mine. That’s when it clicked in my head that he had been grooming me to become one of his pets, too. He calls them his pets.”~~</p>

<h2>R. Kelly\'s Lawyer, Publicist Sever Ties With Singer</h2>
<p>Linda Mensch and Trevian Kutti part ways with vocalist as he battles &quot;sex cult&quot; allegations</p>
<hr />
<p>R. Kelly\'s lawyer and publicist have severed ties with the singer, Rolling Stone has confirmed. The departure of his lawyer was first reported by the BBC on Friday.</p>

<p>Kitti Jones left her home and career for a relationship with the R&amp;B idol. That\'s when she says the abuse began. Now she\'s speaking out</p>
<hr />
<p>In a statement, Kelly\'s publicist, Trevian Kutti, told Rolling Stone, &quot;effective April 16, 2018, I no longer represent Mr. Robert Kelly.&quot; </p>
<p>In a separate statement, the singer\'s attorney, Linda Mensch, said, &quot;I no longer represent R. Kelly. My resignation was unrelated to any allegations related to Mr. Kelly’s social life.&quot; She previously worked for the singer for four years.</p>
<p>In addition, BBC reports that Kelly\'s executive assistant, Diana Copeland, who worked with the singer for over a decade, has also left his employ as of April 1st. Rolling Stone was unable to independently verify this by press time.</p>
<p>The reasons behind the departures are unknown. The news of their exit comes soon after the release of a BBC documentary, R. Kelly: Sex, Girls and Videotapes, which investigated the numerous allegations ­­– including alleged sexual relationships with underage women, mental and physical abuse of women and &quot;brainwashing&quot; women in a &quot;cult&quot; – against the singer.</p>
<p>In addition, a Dallas woman filed a police report on Monday alleging that she was &quot;being groomed for R. Kelly\'s sex cult&quot; and that he &quot;knowingly and intentionally infected her with a sexually transmitted disease without her knowledge.&quot; A representative for Kelly said the singer &quot;categorically denies all claims and allegations.&quot;</p>
<p>The role of denying accusations against Kelly had previously been handled by Mensch. When Buzzfeed published an investigative report in 2017 alleging that Kelly oversaw a &quot;cult,&quot; Mensch offered a rebuttal on the singer\'s behalf. &quot;We can only wonder why folks would persist in defaming a great artist who loves his fans, works 24/7, and takes care of all of the people in his life,&quot; she said.</p>

<h2>Watch Vince Staples go off on “piece of fucking shit R Kelly”</h2>
<p>The rapper had some thoughts about Kelly, who faces allegations of sexual manipulation and abuse.</p>
<p><sup>By JORDAN DARVILLE</sup></p>
<p><sup>April 16, 2018</sup></p>
<p><a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=ulMu23o-xkE&amp;t=164s">Vince Staples Interview - Coachella 2018</a></p>
<p>In 2017, R. Kelly faced allegations of <a href="https://archive.is/EXZ04">abuse, &quot;brainwashing,&quot; and controlling behavior</a> by several former members of his entourage in <a href="https://archive.is/sTgKJ">a Buzzfeed report</a>. Yet the singer continues to tour and has avoided criminal charges or industry reprisal despite national media attention on the claims, <a href="https://archive.is/E6tOH">the #MeToo movement</a>, and <a href="https://archive.is/E6tOH">new allegations of underage abuse</a> made in an upcoming documentary.</p>
<p>Speaking at Coachella last weekend, Vince Staples didn\'t mince words in his opinion of the singer. When the interviewer raised concerns that his probation could get him locked up for speeding, Vince brushed it off, joking that &quot;black entertainers&quot; never get sent to prison and citing the accusations against R. Kelly.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;R. Kelly never went to jail and he\'s a child molester,&quot; Vince said. &quot;I\'m a good person, R Kelly a piece of fucking shit, so piece of fucking shit R. Kelly didn\'t go to jail for being a child molester and <a href="https://archive.is/a5qj7">peeing on people</a> and having a human trafficking ring in Atlanta, then I\'ll be aight.&quot;</p>
<p>Vince skewered &quot;everybody overreacting to my pretty logical take&quot; in a tweet posted on Monday. See it below:</p>

<h2>R. Kelly Says He Plans To Continue His Tour Amid Cult Allegations</h2>
<p>The singer called reports that he’s keeping a group of women against their will “a bunch of crap.”</p>
<p><sup>By BEN DANDRIDGE-LEMCO</sup></p>
<p><sup>July 28, 2017</sup></p>
<p>R. Kelly personally addressed allegations that he\'s holding a group of women against their will in a &quot;cult&quot; for the first time on Wednesday, calling the accusations outlined in a BuzzFeed report by Jim DeRogatis &quot;a bunch of crap.&quot; The singer also said that he would be continuing his After Party tour with three upcoming dates in Virginia Beach, VA, Baltimore, MD, and White Plains, NY.</p>
<p>“I just want to let my fans know, despite all of the crap y\'all hearing, I will be coming to the East Coast to do my show,” he said in the video. “And believe me y’all, it’s a bunch of crap.”</p>
<p>In the BuzzFeed report, parents and women who said they had formerly lived in Kelly\'s properties said that the singer alleged that the singer was abusing them physically and “brainwashing” them in a “cult”-like relationship.</p>
<p>Representatives for R. Kelly and Live Nation were not immediately available for comment.</p>

            Kitti Jones left her home and career for a relationship with the R&amp;B idol. That's when she says the abuse began. Now she's speaking out
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            In a statement, Kelly's publicist, Trevian Kutti, told Rolling Stone, "effective April 16, 2018, I no longer represent Mr. Robert Kelly."
           </p>
           <p>
            In a separate statement, the singer's attorney, Linda Mensch, said, "I no longer represent R. Kelly. My resignation was unrelated to any allegations related to Mr. Kelly’s social life." She previously worked for the singer for four years.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, BBC reports that Kelly's executive assistant, Diana Copeland, who worked with the singer for over a decade, has also left his employ as of April 1st. Rolling Stone was unable to independently verify this by press time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reasons behind the departures are unknown. The news of their exit comes soon after the release of a BBC documentary, R. Kelly: Sex, Girls and Videotapes, which investigated the numerous allegations ­­– including alleged sexual relationships with underage women, mental and physical abuse of women and "brainwashing" women in a "cult" – against the singer.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, a Dallas woman filed a police report on Monday alleging that she was "being groomed for R. Kelly's sex cult" and that he "knowingly and intentionally infected her with a sexually transmitted disease without her knowledge." A representative for Kelly said the singer "categorically denies all claims and allegations."
           </p>
           <p>
            The role of denying accusations against Kelly had previously been handled by Mensch. When Buzzfeed published an investigative report in 2017 alleging that Kelly oversaw a "cult," Mensch offered a rebuttal on the singer's behalf. "We can only wonder why folks would persist in defaming a great artist who loves his fans, works 24/7, and takes care of all of the people in his life," she said.

            In 2017, R. Kelly faced allegations of

             abuse, "brainwashing," and controlling behavior

           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking at Coachella last weekend, Vince Staples didn't mince words in his opinion of the singer. When the interviewer raised concerns that his probation could get him locked up for speeding, Vince brushed it off, joking that "black entertainers" never get sent to prison and citing the accusations against R. Kelly.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            "R. Kelly never went to jail and he's a child molester," Vince said. "I'm a good person, R Kelly a piece of fucking shit, so piece of fucking shit R. Kelly didn't go to jail for being a child molester and

           </p>

            Vince skewered "everybody overreacting to my pretty logical take" in a tweet posted on Monday. See it below:

            R. Kelly personally addressed allegations that he's holding a group of women against their will in a "cult" for the first time on Wednesday, calling the accusations outlined in a BuzzFeed report by Jim DeRogatis "a bunch of crap." The singer also said that he would be continuing his After Party tour with three upcoming dates in Virginia Beach, VA, Baltimore, MD, and White Plains, NY.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I just want to let my fans know, despite all of the crap y'all hearing, I will be coming to the East Coast to do my show,” he said in the video. “And believe me y’all, it’s a bunch of crap.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In the BuzzFeed report, parents and women who said they had formerly lived in Kelly's properties said that the singer alleged that the singer was abusing them physically and “brainwashing” them in a “cult”-like relationship.
           </p>

            Representatives for R. Kelly and Live Nation were not immediately available for comment.

            I listened to an old hip hop song the other day, I forget who it was now, but in the lyrics they said "Keep us locked up like R Kelly" and pretty sure this was an old song so it's obviously been known for a long time! I'll post if I can remember it.

                is the sixth and final studio album by American hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest. The album features contributions from the deceased member Phife Dawg, who died several months before the release.
               </p>
               <p>
                The album, released on November 11, 2016, via Epic Records, features guest appearances of André 3000, Kendrick Lamar, Jack White, Elton John, Anderson Paak, Talib Kweli from Black Star, including the group’s most frequent collaborators Consequence and Busta Rhymes. It was almost entirely recorded at Q-Tip’s house:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Q-Tip had one major rule for the album: He insisted that everyone who was a part of it come work in the studio. “If you wrote your rhyme somewhere else, you still had to come back and lay your verse in Q-Tip’s house,” Busta Rhymes said. “So we pretty much did every song together. Everybody wrote his stuff in front of everybody. Everybody spat their rhymes in front of each other. We were throwing ideas around together.”
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                The title is an homage to Phife Dawg, who came up with the title before his death:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 In the months since Phife died, Q-Tip has worked to finish what he called “the final Tribe album.” Its title is the one Phife wanted. What does it mean? “I don’t know,” Q-Tip said. “We’re just going with it because he liked it."
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Q-Tip shared that the group drew inspiration from various places:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 We played to “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen. Then we’d put on “Money Trees” by Kendrick. Everything. Rakim.
                </p>
