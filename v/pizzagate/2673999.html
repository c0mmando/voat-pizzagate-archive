<p>So now I\'m going over all of his posts.</p>
<p>Wisconsin would tell us Racine has a special governing system that is being tested to be put all over the United States and the whole world called &quot;Sustainable development&quot; Now looking this up it seems like, on the outside, to be a good thing. &quot;Balance the people and resources to live in harmony&quot; however this is not at all. This leads to the United Nations &quot;Agenda 21&quot; plan. According to alot of people &quot;Agenda 21&quot; will be an apocalyptic event. The only way to &quot;balance&quot; the planet is by killing billions of people and enslaving the survivors. If this plan of &quot;balancing&quot; sounds familiar it was the whole plot line of the mega blockbuster Avengers Infinity War.</p>
<p>Straight from the United Nations official website.</p>
<p>&quot;Agenda 21 is a comprehensive plan of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the United Nations System, Governments, and Major Groups in every area in which human impacts on the environment. </p>
<p>Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the Statement of principles for the Sustainable Management of Forests were adopted by more than 178 Governments at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 3 to 14 June 1992.&quot;</p>
<p>Wikipedia on it</p>
<p>&quot;Agenda 21 is a non-binding action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development.[1] It is a product of the Earth Summit (UN Conference on Environment and Development) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. It is an action agenda for the UN, other multilateral organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of Agenda 21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter 28 of the document. These programs are often known as &quot;Local Agenda 21&quot; or &quot;LA21&quot;.[6] For example, in the Philippines, the plan is &quot;Philippines Agenda 21&quot; (PA21). The group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, formed in 1990; today its members come from over 1,000 cities, towns, and counties in 88 countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda 21 implementation.[7]</p>
<p>Europe turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented.[8] In Sweden, for example, all local governments have implemented a Local Agenda 21 initiative.[9]&quot;</p>
<p>Forbes had a horrifying article called &quot;Earth\'s Future Forbidden Zones?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Science fiction is rife with planetary “forbidden zones” --- whole regions of a planet that have become virtually uninhabitable due to changes in climate; politics; nuclear, chemical or biological warfare; pollution; technology gone amok; or something even more exotic.</p>
<p>Who can forget the original “Planet of the Apes,” when Charlton Heston cries out to a buried Statue of Liberty?</p>
<p>Could earth suffer a similar fate?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes folks. Whole parts of Earth that will either be made unliveable or be no access zones guarded by Military Forces. That or be made to rely on places that can provide the resources. More in the Forbes article.</p>
<p>&quot;Areas that would otherwise be too hydrologically-costly to grow crops --- such as semi-arid and arid regions of the Middle East, the American Southwest, Mexico, and Australia --- are provided with “virtual water” provided with food grown in more water rich zones thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>“It makes much more sense to grow an orange in Florida than Saudi Arabia,” said Smith. “You just ship the oranges to Saudi Arabia. If food trade broke down, people would either have to move to where the calories are or starve to death. Without the virtual water trade, Southern California and the Middle East would empty out and Iowa and The Ukraine would become packed with people.”</p>
<p>The United Nations showed a map of a future United States filled with &quot;dead zones&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://agenda21news.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Biodiversity-WildlandsMap.jpg">http://agenda21news.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Biodiversity-WildlandsMap.jpg</a></p>
<p>All the Red spots are dead zones. No life in them or life has been removed. Yellow zones are regulated zones. Meaning only the government has the authority to let you access them. No one will be living in them. Only Green Zones. As you see in the map they are few and in between and it\'s where survivors will live. Think Marital Law Zones in communities of the NWO. &quot;Sustainability&quot; is a keyword for apocalypse. We can only imagine the hell of what life will be like in &quot;Green Zones&quot; and what will be made legal in them, Including Pedophilia.</p>
<p>Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2256949/11162936">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2256949/11162936</a></p>
<p>&quot;Sustainability is Satan\'s Ability. Sustainable development is the mechanism for global control through government, industry, religion, education, health, and community. The agenda will be carried out with the Mark of the Beast enforced by AI and Community Policing to create a Hell on Earth with a system of Eternal Enslavement from Cradle to Career.</p>
<p>Racine, Wisconsin is the model, hub and weak link to exposing the real agenda and the great deception against humanity. The chain of command is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons (Racine).</p>
<p>Sustainability is the key to the Truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you should know that Soros is also connected to Racine, and that we exposed the Racine Social Justice League for their involvement in criminal corruption and cover ups, and their partnership with corrupt officials and law enforcement. They had to shut down the organization to hide the connections after the last corrupt mayor and others resigned.&quot;</p>

<p>Wisconsin was right. The mayor of Racine, John Dickert, did resign.</p>

<p>He said many groups were involved in Human Trafficking and pretending to be Anti-Human Trafficking. One being The &quot;Racine Dominicans&quot;</p>

<p>He mentions multiple groups that he says has ties to ancient societies. Wisconsin keeps referring to themselves as &quot;we&quot; so I assume Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt is a group of people. </p>

<p>The Pilgrims society has many high ranking elite members.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the years it has boasted an elite membership of politicians, diplomats, businessmen, and writers who have included Henry Kissinger, Margaret Thatcher, Caspar Weinberger, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Henry Luce, Lord Carrington, Alexander Haig, Paul Volcker, Thomas Kean, George Shultz, and Walter Cronkite among many others. Members of the immediate Royal Family, United States secretaries of state and United States ambassadors to the Court of St. James\'s are customarily admitted to membership in the Society.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrims_Society">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrims_Society</a></p>
<p>Knights of Pythias he mentions. Anthony Weiner and Chuck Schumer are also members. FBIAnon apparently mentioned this as well. If someone can find the original FBIAnon comment on this please let me know and I will add it.</p>
<p>&quot;FBI Anon said the connection between Schumer and Weiner needs to be looked into, so it might be their within shared club, the Knights of Pythias.&quot;</p>

<p>Remember Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt was a group of people. They are gone now and have not posted on this website in close to a year. What happened to them? A similar fate to Jem777?</p>',

           Knights of Pythias he mentions. Anthony Weiner and Chuck Schumer are also members. FBIAnon apparently mentioned this as well. If someone can find the original FBIAnon comment on this please let me know and I will add it.

           "FBI Anon said the connection between Schumer and Weiner needs to be looked into, so it might be their within shared club, the Knights of Pythias."

            In the Mej WIC thread it included this
           </p>
           <p>
            The program will feature speaker Smart, as well as a question-and-answer session with local authorities on human trafficking and child abduction, a performance by the local band Well-Known Strangers and a book signing. Smart’s book, “Elizabeth Smart, My Story,” will also be available at the event.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well-Known Strangers was the group that was suppose to perform for the Thorn Group Event before it was cancelled.  What I remember is that the WIC group was being successful in spreading their message and it had to be called off.  I remember seeing the link for the event but can't find it now.  It's a little fuzzy after one whole year.

            I live in  a red zone in upper state Maine. It is excellent for growing crops . Has a LOT of pristine clear water. Rockefella has taken an  interest in ME. Bought land and donated it for Acadia Natioinal park...put in a lot of roads....In the last few years, there was a lot of effort to make thousands of acres in northern ME a national park. Our legislature said no. Obomba still sent men to Bangor to "listen" about renewing the idea. If this had gone through, our houses could have been bought out cheaply and the natural resources stolen.Apple has bought  land close by  in an isolated area. Nobody knows for sure why we are targeted, but as my neighbor says, "we are armed and miserable.'Maye the water...maybe the beauty..but presently, we have many many trees dying here. Kind of like California.....Very little in the news about it.

            I am new to this Agenda 21 concept. But I dont get the dead zones or those red zones being off limit to human activity  by reason of being radiated or poisoned.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have spent decades hiking and camping in the USA and I dont  even need labels to identify the red zones. I can instantly recognize the national parks/forests,  the grand mountain ranges, the great  riverine systems,  lands knowns for great aquifers underneath them and so on.  These must be protected from human development for sustainability reasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            For almost 100 years a large portion of the Adirondacks have been off limits to humans.  Note the large red circle in upstate New York. I have backpacked there and happened upon a tall and formidable security fence that made it very clear that there was to be no trespassing in this part of the park. I couldnt understand this being inside a public park open to recreation. I later learned that the fenced off area was the source of drinking water for the metropolitan NYC area. Unless coming thru delapidated local pipes, New Yorkers get to enjoy a high quality drinking water
           </p>
           <p>
            What with population growth, dramatic changes in climate and perpetual war, we humans will have to rely on these protected areas. The military has declared the diminution of potable water  as becoming one of the greatest sources of conflict  in the future. China is already experiencing serious freash water sources and is pumping pristine waters out of Florida's aquifers as fast as Nestles will sell it to them. Water will become a resource as precious as oil and gold.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having said all this, I cant explain preservation of desert lad from a water perspectie but  all the other lare red areas make sense to me.

              isnt earth  2/3s or 3/4s water, 90% being salt water? The issue is not amount of water, its the amount of potable fresh water for human consumption and crops.  Well water and aquifers in USA were contaminated for decades with Stronium 90 following our land based nuclear testing even as far away as the eastern half of USA due to nuclear dust drifting eastward.  Yes it is a problem.

            Didnt he say that they were knee deep in the mark of the beast system and that aside from the 666 lucius trust building in NYC that they were a close second in that whole thing? That is scary stuff...I am far from a holy roller but that is one number I have been told to steer clear from my whole life and DO!!

            That's excellent that you are taking a second look at this! WIC said a lot that seemed to make sense, but also said some stuff that was really easy to dismiss as nonsense. If he laid out his case like you just laid it out I think more people would have been able to recognize that yes this is a serious problem and we need to address it.

            I know Alex Jones is not well liked here, and I admit that he is likely disinformation or a charlatain of some kind, but I did already know all about agenda 21 and sustainable development, etc by listening to his show.

             I'm trying to! I know he did, I just wish he explained better. So many people are good at research but no summaries and explanations. It's the same with evidence. We could have all the evidence in the world but if it's not collected together and summarized the average person see's it as mish mash.

            For those who want to look closer, here is a larger version of the map, which clearly shows the Racine area in one of the green "normal use" zones.

              I'm sorry, I know the feeling, it's overwhelming and disgusting.  I actually think we're too late and there are too many wheels already in motion, and have been for decades.  We're in the last gasp of outright freedom, but they've brainwashed the majority to believe that violence and socialism are right, and family, religion, peace, the law, etc. are bad.  I lose sleep most nights over it.  Remember to take a break and be with people you love.  Unplug, you know?  It does suck.

            Awesome.  I'm trying to remember something about the Trans-Canada highway (and human trafficking highway) leading from Lake Superior all the way to Calgary, then into the mountains just west of there, around Revelstoke.  There was talk that the US connection was through the US National Park System, one connecting it to Lake Michigan.  Smack where Racine is.  Trying to find it.

            "Our posts on Reddit pizzagate were part of the reason why it was shut down. That is also why we do not post submissions here in order to keep voat alive for as long as possible. We do not trust Reddit and we do not trust you either, Rose.

            We don't take this lightly. You betrayed our trust and are now joining in the hit job on us. Congratulations I hope you feel proud of yourself for working for the criminal corrupt Elite planning to enslave the world.

            Is it because we didn't respond to all of your nonsense emails? Or were you trying to infiltrate and become our friend from the beginning only to join in on the year-long planned attack against us?

            You should be ashamed of yourself Rose but we're positive that you aren't."
