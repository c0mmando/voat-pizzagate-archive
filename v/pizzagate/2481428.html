<p><em>&quot;This recently deceased, behind the scenes power managed the careers of many.  His client list included many of the biggest A-list stars of that era.  The immense power he wielded during his life was only eclipsed by his number of vile actions.  For starters, if you were male, and a barely legal office assistant, mailroom boy, or otherwise worked for this mogul – you were expected to cater to his sexual needs.  The fact that the mogul was 3 times your age, or that your sexual preference might be women, didn’t matter to the mogul.  The mogul also liked underage teens.  For that he would be more discreet.  He would pay people who could bring them to a setup he had in another state, outside the glare of Hollywood.  If one of his clients got in trouble, or needed help, our mogul did whatever was necessary.  I mean whatever was necessary.  He would either make your problems disappear voluntarily, or involuntarily.  One of his biggest money-making clients liked his boys much younger than our mogul.  Many times over the years, our mogul had no moral problem with helping that client to get out of trouble, or cover up his crimes.  This happened on a few occasions.&quot;</em></p>

<p>This fish faced fuck should be remembered and dots connected. Relates to Pizzagate in the sense that Gallin connects to MANY notable personalities IN and AROUND the INTERNATIONAL SEX TRAFFICKING INDUSTRY including but not limited to Michael Jackson and a NUMBER of others who have ALL had their share of controversy. He was also a close associate of Steve Wynn, Barry Diller,  <strong>David Geffen</strong>,  Diane Von Furstenberg,  and Calvin Klein.</p>

            ok, here i go. once again trying to bring a little balance to this board with a bit of discernment. no one wants these pedo fucks called out and put in jail more than i do - believe me. but just because a person is photo-op'd with a powerful dude in hellywood, does not mean there is any kind of relationship there. in fact, in most cases in hellywood, it is simply that - a photo op. to automatically assume that there is more than that is to lose perspective, something i have been saddened to see more &amp; more frequently by emotionally immature people on here such as carmencita etc. i GET that you care - we all do. but black/white thinking is what will be our downfall if we let it. discernment is key. life is not like that. this reality of pedogate is not like that. if you can't see that, then i would suggest taking some time away from this issue to get some much needed perspective.

             Got time to hop off your soapbox?  The other side of the coin says a picture is worth a thousand words. Yes,  celebrity brings obligations like photo ops, that's the superficial gloss and plausible deniability that has enabled these people for too long. Take a look at that list again, in fact go to the site listed for Sandy gallin and throw the name out here and we'll see if they don't have an ounce a piece in controversy. I don't understand why you would even waste your breathe defending any of these people in the first place. In fact these kinds of photo ops have proven all TOO useful in putting pieces together and connecting dots because these ppl love to brag about their activities to friends. I'm very shocked at your attacks and  naivete'. And you are TOTALLY off base about Jackson not even worth debating it with you. Move along...

              you won't "debate" anyone.  all you do is post articles from this website and when someone points out theyre all Jews, like this pedo kike faggot in your OP and his "close associates Steve Wynn, Barry Diller, David Geffen, Diane Von Furstenberg, and Calvin Klein", you get triggered to an extremely comical degree.  look...I think you should kill yourself =/

            I would not put it past Joe J to pass off MJ to Quicey.  Maybe some of his other boys too.  But he really messed up MJ big time.  Possibly Gallin was the Middle Man.

             mj was set up. framed, get it? you don't trash talk to a large audience - TONY MOTTOLA - head of SONY MUSIC - and get away with it scott free. michael paid the price for his honesty. the only reason he paid off families is because he was in damage control from hollywood freaks who did not like a black artist speaking truth to power. they also did NOT like the fact that he bought the beatles rights out from under fake paul (faul mccartney). i'm sure faul threw in a few cents in the ring to get back at michael for doing that. did michael hang out with kids? yes. did he rape or molest them? no. he was framed.

              Maybe or maybe not. How can you say either way with such hostile certainty? Any proof?

              Worlds easiest frame job ever then. Having kids sleep over in your bed is a lot different then "hanging out".
