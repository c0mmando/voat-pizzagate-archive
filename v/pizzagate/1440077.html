            Well, I don't think we have to remain independent. Though many researchers enjoy working alone, and are providing interesting results, I do think that the investigation would benefit from teams of researchers going through this stuff in a methodical manner. Lately I've been thinking on how to create a site that would allow us to do just that. There are much better ways to organize data, and present leads to researchers.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is true of boots on the ground activity as well. While this portion of the investigation has been light, we have had people go and protest Comet, and do some ground work on various leads. Of course, and if I remember correctly, we had at least one person on the Reddit thread who never reported back from a fact finding mission- so safety is paramount if we engage in that kind of thing, and people should never go alone. Awareness campaigns also benefit from multiple people, especially since they can't just dismiss multiple people as "that lone crazy guy". Of course, the information in pizzagate is voluminous, and hard to digest for your typical person, so teams that come up with a solid strategy in their area could make a real difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Project Veritas Action, for example, is a good model for an investigative journalist team. Most of their infiltrators are independent in the field, but in reality they are hitting multiple branches of an organization at the same time to study the operation. When their portion of the mission has been completed, they confer with each other, and decide on the new plan. We'll need organizations like this to battle on many fronts.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I guess what I'm saying is this: Focus on a particular avenue of attack, whether it be propaganda, boots on the ground investigations, infiltrating, or whatever you want. Find some like-minded people to help. If you don't want to "lead" an organization, that's fine, but consider making one if none exists to your satisfaction. Remember, waiting around for people to do the right thing is what got us into this mess in the first place. If you do wind up leading - just make sure to have a solid strategy on how to go about things. Read guides on leadership, and some basic things like "The Art of War". Of course, be good to your folks, and keep them from harm.

            What I wonder is -- what do they do with all of these kids and young adults ??? Hundreds of thousands of kids go missing every year around the world. Where the holy hell ARE THEY??? Are they used and then killed when they are no longer useful, or if they cry too much??? Are there THAT MANY pedos in the world that the trafficking trade is a continual business ??? There are already foundations and people get in charge of them who are part of the scheme. Hopefully, what we are doing will DRAIN THE SWAMP !!! These kids have nowhere safe to run and they know it. The corruption is THAT BAD. Personally, I wouldn't know WHO to put in charge of taking care of these kids -- YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE seems like it to me.

            THIS WHOLE THING IS ROTTEN TO THE CORE AND WE NEED TO CLEAN IT UP!!!!!
