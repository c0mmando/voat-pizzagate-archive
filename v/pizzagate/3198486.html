<blockquote>
<p><strong>The former YouTube singer on Bloomington, Illinois had a massive teenage following and his music videos garnered millions of views on YouTube which he parlayed into tours.</strong>    
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors said he admitted to reaching out to 30 other girls online before his arrest on child pornography charges in 2017.   
</p>
<p>In a court filing last week, prosecutors said Jones \'preyed on their youth, their vulnerabilities and most glaringly, their adoration of him.\' </p>
<p>In a 27-page plea agreement, Jones admitted that he had online conversations with six 14- and 15-year-old girls between 2010 and 2017.  
</p>
<p>In the conversations Jones encouraged the girls to send him sexually explicit videos of themselves via Facebook. In addition to giving the girls suggestions for poses and underwear choices, Jones frequently gave them \'lines\' to recite.</p>
<p>Jones sent numerous messages to the girls in which he instructed them to expose their genitals in videos sent to him through Facebook.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'Now you need an intro to the video. At the beginning, get super close and say these lines: hey Austin, it\'s (name) and this butt is (age) years old and then make it clap for 30 seconds. Got it?\' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one of the earlier messages he sent to another victim, who also identified herself to him as being 14 years old, Jones allegedly said she was \'lucky\' to have his attention and told her to \'prove\' she was his biggest fan.</p>
<p>He then said he wanted to \'spank\' her, adding: \'Think about how amazing that would be for you!! To have your favorite singer spanking your a**!\'</p>
<p>The document states he then said, \'If you\'re lucky, maybe I\'d let you suck my d***\', but she would have to \'keep proving your my biggest fan though!!!\'</p>
<p>He told the girl to make videos naked for him, exposing her \'butthole\'. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'I\'m just trying to help you! I know you\'re trying your hardest to prove you\'re my biggest fan. And I don\'t want to have to find someone else,\' he wrote, according to the document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The girl was hesitant to do so, and told Jones she was not comfortable making videos for him naked. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'If you really are my biggest fan, you would do it! You\'re doing so good I need my biggest fan to be confident... I have to see your butthole to know for sure that you care 100%... spread for a good 15 seconds,\' he allegedly wrote.</p>
<p>\'I bet you had NO IDEA when you met me that just 1 day later you\'d get to show me your butthole how special do you feel?!\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A review of his social media activities showed that \'his primary fan base appears to be teenage girls,\' the court documents said, adding that Facebook shut down Jones\' page in 2017 due to his involvement with minors on the network. </p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p>A defense filing contended Jones\' life was \'marred with abuse, pain, loss and death.\' asserted he suffered sexual abuse as a child. </p>
<p>Prosecutors sought an 11-year prison sentence and the defense wanted the minimum available five years. </p>
