<p>So apparently, the terms of the plea deal were out in the open at sone point, but the links on that page are broken and I haven\'t been able to find another copy.</p>
<p>I\'d like to know the terms of this, if they are open or leaked somewhere. I\'d also like to know who the protected &quot;co-conspirators&quot; are, as they could lead us right back to Podesta, the Clinton Foundation, and others involved who weren\'t given a shield from prosecution.</p>
<p>So far, I have found some info of pertinence in this older post and its comments:</p>

<p>A couple of others:</p>
<p>Jean Luc Brunel</p>
<p>Nadia Marcinkova (Epstein\'s girlfriend at the time)</p>
<p>Let\'s not forget, as well, that Epstein\'s attorneys tried to tout Epstein as someone who &quot;conceived&quot; CGI and even &quot;hosted&quot; a trip to Africa in 2002 on his 727.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/PCN83">http://archive.is/PCN83</a></p>
<p>The reason I bring this back up is, what if this plea deal is yet another wrinkle hindering PG arrests? What if the FBI went along with this deal because they didn\'t have enough evidence at the time to slay the dragons Epstein is connected to, in spite of public outcry? Further, what if Epstein\'s trafficking and the PG ring are multiple heads of the same hydra? What if Epstein\'s lawyers hadn\'t counted on something like citizen investigators drawing attention to their shadily crafted deal they insisted be kept quiet, even though keeping it from being seen by the victims broke the law?</p>
<p>Just so happens that a case was opened last summer to invalidate the plea deal because of that law being broken when creating said deal.</p>

<p>That\'s the last I can find on it.</p>
<p>Is this case still going on? Is bringing light to Epstein part of Trump\'s 4D chess to shed light on this deal, encouraging a public outcry for it to be scrapped?</p>
