<p>Previous post (1/19/20): <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2348815">Omaha: 12 year old girl missing, MORE DETAILS: She is with 23 year old gang member, planned to leave area; LE say &quot;not in immediate danger&quot; NO ONE MENTIONS PEDOPHILIA</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Authorities say Paw Ku, a 12-year-old girl missing from Omaha since January 9, has been located and taken into protective custody in Missouri.</p>
<p>Family members reported her missing to Omaha Police and the investigation was assigned to the OPD Special Victims Unit, Missing Persons Squad.</p>
<p>The Missing Persons Squad developed information that the child may have been in the company of an older male and that the two <strong>had traveled out of state</strong>.</p>
<p>The FBI offered help in locating KU and information was developed that she might be in Milan, Missouri.</p>
<p>Ku was located at approximately 3 a.m. Saturday with the help of the Missouri State Patrol and local authorities in Milan, Missouri. <a href="http://www.wowt.com/content/news/Missing-girl-located-in-Missouri-470276543.html">http://www.wowt.com/content/news/Missing-girl-located-in-Missouri-470276543.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Omaha Police waited since the girl went missing on January 9 to ask for further assistance finding her. They <strong>stated as recently as Thursday that the girl was not believed to have left Omaha</strong>, yet her own brother said she told him should would not stay in town the next time she ran away. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Omaha Police] said Paw and her boyfriend are likely still in the Omaha area and police the believe the pair does not want to be found</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Police changed their story (highlighted text above) and covered their own asses while offering little help, and even denigrating the child (please <a href="https://www.10news.com/news/national/missing-12-year-old-nebraska-girl-likely-with-23-year-old-boyfriend">see Police interview here</a>), essentially blaming the victim, due to the fact that she had run away before. The child changed drastically when she began &quot;dating&quot; as media and authorities called it, a 23 year old gang member and ex con who lived for a while in her parents\' home.</p>
<p>Police said they saw no signs she was ever in danger, no signs of grooming, and treated the pair as if they were equals in terms of responsibility. </p>
<p>How does a 12 year old &quot;date&quot; someone over twice her age? How it is possible the words pedophilia and crime were never mentioned by Police or media in the reporting on this case? Why did this receive almost no coverage in press?</p>
<p>I hope we hear follow up reports about her, but I doubt we will. I wonder if she will end up in foster care? CPS? Will she be safe? When the cops are more concerned with covering for themselves than speaking the truth, are any children really safe?</p>
<p>It was in Omaha that the Franklin Scandal took place.  <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/09/10/still-evil-after-all-these-years/">https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/09/10/still-evil-after-all-these-years/</a></p>

<p>But in Omaha during the first Bush presidency, with the nursery school scandals losing credibility around the country, almost the entire Omaha establishment closed ranks to discredit the accusers.

Against them stood a few teenagers, most of them with drug problems, long rap sheets and traumatized brains.

<p>...Unlike most of the children who were abused during the scandal, Alisha Owen did not come from a massively dysfunctional family.

At the age of 14, she fell in with the wrong crowd, started going to Larry King’s parties, and later claimed that Robert Wadman, the Omaha chief of police, had raped and impregnated her and shoved the barrel of his gun up her vagina. She was put on trial for perjury.</p>
<p>Under enormous pressure from the media and law enforcement to recant, she refused. Friends who previously supported her story did recant and testified against her (and later recanted their recantations). Her younger brother, under arrest for joy riding in a stolen car, was found dead in his jail cell shortly before her trial. It was ruled a suicide despite indications of a beating before he ostensibly hanged himself. </p>

             Her parents sound very loving and concerned, they did everything they could (except as Carmencita notes, they were too trusting when they housed this neck tattoo dude). I pray she doesn't end up in the hands of the state :-o

              Pedos are good at seeming very loving and concerned about kids. The bigger question is why is she running away all the time if they are so loving and concerned?

               I hope for your sake you weren't actually sober when you wrote that idiotic comment. Do you mind linking the source material for your statement that she ran away "all the time"? From the information I had, she was a perfect student and gave no one any trouble, until only a few months back when this adult came into her life. The police never said how many times she ran away nor for how long. I'm also curious why you assume running away is an indicator of the parents behaviour as opposed to, say, nudging from an older man, giving her ideas, pleading with her to hang out, skip school, spend the night.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also why are you throwing around the word "pedo" in relation to her parents??? That's very irresponsible unless you have some reason.

                Not sure why you are accusing me of being a) drunk or b) an idiot. My concern is for the kid. It was from the quote you put in your previous post, which mentioned multiple prior runaway attempts:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 [She has a history of running away, said Lt. Tracy Scherer of the Omaha Police Department’s child victims sex assault unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “Her age and her behavior, who she associates with and her prior runaways ... puts her at risk, but we do not believe she was physically taken against her will,” Scherer said.](

                  https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2347185)
                 </a>
                 )
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                The fact that you AREN'T asking why this girl has a history of running away is "very irresponsible". Sounds to me like her parents -- much like one of our subverse members Becki Percy -- have successfully charmed those around them. This equation doesn't add up:
               </p>
               <p>
                Loving, concerned parents + straight-A student + multiple runaway attempts + 23-year-old ex-con allowed to live in house with 12-year-old = wholesome situation
               </p>
               <p>
                One or two of these variables is bullshit.

            So a 12 yr. old girl goes missing.  They find her and now have 4 people in custody.   Evidently they must be adults.  So, they also say she is in protective custody.  They say nothing about her being taken to a hospital for examination.  Was she raped?  No information on her condition only that she seems to be healthy.  We need to keep on this.  Imo, they only reason the FBI got involved is because we here and also those on social media made a Big Stink about it.  There was so much flack about OPD's response that they had to cover their Arses.  Thanks to Everyone that Spoke Out on here and to you for Never Giving Up

             The "protective custody" aspect is interesting....
Protection from the BF, who might be willing to kill her to keep her from telling all?....ex-cons would be very motivated to avoid going back to the pen as a "Cho-lo"...
Hopefully, also protecting her from her stupid dumb-ass parents who let an unrelated, grown-assed man live in the same house with  their young daughter.  They may seem nice, but they could be nice and still too stupid to raise children.

              Sgt. Brown said, "We were notified of the incident at 10:49 p.m. last night. Three suspects were detained at 3:11 and the female was recovered at 3:13 this morning. A fourth suspect turned himself in around 7 a.m. at the Sullivan Sheriff's Office. The suspects are on a 24 hour investigative hold."    IT IS in the post you wrote.  The one saying she was found.

                Wow.  Good catch.  What incident is right.  You wrote in another comment that Even Twitter is silent.  Could there be a possible ban on this?  Idk, there is a lot of questions and not enough answers. Usually there is much more information on rescued children.  I would have expected the address she was at, etc.  Possibly if any of those men are charged, they will release more.  We can hope.  Wait for my DM.

                  I agree it is sad that there is not more attention.  I would think it would have hit the TV News.

                 I don't have high hopes for more info. On Twitter it's just that no one cared. People are so dumbed down. the tweet about her being found got 40 likes but only 2 retweets and one comment, which was praying hands. There were no other tweets about her, except one from yesterday from someone saying "she could do better" referring to her "boyfriend". Today in Omaha thousands of people showed up wearing pink pussy hats, chanting stupid things, and presumably arguing that we all should have voted for Hillary. Hillary, who took so much money from the Saudis they ended up finding 20% of her campaign. Saudis BEHEAD WOMEN as a NORM. What a braindead population we live within, thanks to the CIAmedia.

                  I know.  I saw all the stupid hats too.  There is no way I will ever participate in those marches.  Bringing their children as well.  What little did she do for women and children and what is she doing now but running a sex trafficking ring, and making money on poor little children being used for organ harvesting.  So very very sad.  But we have to keep going.  No matter how bad it looks, we have to remember there are more of us than THEM.

            OMG.  Thank you Thank You God.  But now what is to become of her, yes.  When situations like this occur, the family should be given counseling in accordance with someone that speaks their language and understands their culture and problems.  Evidently these parents are not aware of what is going on on the internet and also may be too busy working.  It seems they also may have had to take this guy in as a roomer and that is how this started.  Again, way too trusting.  We must remember that in their country as in others girls start dating and get married at much younger ages.  The OPD has been Under the Thumb of the Pedo Elites for quite some time.  For decades.  There is some very horrid stuff in the past and present and I believe the Elites are still involved.  LE is lax because they have been infiltrated and it has become their Mantra.  They are being controlled by  some very powerful people in Omaha and all of Nebraska, imo.  Maybe it will come out one day who is Behind It All.   Time to Start Naming Names.
