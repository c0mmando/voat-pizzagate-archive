            Robert you should have stuck with ascii art and stick figures. As soon as you go with the written word you lose.

            Chris, 
Here is the internal FBI document that listed pedophile code words and symbols. It was put in writing in 2007 and leaked through wikileaks during the election prior to John Podesta emails being released. This was not a 4chan fantasy. The FBI documented the codewords. You can also speak to any law enforcement agent who has worked child porn/abuse cases and they will confirm these codes exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            It did not start in 2007 but was codified at that time. The movie Chickenhawk is a good one to watch. Michael Alig was in this film I believe. He later was convicted of murder and dismemberment of an alleged roomate. He was released from prison last year and is a friend of James Alefantis.
           </p>

             chicken is only ever referenced in pizzagate as jimmycomet jokingly calling his friend a chickenlover as a sarcastic jab to a normal pic of a dude holding a coworker's child.  Im sure chickenlover is a phrase known in the gay community that's referenced sarcastically quite a bit.

              I'm talking historically, it establishes a documented pattern of using food code words for little fuckable boys.  This was in a NYT article many years ago, in a photo caption, someone here posted a link many months ago. It looked like a microfilm photo, maybe someone else can remember where that is. 
However, its not just jimmy comet using the language, there are a lot of unrelated people cited in various posts confirming the use of the pizza code. Use the search and you'll find independent pedo confirmation, I remember a few posts specifically about this. And, the use of language is just too awkward and weird for normal usage unless you understand that the words are code. pizza on dominos? Really? we aren't that stupid.

               I've literally been asking everybody in this thread making this assertion for proof that "pizza" is any sort of code related to child sex BEFORE 4chan coined the term "cheese pizza".  If evidence exists, nobody has been able to provide it with me yet.

                Its not our job to provide you with actual evidence. it a code, and unless someone breaks into Jimmycomets house and finds a little code book, we are never going to have anything other than CIRCUMSTANTIAL evidence. However, there is a HUGE VAST amount of circumstantial evidence and we chose not to ignore it.

                 Once any one of you understands burden of proof, please let me know if you find any evidence that "pizza" is a term that existed before 4chan.  Because until then, it's laughable that a 60 year old politician who doesnt understand the internet would be using it.  I've given pizzagate subscribers chances to explain the huge gaps in reason that keep me from believing it, but so far I've come up empty handed.

                  people are convicted all the time on circumstantial evidence. If I were I jury, I would convict based on all the gathered info. If you don't like the code, follow the money. How does a pizzaguy get to be the 49th most influential Washingtonian? Like 49th out of all washingtonians? He makes pizzas. That must be some kind of pizza. And your asking us for evidence about an unverifiable code, why not question that tidbit.

            Pizza is greasy disgusting famine food for Italian peasants.  Should be anathema to elites.  If there wasn't the CP theory you'd still be a fool to not consider it's code.

             </p>
             <p>
              "Considered a peasant's meal in Italy for centuries, we cannot say who invented the very first pizza pie. Food historians agree that pizza-like dishes, including flatbreads topped with oils, spices, and other toppings, were eaten by many peoples in the Mediterranean, including the Greeks and Egyptians.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, modern pizza has been attributed to baker Raffaele Esposito of Naples. In 1889, Esposito -- who owned a restaurant called the Pizzeria di Pietro -- baked what he called "pizza" especially for the visit of Italian King Umberto I and Queen Margherita."
             </p>
             <p>
              Italian mafias (crypto jews most likely in light of PG) made pizza the most famous fronts ever
              <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Connection_Trial">
               https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Connection_Trial

             </p>
             <p>
              Thus its plausible the pizza was popularized exclusively for nefarious purposes; the fact that it makes americans obese is a bonus too

             Yeah, we've all seen it and anybody who's even slightly rational realized it's not evidence for anything.  You're literally saying an underground network of pedophiles centered around a pizza place in DC exists because a guy on instagram posted pictures of kids that irrational 20-somethings with no kids think look suspicious?  Wow, I'm sold!

               IT FUCKING IS.

               I really don't know why I'm wasting my time, but there's got to be one rational bone in your body and I'm going to try to appeal to it one last time:

               Ok, so here have an OBVIOUSLY sexual picture he posted involving pizza.  Great.  How does your mind see something like this, posted by a man who owns a TRENDY pizza place, who's openly GAY (which means he's very likely promiscuous), and think "you know what, this is slam dunk proof that this guy is running a child sex ring out of his pizza place".
              </p>
              <p>
               How?  How does your mind even draw those conclusions?
              </p>
              <p>
               Let me let you in on something I dont think you and a lot of people take into consideration:
               <strong>
                This trendy pizza place is likely a hub for gay people.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Mind blowing, I know.  A gay man with a trendy business being a hub for gay people, crazy.  If you're not aware, gay people are very promiscuous.  VERY.  It's also entirely possible that said gay people use that place as a place to fuck and that it's kind of wink wink, nudge nudge, which is why he labels it as family friendly because during normal business hours he's gotta pay the bills believe it or not.
              </p>

                Or even a walnut sauce the prepubescent cum from aforementioned vagina.

              <p>
               Again, how does your eyes see these things and then your mind go "bingo, child sex operation"?  Lets say that youre partially right and that those reference something SEXUAL.  You are taking that and then jumping a gorge of reason and somehow tying that to child sex ring based on nothing.  Maybe it is a sexual reference but its just talking about genitals?  You know, the adult kind?
              </p>
              <p>
               I really dont know why im wasting my energy typing this, but i hope there's some part of you that absorbs that.

                         I dunno dude, I get what you're saying but I think that's a stretch.  A bear is also specific terminology in the gay community, he could just be trying to say he's a bear...which I think is MUCH more likely

                           Look, you're just a plain old run of the mill idiot.  The fact that you think a honey bear container somehow coincides with a niche joke from 4chan and not the obvious fact that "bear" is an extremely common terms in the gay community is just another excellent example of your stupidity.

                                 FYI - there is a difference in referencing from memory and reading something incorrectly.  The fact that the ONLY thing you have to grasp onto here is that i misremembered an insignificant detail about who told him about the handkerchief just shows how little argument you have to be grasping at straws like that.

                                          chris I won our little debate. There's not question. You couldn't even get the gender right of the person who sent John Podesta the infamous handkerchief email.

                                          You're in denial. You can't accept you're wrong and you can't accept the John Podesta and others run a child trafficking ring.

                                          You need to wake the fuck up now. We're talking children are being raped and the organs stolen from the ugly ones.

                               This is the most hilariously ironic, stupid thing you've said yet.  You're entire thought process is based on the fact that you've already decided he's part of this child trafficking cabal based out of comet pizza and you're filtering what little mental ability you have through that lens, yet you think a rational analysis of the same scenario is the one with the foregone conclusion, lmao.

                            You proving the "Gay Bear" exists in no way disproves that pedophiles have a "Pedo Bear".
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Get it? Do you know what a Straw Man is? It's when you can't argue the point so you make the argument about something else like in this case you pretend I said there is no "Gay Bear". I didn't. I said I think the bear shaped honey squirt bottle has a pedophile meaning given all the other pedo shit down at CPP.

                             hahaha, no that's not a strawman, you're such a fucking idiot it's borderline entertaining.  You're literally describing a non-sequitur and you're too stupid to realize it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Not only that, but you're misapplying said fallacy to this conversation (because you're likely one of the most stupid people in this thread).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             If you were able to read, process and apply logic to conversations, you'd realize that what I described is two possible underlying associations that the OP could have been trying to make, however one is literally a niche joke from a VERY niche site and has barely migrated to other social platforms, let alone into real life or into the gay community, and one is an extremely common phrase that's SPECIFIC to the gay community.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             So if you apply reason to this scenario (you know, like federal and local investigators do?), it's much, much more likely to be the association I described just by pure numbers.  Of course, you don't apply reason to your analysis, you start with a conclusion, then look at evidence and bend your mind to reasoning to fit your foregone conclusion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             You're incredibly stupid and it's sad.

                                 Ok now we're getting somewhere, let's focus on this before you try to make your exit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 So we've established that (you think) the wording matters:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Question 1:
                                 <strong>
                                  How do you think that email would have been worded differently if it came from the realtor?  How else would she possibly describe the handkerchief?
                                 </strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Question 2:
                                 <strong>
                                  Given the likelihood that the realtor would describe it in a very similar fashion, would that not then implicate her as well by your logic and is that not an example of how poor your logic is?
                                 </strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 I'll give you some time to get the hoops ready.
                                </p>

                 lol, the fact that you don't realize how ridiculous the things you say are is just further making me believe that pizzagate is a joke.  I tried being rational and giving it consideration, but this is where you're taking the conversation.

                         Again, you're too stupid to understand what I'm saying and too ignorant to know in the first place so I'm going to waste my time educating you for some reason:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         They infiltrate communities thats investigating a legitimate, true blue conspiracy based in reality.  They pepper in a bunch of all the wall garbage and the dumbest bottom feeders in the group eat it up (because they're dumb).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Now you've got ammo to discredit it.  You either have your MSM mouthpieces do stories about the off the wall, retarded stuff you just added to the mix, or you just let the disinfo spread and let them advertise the retardedness on their own.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Either way, public sees this and says "well thats just fucking stupid, what a bunch of retards" because it is stupid and they are retards, meanwhile all the non-retards are left in the dust or are dispersed and any of the legitimate research being done gets dissolved or dismissed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         So yes, organized child sex trafficking rings exist (anybody could have told you that, its not even a conspiracy).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Yes, politicians are likely involved (as is hollywood, and other regional enclaves)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         However, PIZZAGATE and tying all of that to comet pizza and podesta and clinton, etc is either just a bunch of retards retarding, or flat out disinfo meant to discredit the idea as a whole.

                          "Considered a peasant's meal in Italy for centuries, we cannot say who invented the very first pizza pie. Food historians agree that pizza-like dishes, including flatbreads topped with oils, spices, and other toppings, were eaten by many peoples in the Mediterranean, including the Greeks and Egyptians.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          However, modern pizza has been attributed to baker Raffaele Esposito of Naples. In 1889, Esposito -- who owned a restaurant called the Pizzeria di Pietro -- baked what he called "pizza" especially for the visit of Italian King Umberto I and Queen Margherita."

                         <p>
                          Italian mafias (crypto jews most likely in light of PG) made pizza the most famous fronts ever

                           God, you're incredibly stupid.  I wasn't saying you were a shill, the fact that you think I was just shows that you're comprehension is so low that you can't understand information even when it's broken down for you in easy to consume chunks.

             Hey! There we go! I agree with that...
            </p>
            <p>
             The amount of pizza related imagery pre-PG is staggering. The other "code words" being used, while it may be difficult/impossible to identify their exact meaning, there is no way to seriously read those emails and take them at face value. "Walnut sauce" may be the only one that is legitimate due to their having actually been a recipe related to it.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the cheese/dominos/pasta/hot dog/pizza map/hankerchief/etc... all of those emails make absolutely no sense when attempting to take them literally.

               Yeah dude, that's the exact video i watched that i referenced in the OP (that you apparently didnt read).  In those texts Alefantis says "mod?" because he doesnt know what a mod is.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is there something about a shill i missed in there?  I couldve gloseed over it.

                The shill part is time-stamped in the clip I just provided. Check it out. The point is that just because he was confused about what a mod was doesn't mean he doesn't know other terms. Dude.

                 Sure sure, I get you but what I'm trying to say is that it's insane to think a guy confused about what a mod is was prior to pizzagate on 4chan or on any online forum in general that used the term cheese pizza.  Dudes an old ass business owner that probably has an active night life and probably has zero time for the internet before pizzagate

                  I was just trying to provide the evidence you wanted. Alefantis is old? Lol. I'm sure yes, he partied etc. a lot more than he was online. But he's not old by any stretch. Give us "old ass" dudes a little credit. Dude.

                    How old are you? Codes have been around since beginning of time, they don't live or die by the internet. I just talked the other day w/ an ex NSA code-breaker acquaintance of mine. Cryptologist from the '70s. Anyway, there have been references to cheese pizza being code for child porn and pedophilia since before the net. It's been documented here. Olsen twins, Family guy references, other stuff. Sure you gotta put on your thinking cap but the empirical evidence is overwhelming. Others here could provide you w/ more evidence. So ding dong Jimmy and Podesta didn't need to know anything about stinkin 4Chan. "4Chan? What is 4Chan? We don't need no stinkin 4Chan."

                     Literally nobody here has provided me with ANY proof those terms existed before pizzagate, the hell are you talking about?  One guy referenced a documentary, which I'm gonna watch, but a documentary isn't a source either.  Your code breaker from the 70s friend isn't a source either lol.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If it's been documented here then I'd love to see it.  That's kind of what I've been asking for.  I want evidence, not just some guy telling a friend about it.  I deal in evidence, not hearsay.

                       Of course!  Why would I ask people making a claim to provide evidence for it, that's just plain silly!  What in the world was I thinking????

                      <p>
                       "Do your own research" seems to be a common copout for people here when asked for evidence of their claims.  Funny how that works.

                       Well, you guys have done a great job taking me from kinda sorta on the fence to just laughing at pizzagate as a whole.  So uh....thanks?  i guess..

              The cheese pizza screenshot in the THORN report was a direct link to child pornography.

               <strong>
                once you realize cheese pizza is a meme basically created by kids on 4chan, the rest of the evidence starts to fall apart
               </strong>
               when you realize you have to assume that 50-60 year old politicians who dont understand the internet at all would be using terminology from a niche site that 90% of people on the internet dont even know about or visit.

               THAT WAS A REFERENCE TO TOR YOU MONUMENTAL FUCKING IDIOT.  the term was POPULARIZED BY 4CHAN.  are you that fucking stupid?  Of fucking course it references child porn elsewhere on the internet, it's not like users of 4chan are locked inside 4chan and can't go elsewhere lol.
              </p>
              <p>
               How does that in any way show why 50+ year old politicians IN REAL LIFE would be using the term (mind you, just as PIZZA, NOT CHEESE PIZZA).  You think Hillary and John are loading Tor and browsing hidden onion sites? Lmao

                    The aggressive way that you respond to people is all that we need to see to know what you are about.  Try using logic in your arguments  (if you know what that is) if you want to be taken seriously.

                      Yes, you're right actually that it was I that first started with the "get outta here" phrase.. irritated by the lack of logic in the post and the obfuscation that I thought/think is deliberate.  A shill technique 101. I took a few precious seconds to have a quick glance over your contributions as you seem to think that your 3 years here is a badge of honour compared to my 7 months (only brought here to research 'pizzagate' as I do other things in my life).  Well, the number and quality of your contributions imo is disappointing and nothing to write home about.

            No Chris, the most damning part of this was Tony Podesta's emails about Denny Hastert and their history. We've all heard about pedophilia is rampant in elite circles. Of coarse a Washington DC powerbroker would be the type of guy to engage in Eyes Wide Shut type shit. Like bro, do you even conspiracy? Do you know about Saville, Dutroux, Franklin Scandal, Presidio and everything else?

              I already know that Pizzagate was a limited hangout astroturfed psyop from day 1. This shit wasn't leaked organically, It was deliberately injected into the political discourse conveniently right before the election for maximum damage. Wikileaks is a mossad front, Jews got blackmail on every politician and they leak shit out to make their puppets dance every once in awhile. There is a pedophile ring in Washington DC, anyone who says otherwise doesn't know about Craig J Spence. Whether is GOP ring or Democrat ring it doesn't matter, they all do it.

               it certainly feels like a psyop and this entire situation certainly feels forced.   They're doing what they do to all legitimate conspiracies:  muddy the waters and fill it with a bunch of state sponsored disinformation bullshit, and there's enough dumb peoeple in the conspiracy field to believe it.

            Yeah, there is no existing food code know to the FBI.  That is straight out deception.  You can not find any evidence that list of terms existed before the podesta emails were released.  In fact, I think it's a straight up deception.  It's quite easy to take a dataset and see what words are often used.   You often see these word cloud maps of speeches done.  I think this happened with the podesta emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know what phrase never appears in the Podesta emails?   Cheese pizza.    It's not never there, not even once.

             the rest of the evidence starts to fall apart when you realize you have to assume that 50-60 year old politicians who dont understand the internet at all would be using terminology from a niche site that 90% of people on the internet dont even know about or visit.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's way higher than 90%.    Yeah, this part has always confused me.  Hillary is what 70?  Podesta is 68. They are active on the Dark Web?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also why use an existing code?  This is a small group of people who know each other.  This is not a guy in Florida trying to buy Child Porn from a guy in Iowa over the internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you use known code, it defeats the purpose.  Also if code is known outside a group, it becomes slang.

           <p>
            I believe pizzagate started as a complete hoax and used it used existing nonsense conspiracies that people already believed it online.  The idea that elite pedophiles control governments predates pizzagate for a very long time.  And the people who believe it aren't too strong on facts or rationality or logic.  So I believe that the very beginning of pizzagate was started by people who knew that if they put out some clues/starter material.  The conspiracy folks would run with it and make all sorts of connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look up at how they faked Hillary Clinton's involvement with Laura Silsby.   They make it seem like she knew her.  It's completely a hoax.  It's quite obvious she had no idea who she was until 10 Baptist Missionaries were arrested in Haiti and the State Department got involved...........like they always do when Americans are arrested overseas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conspiracy theories are stories we tell ourselves and we believed them because of cognitive flaws we all have.   We take random events and connections and turn them into cause and effect because that's how our brains work.

             See, I think there actually IS quite a bit of systematic abuse of children and pedophile rings, but I don't buy into pizzagate.  If you watch the documentary on boys town (conspiracy of silence) or look into pedophilia in Hollywood, it's pretty clear it exists AT LEAST in niche and/or local groups.  Not sold on the idea that there is a vast network tied into all politicians or that it's part of some underground network of mollock worshippers or whatever, though.

            <p>
             I think it's not rational to dismiss all conspiracy theories, especially now as quite a few have been outed in recent times, but there is definitely a fringe of conspiracy theories that are not based in facts at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             I try to give pizzagate as much of a chance as I can, though (as evident in this post).

              Name a few that have.       Conspiracies certainly exist and are uncovered, but conspiracy theories specifically refer to commonly held beliefs that a conspiracy took place for which there is no evidence.  The US mob worked with the Sicilian mafia to sell heroin out certain pizzerias was a conspiracy.  And it wasn't predicted before hand.  Comet Ping Pong is one of a series of Satanic pizzerias dealing in child-sex-trafficking and cannibalism throughout the US, including Brooklyn, Portland, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Ausian is a conspiracy theory.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is conspiracy theories are supposed to be predictive. They are supposed to predict something that is not yet known.  Conspiracy theories often popup AFTER an event to explain why something big happened.   9/11 conspiracies didn't take off when we invaded Afghanistan.  They took off years later after we invaded Iraq when the politics made it seem more plausible.  Though if 9/11 was an inside job done to justify the invasion of Iraq, why not make it look like Iraqis did it in the first place?

               A less-elegant and wordier way to say this is that there has never been a popularly held conspiracy theory, ie, a non-evidenced belief that a group of powerful people secretly worked together to do something harmful, that later had compelling evidence to prove that said conspiracy was real.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whenever I use this argument in social media, I’m invariably sent one of about half a dozen different internet listicles that attempt to prove me wrong by going through a number of conspiracies or conspiracy theories that were later proven to be real. One is a really long slog from Infowars. Another is from Cracked. There are still others from Listverse, Style Slides and True Activist.
              </p>
              <p>
               What much of the content on these lists, as well as those who send them to me, get wrong on a pretty consistent basis is that there is a difference between a conspiracy and a conspiracy theory. Conspiracies are real, and many of them have been proven conclusively to have taken place at all times throughout history. Some of these include the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler (the so-called July 20th plot), the conspiracy to throw the 1919 World Series, American tobacco companies conspiring to suppress scientific research that painted their products as harmful, and so on. All of these are real and none of them are theories.
              </p>
              <p>
               Likewise, things like 9/11 being an inside job, JFK being shot by multiple gunmen, chemtrails, the existence of an all-powerful New World Order, FEMA camps and any number of banking and currency related plots are all conspiracy theories. That is to say, they are all theories that a conspiracy took place – and most have little to no evidence supporting those theories.

               You're just changing the meaning of conspiracy theory to suit your needs by removing theories with evidence, that makes no sense and that's not what the definition is.  Of course conspiracy theories with no evidence usually don't turn out to be correct lol

               <p>
                For a conspiracy theories to turn out to be true, the theory has to exist and be widely shared before the event/relevation happens.  It someone came forward tomorrow with proof that John Podesta was a cannibal pedophile than pizzagate would be a conspiracy theory that was proven true.  Pizzagate would have had predictive value.
               </p>
               <p>
                Iran-Contra was not a conspiracy theory because no one was saying the NSC/CIA was selling missiles to Iran and using the money to fund the Contras in Nicaragua before it was discovered.  It was a genuine conspiracy that was discovered.
               </p>
               <p>
                I still would like to hear what conspiracy theories you think have been proven true.

                 You're literally saying the same thing, that evidence has to exist for it to be a conspiracy vs no evidence for a conspiracy theory and that's simply not true, nor is that even close to how a conspiracy is defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's a definition:
                 <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy%20theory">
                  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy%20theory
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 whether or not there is EVIDENCE for said theory can obvious discredit or give credit to the theory itself, but that doesn't stop it from being a conspiracy theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You're conflating evidence with proof.  There can be evidence of a conspiracy, but the conspiracy theory could still be false.  A theory is a theory, in the scientific world it's a framework created using various observations.  A fact is a theory proven to be true, so to call something a "conspiracy" would be inherently inferring that we know for a fact that this event happened, which would take it from theory to fact.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As far as theories that have been proven to be true, off the top of my head I would immediately think of: operation northwoods, operation mockingbird, COINTELPRO, MKUltra, mass government surveillance.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Just recently wikileaks released some data confirming that the CIA can remotely control planes, cars, etc...something that there was zero evidence for (aside from it being possible in theory)
                </p>
                <p>
                 conspiracy theories run a gamut from off-the-wall with no evidence, to no evidence but grounded in reality and/or likely, to much evidence and very likely, etc.  I feel like you're just arbitrarily setting boundaries so it's mentally easier for you to lump all the bad ones into "conspiracy theory" and then writing them all off in the process.

               ROFLMAO. AreWeSure stop talking shit. There's a fuck ton of evidence 9/11 was an inside job.You refuse to acknowledge any of it.
              </p>

               AreWeSure is a paid shill. He's what they call a "concern troll". Google it.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can easily prove this yourself. All you have to do is ask AreWeSure the right type of question. For example regarding 9/11 ask him these types of questions:
              </p>
              <p>
               Is there ANY evidence that 9/11 was an inside job?
              </p>
              <p>
               Is there ANY evidence that building 7 was a controlled demolition? (
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1966675">
                It was.
               </a>
               )
              </p>
              <p>
               Another way is ask him about Clinton Cash.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is there ANY evidence Hillary broke the law with respect to the Clinton Foundation?
              </p>
              <p>
               Is there ANY evidence that the Foundation's CEO, Eric Braverman, quit because he detected charity fraud? (
               <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-22/meet-man-who-can-expose-real-hillary-clinton-scandal">
                He did.
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Etc etc.......ad infinitum
              </p>
              <p>
               An objective person with no shill bias would acknowledge at least something. Just in that WTC demolition post where I list the top 10 pieces of evidence surely you could acknowledge at least ONE is legitimate. The Larry Silverstein evidence is unassailable.
              </p>
              <p>
               What you'll find though is AreWeSure won't acknowledge ANY evidence as legitimate. It's pure insanity. No one is ever 100% sure of 100% of everything.........except the AreWeSure brothers. They are 100% sure no one working for Clinton &amp; Co committed any crime ever in the history of the universe. Ditto for 9/11.
              </p>
              <p>
               Doubt me? Go ahead try asking him yourself.

                There's absolutely zero evidence that any building that collapsed on 9/11 was a controlled demolition.  And more than three buildings were destroyed.  WTC 4 mostly collapsed.  WTC 5 and 6 had localized collapses. Why did this buildings collapse?  Because towers 1 and 2 did not "collapse" into their own foot print, they peeled out and fell on other buildings.   Most of the collapses were due the impact of the falling towers, but they also had fire induced collapses, particularly in WTC 5.

               </p>
               <p>
                Why did 5 not fully collapse like the others?  It was built differently.
               </p>
               <p>
                Had an actually controlled demolition occurred, there would be plenty of evidence in the debris which was examined by structurally engineers and removed by demolition companies very familiar with controlled demolitions.  Explosives would leave distinctive damage and other items like the detonators and wiring required for all the columns to go off at once would have been left over.  It would have thousands of yards of this wiring.  Thermite would also leave quite clear evidence as it spits out molten iron that would have been all over the columns was the reaction was done.
               </p>
               <p>
                They would have left quite clear evidence at the time of collapse as well.  The type of linear shape charges needed to cut through the thick steel of the trade center would be enormously loud.  It's the speed of this pressure wave that helps cut the steel.  The pressure wave would create a boom heard for miles.  You can reduce this pressure wave to where it would not be heard on any of the dozens of videos of the collapse AND cut steel.  You can't have the collapse without the giant Sharp boom.  Thermite was once used to cut a tower at the Chicago worlds fair. They needed 1000 pounds to cut two columns and it was visible for two miles.  The UV rays creaed when thermite burns cannot be viewed up close without a welders mask.  It would have lit up like the sun if thermite was involved.
               </p>
               <p>
                The conspiracists came up with a the idea of a demolition before understanding any of the science of it.  They didn't talk about thermite for years.  They said it was convention explosives, it was only when this was completely shut down for the reasons I just gave did they turn elsewhere.  First to thermate, then to thermite and these got shot down as well, then to nanothermite a substance they imbue with mythical powers.   They claim it's both an explosive that can throw steel columns hundreds of feet and a completely silent way to melt the columns.  Thermite releases no gases in its reaction, so it creates no pressure wave and it not an explosive, by the way.   Thermite also releases all of its energy super quickly.  Nanothermite even more quickly due to the small size of the particles, yet they claim that thermite was still heating fires in the pile for weeks afterwards.   It's the Tinkerbell of chemical substances.  Close your eyes and believe real hard and it doesn't anything.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thermite actually is not very energy dense.  (It's a heavy mix of metals by the way).  Things like paper, wood, wax, gasoline, all have way more energy per gram.  Thermite goes off and then stops.  It doesn't heat things for a very long time.

                 this is exactly what AreWeSure does. He'll just flat out ignore evidence doesn't suit his version of events. I then provide a short refresher on the scientific method:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bad: Conclusion -&gt; Observation
                </p>
                <p>
                 Good: Observation -&gt; Conclusion
                </p>
                <p>
                 To no avail I might add. That has lead me to the conclusion AreWeSure is either a shill or the most naive person on planet Earth.

                  No.  You stopped because you know you always get the science of 9/11 wrong and you simply don't care.    You never engage honestly on this subject.  .   You misunderstand some really basic things. And continually reuse points that have been refuted.  So you try to shift the battlefield from science to politics   Because you are completely unarmed on scientific battlefield, You try to rely on politic arguments and tendentious interpretations of what someone said to.

                  Larry Silverstein said yada yada yada does not disprove the fact that slow reaction time of thermite makes it a terrible choice for a simultaneous collapse and the quicker high explosives that are perfectly suited for a simultaneous collapse cannot be made silent if they are also going to through up to 5 inches of steel.  It doesn't disprove that high explosives or thermite or thermate would have to all wired together with some form of detonating cord/wireless receivers that never would have withstood the fires.  It doesn't disprove that fact that bringing in box of thermite or high explosives on the 70th Floor would not have brought the towers down.  That for either scenario to work you had to get to the bare steel of the columns which meant you had to rip apart occupied offices, break through drywall, get past plumbing an other pipes to get to the steel.  Demolition via explosives would have you required to pre weaken the steel using torches that release noxious fumes. You would have to go in at night smash everything up, do your work and then put everything back the way it was with no dust/fumes left over by 7am the next day. One of the scientists the truth movement relies on for its thermite claims (the same one who won't let other scientists recreate his tests.) said 100 tons of thermite would be needed in each building.  Well after the reaction, that means 70 tons of iron would be left over it weird looking blobs like this

                  Were any of the buildings on 9/11 brought down by a controlled demolition, there would be massive physical evdience all over the debris site.  A debris site worked by many, many workers experienced in controlled demolition.

                   Wrong? Holy hand grenades. AreWeSure it's YOUR "scientific" explanation of how a minor office fire could cause WTC 7 to collapse EXACTLY like it would if brought down by a controlled demolition that's not "scientific".

                   Quite to the contrary the slow reaction time is essential to the entire demolition. You must remember too many explosions would give the whole thing away. Explosions had to be kept to a minimum. The very property of thermite you're talking about helps spread the "steel cutting" out over a couple of hours.

                    The fire at WTC was one of the largest office fires in the World has ever seen.  I've read it was a bigger fire then the tower because fire was on at least a dozen floors.  Each floor of WTC 7 was about 1.7 million square feet.

                    This is a Hallmark of your scientific illiteracy.  You pack so much wrong in just a few sentences.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    A.  When I talk about thermite having a slow reaction time thats in comparison to high explosives like C4 and RDX. RDX has a detonation velocity of 8750 m/s.  When RDX goes BOOM, that BOOM is a pressure wave travelling at over 5 miles per second.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    B.  Thermite creates no pressure waves at all.  Because it releases no gas.  It's not an explosive.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    C.  So the thermite took a couple hours to react? Holy hell how much thermite are we talking about?   Were the buildings made of thermite?  Was each floor stacked carpet to ceiling with thermite?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    D.  Are you claiming the explosions were thermite?  It's not an explosive.  If you are claiming the type of explosive used in demolition you can keep them quiet AND cut steel.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also you just caught yourself here in a web of your own contradictions. If explosions were to be kept to a minimum and thermite takes hours, then then the massive destruction during the collapse was mainly due to  gravity and the massive kinetic energy release by the top floors of the building falling down.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You once told me that only bombs could cause that much destruction.

                     And to be honest it's hard to even see any flames. Not to mention based on all the smoke whatever fire is going on isn't very high temperature. Anyone who's built a campfire can tell you the hotter the fire the cleaner the smoke.

                     But wait, there's more. Yes there was a fire but even that fact is evidence against a fire causing the collapse. A fire limited to just on side of WTC 7 would lead to a highly unsymmetrical collapse not the perfect symmetry of the collapse that occurred.

                      Why do you insist on lying?  You know that image only shows the very end of the collapse and that collapse begins like 10 seconds before what you show. And that viewing the full sequence we can see that there was a highly asymmetrical internal collapse that preceded the collapse of the outer shell.

                      WTC7 was a tube within a tube construction with lateral supports connecting the two.

                     <p>
                      We can see that roof collapses on the left side first while outer shell looks fine.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      We can then see this collapse of the roof starts to move right before the whole building comes down.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Just as the full collapse begins the roof develops a kink.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Then the outer shell comes down.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This is a highly unsymmetrical progressive collapse.  Starts on lower left floors on interior goes straight up to the right before the whole roof bends in a kink and the outer structure falls.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This collapse is well under way already in that deceptive gif you show.

                       All controlled demolitions implode the interior first and then the "outer shell". That's so the building collapses in on its own footprint. Once again you prove my point. Thank you.

                       Yes because the left side of the roof of WTC 7 contained an additional penthouse structure the right side didn't have. The fact the left side penthouse collapsed first is actually as much evidence of a controlled demolition as not. It certainly is easily explained with a controlled demolition. It was first because, duh, there was more there to blow up.

                       You're priceless AreWeSure. Let's review more of the Scientific Method. I'd like to introduce you to an American Physicist named
                       <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">
                        Richard Feynman.
                       </a>
                       He famously wrote:
                      </p>
                      <blockquote>
                       <p>
                        “Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.”
                       </p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p>
                       That means you don't get to call a competing view "lying". The entire concept of attacking the person instead of the argument is anathema to Science.

                        I call you a liar because you insist on lying.  You use a deceptive clip and claim that the "perfect symmetry" proves it must be a controlled demolition.   Then when I point out you are being deceptive and not showing the full collapse and it was actually highly asymmetrical, you act like you never claimed the opposite.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Then you make a new claim that an asymmetrical collapse also proves a controlled demolition.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And I call you a liar  because I had previously pointed how how deceptive your clip was and you went ahead a d used it with full knowledge it was deceptive.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Your new claim is also high order nonsense.

                        This is incredibly silly and ignores the fact of how WTC was built and how it differs from other buildings.  There is no one size fits all. And there's dozens of examples of demolitions that show you wrong on YouTube.  Here this highly asymmetrical collapse starts on the left outer than middle than right outer.

                        Also you had that nonsense explanation about the additional structure at the ready, didn't you?  It just shows you knew your clip was deceptive and did not show the entire collapse sequence.

                        In terms of how WTC 7 fell, the direction was inluenced by the structural damage caused by the collapsing Towers.   Something nobody could have planned for.

                         In science you don't get to call people "liars". Actually the whole idea behind science is to have differing opinions. Right now as I write this brilliant physicists are researching things like Super Symmetry, String Theory, High Temperature Super Conductivity etc etc. There are a panoply of opinions about all of them. Just those 3 examples may total to 20+ differing theories. All but 3 of those you would call "lying". Is that even a useful accusation? Can you imagine Professor Jim Gates opening a lecture at CERN accusing Professor Mikhail Shifman of "lying"?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The worst I ever heard was Newton accusing Leibniz of plagiarism but that's not in the same ball-park. Scientists don't dismiss competing theories with the accusation their opponent is "lying". Even the thought is comical. You would get laughed out of a conference. By your definition AreWeSure

                           Easy. In my theory of the collapse I'm not lying. For example asymmetry vs symmetry. While you are certainly correct not all building implosions are symmetric or are engineered to collapse within their on own footprint that outcome is VERY common. Yes I shouldn't have said virtually every implosion is like that but you get my point.

                           Also in my theory of the collapse of WTC 7 the penthouse on the roof situated "on the left" is a demolished first while the building is still rigid to nullify its effect on an otherwise highly symmetrical building. It collapsing first isn't enough to make any rational observer think the entire collapse was asymmetrical at least from my perspective that the collapse was a controlled demolition. Yes that penthouse indicated the core was collapsed "left side" first if you will. But the core is not the exterior. By the time the outer shell is brought down both left and right of the core have been compromised. The outer shell goes down

                            symmetrically

                           with just a slight inward tilt to make it collapse in its own footprint.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Two different theories of the collapse will have wildly different explanations for things. That's just how science and engineering work. For some reason as an example I think of when U.S. weapon designers reverse engineered German technology after WWII. There are several examples of pieces of weapons copied lock stock and barrel but had no purpose because they were missing a crucial piece. The US engineers had mistaken its function and added completely useless non-existent "feature" and unnecessary weight for no reason. You would probably say either the US or German engineers were "lying".

                            What?   This is incoherent.  Is your defense you weren't personally dishonest just intellectually dishonest?  IT's the beginning of the freaking collapse.  The left side going first means it's asymmetrical by definition.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Let's put aside how it started for now, but this absolutely was a progressive collapse---some parts collapsing before others-- and it absolutely was asymmetric.  How can you honestly say otherwise?
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            If you get high res video of the collapse, you can see windows breaking on the left as the penthouse goes down where the interior collapse travells out to the perimeter, then as just as the roof goes down, windows break all through the right.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The shell falls symmetrically because all of its interior lateral support is gone and it just falls straight down.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Are you claiming the collapse starts at the Roof?  Because it starts lower.  As the Penthouse starts to go, you can see windows breaking at least 12 stories below the roof.  As the roof kinks, you can see lots of windows breaking up and down on the right side.
                            <br/>
                            Something failed in the lower interior of the building on the left.  The collapse travelled up to the roof while the right side was intact.  The Penthouse collapsing through the building ripping and pulling as it went down.  These collisions rip up the interior structure of the building.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The kink in the roof is probably caused by one corner wanting to fall one way and one wanting to fall the opposite direction.  Remember firefighters saw the corner bulging hours earlier.

                             Moving on. Of the 10 items on my list of evidence 2 involved Larry Silverstein. Maybe I'm wrong but you haven't addressed those.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             They're important because they don't deal with physical evidence of a demolition but with verbal evidence. Silverstein infamous verbal gaffs need an explanation. Here they are again:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             1) Used the demolition term "Pull it" in reference to bringing WTC 7 down.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             2) Started planning the WTC 7 replacement one year BEFORE 9/11.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I could maybe have dismissed 1 but 2 apparent slips of the tongue is beyond the pale. I think the most likely explanation is they refer to advanced knowledge of 9/11.

                             I think I know what the misunderstanding is. You concede the exterior collapse was symmetric and I concede the interior collapse was asymmetric. The misunderstanding I think the exterior shell should have collapsed asymmetrically given your argument fire weekended the structure. After all one entire side of WTC7 is drenched in smoke while the remaining 3 sides aren't. That steel within the back side away from the camera should have failed at a different rate than that of the side facing the camera. If fire played a significant role in the collapse then the outer shell collapse would have been asymmetric.

                             No not at all. I'm claiming the demolition started within the core deep within the building.  And within the core the demolition started "on the left" side because that would neutralize the left core's asymmetric load. That's the very reason I believe the outer shell failed symmetrically. The additional core load carried by the steel on the left was neutralized.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The big picture here is there are various theories about the collapsed. You have the "official" theory and I the unofficial. There is no "True" and "False" theory. That's just how science operates. Scientific is rarely 100% correct. Even something as simple as a straight line gets disproven later when Einstein discovers all space is warped to some degree. There doesn't exist a single straight line in all the Universe.

                             It's almost comical. That's why I gave you the example of Professor Jim Gates giving a lecture on Super Symmetry and constantly referring to critics as liars. Gates or anyone else would be laughed off stage. Calling a competing theory "lying" is so unscientific it hertz. :-)

              Do yourself a favor and pick up a book or three.
John DeCamp's Franklin Cover Up - names national-level names partaking in the sex/drug courier ring, with a focus on the torture these kids endured. Conspiracy of Silence discusses about 45% of what's in the book; they left out a bunch of stuff. 
Cathy O'Brien's Trance Formation America - She delves into behind the scenes of the torture/Satanism as a child who endured it; she discusses the use of dentist chairs for torture/MKUltra purposes (ala Jeffrey Epstein).
Both those books lay the foundation of Pizzagate as a continuation of horrific acts against children; the precedent has been set.
             </p>
             <p>
              Question; what's your definition of "Pizzagate" because the mainstream definition is jacked on purpose by those controlling the media to give plausible deniability and to paint it as a lunatic's wet dream. But when one actually delves into the infamous instagram account of Alefantis, it raises some serious questions about his role in DC and how he garnered enough power and influence despite being a meager pizza slinger, to be counted among the 50 most powerful people in Washington. Especially when those photos include associating infants and toddlers to sexual connotations and money.

              Brownstone Operations help keep politicians in line; put in compromising positions. This came out in public during a 1997 Senate Committee regarding radiation; some of those afflicted were also
              <em>
               tortured
              </em>
              with the government's okay, and their testimony taken.

             <p>
              Also take into consideration of Marc Dutroux, Belgium's child-kidnapping/raping/porn-making douchebag of the elites (who had seven houses; maybe it's my American mentality, but multiple homes are expensive with all them taxes/upkeep, so how'd he afford them all and still have time to kidnap and rape girls? Oh wait, he was
              <em>
               paid
              </em>
              to kidnap and rape girls.)
             </p>
             <p>
              It's my (unpopular) opinion that the Mollach worship/Satanism ties into the MKUltra programming; used to torment kids and fracture their psyches, used to gather incriminating evidence of the elites participating to control them else evidence gets released, and said elites/politicians become fodder for legal issues and social pariahs/losing the life that enriched them with money and perversion. Plus, with a Satanism taint, it's easier for the masses to dismiss it rather than investigate it. That happened in the 80's with the Satanism "hysteria." Again, a precedent set.
             </p>
             <p>
              These local groups are linked via those in control. Bring kids from outside areas to be trafficked, which means that the local populace doesn't get up in arms because it's not their kids. We saw this happen with the Franklin Cover Up/White House Call Boy scandal. Those "call boys" aka trafficked children, came from Nebraska to be used by DC elites at the fucking White House. When one looks at Tom Brokaw's report, we can see the propaganda line being towed; the legal focus was on credit cards being used to buy the rape of trafficked children, instead of focusing on the trafficked kids and those pimping them, because those people are
              <em>
               assets
              </em>
              ... when an asset gets busted, they either do little time and get on with their lives, or they are removed from the picture.
             </p>
             <p>
              Research the CIA's modus operandi; it's very enlightening, and explains EVERYTHING. There's a reason school education covers certain aspects of how the American government works but utterly leaves out the CIA's role in it all. That is on purpose.

               I explained elsewhere in this thread that I'm aware of all those incidents and am a proponent that these rings exist, I referenced conspiracy of silence early on in this thread.
              </p>

               I'm just talking about pizzagate right now though, as I think pizzagate is being used to discredit everything you just described.

                 Sorry glossed over that, but is it not obvious?  Is the sum of the evidence surrounding the podesta and Clinton emails and codewords about pizza, involving comet ping pong as a hub for said debauchery.

                <p>
                 And since i re-read that paragraph: he's a wealthy business owner that owns multiple trendy business in neighborhoods where a lot of big wigs live and hang out, of course he knows a lot of people.  He's basically a clone of my cousin :. Rich white kid, parents funded restaurant businesses for him in a hip area, he gains a lot of notoriety as being the owner from schmoozing and gets rich in the process...it's not that rare of a situation and you can find similar situations in any big city.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You're also conflating him being "top 50 influential people" with an article in some shit magazine calling him that.  Sure he's influential, but top 50?  Lol

Not to mention strator is in the astroturfing business, of course someone there would be saavy enough to know the phrase CP

                The running theory of how the code "pizza" came about is it was started by military contractors (such as Dyncorp International) in Slavic countries running child rape rings.  Pizda was the Slavic word for cunt and colloquially used as a way to say "getting some ass."  The people running the ring modified it to the English word "pizza."  So it really isn't connected to the 4chan usage of the term at all.

                  Anyway, I don't think pizza is a FBI recognized code.  It is just a shitty obvious code which has already bitten Stratfor in the ass.  Words like cheese and walnut and the like are speculative at best.

                  The big FBI recognized things are the logos,  Besta pizzas in particular is a dead ringer for the boy lover logo. James Alefantis also posted the hashtag "chickenlover" in a picture with a child which is recognized as pedo language.  There are more instances but you get the gist.

                   Right, logos: for sure.
chickenlover: definitely a phrase, but context matters.

                   If you look at that instagram post rationally, you can pretty easily infer what happened:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>
                    friend is holding other friend's kid (i think that kid is the daughter of someone that works there)
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    kid or him were wearing necklace and kid does what all kids do and tries to wear it or put it on him if shes wearing it
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    kid's mom says "this would be a cute picture" takes picture
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    jimmycomet sees picture and jokingly/sarcastically tags it "chickenlover" to make fun of his friend, because chickenlover might be a common thing referenced in gay circles sarcastically.
                   </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                   Ive noticed that a lot of pizzagate subscribers tend to not employ or understand occam's razor, in that the simplest explination is usually the correct one.   A lot of pizzagate subscribers also dont have kids and dont realize how they act or how people act around them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Employing both of those in a rational analysis will tell you that my scenario is waaaaaaaaaaaay likelier than some scenario where he's running a secret, underground child sex ring that involves a female worker's child.

                    I get what you mean.  I can imagine a logical explanation for everything.  I mean can a pizza shop unknowingly have a pedophile logo?  Sure, I'm sure they could have hired a separate designer or thought they came up with it independently.  How about three on one street?  I find that unlikely, although still hypothetically possible.  How about three pedo logos on a street which is 90% CIA (the sort of people who should recognize this stuff much more than the average civilian).  I think it is really unbelievably astronomically unlikely.  After a certain point the most likely thing ends up looking like they know full well what their doing.  Same with Alefantis' use of the code words.  I can try to give the benefit of the doubt.  But the guy flat out had porn (Jeff Koon having sex with his wife) on his Instagram which is connected to the restaurant. You have to either assume that he is just oblivious that kids will see inappropriate stuff on his insta or in his restaurant (which seems unlikely) or accept that he probably doesn't care.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That said, I don't think Comet is anything more than a pedo friendly hangout.  I'm sure they are all involved in shadier stuff but I don't think it actually takes place there.  The fact that the media is so protective of Alefantis is suspect to me as well.  They didn't care about the guy whose store was burnt down because people thought it was the one Mike Brown robbed.  They had no tears for the limo driver who had his vehicle wrecked for volunteering to drive Trump even though the limo was essentially his entire livelihood.  Hell, the BBC cared more about hypothetic future victims of racism than the women raped in Rotherham.  I'm just suspicious of their sudden concern for small businesses.

               even so, you just described the dark web and we're talking about 50+ year old computer-retarded politicians.  Like I pointed out, Alephantis had to ask a pizzagate researcher what a "mod" was when they were talking about voat.  These people probably barely know how to use social media, let alone decipher the intricacies of Tor.

             Im not sure what point you're trying to make.  I said cheese pizza is a term created in the early days of 4chan, not during pizzagate?

              is pointing out the Urban Dictionary lists it as a code word and that's outside of /pol and 4chan.
             </p>
             <p>
              You could make the argument that the Urban Dictionary definition was made by someone from 4chan but you have no proof of that. You're just speculating basically.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've been here since last December and I can assure you all those code words exist in the Pedophile world. The only question is whether they were just coincidences in the Wikileak emails or a sign of foul play.
             </p>
             <p>
              Make sense? The question isn't do the words exist but HOW they were used in the Wikileaks emails.

               Where?  Where does it reference that?  Alls I see is posts from 2010 or later saying its referencing child porn, the very top one referencing hashtags specific to 4chan.

              <p>
               Again, as I said in my other comment thread with you, the fact that they show up in wikileaks emails would only be relevant or significant if there were proof those words existed before pizzagate.  The only phrase that can be verifieid to have existed (cheese pizza) doesn't show up in the podesta emails at all.

                  I just saw that 2010 date. Sorry about that. The answer's still the same. You're speculating that any reference to anything used on the Urban Dictionary page that is also on 4chan invalidates the UD page.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There's evidence of all these words being pedophile code words. Search voat, use Google you'll find the evidence.

                 <p>
                  I would provide links to where the code words came from but I'm getting the feeling you two are not interested in objectivity. Mill_Fal you set off my shilldar the past few weeks by deleting some of my posts and never responding when I asked what I had done wrong and how to correct it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm going to treat this as a test of your willingness to be objective. You are more than welcome to prove me wrong by finding 2 or 3 of of the voat pages referencing evidence about those code words.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you're objective you'll find some of those pages here on voat and respond with them. If you can't find them then you fail the test.

                    and those references aren't 4chan or Urban Dictionary. You can find them easily using Google's advanced search. I just looked up a few of them myself to verify.

            That's flat out wrong. All those code words exist and are used by Pedophiles to talk in code. In addition to "cheese pizza" meaning child porn the term "Buck" has a meaning for Pedophiles:

            And stop listening to the MSM. You've obviously been "disinfo"ed into thinking the code words don't exist.

            Or even that walnut sauce as prepubescent cum was wrong.

             Are you saying the video I linked is disinfo?  He seems like he does some pretty good research and doesn't at all seem like disinfo to me, just a rational analysis of pizzagate evidence.  The video is pro-pizzagate afterall.
            </p>
            <p>
             What he says in that video is that those terms weren't something documented by the FBI, that a random /pol/ user just said that and people ran with it.  It's entirely possible they were around and have been used and I'll check out that documentary, but do you have anything not in video form that would serve as proof for that?

              The issue is the pzzagate evidence is incredibly weak.  It's mostly speculation that is used as a basis for other speculation.  It's simply not an honest investigation and it never was.   It started from the POV of people who felt Clinton was horrible and must be destroyed. It was started by dedicated enemies of Clinton and Podesta who went hunting for ammuition to be used against them.  And they didn't care if they had to distort what was in the emails or lie about them.  There's simply no honest reading of the emails that gets you pedophilia-Satanism-cannibalism-trafficking, etc. So you have to change the meaning of the emails and come up with some code to make them seem sinister.
             </p>
             <p>
              In this way provocative performance art by an internationally acclaimed artist became Satanism.  In this way a pretty boring set of emails becomes the fodder for other people's paranoid fantasies.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you really want to look into this, put all the Pizzagate stuff out of your head and read all the emails, one after another and see if they seem spooky to you.  Then you'll see how much effort went into manufacturing this scandal.

               Most of them can't even keep their own nonsense straight. I bet this would be an interesting exercise: ask pizzagaters if they know (1) who made the dumb joke about "sacrificing a chicken to Moloch" in one of the leaked Clinton emails, and (2) what that person's political orientation/party affiliation is. I bet for the vast majority of them they won't know the answer to part 1 (or they'll get it wrong) and they'll probably guess wrong on part 2.

                I truly wonder about when people called the redditors who found most of this stuff "weaponized autism" if autism doesn't actually play a part here.  Jokes and metaphors and figures of speech all seem foreign to a lot of these folks.

              Disinfo would imply the guy is lying. But he might just be wrong. Either way the fact "those terms weren't something documented by the FBI" doesn't mean the don't exist.

              Do some more research to prove it to yourself. You might start by watching "Chicken Hawk". The word "Buck" most definitely exists and is a pedophile code word.

               Like I said, I'm going to watch that documentary, but lets be clear about one thing here:  Burden of proof lands on those making the claims.  If you're making the claims that it existed before pizzagate (with the exception of CP), then the burden is on you to provide evidence for that claim, and a documentary is not evidence.  The evidence the documentary references should be something you have at least verified to exist and should be something you have read and could reference when people ask.   How do you know the documentary itself isn't just making things up and referencing evidence that isn't real?
