<p>The more than 1,500 pages of material from the trial and appeals courts
files appear to include some sensitive material, such as logs of
air-to-ground phone calls made from the plane. These show multiple calls
to CIA headquarters, to the cell and home phones of a senior CIA official
involved in the rendition program, and to a government contractor,
DynCorp, based in Falls Church, that worked for the CIA.</p>
<p>&quot;This new evidence tells a chilling story, from the CIA\'s efforts to
disguise its illegal activities to the price it paid to ferry prisoners to
torture chambers across the world,&quot; said Cori Crider, Reprieve\'s legal
director. 
In early 2002, DynCorp hired Sportsflight on behalf of the U.S. government
to secure a plane with 10 seats and a range of nine hours for chartered
flights. Sportsflight, in turn, guaranteed Richmor 50 hours of flight time
a month, and it agreed to have a plane and crew on 12-hour standby.</p>
<p>Moss said he had an understanding with DynCorp that the company would not
be required to provide passenger manifests. &quot;This was a highly unusual
situation,&quot; he said. &quot;But I received the waivers.&quot;</p>

<p>The program saw the abduction and ‘rendering’ of detainees to CIA ‘black sites’ all over the globe. Detainees were not ‘rendered’ to the US, where they would have rights under the law. Instead, individuals were sent to places like Syria and Egypt where they could be ‘interrogated’. The CIA now maintains that the ‘extraordinary rendition’ program is no longer in operation.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice has continually argued that detainees held at these sites are outside of US and international jurisdiction and that the rendition program is not outside the law. However the DOJ and White House would like to spin things, the fact remains that rendition is completely illegal.

<p><strong>Could there be a link between CIA rendition program and a covert worldwide human trafficking network?</strong></p>
<p>The remnants of the rendition program provide the basic infrastructure for such a network.
Here we have a now defunct clandestine CIA operation to kidnap and to transport victims just about anywhere in the world. The WaPo article and the WIkileaks email show the already established working relationship between Dyncorp and the CIA with the contractor providing aircraft to the CIA for covert operations.
Large government contractors like Dyncorp are looking to make a profit off of ‘theaters of conflict’ (war zones) by providing training, equipment, personnel and services. Illegal activities are not beyond the pale since, historically, we know the CIA has been involved in drug smuggling. It’s not a stretch to that they could quickly adjust to human trafficking.
The incentive is to maximize profits or to generate new streams of income. The human trafficking ‘industry’ is estimated to be well over 100 billion dollars and by all accounts growing at an alarming rate. </p>
<p>It seems plausible that contractors like DynCorp have the means and the incentive to contribute to such a network.</p>',

             Ah, my bad. I was trying to keep it short and sweet.
            </p>
            <p>
             From the Stratfor email:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              On Aug. 12, 2003, a Gulfstream IV aircraft carrying six passengers took
off from Dulles International Airport and flew to Bangkok with fueling
stops in Cold Bay, Alaska, and Osaka, Japan.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before it returned four days later, the plane also touched down in
Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates and Ireland. As these
unusual flights happened, U.S. officials took custody of an Indonesian
terrorist, Riduan Isamuddin, who had been captured in Thailand and would
spend the next three years being shuttled among secret prisons operated by
the CIA.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This type of aircraft is suspected as being the vehicle used to transport detainees to various black sites.
