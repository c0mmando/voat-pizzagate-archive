             An email released by the State Department on Friday shows that a top Hillary Clinton aide was mostly relieved that an NBC News report which was a response to a story called "Critics blame State Department for turning a blind eye on sex abuse" wasn't "worse" when it aired on television. It took months for the State Department to suspend an organization it worked with that was singled out in the report, and it wasn't until nearly nine months later - after a host father went to prison for sexually abusing a foreign exchange student featured in the NBC News report - that it was removed from the list of sponsors. However, the State Department - under Hillary Clinton and after she left in 2013 - never apparently even publicly admitted that the sexual abuse charges had anything to do with dropping the organization, which appears to have gone defunct."

            <p>
             This is the email mentioned:
             <a href="https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_OctWeb/244/DOC_0C05789560/C05789560.pdf">
              https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_OctWeb/244/DOC_0C05789560/C05789560.pdf
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "In the email, Kevorick wrote, 'One thing to note, none of the kids mentioned the state department or usg. Only Jessica Vaughan who is at the center for immigration studies and has long been a critic (and was a former junior [Foreign Service Officer] mentioned State with incredible disdain and explicit culpability.'...
            </p>
            <p>
             "When told about the staffer's email which politicized her criticism, Jessica Vaughan mostly blew it off, but said that it strikes her as 'typical and in character.' She added, 'There has been no leadership-level interest in the exchange programs and their proper management. Nor any authentic concern about the participants. That is why the oversight is outsourced to the designated sponsor organizations, who - as a result - have near free rein to operate these programs.'
            </p>
            <p>
             "Vaughan complained that 'people in the Secretary's office would have zero idea how these programs are really run. They think it's all happy Fulbright scholars falling in love with America. It's just not an area of interest for them, regardless of crimes or other problems. Same with most members of Congress, who hear only glowing Kumbaya stories from the sponsoring organizations. No different from the au pair problems a few years back -- nothing changed until a baby was killed by a nanny who was incompetent/inexperienced.'
            </p>
            <p>
             "'I suspect that some of the more reputable outfits are doing a better job of screening participants, but I'm sure there are still some bad actors operating exchanges,' Vaughan said. 'State will ignore it until there's another scandal. They just don't like having to take responsibility for it, they aren't trained for it, it's a placeholder job for someone.'"

             "Sex slavery, hard labor: US student-exchange program revamped after abuses" by the Associated Press, May 4, 2012
            </p>
            <p>
             "The State Department announced major changes Friday to its premier student-exchange program following an investigation by The Associated Press that found widespread abuses.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The agency issued new rules for the J-1 Summer Work Travel Program, which brings more than 100,000 foreign college students to the United States each year.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The changes are the latest in a series of steps the State Department has taken to fix the program since the 2010 AP investigation. The investigation found that some participants were working in strip clubs, not always willingly, while others were put in living and working conditions they compared to indentured servitude.
            </p>
            <p>
             "In one of the worst cases of abuse, a woman told the AP she was beaten, raped and forced to work as a stripper in Detroit after being promised a job as a waitress in Virginia....
            </p>
            <p>
             "The J-1 program, created under the Fulbright-Hays Act of 1961, allows foreign college students to spend up to four months living and working in the U.S. It was meant to encourage cultural exchanges, but has become a multimillion-dollar international business.
            </p>
            <p>
             "'In recent years, the work component has too often overshadowed the core cultural component necessary for the Summer Work Travel Program to be consistent with the intent of the Fulbright-Hays Act,' the State Department said in a statement announcing the new rules.
            </p>
            <p>
             "'Also, the Department learned that criminal organizations were involving participants in incidents relating to the illegal transfer of cash, the creation of fraudulent businesses, and violations of immigration law.'"

             "State Department suspends student exchange organization in the wake of Rock Center report" by Anna Schecter, Sept. 7, 2012
            </p>
            <p>
             "San Diego-based Pacific Intercultural Exchange (P.I.E), one of the organizations highlighted in the March 14 report, was banned from participating in the State Department program.
            </p>
            <p>
             "As reported by Rock Center, P.I.E. placed a 16-year-old German exchange student in the home of a single host father, 51-year-old Craig Ley, who repeatedly sexually abused the student in his Oregon home over the course of the 2009 academic school year....
            </p>
            <p>
             "P.I.E. has vigorously fought the lawsuit, asserting that the sex between Ley and the boy was consensual.  The case is set to go to trial later this month.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Ley pleaded guilty to four counts of second-degree sex abuse in 2010 and was sentenced to five years in prison....
            </p>
            <p>
             "Despite its suspension, P.I.E is still listed as one of the 82 exchange organizations that the State Department endorses to bring students to the U-S.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The P.I.E. website still advertises student exchange and features a video of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsing the State Department exchange programs.
            </p>
            <p>
             "P.I.E President John Doty is the former Executive Director of the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel (CSIET), the trade association that lobbies on behalf of the organizations that bring students to the U.S. under the umbrella of the State Department’s 'Secondary School' exchange program.
            </p>
            <p>
             "P.I.E. did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
            </p>
            <p>
             "An employee of P.I.E. said the organization is still operating, and is communicating with the State Department in order to 'work this out.'"

             "High school foreign exchange students repeatedly placed with convicted murderer" by Anna Schecter and Kate Snow, March 16, 2012
            </p>
            <p>
             "The day after a Rock Center report on the sexual abuse of high school foreign exchange students aired, the State Department’s Inspector General issued a scathing report that challenged spokesperson Toria Nuland’s assertion to NBC News that the Department has taken the necessary steps to protect students.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The IG report said an exchange organization had for years been placing high school students in the home of a convicted murderer.  The Department did not terminate the organization from the program until a year after this information was discovered, the report said.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Some organizations that placed students in the homes of convicted felons continued for extended periods to operate as 'designated sponsors,' according to the report.  Those 'designated sponsors' are regulated by the State Department.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The report cited 118 allegations of sexual abuse or harassment of high school exchange students in 2010 and 2011.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The new report’s findings contradict Nuland’s assertion on Rock Center March 14.  She said in response to a 2009 IG report that was also critical of the high school foreign exchange program, the Department had significantly improved the oversight.
            </p>
            <p>
             "In that 2009 report, the IG recommended that the Department conduct on-site reviews of the organizations that place students with families. The most recent IG report found only 39 of 92 organizations had been reviewed.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Furthermore, the IG found 15 of the organizations did not comply with regulations. They failed to complete criminal background checks on families, resulting in teens being placed in homes of sex offenders and other felons.  Instead of shutting down or suspending the organizations as required by law, most received only a letter of reprimand."

            <p>
             "Fifty high school foreign exchange students reported being sexually abused or harassed by a host parent during the 2010-2011 school year, according to data released by the State Department in response to an NBC News probe....
            </p>
            <p>
             "NBC News found that a lack of oversight can allow sexual predators to take advantage of the program. And when sexual abuse did happen, there is evidence that the students go back to their home countries with little or no support from the exchange organizations or the State Department.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The program dates back to the 1960’s, but the Department said it only started compiling data about allegations of sexual abuse and harassment in 2009 after the Inspector General issued a scathing report on the program.

             "Critics blame State Department for turning a blind eye on sex abuse" by Anna Schecter, March 14, 2012
            </p>
            <p>
             Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy at the Washington-based research organization, Center for Immigration Studies, "says the lack of oversight and resources at the Department makes it possible for sexual predators to take advantage of the system and become host parents to foreign exchange students....
            </p>
            <p>
             "State Department staffers told NBC News that a fraction of one percent of high school foreign exchange students reported sexual harassment or abuse by a host parent for the 2010-2011 academic school year. The Department said it did not have such data in a central log of complaints until the fall of 2009....
            </p>
            <p>
             "Rock Center found more than 60 cases of alleged sexual abuse or harassment by a host parent have been reported in local news reports around the country in the last decade, a third of them resulting in convictions.
            </p>
            <p>
             "'Those are just the cases that have been reported, the rest just go home,' said Vaughan, who said she believes sex abuse of exchange students is grossly underreported because the students are especially vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
             “'They don’t speak the language or know the culture or know their rights,' she said....
            </p>
            <p>
             "Despite reforms, just this past Christmas a 16-year-old boy from Germany says he did not know what to do after he was allegedly sexually abused by his host father and did not know what to do.  In an interview to be broadcast tonight on Rock Center, he said he did not know about the State Department’s 24/7 hotline.
            </p>
            <p>
             "His mother said when she spoke to the local coordinator by phone and asked her what she should do, the coordinator told her, 'It’s up to you.'  She quickly flew to the U.S. on her own dime to retrieve her son at her own expense.  Three months later she and her son flew back to the U.S., again at their own expense, to file a police report."

             "Foreign Exchange Students Sexually Abused in Program Overseen by State Department" by Anna Schecter, March 13, 2012
            </p>
            <p>
             "In one of the most egregious cases, at least four exchange students were sexually abused over the course of two years by the same host father, even after the first victim sounded alarms.
            </p>
            <p>
             “'He said "this is American culture," and I should get used to it,' Christopher Herbon of Germany told NBC News in an exclusive interview broadcast on Rock Center.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The organization that placed them with the host father has been accused of orchestrating a cover-up to protect its reputation over the safety of the students....
            </p>
            <p>
             "In addition to Herbon, Meyer was sexually abusing other exchange students that academic year.  When one of them finally told Benevides, she alerted the police and Meyer was arrested in May, 2005.
            </p>
            <p>
             "When word got out about the arrest, Benevides said ERDT executives flew to Arkansas and told the local coordinators not to speak about the abuse.  She said at a meeting convened in Arkansas, Jones told her, 'Keep your mouth shut.'...
            </p>
            <p>
             "When asked why ERDT is still operational after a case like this, State Department spokesperson Toria Nuland said that ERDT was one of the organizations that helped the Department draft new regulations in recent years to better protect exchange students from abuse."

               I'm not sure. I think maybe the length of the post was preventing it from going through. After I broke up the material into separate, shorter posts, it went through fine.
