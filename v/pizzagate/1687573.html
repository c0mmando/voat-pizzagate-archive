             perhaps I am off herer. There is a second meeting minutes. I know one of them is from Stamford Hospital. I will go back and check. If I am off here I will delete and repost in Pizza related with Stamford Hospital removed. Thank you. If this is off I need ot update immediately. Alot of information to sort through but I got there via Stamford HOspital /Augusto Podesta connection. Perhaps these are 2 different threads??? corrections appreciated. I dont want to waste time if I am wrong...

            same deal as above. Zero dollar transaction in 5/3/1991  If it is the same Andree K (in her early 50s shoudl would have been very young at the time of these transactions.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are more.. but this is enough to show that there are some strange property transactions going on.

            Other tidbits that may or may not be of importance.

            There is a Peggy Kaminski that is a big donator to Stamford Hospital.
           </p>

            Property Formerly belonged to MIRIAUM FEIST (deceased) her name above includes Feist. ANDREE H FEIST KAMINSKY

            I did a lookup on Andree H Kaminsky / Kiselbach in the mormon records and she is shown to be out of new york and DECEASED
           </p>
           <p>
            This listing offers both last names but they died in 2006  or 2008 according to various sites. Kisselbach and Kiminsky related to the same death records of Andree H.

            If you search for Kisselbach you find Kaminsky. I am convinced they are one and the same. I looked up these names and found these she goes by both. WHY DO THE MORMON DEATH RECORDS SAY THIS PERSON DIED IN 2009???:

             My question is did the Groundskeepers or SOMEONE take Miriam Feists Property or is she a relative? I cannot find a connection.I have heard of these elits going in and usurping property from people or the Mk's taking on other identities and assets of someone. Would appreciate insight if anyone knows how to do a PROPER property search.

            Let me just re-state the meeting minutes from the attorney in relation to Andree Kaminsky and Hospital Business:
           </p>
           <p>
            Committee Chairman Trow stated for the record that the owner of the premises is someone he knows.
           </p>
           <p>
            He does not consider this to be a conflict of interest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Trow read the email from Andree Kaminsky, owner of the property to the committee.
           </p>
           <p>
            Consultant Geoff Steadman recommended that the ARC find the application consistent with the HMP provided a series of conditions are met. Mr. Steadman discussed the conditions, among them: the applicant should be required to employ Best Management Practices to ensure the work does not cause adverse impacts on environmental quality, including water quality, in the Harbor Management area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Orteli moved to find the application consistent per comments and findings as drafted by Steadman. Seconded by Commissioner Adelberg. Approved Unanimously

             On her friends list is Andree @ Singer Express!~
            </p>
            <p>
             Andree @ Singer Express has a facebook page (photo?)

             it says she is a singer/songwriter and currently lives... in New York.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is Andree's personal FB Page (need to go through)

            </p>
            <p>
             Here is Don Kisselbach - whom I understood to be Andrees Father- however in this pic, Andree's son Eli is out with Grandpa on fathers day

            </p>
            <p>
             There are several posts referring to DOn as father/son.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don Kisselbach is who made the real estate transactions to Andree Kisselbach/ Andree Kaminsky. I understood him to be her father but perhaps he is huband. Still not sure.  He would be about 20 years older than Andree. Cant figure this one out. May not be relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just trying to show the incosistencies in WHO IS ANDREE KISSELBACH/ANDREE KAMINSKY and why do that have so many aliases, business names, home addresses, real estate deal transfers at ZERO dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
             AND WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH STAMFORD HOSPITAL???
            </p>
            <p>
             THEY PAY FOR HER REMODEL FOR HER BUSINESS ADDRESs/PRIVATE RESIDENCE.
            </p>
            <p>
             A NEW BASEMENT. A NEW CLOSET. A NEW DECK. CLEARING OF OLD BASEMENT AND EXCAVATION UNDER THE HOUSE.
            </p>
            <p>
             3 Weed Circle is used for "talent Management" and film and video production. It is 11 minutes form Stramford Hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             THe lawyer on the board of directors vouched that he knows her and "it wasnt a conflict of interest" for the hospital to pay for the construction.
            </p>
            <p>
             The list of people who work for Singer Express &amp; Fretless Production have SERIOUS corporate backgrounds at a high level. Why would all these people be involved with a kid talent/movie making business (that only lists 140k a year revenue) at a small private home financed by Stamford Hospital? Can someone help me answer this question?
            </p>
            <p>
             Am I off here? this is just too much going on to ignore but if it seems worthless to you let me know.
