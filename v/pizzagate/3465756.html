            Well squidfiddler, since you didn't bother to edit in the link, I have to remove this per Rule 2. Please repost in a manner that satisfies our submission rules if you desire. This is an important topic.

            In the late 80's in Canada there was something similar in Canadian public schools including fingerprints and a small video recording of the child.  Looking back my brother pointed out how it was likely a shopping list for pedos

            , can you add a link describing this LifeTouch program? We require at least one link for each submission. Otherwise, I'll have to remove this per Rule 2, which I really think is not optimal. I'd rather give this our "Share!" flair.
           </p>
           <p>
            For now, I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. Here's a link:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://lifetouch.com/privacy/">
             https://lifetouch.com/privacy/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            You also might want to quote their policy regarding this program:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             What is the SmileSafe® child safety program? Do you share photos with law enforcement?
            </p>
            <p>
             Lifetouch does not share its photographs with law enforcement unless a parent or guardian has expressly requested us do so in accordance with our SmileSafe child safety program or on an exceptional basis pursuant to legal process. Lifetouch provides two complimentary SmileSafe photo ID cards annually to the families of each PreK-12 student photographed in participating schools, at no extra cost and regardless of whether the family has purchased photographs. We work in collaboration with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the United States’ leading experts in child protection. If a child is missing, the parent or guardian of that child can request through NCMEC that a Lifetouch photograph of their child be provided to aid search efforts. Lifetouch will respond on a 24/7 basis to aid search efforts. This private, secured system requires parent permission and law enforcement verification, or the receipt of legal process, prior to image release by Lifetouch. Once released, the images can help authorities start an accurate, on-site search. Parents or guardians have complete control over whether or not to initiate sharing a child’s SmileSafe image with law enforcement. As of the date this Policy was last updated, Lifetouch has assisted with more than 2,000 searches and has contributed to the successful recovery of 56 children from 24 states as a direct result of the SmileSafe child safety program.

             Maybe they don't share with Law Enforcement but they are collecting data without permission and building a list of children in public school complete with a photograph and physical address that could possibly be shared with non law enforcement in the future or even hacked for nefarious purposes. The point is, I did not sign up for this. All I did was fill out a school order form with a pen, and I sent it back with $13.00 in cash to purchase $12.99 worth of photographs. All offline. Now she has a digital profile that she did not agree to(she's only 5) but I didn't either. So I called and asked that she be removed entirely from their database and any that they shared with and was told that they didn't know how to do that and that I would hear from corporate in a couple of days. Still waiting on corporate.

             Those fucking sheep fools.  They were registering their own kids into a custom order child snatching operation and could track them through the supply lines.  When was the last time anyone heard of NCMEC doing anything good for children other than letting Laura Silsby, child-trafficker friend of the Clintons, change her name and (supposed) supervise the Amber Alert program?

               It's the "child exchange".  I bet they know where 80 percent of the kids are, or at least what pedo ring or cult or satan worshippers likely snatched or bought the child.

            To add historic info, back in "the day", MSM outlets used to get copies of high school yearbooks. This way when someone committed a crime and the MSM had no photo available to show, they simply figured out what high school the person went to and used that photo on the news. Probably still goes on, but seems that they've gone to the absolute youngest school age now.

              I remember them doing this all through elementary school for their photos. I don't remember it for middle school, but could have been done, I just don't remember. For high school, my boys did online high school from home.

              I honestly didn't think anything of it at the time because I wasn't "awake" back then.

              Your library, school district and local co-op can provide you with everything you need, especially at that age.  Most homeschool parents work full time FWIW.  Other homeschoolers are very supportive and helpful, if it comes to childcare.  You would be surprised.

                As I said, most who do it also work full time.  Ir may not be the easiest, but it's doable.  The actual schooling takes about w hrs a day, and can be dine at your convenience or on your schedule.  And homeschoolers are always happy to help each other out.

              Homeschooling doesn't cost a lot of money.  If you need help I can find you tons of resources.  However, if you are a single parent and or refuse/can not cut expenses back further I understand.  I can even help you find work at home employment if you are a single parent.  Most people don't care enough to look outside the box to fix things, they just butt heads with a brick wall.

               <p>
                With all of these resources you can find a work at home job and educate your child for free or nearly free.  I don't even budget homeschooling expenses anymore.  The kids never need school clothes, no picture expenses, and certainly no "fitting in" problems.  Plus they love hanging with mom and I can ensure they get an hour outdoors everyday.
