<p>So...looking at State Department site on human trafficking and really nothing there for Belgium...but did run across these stats for comparison when looking at arrests ALREADY in 2017...from US State Department website here <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2015/243559.htm">https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2015/243559.htm</a></p>
<p>&quot;The federal government reports its law enforcement data by fiscal year (October 1 through September 30). In FY 2014, DHS’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported opening 987 investigations possibly involving human trafficking, a decrease from 1,025 in FY 2013. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) formally opened 835 human trafficking investigations, an increase from 734 in FY 2013, and DOJ’s ECM taskforces initiated 1,083 investigations. The Department of State (DOS) reported opening 154 human trafficking-related cases worldwide during FY 2014, a decrease from 159 in FY 2013. The Department of Defense (DoD) reported investigating 14 human trafficking-related cases involving military personnel, an increase from nine in FY 2013.</p>
<p>DOJ prosecutes human trafficking cases through the 94 U.S. Attorney’s Offices (USAOs) and the two specialized units that serve as DOJ’s nationwide subject-matter experts. Taken together, DOJ initiated a total of 208 federal human trafficking prosecutions in FY 2014, charging 335 defendants. Of these prosecutions, 190 involved predominantly sex trafficking and 18 involved predominantly labor trafficking, although some involved both. These figures represent an increase from FY 2013, during which DOJ brought 161 prosecutions charging 253 defendants.</p>
<p>During FY 2014, DOJ secured convictions against 184 traffickers, compared with 174 convictions obtained in FY 2013. Of these, 157 involved predominantly sex trafficking and 27 involved predominantly labor trafficking, although several involved both. These totals do not include child sex trafficking cases brought under non-trafficking statutes. Penalties imposed on convicted traffickers ranged from five years to life imprisonment. For the first time, the government used an extraterritorial jurisdiction provision of the law to convict a trafficker for sex trafficking that took place in another country.&quot;</p>',

            I like your point that it is suspicious that Belgium is one country that we do not spy on.  I always associate Holland with pedophilia because of lax laws, but things may have moved to Belgium and we would have no way of knowing about it.  I upvoated your post.  That information could be very pertinent in the future.

            Your title isn't exactly inaccurate.  You do mention Belgium, and you certainly state many stats.    I just have no idea what your point is.   Can you spell it out in one or two sentences?
