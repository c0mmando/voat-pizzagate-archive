<p>Just like they covered up pizzagate they are covering up this entire virus. I\'ve seen it get worse day by day, and now it has hit both America and Europe. I can no longer be quiet about it. I found and uploaded every leak I could of the outbreak and it\'s not looking good. I got a horrific feeling about this. You think the pedophilia in the world is bad right now? Imagine the horrific crimes against children during a global pandemic. </p>
<p>There is a Reddit sub that was put up that has leaks from what\'s going on. It\'s called China_Flu. I suggest following it. It\'s where I got all the leaks from. I\'m putting them all together day by day and now feel like I have to warn many of you who I\'ve come to see as friends on this sub.</p>

<p>Bill Gates &quot;Gates Foundation&quot; &quot;predicted&quot; the Coronavirus outbreak. They planned this. In the simulation 33 million people died in the first six months. 33 million. 33 is the masonic number.</p>

             Do we know the ages of the people that died? Were  these people at risk to begin with? All the panic over SARS and it died down. I wish Schiff and Trump and Schumer would shut up and let us know about this virus. Hours and hours of talking and photo ops while people are falling over dying. This is frightening.

               Yes I just read that. I am now wondering if they will pump up the numbers. But will ever know the real truth? They are masters at lying.

               Just like the deaths from the flu. Many are from at risk babies and elderly or people with other serious diseases.  For what? To frighten people to run for their shots.

              They hired older crisis actors because the younger ones can only play brain dead. They need them to stop moving before the camera's can control the narrative.

            It scared the hell out of me since hearing about it. I have a arched news reports and immediately I felt there was more than they are telling us. 800 in China? Bleeping lie. They are building. hospital there with 1K beds to be done in a week. They are in panic mode I believe. But it’s a lot worse as you say. Why did they not close Chona down and refuse flights out and arrivals. CDC will make plenty off this dive they sell meds etc. Not to mention people like Gates  and GSK..  Mope they aren’t fooling me one minute. Yeah WHO what have you gotten to say? They just love killing us and our offsprings omg. Bleep them.
