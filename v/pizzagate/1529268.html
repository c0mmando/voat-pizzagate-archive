<p>&quot;The violent themes characteristic of Serbian artist Biljana [Djurdjevic]\'s works reflect her development as an artist during the horror-stricken 1990s – a decade when violence in her country peaked following the collapse of the communist regime in Eastern Europe. [Djurdjevic] belongs to the young generation of Serbian artists who experienced the political disintegration of Yugoslavia and Serbia\'s isolation under the rule of Slobodan Miloševic. The works of these artists bespeak a spirit of protest against Miloševic\'s tyrannical regime, and respond in a satirical, critical manner to the horrors of war and waves of violence brought on by outbreaks of nationalist and chauvinistic sentiments. The body of works included in this exhibition features a selection from several series created by [Djurdjevic] between the years 1999 and 2007 – series in which she gazes directly into the darkest abysses of the human soul.&quot;(<a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Biljana_Djurdjevic#Role_at_.23Pizzagate">Link</a>)</p>
