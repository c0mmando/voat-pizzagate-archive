<p>The 1603 Grant Program was designed to award up to $25 billion in taxpayer dollars to renewable energy development
projects of which First Wind received $778 million of that taxpayer money.  First Wind has had ongoing structural and mechanical
failures. It’s as if their entire business model was focused on accessing the 1603 Grant money
and nothing else.  According to the Boston Globe, investors shied away from the company
because “First Wind owes more than $500 million, loses money on a steady basis, and reports
a negative cash flow.”  
</p>
<p>A House Oversight Committee Report of March 20, 2012  criticised the  company executives for lining their pockets before filing for bankruptcy in MA. First Wind  is identified as S&amp;P “Junk” rated.”</p>
<p>Larry Summers was Obama’s Chief of the National Economic Council;  was a leading voice within the Clinton Administration; appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs and later in the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton
Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. Summers was hired as a part-
time managing director of the New York-based hedge fund D. E. Shaw for which he received
$5 million in salary and other compensation.”  DE Shaw was the majority owner of First Wind.
Madison Dearborn Partners and its employees were the No. 2 donor to Rahm Emanuel\'s
campaign. Dearborn Partners was the second largest owner of First Wind.</p>
<p>When Larry Summers and Rahm Emanuel needed to find a way to dump their
company\'s toxic assets onto another emerging company  SunEdison came to the rescue. it became quickly
obvious that Sunedison had taken on too much debt in the acquisition and they were unable to
pay the full amount. One year later DE Shaw and Dearborn Partners filed a lawsuit against
Sunedison.  DE Shaw and Dearborn were major shareholders in First Wind, and Summers and Emanuel were the people behind Shaw and Dearborn.</p>
<p>Basically Shaw and Emanuel sold a dud company they were trying to offload. The company was losing millions and had huge debts it could not repay.  Shaw and Emanuel sold to SunEdison and got paid millions.  Then, when SunEdison couldn\'t repay the debts, Shaw and Emanuel sued SunEdison.</p>
<p>As soon as SunEdison had acquired white elephant Wind, it set about acquiring another: Vivint. Vivint had previously been acquired by Blackstone\'s TERP. In less than two years after Blackstone had acquired the company the share price had dropped by $8. Noone can work out how $2.2 billion dollars was paid for Vivint when its value was $560million. SunEdison went down quickly thereafter.</p>
<p>From 2009 until 2012, Heather Podesta served as lobbyist for Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), and she\'s been
lobbying on behalf of Brookfield Power  since 2011. During this time Larry Summers has also held a position as a
distinguished senior fellow at John Podesta’s CAP.  Sunedison paid over 100k to the Podesta Group for lobbying efforts. Another close connection to John Podesta can be found in the communications he had with Cathy Zoi (head
of Sunedison’s Rural Electric Division). There is another wikileak in which Podesta is
being asked to have a phone conversation with Ahmad Chatila weeks before the First
Wind acquisition.</p>
<p>Sunedison was used as a dumping ground for debt while all of the real assets (First Wind, etc) can be found in TERP which was spun off less than two years before Sunedison bankruptcy. </p>

            "The study showed that psychopaths have reduced connections between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the part of the brain responsible for sentiments such as empathy and guilt, and the amygdala, which mediates fear and anxiety."
           </p>
           <p>
            That sums it all up right there. All I thought of the first three months was how do these people seem so impervious to emotion. I was practically dry heaving at times. It was fucking horrible.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think what's going on is a psychopath relies on their lower brain stem way more than normal because they weren't born with all the bells and whistles. The brain has two parts, the limbic system or reptilian brain and the neo-cortex where all higher more complex thought occurs. An artist will have all the neo-cortex and then some. The empathy center of an artists brain is probably the size of a grapefruit where the psychopath's got one the size of a grape seed.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the artists go through life and see people suffering and are so overwhelmed they write "Les Miserables" or "Hamlet" or "War and Peace" just so they can stay sane while seeing the sordid human condition in all its depraved glory.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the psychopath sees the same anguish and suffering of their fellow man and it barely registers. An alligator would probably pick up more of the human suffering walking through Spanish Harlem or Bedford-Stuyvesant* than a psychopath would. It's fucking hysterical. Oy-veh

            It's examples like this that make me think the least painful way to bring the cluster fuck down is granting immunity to all participants in exchange for the Truth. To guarantee you'd get everything you'd have to put in a clause that says:
           </p>
           <p>
            "You're immune from prosecution for anything confessed between starting date X and ending date Y. Anything that comes out after no matter by whom if it proved  you lied or withheld information then the immunity is voided."
           </p>
           <p>
            I think ex-CIA Robert David Steele suggested this already, grant full immunity for everything. Anything less and the deal's off. That way we the people can get our heads around what happened. Immunity is starting to look like the only way we can guarantee:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) No perp decides to check out of life early rather than deal with the temporary change of address. Watching anyone off themselves is hard to watch and it doesn't matter their guilt or innocence or even what crime they committed.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) The country can recover from the sucking chest wound we've been carrying around for at least the past 30 years but never knew it. Yeah everyone could hear it and smell it and follow the trail of blood but no one ever found where it was. Now we know what happened but unless we find all the bullet entry wounds within our soul we're just going to get sick again.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) The last time America had a "sucking chest wound" 500,000 people died, more than died in any other American war combined.
           </p>
           <p>
            O_O
           </p>
          </p>
