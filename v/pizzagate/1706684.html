Interesting tweet from one of the stars of the hilarious political satire about Capitol Hill.

            Close to the Bone  or the fact it had terrible ratings?
           </p>
           <p>
            BrainDead debuted to a disappointing 4.6 million viewers and 0.7 demo rating, and after four Monday airings got bumped to Sunday nights; its final hour did barely 2 mil and a 0.3.
           </p>
           <p>
            I, for one, never heard of this show and I do like Tony Shaloub.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the reviews, of the top critics on Rotten Tomatoes  54% liked it.   Not good numbers all around.

             For the record 70% of the top critics on Rotten Tomatoes liked it, and the audience score was 91%. It was never going to be prime time pap because of the bizarre subject matter, and it's numbers for a summer Sunday 10 o'clock timeslot were fine for a challenging piece of work. For someone who has never even heard of the show to fabricate statistics about it is  laughable.

              I fabricated nothing.  Right now as I look at Rotten tomatoes.  64% of all critics liked it, but only 54% of top critics.

              This is not a highly reviewed show.
Average Rating: 6.21/10
Season Reviews: 45
Fresh: 29
Rotten: 16
             </p>
             <p>
              The 91% of audience likes is irrelevant to the network, given that it had such a tiny audience.

            It was brilliant and it got really good reviews as well didn't it? So that is definitely weird they would cancel it. I have been seeing this kind of parallel in TV shows recently, Braindead was one, Westworld another, House of Cards etc. But braindead was interesting because the politicians were all compeltely controlled by alien bugs - they had literally lost parts of their brains and were complete puppets, which it seems is a close analogy to what is really going on.

            Maybe.  I thought it was really crappy acting and relied on a gimmick, but I could only sit through few episodes before losing interest. Brainwashing of politicians by ants is going the reptilian route rather than extortion by sex crimes.

            The ants in their brains...metaphor for corruption? Yeah, maybe. But unfortunately the acting was pretty poor. I did watch season one during the election. It was on Hulu.

            Thanks for this. It really does strike me as related, good catch. Much like the many pedophile related articles that were removed after pizzagate first came to light. Namely, the Norway busts, Salon's 'have some compassion for pedos' pieces, and others. The timing can't be ignored.
