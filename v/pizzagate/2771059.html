            Let's hope they do not reduce his sentence for some stupid reason or another.  Or to protect him.  I hope to God he rots in his cell.

            OMG, what a scumbag degenerate. In another article, it said that he'd been doing this for decades and was a serial child pornographer. I don't understand. Then if he'd done this for decades, why was he out and about? Did they want to make sure he destroyed other children's lives?

             This is what occurred to me as well.  Wat is their purpose. Do they not know?  Of course they do.  I also think they want the crimes to continue. Yes.  Scumbags.

               There plan is to screw them up any way they can.  Physically and Medically and Mentally.  Anything goes as long as they reach their goal.  Keep any eye on your kids people.  Keep them safe and if at all possible NO Vaccines.

                The Devil (referred to as the 'Thief' in the Bible) and those who do his bidding:-

                <em>
                 John Ch 10 vs 10 says:- The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.

                They are doing what the servants of the Devil do, kill, steal and destroy lives, especially innocent lives, the more evil the better to these sickos.  This is their fate:-
                <strong>
                 Revelation ch 20 vs 10 - And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

                 Yes, what a great description. Kill steal and destroy.  It seems that is their mantra.  Sounds like a great beginning for a meme.  Also the quote from revelations.  These make great meme messages.  We should use the verses from the bible and hit them with those words in the worst way.  Here's a good one.  Start it with your Where they go and put it with the beast, fire and brimstone.  We need to call them out on their evil and devilish murderous SRA.

                  I would if I could, I tried to make a meme last week for the first time, (it was a full pic of prison cells and on the top headline it said:
                  <strong>
                   DEMONRATS
                  </strong>
                  then below it said:
                  <strong>
                   Where THEY go 1 THEY go all
                  </strong>
                  It took me hours and it looked silly! I sent it via email to srayzie suggesting if she could make it better. Please ANYONE feel free to make a meme with these scriptures/these wordings. I wish I could.

                Although I did get a burst of hope by entylawyer and Q saying the same thing about arrests. I am not fans of either of them (although I recognize enty has been right at times). But I remain in the waiting to see it to believe it position. But I was really surprised that FOX News pretty much summed up the Russian collusion story. Never heard that broadcast before and put so succinctly.

                 I would love to believe all these things will happen, but some of them have not and yes I am a believer of enty too but have to say that not much of that has happened either.  Exposure Exposure but No Action.  It is Frustrating.  In the meantime I believe the waking up of the people is very important.  When I started almost 2 yrs ago we had only about 7K members and now we ave over 20K.  Some have left and they are waking others.  I truly believe people will be rising up soon.  Memes Tweets and Posts.  It's what has worked up until now.  If we wait for others it will never happen, imo.

                  Well, I think that broadcast did it for me. Above all, hearing that stated so clearly for me means that the awakening is more than started. If that had aired a year ago, there would have been such a backlash, but now? People listened. Now it was on FOX News, but still ... definitely starting. And I do understand the need for pieces to be in place. It's why Schumer's blocked so many judges from being appointed, and I'm not talking about Kavanaugh. They need those judges. God! I just had a thought ... wouldn't it be wonderful if California went red? Imagine if John Cox were governor? Now he's the guy I thought enty was referring to. Someone did a timeline and the years matched pretty closely to what was said. Anyway, fingers crossed. If politicians like Graham and Scalise, and all the rest can put themselves on the line like they're doing, we can keep posting and keep the momentum going.

                   California has a few places that are fighting back. I am somewhat surprised.  Hopefully there are changes.  I read something about Kamala Harris taking on the character of a priest and hiding some sexual abuse that she did not want to be exposed.  It's bad enough we have the RCC hiding priests, now we have pols doing the same.

                    Yeah, she did do that and got blasted in the papers for it ... at the time, of course. Papers used to print the news and not act as propagandists for this elite scum. SFWeekly called it a "Secrecy Fetish", and I believe that description fits. We need to keep hammering this point of her hiding these records from the press.

                    And I meant to tell you that that satanist I've been following has been going crazy nuts over Kavanaugh. Really playing it up big. The satanists have always been a part of this. Look what Aquino allegedly did to those kids. It's identical to what is being reported now in terms of underground tunnels and adults wearing masks. The kids even contracted STDs and they still weren't believed which leads me to another point. Do you remember those clown sightings that were taking place a couple of years ago? Well, this satanist is now blaming and floating the theory that CHILDREN MADE IT UP! Yup, that's what they did when kids were reporting the sexual abuse. They even invented a term for it, and they're now kicking it up again even though adults saw the clowns and a clown was even captured on security cam footage standing on a home owner's porch in the middle of the night while they were sleeping!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And I thought of something else. It's this: the court decisions that have expanded satanic rights while destroying christian rights are the payoff for the satansts doing a good job of messing things up. So the christians are thrown out of schools and government buildings, but now the satanists can teach, recruit, and lie about theirs to a bunch of impressionable kids? Has to be the elite are paying them for a job well done. After all, it was always pizzagate's contention that the pedo elite had aligned with thugs like MS13 satanists and it's proving true.

                     I agree.  Yes, the Satanic Clubs are now allowed due to us allowing the ROTC.  They are passing out booklets to young children under the guise of a Club like the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.  I am hoping parents are smart enough to attack them and protest their existence.  Keep your kids home after school.  Keep them away from their brain washing.

                        Parents do everything to ensure their children's safety and happiness, and these buzzards do everything to ensure their downfall and fall from grace. We can't let that happen. Before it was all under the surface, and when there was a ripple of media attention, the kids were lying even though they contracted STDs. The monsters made up a fake psychological condition and the assault on our children continue unabated. It was a concerted effort, but through those emails it was revealed. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to those being leaked.

                         I agree we have to keep waking people up to the emails as well as everything else.  Many have not even read one of them imo.  I will never in my mind understand how people believe those sick lying adults over Innocent Little Children.  I will from now on blast anyone that stands up for those liars.  I will make a point of it.  Imo, they started all of these snap chats and other sites for kids so they can now say that they know about all these sexual things, where as before they had no inkling.  Now they can say with Soc. Media they are privy to all and can make up lies.  Makes me sick.

                          Very true. They can also say the same thing about the sex/gender education that little tiny children are forced to attend. They're taught EVERYTHING. It's in their knowledge base and arsenal to concoct a lie.

                           Sorry for the rant.  I just felt this was so important.  It is happening in all religions not just the Catholic Religion.

                           Exactly.  I have no problem with children of a certain age learning certain things, but they are starting WAY to young.  And they type of info is horrid as well.  Teaching a girl and boy how they can make a baby is very important.  They need to know in case they do try, but they also need to be taught the responsibilities that come along with that and this does not need to be taught at the age of 5.  They have and are sexualizing Our Children before they even are old enough to make their Holy Communion.  I learned something very interesting just recently.  The Sacrament of Baptism   which is a type of exorcism of Satan.  In here it tells how the prayer was changed with a slight of hand.  You should read the whole description of the Baptism and you will realize how it has changed and why.  I truly believe that they have exposed Our Children to Satan.  Read how another religion has also changed theirs.

                            http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2014/09/10/traditional-catholic-baptism-has-more-exorcisms-than-new-rite/
                           </a>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           In the Latin Baptism the priest then breathes three times on the child in the form of a cross saying; “Depart from him unclean spirit and give place to the Holy Spirit, the Consoler”.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           While the priest does the “Imposition of Hands”, there is the prayer; “Free him from the snares of Satan which until now have held him.”
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Then comes the part that is called The Exorcism were the priest starts “I exorcise you, unclean spirit“.  The prayer goes on to say; “Come forth, depart from this servant of God, for He Commands you, accursed and damned spirit…” “Therefore accursed devil, acknowledge your condemnation and pay homage to the true and living God…. depart from this servant of God..”
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The priest then makes a Sign of the Cross on the forehead of the child saying; “Accursed devil, never dare to desecrate this sign of the holy cross which we are tracing upon his forehead…”
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Once inside the church comes The Solemn Exorcism, the priest says; “I exorcise every unclean spirit” (with three signs of the cross in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit) “that you may depart from this creature of God”.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Then comes the Renunciation of Satan, that is almost identical to what is done in the New Baptismal right.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The Exorcism Prayer in the New Baptismal Rite is this prayer; “Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness, and bring him into the splendor of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). We ask this through Christ our Lord.”
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           It is evident that there is a description of the power of satan,
                           <strong>
                            but there is no exorcism prayer that directly commands the devil to depart from the child
                           </strong>
                           like the multiple times it is found in the Traditional Latin Baptism.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           We traditional Catholics are so blessed to have such powerful prayers of exorcisms in the Latin Baptism. As you probably know, the ANGLICAN CHURCH  has even removed the word “satan” our of their newly evolved Baptism Rite. “Claiming that the traditional rejection of the devil and all rebellion against God ‘put off people who are offended to be addressed as sinners,’ clergy claimed that they found it much easier to ask parents and godparents to make vows that do not mention Satan.”

                             YW.  I just want people to realize that this is not only about the RCC.  They are all doing it.  Here is the clincher.  If they are so intent on keeping Our Children from being protected from satan, well  maybe They Know.  They know that satan is real.  They are working at convincing everyone that he is not.  Remember francis just said there is no heaven or hell.  Hmm.  They are working on Changing the Teachings of the Church that have been in effect for thousands of years. Whatever your religion make sure you practice the older version.

                              Yup. They are taking God away from us. And by perverting the truth, they will have us worshipping Satan. Remember, Satan is the absence of hope and perpetual suffering and that is what they're offering.

                               AND if others think that the RCC is the only one being affected well, you are all in for a Big Surprise.  It's happening to All Religions.  I have a statue of Mary in my home and when my parents leave this earth I will get a statue of the Holy Family.  I know that some think they are hokey but I don't care.  I never force My Love of God on others.  But having them lately has given me a warm and fuzzy feeling.  I feel more protected.  Saying my Prayer to Michael the Archangel also does the same. It exorcises the devil.  I have stepped up my prayers and it is a Good Feeling.

                                I should say that I RT'd this horrendous crime. One of my followers, somebody I've known for a long time, got back to me and said that her baby sister was raped at the age of TWO! This is so very real. She asked me what she could do and I suggested she either find a pizzagate forum or follow someone that is a pizzagater. It's a good way of staying on top of the news and learning all about the insidious agenda to normalize this perverted crime.

                                 What a horrid thing to have to live with, as a Victim and family.  I hope the whole family is supporting her.  Some feel ashamed and just want them to forget it.  It takes such Courage to speak out about it.  But it helps them so much.  It frees them from the guilt so many feel.  SNAP has a blog.  It is a very good one.  StcharlesSeminary recommends it.

                                 I agree.  I have not been walking which I always used to do, but I am on here almost all day on and off.  No time.  But I just started.  Half hour every day.  Yes, it is refreshing and it clears the mind.  There is power in prayer.  My friend just started praying again and she feels better too.  Just one prayer a day.

                                    Yes. I keep meaning to post something on how it's effectively used by Satanists. It's why everything is done in a ritual format with lots of participants. And even when there are serial killings, like Son of Sam and Zodiac, you'll notice that there were always rumors that the murders were filmed. No doubt.

                                     I too believe many of those serial killings were tied to others and that is why they are locked up, many of them in solitary.  Filmed and sold to High Level pedos.  I believe there is so much of this going on, the SRA, that people would be horrified at the numbers.  I just read a long 3 part story about a murdered priest, and Malachi Martin knew him and said it was satanic in nature. It is the 20 yr. anniv. of his death.

                                      Maury Terry also really tried to get the word out by connecting the dots. Now the Blue Mob has these psychopaths on their team. They are working together to destroy our children and America. And thanks to the Satanic element, there are a lot of broken children running around, acting out because they don't quite remember what happened to them, but they know they're not the same. Abuse alienates you, it makes you feel different. They feel they don't fit in with the "good" so they seek out and join the very people that molested them and made them that way.

                                       Those Children are in a kind of purgatory on earth.  They are caught in the middle.  We have to open our arms to them.  They have to know that we will help them and cast them out.  I can't believe that so many in the families of the abused are still shamed, as if it is their fault and an embarrassment.  They should be there for them.  Yes the evil ones know exactly what they are doing.  They know the abused are caught in the middle, the devil who you know kind of analogy.

                                        Absolutely. Families need to be counseled on what really went on and what the child needs. You don't want to victimize them further, but neither do you want them to think of themselves as a victim. They were victimized and are not a victim -- if you know what I mean.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        I think the shame of having it happen was a major reason for keeping it a secret and hiding what went on. The new freedom of talking about things is good, but we're still taking baby steps because we're not addressing the concerted, coordinated effort to molest our children. It's the agenda I'm worried about. Unless that is exposed, gotten rid of by jail time, and the leadership disbanded, children will continue to suffer.

                                         I agree.  Their concerted effort towards their agenda is extremely dangerous.  So many don't think people can be that evil and will not  believe it.  That is the same lie they are hoping for to continue.  It is in the same vein as the lie about the devil.  That he doesn't exist either.  I went to lunch with a friend and she doesn't believe in the devil either.  I will not push it, for she is such a kind person and has helped so many.  I have become more understanding now after realizing how we have been lied to for so many decades by elites and our faithful.  I no longer push my faith or ideals on others.  I suggest but never push

                                          Arguing raises resistance as does arguing. Once you starter arguing, the walls are up and they'll defend their position. Better just to let them know what you think/believe and let it sink in and process.

                                           The primary is what did it for me.  Seth Rich's death following what the Dems did to Bernie in Philly was a huge shock for all of us that went.  They took a poll before the vote and that is illegal.  In other words, they threw the John Robert's Rules out the window. That was when I realized that Freedom Rang No More.
