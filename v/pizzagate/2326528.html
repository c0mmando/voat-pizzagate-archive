            The worst part of child sexual abuse is the shame that goes along with it, that's why it's so destructive.  If you are abused, the abuse is fairly normal to you, it doesn't really set in until later in life. You have love, first sexual pleasure and often fear and pain all mixed in. Something that isn't talked about is the child victim will sometimes idolize the perpetrator which leads to more guilt later in life, any pleasure that was felt is a source of shame years later and wires the victim's brain to associate things the wrong way. I agree that sex is powerful and it's a complicated exchange that children are not even close to being able to process until much later in life.

            This article alludes to it, but my experience is that there are inter-dimensional entities that can enter you, implant you, etc., through trauma, especially sexual trauma.
The energy of traumatic experiences, struggle, or heart-centered love can then be siphoned off by those entities. We ARE batteries. Children are targeted to continue the cycle of abuse, by fragmenting their psyches/souls. Children also have the strongest energy fields, before this fragmenting happens. So it is a win-win for those entities. 
This sounds fantastical but I know it to be very real. We are not the top of the food chain, so to speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stay heart-centered. It is the only way through this minefield.

            Trauma can be described as a horrifying discovery that the world/reality is not what you thought it was. I’ve never understood pedophelia and assumed it meant that someone looking at a little baby giggling wrapped in a bath towel was somehow sexually arousing. Well how could a normal person “understand that?” But my tiny little half-hearted attempts to understand the heart of the pedophelia charges coming our way (so I believe) fell right into the wood chipper when I seem to have grazed just the edges of the problem. It was traumatic for me because yeah it means the world is not what it seems.
           </p>
           <p>
            The audio clip I heard was of a man terrorizing a screaming child in a calculated manner to break the child’s mind, shatter the soul, destroy the child without technically stopping the heart beat or pulse by revealing to the child a kind of evil I didn’t know existed. I’ve been around a long time and just never heard anything so horrific. It’s less about leering at a little pudgy baby body with cupcake in it’s hair and fingers and more about a satanic urge to be the one in control and to terrorize a child to death and enjoy every minute of it. The innocence and helplessness of the child is the real prey and sexual abuse is but one tool to slay the soul.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suddenly the Podesta art collections make sense if one considers the hollow dead look in the eyes of the children depicted. One understands that only fiends like looking of pictures of children whose eyes reflect the absence of their souls . Absent, I believe, because God in heaven was witness to what the pedophile torturers were doing to these children and He would not make their souls remain present with such evil. I believe God allowed the souls of the tortured children to flee to Him leaving the child torturers with the hollow eyed vacant stares of children. Fiends in the government and in elite circles (Royalty, Hollywood etc.) around the world then love to capture the soul-death of child victims in paintings and sculptures and hang them on the walls of their houses with pride. This is sociopathy. Sociopathy is the antiseptic word “scientists” used to describe profane evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony Podesta has a replica of one of Jeffry Dahmer’s victims of which he is most proud. It’s like one murdering soul admiring the handiwork of another.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will start praying for a means by which we as a country can take hold of the truth because if we don’t, the children remain prey and the fiends continue to harvest them. If the weird cackling Podestas were the only type of person/fiend combination I could see the path through it all. But we, I believe, will discover that many many icons we hear about and read about everyday will be revealed as fiends.

            Pedophiles are NOT the only sexual offenders who are aroused by "domination" and their own violence against victims.
This is often true of heterosexual males watching the sexual abuse of adult females in pornography on the internet.'
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Pornography consumption -- both violent and non-violent -- is associated 
with verbal and physical sexual aggression."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The creation of pornography is an organized industry, for profit, based in exploitation of women.
Pornography is basically made to teach males to disrespect females and to encourage violence against them.
Pornography is basically organized propaganda against females -- to debase and demean them and to make
them seem only worthy of abuse by males.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY?  One of the major reasons is to continue the oppression of females for the benefit of Elite patriarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The oppression of females makes children more vulnerable
            </strong>
            and more likely to be exploited by males.
Males are our sexual abusers of children.  And they are heterosexual males.
Heterosexual males are 100X MORE likely to sexually abuse a child according to studies.

              Catholic nuns were helping Catholic priests sexually abuse children.  These nuns were also 
sexually abusing children.  Meanwhile, 40% of those nuns were being sexually and physically
abused by Catholic priests.

            Satan is ramping up his efforts to destroy children and he will do it through any man, woman and opportunity he can find. But God is calling all adults who care to ramp up their efforts too in protecting kids.  CHILD Sexual Abuse is so destructive because it Steals the Soul of the Child.

             I never thought about it stealing the soul of the child before, but that is so true. Now I understand the verse in Revelation 18 where it talks about the international traders of the world in the end times selling "bodies and souls" of people. I always understood how bodies could be traded, but not souls. But now it makes more sense after you said that.

              I don't go to church anymore but still pray.  I have not thought about Satan for years, but that is because I did not realize what evil is in this world, until now.   These Sick Demented and Perverted Disciples of Satan are truly taking the lives literally and soulfully of our children and their and our future.  We are in the Fight of Our Lives.

                I'm up to the challenge and so are our members.  I know many others are too, we just have to make them aware how serious this is.  I don't care what religion people are or their party affiliation or their country or race, or whether they don't believe in God at all.  All we need is people to fight for what is right.  To fight for the right for our children to live a happy and peaceful life.  They are trying to take that from them and us.  We need all the people we can get into our army.

             That's more nonsense.  No one is deceiving you -- you are free to use your own mind to decide what is going on,
just as others are free to use theirs.  That's the basis of the guarantee of "Separation of Church &amp; State" where we 
all are aware of the terrors of governments under the control of religion -- and the bloodletting that caused not only 
throughout European countries.  Later those religious "Crusades" and "The Inquisition" and the violence of it were 
brought to this land to follow the Papal Edicts to "enslave or kill" the natives here and the Africans enslaved here.
It was this religious violence which allowed the stealing of this land from the native people here.
"Christianity" labelled native people as "pagans ... only fit to be fed to dogs."
Same for the women they labelled "witches" and for centuries burned at the stake.
            </p>
            <p>
             We all need to wake up to what organized patriarchal religions are all about -- and the violence it has brought to the world.

             That's nonsense which has been taught by organized patriarchal religions in order to CONTROL one of the strongest
forces in nature -- normal human sexuality.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the most significant efforts of organized patriarchal religion is to CONTROL not only individual sexuality, but to create a sexual norm throughout all of society.  The banning of masturbation.  What did that teach members and their children?
Only that sexual pleasure can only be honorable if carried out with someone of the opposite sex and within marriage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's also reflect on marriage and how it came about:  It was the debasement of women in societies which forced females
into marriages in order to secure shelter, food, clothing and other necessities of life.  Only the oppression of women in all societies through violence forced women into marriages which even still today remain "unequal."
Also recall that it was male supremacist religions which encouraged and instructed males to "beat their wives" and which is the very basis of domestic violence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further -- IF our mission here is to truly protect children then we have to realize that the oppression of women -  who are appointed by nature as the natural guardians of children -- leave all children vulnerable to sexual abuse by males.

             Jews were basically singlehandedly behind the sexual revolution,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2063874">
              legalized pornography
             </a>
             , and before that birth control and "free love".  They are quite proud of it if you read any Jewish publication.  They also publish all the girl magazines with "how to enjoy anal sex" (obviously the devil's preferred sex as the opposite).  I myself slew dozens of chicks because I grew up seeing "notches on your belt" as a sign of manliness, which I regret.
            </p>
            <p>
             So if Organized Jewry isn't behind PG this is all quite a cohencidence.  Poor Jews are always so unfairly scapegoated, it's so weird, LOL!!

               Those are verifiable facts.  I don't find it funny that over 50% of men watch porn daily and thus feel less motivation to court women and have white babies.

              It’s on 5 different subs. When the current ad is up, it will be on this sub too.

               Tht would be a great reason not to, but the fact that you don't believe there are men who don't watch porn shows what crowd you hang out with and proves my point further.  Debased sick kike scum turned you all into beta faggots spilling seed into a napkin so you don't feel the urge to approach real woman and jizz in THEM

                Donkey, we all know that you're not into women. And no, I've never heard someone who pretends to be an antisemitic male preteding he doesn't watch porn 'because the jews own the porn industry', lol. Hope you'll get some extra bucks as a bonus writing this kind of fiction!

                 "Pretending to be an antisemitic make" What a childish faggot way to ignore reality.  "You don't even really want to criticize Jews, you get paid to." LOL why do you think it's spiting me if you stick your fingers in your ears.  Youre afraid to associate PG with Jew hatred, but apparently no one really hates Jews they're just pretending, because Jews pay them to in order to distract from other crimes said Jews are presumably complicit in.  What a tangled web you weave when you're a totally retarded larpfag piece of shit right

                    You know that he wrote some time ago that getting abused wasn't as harmful as growing up without a father?

                   <p>
                    And he recently posted a pic, claiming it was him, that showed someone who really looked like a trannie, pointing a gun at the camera.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I don't think it was him, but maybe someone of his trannie friends...

                 LOL triggered, that means you's a slut too.  No I'm not rude in real life, there's a difference between acknowledging a widespread phenomenon and singling out one representative of it.  I was fired once for saying nigger four or five times tho.

            Interesting that this was posted on the Feast of Epiphany, when the wise kings of the East showed up to honor the holy infant king, avoiding Herod's murderous doxxing attempts. Thanks for sharing. :-)

            I know this article won't be appreciated by the hard core atheists among us, but this is in fact what SRA is all about.  It is how the dark force reproduces itself on Earth.  The perps are aroused by domination and abomination.  The victims learn that there is no justice in the world.  They are led to think, "If you can't beat them (the darkness), might as well join them."

             Shall we begin to describe those who believe in an all male god as "hard-core religious fanatics"?
            </p>
            <p>
             Or maybe "hard-core male-supremacists"?
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no Satan -- evil rests within every human -- each of us has the power to do good or evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Satan, the Devil and demons are the invention of male-supremacist religions in order to control the minds of members
with FEAR.
            </p>
            <p>
             That does not mean that violence being done in the name of Satan isn't actual violence.
It is real and actual violence by real people doing evil -- and committing violent crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The mind is central to our entire well-being -- it is the center of the system or systems which control our entire body.
Our sight, our hearing, our breathing, our nervous systems.
Sexual abuse of a child or an adult seems often to be seen as TORTURE to control the mind of an individual.
In order for the brain to continue running our system, it will often split off the TORTURE and compartmentalize it in
other personalities unknown to the victim.  This is what MKULTRA is all about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many people don't actually realize that these new personalities can be programmed to carry out other deeds unknown to the host.  In the case of the CIA/MKULTRA they used children they had sexually abused/TORTURED as drug runners, as homosexual prostitutes, and for espionage/spying for blackmail.
These new personalities can also be programmed to speak languages foreign to the host.
            </p>
            <p>
             People have to make their own decisions about a "god" or an "all impotent god" or an "all male god."
But from what the world has seen of this "god" he is a mere showcase for evil which he is either unwilling
or unable to stop.  It's one or the other.
            </p>
            <p>
             We all have to recognize, however, that male-supremacist religions underpin and support Elite patriarchy and
the exploitation of Nature, the planet, animal life -- and even other human beings according to various myths 
of "inferiority." 
See:  Manifest Destiny and Man's Dominion Over Nature -- the licenses issued to Elite patriarchy to exploit all Nature.

              Name one way women are superior to men.  Just one.  LMAO at the very suggestion.  We had to remake the entire education system to favor homework over tests just for them, they earn more college degrees, and they STILL choose stupider jobs and make less money. Women nowadays are a complete fucking disaster and you know it.
