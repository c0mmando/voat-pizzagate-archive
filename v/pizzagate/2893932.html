<h2>A group of former and current priests had argued that they were denied due process because they didn’t have enough time to defend themselves against a grand jury report that came out earlier this year.</h2>
<p>The report, which concluded that hundreds of priests had abused children going back more than 70 years, was released with the names of those priests temporarily redacted.</p>
<p><strong>An attorney representing several of the priests called the court\'s decision &quot;a victory for all Pennsylvanians,” according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;There is no vindication in a wrongful accusation,&quot; Danilewitz said, &quot;so we think that victims can take comfort in … that their voices were heard, but not at the expense of innocent individuals.&quot;</p>
<p>The names of more than 270 priests accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 children were made public when the grand jury report was issued in August. The abuse, which church officials covered up, took place in six of Pennsylvania’s eight dioceses, the grand jury found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We acknowledge that this outcome may be unsatisfying to the public and to the victims of the abuse detailed in the report,&quot; Justice Debra Todd wrote. </p>
<p>&quot;While we understand and empathize with these perspectives, constitutional rights are of the highest order, and even alleged sexual abusers, or those abetting them, are guaranteed by our commonwealth\'s constitution the rights of due process.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>State Attorney General Josh Shapiro urged the state’s Catholic bishops to release the names of the accused priests.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Today’s order allows predator priests to remain in the shadows and permits the church to continue concealing their identities,” Shapiro said. &quot;The public will not relent in its demand that anyone involved in this widespread abuse and cover up be named.&quot;</p>
