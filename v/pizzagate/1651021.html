<p>Heads are about to roll, can you feel it? House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz along with Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)  have submitted a letter to the Justice Department\'s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, requesting a formal investigation into both the surveillance and subsequent leaks of classified communications &quot;of or regarding&quot; former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn - citing the highly inappropriate release of information.</p>
<p>Generally, collection activities by intelligence agencies are classified, as are the products that result from those activities. This is to ensure the continued integrity of the sources and methods used. Therefore, it seems probable that the fact that an intelligence agency monitored the call, if it did, as well as any recording of the call, would also be classified.
Chaffetz and Goodlatte\'s letter cite &quot;serious concerns&quot; about mishandling of classified information, stating the release of which would, by definition, &quot;have grave effects on national security.&quot;</p>
<p>In a discussion with Fox\'s First 100 Days, Chaffetz also made clear that he\'s concerned about both the Flynn leaks and President Trump\'s conduct, following a letter the congressman to the White House over Trump\'s public discussion at Mar-a-Lago with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe regarding North Korea\'s recent missile launch.</p>
<p>&quot;no matter where you are on the political spectrum, you cannot have classified information migrating out into a non-classified setting.&quot; -Jason Chaffetz, Bounty Hunter
While it\'s perhaps to be expected that our intelligence agencies might monitor an incoming administration\'s communications, using those obviously classified conversations as a weapon for the purposes of propaganda designed to undermine a sitting US President is absolutely beyond the pale.</p>
<p>&quot;How does that information end up at the news media? The President has made some very serious allegations in his description in the movement of this information.

            Why not make a HIGH profile arrest for pedo sex and release it to every station to be reported to the public? That would teach them. They're creating crime to harm the president. The Clinton's have created a lot too. I'm sick of only a few over decades getting outed and arrested. Those were retaliation for stepping out of line. Like Elliott spitzer, etc. Barney Frank has much to do with this too. Now he's comfortably retired on our tax dollars! Sessions needs to move on this now. So people understand why the media is doing this all out assault. People are stronger than they realize.

            They have to stop the soft coup happening with factions of the Intel community who are loyal to Obama/Clinton purposely leaking damaging material.
           </p>
           <p>
            So fucking what if Flynn contacted Russia to tell them not to respond to Obama's little fit, because Trump would remove the sanctions.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's so obvious that the Soros controlled Democratic Party was pushing for a war with Russia (along with the MSM, Graham, McCain and Rubio).
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be nice if our politicians would use a little more common sense and keep us out of needless wars.

             I think its more than that, I think that they are afraid that Flynn was going to initiate a major intel community reform, that they know their gig is up, and are fighting tooth and nail and every other tactic...Otherwise why bring down Trump? what aspects of his policy or personality is so objectionable to them?  They could just do their job and support the elected president, but this is more than that

            Trump is our only hope! Sessions with Trump's go ahead will be the only chance we have to get the sick Evil Pedo Elites!
Whoever leaked that info, (IMO) is an accomplice to the Elite Pedophilia and other crimes associated with the Clinton Pedo Cabal!
The mole needs to thrown into a tank with sharks!

            Still no Benghazi prosecutions?  Its ok to sell stinger missiles to terrorists? Then change your mind, and send someone in to buy them back, then watch them get tortured for a day before they die, without sending any help?

              The public being aware and HER taking all the people's money and making fools out of them.....Well that alone is what I'll take in the least to combat all th emails I put up with after Bernie from those I know saying "I don't care what she did, I'm voting for HER. The cognitive dissonance turning into enlightenment within the sheeple would be justice as well.

             Or, well we have to make it look like we are fighting ISIS, so that we can give more money to our friends who are funding ISIS... IN HER OWN WORDS... It is not providing material support to a terrorist organization when you are the terrorist organization
