<p>That image has been seen over two million times since posting in July of this year. You\'ll notice of course that the horrific image is depicted using children\'s toys from the extremely popular franchise Peppa Pig, a brand aimed at toddlers. Notice too that the children, sitting in the circle around the feces, are led by the teacher who is a goat-headed figure of adult size in comparison to their children\'s proportions. Finally, notice the reinforcement of children as animals. Please look long and hard at this image. This is what another Voat commentor accurately called <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1515888/7362240">BubbleGum Satanism</a>.</p>
<p>Who would produce such filth? The fact is, hundreds of channels each garnering <strong>tens of millions of views</strong> are producing these videos daily in a never ending stream of keyword optimized themes. That\'s <strong>hundred of millions of viewers in total</strong> that these videos have and continue to receive.</p>
<p>This still is taken from a YouTube video channel <strong>Home of Toys</strong> that as of today has garnered almost 58,000,000 views. </p>

<h2>YouTube has been taken over by weaponized Bubblegum Satanism</h2>
<p>There is something happening right now (12/27/2016) on YouTube that should alarm every decent human. You can verify this yourself. I first made mention of this horrific development yesterday <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1515888">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1515888</a>, and others before me have also called this out.</p>
<p>What has happened is that a vast, inter-connected, and monetized farm of YouTube channels are gathering hundreds of millions of views in aggregate. These sites are churning out sickening animated and live-action kids videos that depict what can only in sum be described as Satanism, that is, cannibalism, scatology, eating from toilets, dismemberment, de-humization, infantilization, sexualization of children, etc. Even unrelated videos will surface these Bubblegum Satan videos in the recommendation lists due to the extraordinarily high volume of views and the well-organized cross-linking, search engine optimization, and undoubtedly artificial promotion. The motives as I\'ll explain below are profit, perversion, and cover.</p>
<p>To be very clear, <strong>these videos are available freely to children through a Kids YouTube App</strong> that is supposed to be child friendly. <strong>The YouTube Kids app is intended for children five and under</strong> The idea is that a parent can safely give their child a tablet or phone and let them watch videos through the app (the videos are also available through a web browser, but the app is designed to filter content for children). And that\'s exactly what happens, kids watch these videos one after another on autoplay and these videos garner millions of hits. And to again be very clear, <strong>these videos are not buried and hard to find.</strong> In fact, there are designed to show up everywhere, and once you click one, you\'ll enter a maze of referred videos, playlists and channels that a child would never be able to leave. And to once again be very clear, <strong>the video producers are targeting children with keywords and themes that children look for:</strong> Hulk, Mickey Mouse, Frozen Elsa, Spiderman, Minions. These are enormous global brands being illegally and overtly re-purposed, yet no-one at YouTube seems to notice or care.</p>
<h2>See for yourself</h2>
<p>To be extra certain of these claims, go to YouTube and download their Kids app: <a href="https://kids.youtube.com/">https://kids.youtube.com/</a> </p>
<p>Remember, all content viewed via the Kids app is subject to direct vetting and approval from YouTube.</p>
<p>Go to YouTube using the App, enable search. Search for &quot;peppa pig poop&quot;. There\'s the video and also available is the entire channel of videos from the producer.</p>

<h2>I\'m sorry, but it gets much, much worse</h2>
<h3>There is so much related child-directed, weaponized Satanism directed at toddlers on YouTube at this point, it would be impossible to catalog it all.</h3>
<p>Go for yourself, type in a keyword of interest to a young child or toddler (some toy, some kid franchise, some movie super hero, etc.) and you\'ll find Bubblegum Satan videos on the first page of results. It is no exaggeration to say that there is an unending ocean of Satanic filth directed at toddlers on YouTube. I encourage others to verify, share and to pray for the children that have already been exposed to this violence through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>I\'m frankly demoralized by the sheer volume of channels, posts and viewers, and also by exposure to this poison. I\'ve already mentioned criminal <a href="https://i.sli.mg/MXWqBc.jpg">SLiMG Image</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/AQPZa">Greg Chism</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/ahyTE">https://archive.fo/ahyTE</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/qec8p">https://archive.fo/qec8p</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/9YPPi">https://archive.fo/9YPPi</a>, aka Freaky Daddy and Freak to Geek, <a href="https://i.sli.mg/kQjhVT.jpg">SLiMG Image</a> who is responsible for many of these channels, and another Voat user noticed that Alefantis\' cleaning service woman has a penchant for following these channels on YouTube. </p>
<h2>What\'s going on here</h2>
<p>So much. One, we are witnessing how extensive, well-funded and well-organized these groups are. Besides the vast advertising revenue fully vetted, arranged, and paid out by YouTube / Google, the Satanists are also taking part in a well organized mind control and infiltration operation that as of today is adding hundreds of videos per day and overwhelming all search results with pure Satanic rot, weaponized at children. Any parent casually listening in hears nothing but cartoon noises. Any parent taking a passing glance would see nothing but mind numbing children\'s toys. The reality is that children are being taught to eat feces, among other atrocities.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/7snuzn.jpg">SLiMG Image</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/gJ2zicpYsCM">https://youtu.be/gJ2zicpYsCM</a></p>
<p>There is also an unmistakable aspect of mind control in these videos. These videos are carefully designed to warp minds and possibly trigger or induce dissociative states. They are inherently hypnotic and are nothing but a direct pipeline of un-erasable images of blasphemous filth pumped directly into a child\'s unconscious and formative brain.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/7QehOH.jpg">SLiMG Image</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/-YkVd1_Z3W8">https://youtu.be/-YkVd1_Z3W8</a></p>
<p>Also, without a doubt, these videos are made for the pleasure and entertainment of Satanic sexual fetishists: littles, furries, puppy slaves, cosplay -- it\'s all there for these adult deviants to get their jollies off of it too, proving that these so-called &quot;role play&quot; fetish freaks are actually concerned with real life acting out with children, not just with fantasy.</p>
<p>Besides the desensitization, besides the terrorization, besides the joy these Satanists take in perverting the young, there is one more sinister motive for these videos: cover. Now, if any allegations from a child surface, the response is that they were simply watching a &quot;potty training&quot; YouTube video and that this is another Satanic Panic.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, white knight for pedophiles the world-over, has this to say about Satanic Ritual Abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allegation of cult-based abuse is the most extreme scenario of SRA.  During the initial period of interest starting in the early 1980s the term was used to describe a network of Satan-worshipping, secretive intergenerational cults that were supposedly part of a highly organized conspiracy engaged in criminal behaviors such as forced prostitution, drug distribution and pornography. These cults were also thought to sexually abuse and torture children in order to coerce them into a lifetime of Devil worship. Other allegations included bizarre sexual acts such as necrophilia, forced ingestion of semen, blood and feces, cannibalism, orgies, liturgical parody such as pseudosacramental use of feces and urine; infanticide, sacrificial abortions to eat fetuses and human sacrifice; satanic police officers who covered up evidence of SRA crimes and desecration of Christian graves. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, here we are, Kid YouTube videos of Peppa Pig sitting with classmates in a circle around feces in a school classroom led by a goat-headed adult -- animated with toys, aimed at toddlers and brought to you by a vast highly organized network. This isn\'t just about gross and highly inappropriate content. The undeniable Baphomet circle of feces proves conclusively and without a doubt this is about Satanism, and this lesson should not be lost on the forces that are behind all of PizzaGate.</p>
<p>This time, there is no so-called bullshit made up &quot;moral panic&quot; conspiracy theory offered by child rapists as cover for their crimes. The lies will never cease and the attacks are now made in broad daylight by those who wish to rape and pervert children for the sake of Satanism and profit. This is no panic. Make no mistake, this is war.</p>',

           There is so much related child-directed, weaponized Satanism directed at toddlers on YouTube at this point, it would be impossible to catalog it all.

           Go for yourself, type in a keyword of interest to a young child or toddler (some toy, some kid franchise, some movie super hero, etc.) and you'll find Bubblegum Satan videos on the first page of results. It is no exaggeration to say that there is an unending ocean of Satanic filth directed at toddlers on YouTube. I encourage others to verify, share and to pray for the children that have already been exposed to this violence through no fault of their own.

           What's going on here
          </h2>
          <p>
           So much. One, we are witnessing how extensive, well-funded and well-organized these groups are. Besides the vast advertising revenue fully vetted, arranged, and paid out by YouTube / Google, the Satanists are also taking part in a well organized mind control and infiltration operation that as of today is adding hundreds of videos per day and overwhelming all search results with pure Satanic rot, weaponized at children. Any parent casually listening in hears nothing but cartoon noises. Any parent taking a passing glance would see nothing but mind numbing children's toys. The reality is that children are being taught to eat feces, among other atrocities.

          </p>
          <p>
           There is also an unmistakable aspect of mind control in these videos. These videos are carefully designed to warp minds and possibly trigger or induce dissociative states. They are inherently hypnotic and are nothing but a direct pipeline of un-erasable images of blasphemous filth pumped directly into a child's unconscious and formative brain.

          <p>
           Also, without a doubt, these videos are made for the pleasure and entertainment of Satanic sexual fetishists: littles, furries, puppy slaves, cosplay -- it's all there for these adult deviants to get their jollies off of it too, proving that these so-called "role play" fetish freaks are actually concerned with real life acting out with children, not just with fantasy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Besides the desensitization, besides the terrorization, besides the joy these Satanists take in perverting the young, there is one more sinister motive for these videos: cover. Now, if any allegations from a child surface, the response is that they were simply watching a "potty training" YouTube video and that this is another Satanic Panic.
          </p>
          <p>
           Wikipedia, white knight for pedophiles the world-over, has this to say about Satanic Ritual Abuse:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Allegation of cult-based abuse is the most extreme scenario of SRA.  During the initial period of interest starting in the early 1980s the term was used to describe a network of Satan-worshipping, secretive intergenerational cults that were supposedly part of a highly organized conspiracy engaged in criminal behaviors such as forced prostitution, drug distribution and pornography. These cults were also thought to sexually abuse and torture children in order to coerce them into a lifetime of Devil worship. Other allegations included bizarre sexual acts such as necrophilia, forced ingestion of semen, blood and feces, cannibalism, orgies, liturgical parody such as pseudosacramental use of feces and urine; infanticide, sacrificial abortions to eat fetuses and human sacrifice; satanic police officers who covered up evidence of SRA crimes and desecration of Christian graves.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           And yet, here we are, Kid YouTube videos of Peppa Pig sitting with classmates in a circle around feces in a school classroom led by a goat-headed adult -- animated with toys, aimed at toddlers and brought to you by a vast highly organized network. This isn't just about gross and highly inappropriate content. The undeniable Baphomet circle of feces proves conclusively and without a doubt this is about Satanism, and this lesson should not be lost on the forces that are behind all of PizzaGate.
          </p>
          <p>
           This time, there is no so-called bullshit made up "moral panic" conspiracy theory offered by child rapists as cover for their crimes. The lies will never cease and the attacks are now made in broad daylight by those who wish to rape and pervert children for the sake of Satanism and profit. This is no panic. Make no mistake, this is war.

            Nadine Zylstra used to produce Seasame Street episodes that starred Kevin Clash as Elmo, who had to resign because of molestation accusations. Producers are usually in the know of everything that goes in on set.

            Margaret Kelly Michaels, a teacher at the Wee Care Nursery operated by an Episcopal Church was convicted in April 1988 on 115 counts of child sexual abuse and sentenced to 47 years in prison. Nineteen preschool-aged children testified that Michaels sexually abused them and subjected them to rituals involving urine, feces, peanut butter and jelly, bloody tampons and penetration with silverware.

           <h1>
            Francisco Fuster, 36, was convicted in 1985 on 14 counts of child abuse and sentenced to a minimum of 165 years in prison. ... More than 50 children accused Fuster and his wife, Iliana, of abuse that included feces-eating, drugging, pornography, animal killings and anal rape with a crucifix. Fuster’s 7-year-old son was treated for gonorrhea of the throat.
           </h1>

            Robert F. Kelly, Jr., co-owner of the Little Rascals Day Care Center, was convicted in 1992 on 99 of 100 counts of sexually abusing children...
           </p>
           <h1>
            Twelve children testified that Kelly sexually molested them, forced them to have sex with other children while being photographed, and engaged in sexual acts in the presence of children. The children described being forced to eat feces, threatened with snakes, penetrated with toys, sticks and other objects, hung from trees and tied in bags, and being present while infants were killed.
           </h1>
           <p>
            Rene Osterwalder, 38, and his girlfriend, Agostina Schonenberger, 21, were convicted in February 1994 of illegal weapons charges and attempted child abduction. Schonenberger testified that Osterwalder had planned to abduct children, torture them to death in his apartment, and dump their bodies into an aquarium filled with piranhas.
           </p>
           <h1>
            Six videotapes showing Osterwalder abusing three children ranging in age from 6 months to 12 years old. The children were given electric shocks, held under water and resuscitated, and abused with feces and needles;
           </h1>
           <p>
            On March 1, 1991, FBI agents arrested three men suspected of running a major child pornography ring. The three men charged were Wayne H. Bailey, 56, of Fairhaven, RI, Brian K. Schultz, 44, and Mark Colen, who headed a company that reproduced and distributed alleged pornographic films.
           </p>
           <p>
            Law enforcement officials said videotapes recovered in searches of the men’s homes and businesses depicted pregnant women being tortured, children being molested by adults, young women engaged in sexual activities with animals, children urinating on each other and ingesting human feces, and various bizarre sex acts with “satanic” overtones. Some of the children were as young as six years old.

             That's only one channel of hundreds. I'm not sure I've successfully conveyed the scale of the network and how much traffic is going through these videos. Hundreds of millions of viewers with vast multi-channel networks all cross-linking and cross-promoting.

            not to downplay how weird this shit is - and I would never let my kid watch it - keep in mind that christians tried to raise a ruckus like this in the 80s over heavy metal and how it was "ruining teens"...(was one of the those teens, was not ruined)
           </p>
           <p>
            Satan and evil are everywhere, even in kids shows - it's not against the law and protected by 1st amendment....you can only do you best to inform parents
           </p>
           <p>
            sad but true
           </p>
           <p>
            and to be honest.... I've seen worse in Disney movies, and no one seems to care about it. Grimms fairy tales are also very dark, lots of evil characters and kids killed by them.
           </p>

            one more thing, when i was a kid we had this on network Saturday Morning TV -

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            again, no one batted an eye
           </p>
           <p>
            also knew a kid when I was around 7-9 who ate dog poop and all the neighborhood kids  thought he was fucking gross - witnessing an act doesnt not always make one want to copy it.

             Pee-Wee Herman was fired from his kids show for masturbating in a dirty movie theatre. It's different when it comes to kids, this isn't Black Saabath on a 15yr old's radio.

             Actually, people
             <em>
              did
             </em>
             bat eyes over this kind of thing. People were upset with Elvis. And to a certain extent, they were correct. It's been social engineering over the course of several generations to get to where we are now, and it's a gradual process of normalization of the deviant, and not in a fun, revolutionary, pro-human kind of way. People who said anything were mocked, ridiculed, dismissed, but they weren't necessarily wrong.

            How is it possible that these videos have taken hold on YouTube with millions of hits each since they clearly infringe on copyright? They use all sorts of copyrighted and trademarked characters far beyond what would be considered fair use - like someone playing a prank in a Spiderman outfit. So why hasn't YouTube been forced to remove them?

             All that I've seen are available through the YouTube Kids App, which means the video must be vetted through their kids program and approved for inclusion in this specially filtered app. Thus someone at YouTube is approving this content tacitly.
            </p>
            <p>
             I noticed too that the Freak Daddy has a lot of very professional produce placement in his video. Food products in particular. See:

             I still don't want to admit this, but it appears that major brands are paying for product placement in this videos.

              I read that but it was all too much to take in. I can't believe YouTube would give these videos the seal of approval for children. They come off as some sort of pornography. They just don't protect the innocence of children as they should. And I have to wonder if certain companies are paying for product placement, as you mention. These companies need to be confronted with these videos. And what children are being allowed to watch them, and what adults approve of or even watch these videos themselves?

               That's the problem. Parents put the kid down in front of a tablet, click the Kids App, and walk away. They hear cartoon sounds, everything sounds fine. The videos cycle through a playlist, and these are the videos that get played automatically for as long as the child sits there.

                Yes, exactly. And since they use characters like Spiderman, the parents might feel that the video must be all right if they notice the title or catch a glimpse of the screen. Parents might also be on the internet themselves and not even away while the child is watching.
               </p>
               <p>
                And older children who have been abused or neglected in some way, or with emotional problems, might enjoy these videos and accept what's in them as normal.

            Here's a video with cheese balls and pasta, and that mentions pizza. I've never heard of these but just watched a few. They do seem like something that pedophiles would make. They corrupt the adult-child relationship, just for one thing, and try to normalize things to children (like being squirted with feces) as acceptable. This video I linked to here has a lot of violence and the children don't seem to be with their parents, but merely some random adults.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Apparently one girl identifies an adult as "mom" in the video, but the two still have a relationship very far from parent and child, with the mother being excited to join her daughter for a "cheese ball bath."
           </p>
           <p>
            These videos are obviously aimed in part at children, but they are so high conflict that I have to believe most children not being abused would find them stressful, but children who are being abused would get the message that certain acts and situation and behaviors by adults are acceptable.

             They are available through the YouTube Kids App, which is made to filter content specifically for children. It all needs to be vetted before getting into the Kids app.

             I feel like I should post this again, because it's so bizarre:

            <p>
             That channel is made by Etayyim and Mohammed Etayyim, aka. Moe and Ethan Bradberry (proof:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipTJNNvW-Gw">

             </a>
             ), who were famous "pranksters" (they faked many of their pranks, using paid actors). After the pranking trend died down, they jumped ship to this trend for some reason. Their videos are some of the most perverse in this "genre". Just look at these thumbnails/titles. This is for the YouTube Kids app.

            My god. These channels always gave me a feeling of being "robotic," as if these ideas were not made by human beings. I think I know why now, if they were designed to be hypnotic.
