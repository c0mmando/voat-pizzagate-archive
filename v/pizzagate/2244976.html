            Hey, I see this was just deleted. Pls repost adhering to Rule #2.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I think you should do is get her in touch with an indie journalist. Not a sensationalist like AJ although he's not a journalist. Mike Cernovich, Thomas Paine of True Pundit, Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit. Project Veritas maybe? The usually specialize in undercover work, but this might work. Laura Loomer is in NYC a lot so she might be interested, but she's flamboyant and over-the-top. Don't know you want that, but she would not back down if she believed that story.
           </p>
           <p>
            I definitely would try the Indie reporter route. Key points in her story would have to be proven, etc. A lot of people do have mental problems like schizophrenia. They live in a constant state of terror over made up fantasies. I don't know her and am not ascribing that, I'm just saying it's possible and it's why key points would need to be investigated. The indie journalist might be the route. Oh, how about Liz Crokin? She was a traditional reporter. She might want to check this out. A woman who was abused would definitely be something she would be interested in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for at least TRYING to get help for this woman ... and definitely repost after you fix the non-compliance to Rule #2.

              Definitely address Rule 2 but do NOT post a picture of the woman! That might put her in danger should the picture go viral. Right now, people walking past her prob write her off as crazy, as you already pointed out, and that offers her some protection.

            Seriously, if this woman is so afraid, and she probably should be, why have you just outed her? If Panetta wasn't aware of her roaming around before, he will be now, and I bet she's going to get shut up in the nut house. Please find her and tell her to stay inside for a while. She needs a laywer.

            He owns a "walnut farm" in Carmel Valley, California, and would travel to it weekly on the taxpayers’ dime to tend to his walnuts. He spent approx. $860.000 in total on his trips.

            It’s an interesting coincidence for sure when taking into account the codewords from the Podesta email leaks, "walnuts" and "walnut sauce", that the director of the CIA would travel that often to the farm on the weekends to "tend to his walnuts". Maybe there’s something more going on at that farm?

            The emails even reference "northern CA". Here’s the full sentence: "Walnut growing northern CA surely knows and celebrates walnut pasta sauce?"

                I wouldn’t be so hasty to dismiss this. The thread was deleted by Millenial_Falcon right after Are_we_sure showed up, on the grounds that "codewords are nothing but 4chan BS", which is ridiculous considering that this whole movement is named after one, pizza, and that pedophiles are by now widely known to use codewords for their terms.

                 I don't think it's the codewords aspect, per se, that got your submission deleted, but the lack of confirmation for your statements about said codewords in your cited sources. But, again, I haven't looked at your sources in detail myself.

             Wow, that is quite the coincidence.  Considering I and probably many people have never heard of “walnut farms” there is probably more to this.

              I live among Northern California orchards-- walnut and almond. They are common here, followed by rice fields. My dad worked for a rancher that grew walnuts, plums/prunes, and almonds (in addition to dairy and rice)... so it's not unheard of; that said,
              <a href="http://carmelvalleycalifornia.com/">
               Carmel Valley
              </a>
              isn't in NorCal proper; it's below San Jose, near Monterey Bay, and is more in wine country than walnut orchards. Per
              <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Carmel-Valley-California.html">
               City Data
              </a>
              , the main industry isn't agriculture. Also per City Data, there's a naval training place about 15 miles away (in Monterey).

              Note the proximity Carmel Valley is to several state parks.Note the topography. Want to find satellite images so I can see the orchards; depending on the size of said orchards would indicate whether they are there for profit (aka legitimate walnut ranching) or as a cover (a small orchard; enough to say it's an orchard but not enough to make a decent amount from the crop)
             </p>
             <p>
              The most notable thing I find about the valley is that there's an airstrip in the center of "town."

              No, wait. The most notable thing is the super shitty what could be a walnut orchard (too much space between trees; it's sparse) on what just so happens to be Panetta Road.

              At the end of the road is a house backed up against the Carmel River.

              Carmel Valley is also home to celebrities.

              It also has a LOT of art galleries for a place with little population density.

            <p>
             Leon Edward Panetta (born June 28, 1938) is an American politician who has served in several different public office positions, such as Secretary of Defense, Director of the CIA, White House Chief of Staff, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and as a U.S. Representative from California. A Democrat, Panetta was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993, served as Director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1993 to 1994, and as President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff from 1994 to 1997. He co-founded the Panetta Institute for Public Policy and served as a Distinguished Scholar to Chancellor Charles B. Reed of the California State University System and as a professor of public policy at Santa Clara University.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In January 2009, newly elected President Barack Obama nominated Panetta for the post of CIA Director.[2][3] Panetta was confirmed by the full Senate in February 2009. As director of the CIA, Panetta oversaw the operation that brought down international terrorist Osama bin Laden. On April 28, 2011, Obama announced the nomination of Panetta as Defense Secretary, to replace the retiring Robert Gates. In June the Senate confirmed Panetta unanimously and he assumed the office on July 1, 2011.[4] David Petraeus took over as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on September 6, 2011.[5]
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Since retiring as Secretary of Defense in 2013, Panetta has served as Chairman of The Panetta Institute for Public Policy, located at California State University, Monterey Bay, a campus of the California State University that he helped establish during his tenure as congressman.[6] The Institute is dedicated to motivating and preparing people for lives of public service and helping them to become more knowledgeably engaged in the democratic process. He also serves on a number of boards and commissions and frequently writes and lectures on public policy issues.

             Thank you so much! I guess there’s no sleeping for me today. I found this, and it’s frightening...

              Yes, and I found this extremely worrisome: "The New York Times reported that Leon Panetta, the current CIA director, has taken the position that “no one who took actions based on legal guidance from the Department of Justice at the time should be investigated, let alone punished.” Yet a number of CIA officials implicated in the torture program not only remain at the highest levels of the agency, but are also advising Panetta. Panetta’s attempt to suppress the issue is making Bush’s policy into the Obama administration’s dirty laundry."  This makes me think we are going to find much more to verify that woman's story.

               More Evidence and from the Article: The Department of Defense said in its annual sexual assault report that it received reports of 3,393 victims of sexual assault in fiscal 2011. But a DOD survey the year before indicated there may be as many as 15,000 more assaults each year that are never reported. Factoring in the unreported assaults, only 6 percent of perpetrators ever spend a day in jail, the DOD report for 2011 said.   THESE Sick Pedos must be Jailed!

               Honestly, I can’t speak of this anywhere else because I could lose my job. It’s fucked in every way possible, but I’m thankful that I have the voat community to assist me with this.

                It's a terrible set of circumstances indeed, when good people are faced with that. There's a lot of clued on people here who can help, though.
