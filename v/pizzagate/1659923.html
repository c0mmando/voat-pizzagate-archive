            He is ex CIA. Is that possible? Maybe. I take most of what he says with a grain of salt. I am not for putting all eggs in one basket but I think(I could be worng) that his intentions are good. having said that, just like FBIanon, he mixes some red herrings in there for his safety. Much of his info I sense is really good but yes, could be a few disinfo things thrown in. The Lynn De Rothschild thing is just plain nonsense. She was also Hillary's biggest supporter and when you see photos of them together, it is about the only time you see Hillary looking uncomfortable and not so in control. My guess, Lynn pulls Hillary's cables, tells her what to do and let's her and Bill do crime through the Clinton Foundation. I mean think about it, the Rothschilds!!! Don't they control every country's central bank now except for 3( now that Libya, Syria, Iraq have been compromised). Plus it is most likely Evelyn whispering to Lynn.https://deusnexus.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/rothschild-central-bank/

            He did make a big deal that the pedophilia didn't originate in the Democratic party and that it came about from big businesses and the Republican party.  The thing is, who cares?  If you aren't the first person ever to commit a crime it doesn't absolve you of guilt.  Also what the fuck is a pedo-lite?

            I disagree. He's one of the most credible sources we have and he is a HUGE supporter of exposing the deep state for these pedo/satanic/human trafficking crimes. I think you may be misinterpreting his comments and information. When he says Podesta is "pedo-lite" he means that his afflictions and crimes pale in comparison to the other high levels involved. Not to say in our eyes in any better. And the "accidental" president comment/book is not discrediting Trump or saying he's not meant to be president. The Rothchilds funded his campaign to make him the less desiresble candidate so Hillary would get elected. Trump didn't think he would win. But when he was crushing the polls he decided to take it seriously and go for it to take down the establishment. This was not part of the plan as the elites selected Hellary to win. So this is what he means by that and what the book Accidrntal Presdient. Steele is informed, smart, and knows how the CIA works. He is a credible and resourceful reporter in this matter.

            Wasn't he showcased on infowars? That makes his credibility questionable just there.
