           there was still real MSM reporting on these events. Something happened after 2013 and I think it's around that time the numerous cover ups occurred.

             You ever read 1984? The only ones that could theoretically take down the Elite were the proles, for the proles outnumbered the elite. The Human Race, if awakened in mass, would fight back and overthrow the elite themselves. I have a huge family up north who are largely Police Officers in NYC and many of them served in the Military, my one uncle would die for his daughter and has served NYPD for many years. I assure you if they, and the masses, woke up their would be a rebellion like no other. Many good people are out there in the dark and if awakened these atrocities wouldn't continue.

            Kathryn Bolkovac also co-wrote a book on what happened in Dyncorp and the UN, and has a lot of details both on the
            <em>
             what
            </em>
            of the horrors inflicted on the trafficked girls, and the
            <em>
             how
            </em>
            of the way these people were able to exploit the instability of the post Balkan war situation, and abuse their immunity from prosecution.
           </p>
           <p>
            The book is for sale on Amazon as well as the other big sellers. For some reason Voat won't let you post links to Amazon? Anyways, here's a review of the book:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://hopeforthesold.com/book-review-the-whistleblower-sex-trafficking-military-contractors-and-one-womans-fight-for-justice-by-kathryn-bolkovac/">
             http://hopeforthesold.com/book-review-the-whistleblower-sex-trafficking-military-contractors-and-one-womans-fight-for-justice-by-kathryn-bolkovac/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is interesting to note that after Kathryn Bolkovac's whistleblowing and successful lawsuit, Dyncorp just carried on doing all that shit anyways. here's the story of a guy who worked for Dyncorp after Kathryn Bolkovac, and after finding Dyncorp employees trafficking,
            <strong>
             he
            </strong>
            got fired and had to sue them for wrongful dismissal (he won) just like Kathryn Bolkovac had:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11119">
             http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11119
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            They hadn't done a thing about the criminal activity of their employess. Dyncorp just regards these trafficking incidents and the lawsuits they cause, as just a cost of doing business. They have no personal morality or desire to halt these crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is interesting is that the director of the 2011 film
            <em>
             The Whistleblower
            </em>
            was criticized for including extreme violence in the film. But she said that the violence was reduced from what actually happened for real. After consulting Kathryn Bolkovac about how close to the real events she should make the film go,
            <strong>
             They both decided that they should reduce the violence from what Kathryn actually saw, because they were concerned some audience members might get sick or have to leave the theater
            </strong>
            .

              What I read this past week about her assault is that she, too, was taken to a Med Star Hospital, where she passed. Just like Seth. There is a video where George Webb went to her neighborhood. Homes there basically "Colonial" palatial. I am stunned, stunned that the police haven't been taken to task by the neighbors or the significant other.....in our town if a murder had happened in a like neighborhood, it would be on the news every night until it was resolved......because something similar happened to a model home where high school students had a rave party and two people were shot and died....that was solved in two weeks. So, just weird, all around.  It is being suppressed, just like Seth's murder.and, that is why we get downvoats.

               I think they have gotten the message. Nothing is to be done. It is all about her name and not her town.  I also read that Ashe was into Electromagnetics.

              How is Seth related to John Ashe? Molly was the one who worked at Johns Hopkins? killed walking her dog, is that right? I don't remember anything else about her case  at the moment.
