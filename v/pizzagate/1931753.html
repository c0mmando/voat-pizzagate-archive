<p>So, Steele is taking Webb\'s word and then endorses him, bashing us, without doing much investigation into Webb\'s work? Why would he do that?</p>

It seems like the rumors linking Alpha Jalloh and his friends to Seth Rich\'s murder have been circulating on the web since July 2016. Looks like the source for making the SVR report public would be Sorcha Faal at WhatDoesIt Mean.com.</p>
<p>This SVR report, though, says that DNC official Seth Rich was “lured/enticed” to his murder by this Clinton “hit team” who portrayed themselves as FBI agents wanting to secretly interview him—and that the expelled Russian diplomats had given the US State Department “electronic access” to so that they could be found.</p>
<p>Curiously, this report continues, US authorities, and while being able to track this Clinton “hit team” since 7 July, only confronted these assassins yesterday—and who before being captured, engaged in a gun battle with US federal police forces firing their fully automatic weapons before being trapped and surrendering just blocks from the US Capitol and White House.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2071.htm">http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2071.htm</a></p>
<p>On Wednesday, police identified the suspects as Keyante Edwards, 19, of Southwest D.C.; Alpha Jalloh, 18, of Southwest D.C., and Keith Jones, 20, of Southeast D.C.</p>
<p>Edwards, who is accused of firing the gun, and Jalloh, who court documents say drove the vehicle, face a number of charges and were ordered held without bond. Jones, who is only charged with evading arrest, was released on his own recognizance.</p>

<p>Some believe that Sorcha Faal is David Booth, the owner of the WhatDoesIt Mean.com website.</p>

             He named the murderers of Seth Rich, when we don't even know for sure that Seth died. And those murderers are not in jail, so that must have been a lie. He is NOT an investigator, he's a computer SALESMAN and he's selling you a story and making a joke out of anyone who follows him by continually saying inane things.

              He could be right.. He is doing journalism and is very knowledgeable about how the dark side operates.. very illuminating. You on the other hand waste time trying to persuade people he is mis-information -  not sure you're objective. but suggest you get back to researching and let it unfold.

            Robert David Steele...Spooks and their assets in psyops love having have three names. John Wilkes Boothe, Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinkley Jr.(Cheating?) Vester Lee Flannigan, Dylaan Storm Roof, Charles J. Guiteau, Kevin James Loibl, Mark David Chapman, James Earl Ray etc etc
           </p>
           <p>
            Steele is as big a narcissistic low life as George Webb. Of course he prefers his goose chase style that results in blaming the Muslims,  over the citizen researchers single mindedly focussing on the original perps. His ideal end game, as well as Webb's is that "everybody gets the truth, nobody goes to jail". Forget that for even a moment and you have been had.

            But George Webb has people just like us and  lot of us doing research for him. George Webb was just a random person ( Coughs ) Him and Robert David Steel are both full of it.

             Yeah and when random people just like us send him actual evidence that pizzagate is real, he ignores us. When we question his misstatements, he erases our comments form his facebook.

            An actual investigation involves many leads and has many footprints. Our problem is we won't abandon anything we already have, we need to stop kicking closed doors and embrace our limitations. The hubris of our enemy is our strength. Its not so much to observe but what to observe

            People need to understand that:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Current and former CIA officers and contractors who have signed the standard CIA secrecy agreement are required to submit to the PRB any and all materials they intend to share with the public that are intelligence related, such as materials that mention the CIA or intelligence activities, or that concern topics to which they had access to classified information while employed at or performing contractual work for CIA.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This submission requirement extends beyond the sub-set of topics they may have had immediate responsibility for on a day-to-day basis.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Publishing
            </strong>
            : Publishing is more than having a printing house bind copies of a book. It means communicating by any means (including orally or electronically), information regardless of form to any person or entity other than the CIA’s PRB or a US Government official authorized by the CIA to receive such information for prepublication review.
           </p>
           <p>
            This encompasses materials including but not limited to: book reviews, Op-ed pieces, scholarly papers, scripts, screenplays, blogs, speeches, and other materials.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus, material covered by a CIA Secrecy Agreement requiring prepublication review must be submitted and approved prior to discussing the material with or showing it to individuals such as a publisher, co-author, agent, editor, ghost-writer, personal representative, family member, or assistant.

             ... and that he would do this mere  hours after Sweigart's brother outed him. This is actually why i thought it important, it pretty much seals the deal: "Webb" is indeed under the wing of intel. Nothing independent about it. I still think they're (including his brother) part of an operation to gather information on US

              Yes, I agree that his brother is working with him. There was a very strange post made on the video that George deleted which stated that Dave likes to turn up at car crashes and murder scenes and record the horrific scenes.  I think these two brothers are both very sick and there is a much darker side to what's going on.

               I will tell you this, i very literally never have nightmares. I can't remember one in 30 years... until the other night, i watched 2 hours of george webb (i usually do not watch him, this was a first to take in so much) and i had a horrific nightmare that had me messed up for days, it stirred up ancient abuse which i relived - the dream seemed totally real. There is a predatory nature and a complete lack of conscience in George. His brother is a very angry guy, he's been nonstop bitter for decades, you can tell by his face, voice, and what he says, how quickly he gets angry and snarky. They're both so sick they don't even realize it, both think they come across as superstars in their own way, both are incredibly selfish and narcissistic. These are the kind of guys our government hires to do the dirty work of controlling free thinkers like us.

               Likely 911 was way over their heads. Even Bush didn't know much about the inside machinations, I doubt. I don't even know how much Cheney knew. They did know the intended end game. I'm sure it was Mossad/CIA. Rumsfeld may have known some of the inside stuff, don't know.

                 Thanks, I remember most of this stuff, this is one of the better videos on it. It's all quite amazing. For me to embrace all of what is suggested here, it would have to be taken to a more spiritual (demonic) level, but I'm not at all unwilling to go there, as many here on Voat are. The devil is "the god of this present evil world." Albeit he is leashed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                 6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

                  Whoa you kind of blew me away with that quote from the New Testament. The Last Temptation of Christ for me is one of two cruxes of Jesus' story, the crucifixion itself being the other.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There is more to the Last Temptation than is told in the Bible. There was a famous
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ">
                   book
                  </a>
                  about it "The Last Temptation of Christ". Scorcese made it into a
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(film)">
                   movie.
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Very powerful stuff. Turning to Christianity later in life has blessed me with a different perspective that I feel more fortunate of as time goes on. The traditional Jesus we think of today is far different that the real human being than lived among us all those years ago.

                   I have heard of the famed Scorsese movie but haven't seen it. Yes I went through a spiritual conversion experience myself. Hitting rock bottom is a blessing in disguise :)  "I had perished, had I not perished." Good to hear.

                 Yes, I simply mean they knew only to certain levels of how everything was pulled off, planes, passengers, CGI, Norad, how the towers came down (which wasn't explosives IMO but something else, see Dr. Judy Wood). Bush expertise is/was quite limited. He was my governor for a long time. Not the brightest guy. I'm sure he was given a certain limited amount of info. His dad on the other hand was much more cunning and diabolical. Papa Bush either allowed, or ordered, the death of his "friend," who was Russian ex Oswald handler, just before Senate hearings on the matter, it's interesting to see the letters back and forth from each.

             They may be using Cynthia as a front for credibility and trust, much like Sibel Edmonds is leveraged. and they could be using this campaign as a way to avoid a real awakening, and identify or separate the groups within the groups.

             Steele reveals both truth and disinformation with keen selectivity, and stays on the surface while changing subjects to avoid deep interrogation, and his solutions are the main problem. He seems weak and controlled. None of these "investigators" seem to be in charge. Who is the Alpha in this group?
            </p>
            <p>
             They should be supported as an entry point from any topic, like InfoWars, only to then lead people to the real truth, although it is understandable why some people believe they hurt more than help. A real litmus test for all of them is if they will investigate Racine, Wisconsin, and if they know how that is connected to the bigger picture. Everyone needs to understand the real story here, and be careful to not accept compartmentalized compromises. This is a war of Good and Evil. Ignorance and complicity enable evil.

              I've always felt that Robert David Steele wants fame. He tries to be on any podcast or video possible. He keeps saying that Trump should call him. As if he could save Trump. I truly believe that he was one of the anons. The one that kept saying ask his buddy Robert. Or Bob (nickname for Robert). I've seen that other places too. I think it's him that makes those posts. Now he backs George Webb and acts like he's doing a great job.

            Steele, just as every other ex-CIA media horny celeb propaganda pusher, just that: a dis-info that spills some truths that are known in circles already and are to be popped anyways, with dis-info to steer you all off-track. They are all the same. No exception. Big website. Media horny. Army of yes-man minions. The whole jizz, the whole 9 yards.

             CIA-MOSSAD nexus has been present since the MOSSAD was created in 1949.

             In fact, ALL alphabet intel agencies are basically tentacles of the CIA.

              No, the British were responsible for the creation of the CIA and the Mossad. You need to go back to CampX in Canada for their original training camp. It's believed that Ian Flemming and Roald Dahl (among others) trained there.

              I would argue that all alphabet agencies are tentacles of the Holy See.

               One thing to consider, per Cynthia McKinney, is that every Congress member who lasts has signed a pledge to put Israel FIRST before the US. This is actually true. So Mossad is almost more American than the CIA.

            First off, I am not aware of many pizzagate researchers who are financially capable to do what Webb has claimed he can do.
Second, this is not a game. Webb is treating this like a reality show. Each segment that he tapes is like he alone survived being "kicked off" the island.  Dedicated pizzagate researchers do not have the time nor the insincerity to play games.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this Steele guy is promoting Webb, then I think it's safe to say Steele is in on the Webb game.

             It seems it is Steele who cannot do proper research. Webb has revealed or discovered
             <em>
              anything
             </em>
             as far as I know, he just repeats things from Voat, 4chan, Reddit and YouTube as far as I know.

            they are both mental cases. Seriously, probably bipolar or something. Be kind to yourself and ignore their drama queen crap.  or at least only consider it for entertainment value. If either idiot had any real influence, they would be arresting people or silenced by now.

            Anyone who says that officials and their handlers involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption should not be held accountable for their crimes should be questioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            The litmus test remains for both George Webb and Robert David Steele - Investigate Racine, Wisconsin. Steele previously acknowledged he had inside information regarding corruption linked to Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, Scott Walker, John McCain, Clintons, Weiner, Schumer, and others, but would not reveal details. He also claimed that Reince Priebus is gay, and that a video allegedly existed of Trump raping and murdering a young underage girl (Mary). Then he said no one should go to jail.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin is real. It is a hub for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Comey, McCabe, Lynch, Kadzik and others stonewalled the investigations. It is linked to Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development, Viruses and Vaccines, Community Policing, Human Trafficking and Harvesting, Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, the mafia, and Sanctuary city status. The Awan brothers are in Racine also. The airport and harbor are closely controlled. The elite are involved in pedo crimes, and corrupt officials are suddenly resigning and running scared amid allegations of abuse. Racine is a Bellwether county with ties to the most powerful people and the most valuable resources in the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth is coming out. The question is why are so many people who claim to be investigating the truth about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption so afraid to investigate Racine, Wisconsin?

            Zzzzzz who cares? You are pretty fixated on Webb. I've only heard him mention pizzagate once and you know, the more methods the better. Hit them at all sides.

             Oh thanks for weighing in, if you don't want to help fact check and don't care, no need to even open up the post. There are tons of posts I don't care about. That's why I rarely comment.

               So his 10 posts per day to his youtube channel must REALLY feel like propaganda to you. It does to me too, that's why it's a huge concern to me. There is nothing i hate more than propaganda, except for an infiltrator in the truth community.

                Not saying GW is legit or not, but it's overkill how you make smear posts about him all the time. It kind of make you look like a shill dude. Youtube is a big site and it's easy to not have Webb in my feed, but you're clogging up this thread with what looks like a personal beef. Dirt Dancing montages of them and all. Just air your laundry in the seth rich thread or make an I Hate George Webb subthread

                 This post was a request to fact check - I wanted help checking to see of Steele's claims against us based on the Moccoby investigation, as well as his claims in favor of Webb, were supported by the facts. If we did find out, and i think we did, that Steele's word isn't worth much, especially as it relates to (non famous) pizzagate researchers, that's an important hing to learn, and to make very clear to all so we won't be tricked by Steele in the future.

                   It's not a grudge, and guess what? George is part of the fucking traffickers, not the opposite - and if people aren't aware of this yet, i'm not done TALKING ABOUT IT

                    All your music videos on George ring out paid shill. They did the same shit with all the other youtube guys. Where is the evidence that he is a trafficker? Him saying he is ok with "light" organ harvesting and "light" child brownstoning does not show that he is a trafficker. If you have evidence on him spill it!

                     He supports the old rat lines. And you continue to support him. We're done here, sir. Thank you for weighing in. I don't need to hear how unhappy you are with my posts again, i'll make a little post it note so i never forget. You can go back to commenting on Very Important Posts like Katy Perry passing out 2 years ago.

                      Haha thanks for researching my comments. I don't support George btw, I think about what he says when he's not rambling, talking in circles drunk, and making non-sequiturs. I'm just curious about he is saying sometimes, he's not gospel. I didn't like what he said about keeping rat lines either. But it doesn't mean everything else he is saying is untrue. Doesn't make it true either. Could be complete fiction, how should I know? The alternative is CNN and all that other garbage. See ya.

                       I have to admit, i have always hated disinfo agents, limited hangouts, people who want to fool, deceive, and in this case distract innocent people. He and his online army have inserted themselves into every corner of our community - we've even got his "OMG 911 is coming!" latest declaration on the front page of v/ pizzgate right now. Even though he has been shown to LIE and use shoddy sources. No other time on this sub do we quote people who have been shown to be disinfo agents, except Webb. And anyone who has a problem with Webb gets their ass handed to them in the comments section. I do feel as if there is more educating to do when it comes to just who Webb is... and I know some people are working on good videos that will make things more clear. Until he is no longer quoted here as a source, I still have work to do.

                        I keep telling you, Webb critics get "their asses handed back" because you guys phrase your comments like Correct The Record smear employees. It makes you sound insane and paid. If you have contradictory evidence to what Webb reports, post it in a professional manner and drop the hyperbole and editorializing. No more scatterbrained rants, just the facts ma'am

                         You, like Webb, have no sources, and I don't even see an  example of what you're saying. Do you really want to claim that all who have critiques of Webb sound batty? Realize you are the only one complaining about this post, whereas there is a slew of comments form rational people who agree with me, and are on to him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         You can look in my submissions and on the Webb related posts, scroll through the comments and you will feel a bit silly having made this sweeping, baseless claim.

                         I actually thought you'd come back to me with, "yeah I get it, I hate diinfo agents too. Glad someone is keeping 'em honest. Thanks for the good work." Because more than a handful of people do say that to me, and many people here know damn well i'm not a shill, and that i have been complaining about using him as a source for as long as i've been here. Only this week do I receive an ass whooping for doing so.

                          Get a grip. Posting videos of George Webb and Jason Goodman smiling together set to the Dirty Dancing soundtrack and calling it proof is just bizarre. I don't like disinfo either, it is a waste of time, but so is trying to get someone to step out of themselves to see what they are doing from another person's perspective. What has he even said that is incorrect to you?

                              Three things... One: Steele disavowed those guys, and he only said he likes the way they are knocking on doors over the internet investigating pizzagaters do.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Two: Your post doesn't even compare the same things. George isn't looking into pizzagate, the only crossover is seth rich which is coincidence, so your original post doesn't even make sense.

                             <p>
