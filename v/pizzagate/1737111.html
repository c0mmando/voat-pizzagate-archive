<p>This is depressing and sadly not surprised.
 Where do you think all these missing kids are ending up? Sacrificial lambs I\'m guessing.. Sold off to the network for prostitution and worse.
Merkel is a monster and the public are taking to the streets calling her the new Hitler.. And no MSN reporting all this..
Ive been doing the numbers.. Hundreds of thousands of children are going missing worldwide every year.. This is beyond an epidemic! But its nothing new either.. Were just becoming much more aware of it..
Im so despondent lately.. I don\'t see a solution.. I don\'t have any faith in Trump or anyone.. I mean what can any one person or group really do? They hold all the cards.. The weapons, the tech, the networks, the media and govts... They (cia iluminati etc) hold all the cards.. Blackmail, threats, murder and financial ruin await anyone who speaks up or takes a stand. 
They control dems and Republicans liberals conservatives and the whole game!
Lets get real people.. No one and no white hat group is going to save us.. To really take down the global satanic cabal would take a massive worldwide effort involving thousands of organised people.. But the organized ones are the corrupt ones.. 
We have an energy loop here farming humans physically and emotionally.. And its the same beings in New avatar bodies lifetime after lifetime.. Were all here repeating the same game and battles over and over again!
WTF do we do about this?!!!
 Ive been looking into this for 25+ years and Ive heard every kind of hopeful message about white hats and galactic Brothers and others here to save the day.. But its always the same.. They are all full of shit!! 
Ok so there has been many low and mid level arrests recently.. Yes this is true.. Maybe there is hope in all this.. I know there are many others and good people in positions of power (well some anyway) whole really want to change all this and are disgusted by whats going on.. 
But all this sacrificing has been going on for thousands if years.. What do we do?
We have knowledge and information and hackers on our side.. We need military on our side.. We need strength and organisation.</p>',

            One day people are going to have to face the ugly reptilian truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why they start these wars.
They can generate far more prosperity just by being at peace and helping other Nations thrive
But they want to toture and eat these children.
So our world will never know anything but injustice and horror until we rise up--all good hearted people--and fight back
It's going to happen anyway

            It is very hard to not be despondent. At the same time it is very hard for people to believe in a gracious and merciful God in the face of such evil. Many have posted that the very leaders of prominent churches have not or do not even address what is going on. This is very true of course. I have made many posts on the Vatican involvement in all that is and has happened. Not because of bias toward Catholicism but of the reality of historical account of Rome and founding of the Vatican itself. It is very important to understand this involves the crucifiction. The truth of this amazing sacrifice. The promise to us all. The hope we can share together if we begin to understand these incredible truths without yelling at each other. TPTB are trying more than anything to hide this truth. That there was only one sacrifice that ever counted. Yes it was a blood sacrifice and yes He chose to allow it to happen for us and then looked up towards Heaven and said, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do." After he spoke his last words and said "It is finished."  At that precise moment the earth shook, the veil spilt, the temple cracked. Time changed from B.C. (Before Christ) to A.D. (After Death)
2017 years later here we are.

            Thanks for this post. I've been feeling much of the same. I keep trying to wrap my brain around the scale of all of this and the days of restful sleep are gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's just say for the sake of argument that the good people of the world completely expose these evil networks for what they are. What can we do for these kids? Where will they go? We cannot simply put them back into the systems that failed them, but that is exactly what is happening in now. One institution is tarnished and the kids are moved and abused by another. Maybe people will open their homes to these kids, but are any of us prepared to help deprogram them?
           </p>
           <p>
            I also keep thinking how can we help the children that are not missing, but are victims being groomed by their own families to become the predators of the future. How will they even be identified?

            What your saying could account for a certain percentage of the perps.. but what is "sra"? Its clear from certain books written by those who survived abuse that there are well organised rings of people involved.. if you take the elite psychopaths, those that are in the upper percentile of IQ, they tend to be well organised and working together with others of their kind.. and likely are yes sex addicts and so on.. Charlie Sheen is a good example of a sex addict who also turned pedo and by the sounds of testimony from his ex, he got more depraved in his porn addictions over time and also more violent and aggressive and unstable.

            I really hope Benjamin Fulford is right about the white hats/military/White Dragon Society alliance, against the Bloodlines...but I have on idea. And every week is like "Next month, the arrests will happen and the global rest (jubilee)" will occur.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with you exactly! I feel like consciousness is brewing and MANY of us are aware of these Babylonian Khazarian snake oil salesmen...but yeah, I don't know about anybody coming into save us. I think that there are probably multiple Illuminati faction groups. I think the Gnostic Illuminati are the more meritocratic minded. The bloodlines are evil, through and through. We've seen this through their many many agendas and misadventures.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what to do??? Especially when 60% of the population would think you're insane. I guess just trying to speak out as much as possible and connect with like minded people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only realm they don't control is our minds.  Think about that! That's incredibly profound. Until they develop chips to make us all asleep sheep, at least we have that. That is the only hope for the human race, is our knowledge and the actions we take in this lifetime.

             I have looked into the Fulford/Wilcock/Drake/Cobra/Nesara and related stories since 2003, and honestly it has not changed a bit in the last 13 frigging years! Its always just around the corner, were sooo close now.. blah blah blah.. this is whats happening behind the scenes.. blah blah blah.. and it never amounts to anything.. ANd my theory has been that this whole ongoing narrative of the white knights/hats/ascended masters/space brothers/breakaway good guys/SSP Alliance/Galactic federation etc etc.. are all just different versions of the same game, which is designed to give us just enough hope and keep us waiting and hoping that were gona be saved any day/week/month/year now, and do nothing to free ourselves from the system.. That is what they are really afraid of!
An educated public that simply stops playing their games. Stops paying taxes that fund criminal activities! Its that frigging easy.. non compliance.. but to do that we need to be an alliance of sorts ourselves.. and I guess we are.
They are afraid of us simply all standing up and saying no! enough of this corruption and BS.
So anyway they dangel just enough carrots in front of our faces to keep us occupied and waiting patiently for our white knights to save the day while we sit back and do sweet fuck all to save our own arses and release ourselves from the slavery of modern fiat money and 40-60 hour working weeks and mortgages and credit to the hilt. They have made us addicted to their systems of control.
We have to actually take responsibility in numbers for our future. And maybe just maybe its happening.. cause there are just enough of those like us in all walks of life who have had enough of this BS and maybe just maybe shits gona get real and these sacrificing blood drinking sick frigging energy vampires will get booted the fuck off this plane of existence.. that would be a nice day :)
Or maybe we will all just get over this addiction to physical reality and go back to where we came from! How about them apples.. or are you too hooked on your chocolate and sex and other worldy pleasures that .. hang on im getting wayyy off track here.. apologies

              Lol no worries. I feel you! Yeah I think they are all just factions of the same sick game. I think there are some good guys in the mix, but nowhere near what the alternative media claims.

               yea theres gotta be a bunch of good guys in there.. some of them will be getting fed false info in a coordinated way.. this is what i feel is happening with David and Corey.. Corey is getting synthetic telepathic messages and programming I recon, and Wilcock is getting fed false info in a coordinated way from seemingly separate sources but really they are not.
Recently they talked about releasing of patents on free energy technologies etc and said hey so and so corroborated what our other source was saying about there been 5700 suppressed patents, when in fact that info has already been public knowledge for years. So they get two separate sources to say the same thing and then make a song and dance about it saying, oh hey both of these sources are saying the same thing it must be important and true.. This is the game they seem to play with David Wilcock.. I think hes a nice guy and intelligent but i feel hes been played and "managed" as best as they can to steer the narrative in their favor... or maybe im overly cynical.
David is correct about a bunch of stuff and energetically i feel in relation to our collective awakening and reaching some kind of new threshold in world consciousness.

             They certainly do their best to control our minds, through media, tv, movies, conditioning of all sorts.. but yes a certain percentage are resilient to their hive-like mind control and influence.. It depends on blood type, dna and our own eternal spirits energy weather or not we are to think critically or not.. there are different breeds you could say inhabiting human bodies.. many are hive minded and they will believe authority figures.. its built into their dna slave programs.. engineered in.. but even though we inhabit human bodies, we are more resilient and are able to think independently of the heard.. something like that.. some say we have two man "races" of human style beings on this planet.. pre adamites and adamites.. the adamites souls are more like group souls.. they have a kind of collective intellect.. we are also tapped into that collective instinct, but it does not rule us.. we have a rebellious nature and do not accept such hive mind thought streams as our own.

            You're most welcome! We absolutely need to be able to identify the disinformation agents first. It is vital to our case and to this investigation. If we can't, then we'll be going down false roads that will lead us straight to dead ends and misinfo.

            Wasn't this the type of thing that Monica Peterson was murdered for investigating? Merkel seems to be running her own Clinton Foundation in her own home country to boot. Here is to hoping her people drag her out in the street and obliterate her like a pack of wild dogs.

            I am sorry, but I have to correct you. I am from Germany. Within the last 35 years we are missing 11.000 children in total. Don't say that doesn't scare me, but we need to stay with the numbers. In fact, we can't evaluate how many refugees are missing because we don't have a system for that. Too many get lost, lose their passports, etc. I know we have to be aware. But we shouldn't change the facts.

             Yes you are right, I havnt done any in depth look into this from the situation in germany except to read of some rumors of Merkel been into black magic and basically been one nasty piece of work. Also that the british royal family have huge amounts of land in areas in germany and that there is a possible link to them, an organisation that organises aid money for refuges and missing kids. Much digging needs to be done.. but that article i posted has a number of connections outlined..

            These might not be real kids though, in Europe its considered racist to question the age of a rapefugee.  So 40 year olds are put in foster care and in a primary school because they say they are 7 or 8 because it helps them commit crimes without repercusions or maybe some other reason.

            Lanning is a Satanist and a disinfo agent. Ted Gunderson exposed him and it's all in the Franklin Cover up file dump.

            His work has been used as a guideline for law enforcement agencies, including the FBI. Now we know why there is so much negligence and corruption going on in LE. They're being brainwashed by Lanning.

            And organization gets subverted. Mass chaos and rolling heads makes a better impression. That is why they always say it is the wrong thing to do. They have enslaved us, torture, farm and murder children, use the media they own to propgandize us, murder those who reveal too much truth, steal from us and force us into their banking system. As if we are savages for taking to the streets and dragging them out with violence. It is what any society with any backbone does. What is left for them to do to get people past the breaking point?

            Excellent post. I dispise Merkel. Another Hillary. Terrible Human being. She has sold her country out for her own personal gain and inclusion into the globalist secret societies. She needs to be dragged through the streets and lynched. Europeans are not like Americans, they fight back and even attack the police.

             Merkel will lose the election if she does not change her stance on open borders.  At the moment, she's just a puppet for the globalists.  The Germans are sick and tired of everyone but Germans deciding what is best for the Germans.  I hope every single voter in Germany decides to become a full-on nationalist.

              This aint about borders and immigration.
As soon as they get all the children and young slaves they can--all of of a sudden the "right" in Europe are going to rise to all power. Then they are going to kill the Immigrants.

            I couldn't hear you more, and my sentiments are the same except this: by being woke, by taking our power - the power of knowledge and awareness back, we steal strength from THEM. It's the fight of retaining our energy, power and the resulting freedom to do GOOD. Whether you are religious or not, WE all have to continue to beat to this drum...the one that will NEVER beat like their drum.

            I know a lot of people feel like David Icke is crazy, but he did a great presentation posted on YouTube that goes over some of the crap we know already: every POTUS since Carter has been elected because they cavort with and will be puppetry by the elite, etc. The second half is amazing, though, about how we can move forward, without fear, in strength because we are all extraordinary, and we believe others are too! No one is a relegated to the bottom of the food chain in this reality. And it's the one we create by staying bonded, raising awareness, and fighting the good fight for each and every extraordinary trafficked man, woman and child. Staking woke and not becoming a sleeping drone is the very first and I think most compelling part of creating an empowered reality.

             ive been a big supporter of icke over the years.. he was a huge influence to me really waking up back around 2000 to 2006.. even shortly after 2000 Alex Jones(Bill) films were my first intro to all this.. then it was Chris Everard's films after that.. then I started reposting them and uploading on my webspace.. this was before youtube days.. Then our city started getting hit really hard with chemtrails.. it was suddenly very noticeable.. and we were filming and reporting on a lot of it.. we used to red pill groups of people by holding free documentary film nights downtown in the capital city.. I remember when we played 911 loose change and even that was a big deal for people new to these things, then we played "illuminati" Chris Everards first film.. watched many wide eyed people leave that theatre.. it was interesting times back then.. it wasn't online.. but the internet was where we were accessing these "subversive conspiratorial" (for the time) films and using dialup to download them over a week.. and then distribute free DVDs at our film screenings..  we would do midnight raids around town putting up posters all over the city advertising our film nights.. bomb downtown with huge and small posters on ATMs, street posts and anywhere there was a spare surface..
We had hundreds turn up to every film night.. over 300 sometimes.. it was a blast.. I still think this is a good way to red pill people in your local city or neighbourhood.. when your sitting down to watch a doco in a theatre like setting.. you have peoples full attention for those 2 hours.. We also used to do open mic and discussions afterwards.. you never knew who might turn up.. we had dark hooded cloak wearing satanic type weirdos turn up sometimes and stand up the back.. 
I also used to put DVDS in the local librarys on the shelves for people to randomly find and take home.. Alex Jones docos and Chris Everard and Icke also.. thats what we had back then to go with..
             <br/>
             We were a very active group waking people up.. that was during my time in the city.. It was satisfying to see people waking up in front of your eyes..
These days its all very impersonal and done behind a keyboard..

              Thanks for writing this.    Your post helped me realize how  we are making history - here and now.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the future 10 years, 30, 90 yrs....  kids will wonder what it was life for us...   when the internet came and then the Great Wake Up
             </p>
             <p>
              But will this be the Great Wake Up?
             </p>
             <p>
              I am keeping a journal of this great turmoil.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the people wake up, any documentation of this time period that we keep or  write can turn into a best seller.    (Much is lost, changed  and deleted from archive.is!)
             </p>
             <p>
              If they don't Wake Up, I'll have the documentation to tell young people "what happened"  and how "we tried... just not hard enough".
             </p>
             <p>
              Your writing is an amazing historical observation.  I'm going to copy / paste keep it  if you don't mind.

               Awakenaware and 11-11...I believe you are onto something with your historical perspectives, and I appreciate you sharing. I had no idea what was going on, but was taught to question everything by Hippie parents. I spent decades suffering from an autoimmune disease I didn't know I had...but my energy was low and capacity for anything "extra" was limited. I started a page called Breaking Awake...and would love to have some help with it. Your historical perspectives, record keeping, etc would be wonderful. The page is under design, and a good convo in advance to get it up and running would be great. Help on what to post, and some bloggers would be awesome. Please let me know if you are interested. I have had this under construction for awhile, but have spent most of my time learning about what you both already know. I'm rambling, but couldn't keep up with all of this on my own. Let me know. My goal is obviously to help others Break Awake...and can be done in a variety of ways. Goes back to "hiding behind a keyboard," but this time maybe that's how we have to approach it...getting our e-posters up, etc.

            This is horrific.  You are correct - we DO need strength and organization.  The very same NGOs working though Merkel in Germany are working here - and if we don't stop them, we're going to see the same thing.  For more views on Germany, listen to Jeff Rense's interview with "Meral."  Sounds all too familiar -

            Now why is it that, when I post information about human trafficking, the moderators delete my post as not pertaining to PizzaGate, but you got away with this?! BTW, I have been addressing just what you said:

            We need mass awakenings and it is happening! We need to talk about it and continue to research and post and talk!
We will not give up though it is a journey that also takes a toll on us, we must help each other. 
We will figure it out, for the children who are hurting at the these sick bastards right now
We will keep fighting! There is no other option. More people will keep waking up to this.
Love and peace to you all.

            I know, just when you think it couldn't get any worse, you read something like this.  I can't believe fellow humans can do what they're doing and sleep at night. According to the video below the article, this has been going on for 1000-2000 years, maybe longer. The narrator skips around a bit but goes through symbolism of obelisks, gargoyles, stone statues, etc. and what they are/were used for. He's awoke and mentions pizzagate in passing.

            Its not all doom n gloom.. When others have posted despondent comments sometimes I've jumped in to remind them hey the Cabal are in some ways desperate and everything they do always backfires to some degree.. I know that.. Im asking what can we do.. Knowing a lot of the bigger picture now.. How big this is.. What options can we explore other than what we've already covered? We need to think out of the box.. We need to organise in some way that doesnt use the cabals Resources (Google etc) and so on.. Are there any hacking groups working on MSN hacks.. I mean it can't be that hard to hack satellite feeds etc.. Just an idea I'm putting out there.. MSN Website hacks.. And so on..

            I put the deaths/prostitution/trafficking/abuse of these innocent children directly at the foot of fucking George Soros with his globalist mates, and the war mongers who put their desperation for power, oil, money, wealth before the human rights of innocents.

             God is still here.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm going to turn this banana around and look at it from another angle:
            </p>
            <p>
             Since we don't know where we came from or where we are going after this life, we don't know the point of life
            </p>
            <p>
             Since we don't know the point, we do not know what life is "supposed to be".
            </p>
            <p>
             It may be an exercise in forgiveness (a one time shot or a break out room in the convention of eternity).
            </p>
            <p>
             I tell little kids this &amp; have to remind myself ....
             <br/>
             God's brain is bigger than ours.  He knows the future.  We do not understand very much about anything.  We have to trust him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The topic of forgiveness woke me up this morning and strikes me as being an important part of this? life?.  (I could be wrong, but who would know and how?)
            </p>
            <p>
             Not necessarily for the satan worshipping abuser, or the "christian" abuser, etc - but for the abused.
            </p>
            <p>
             Abused people "lose" their life because the abuse effects everything in their life for always.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, their "this sacred life" has been stolen.
            </p>
            <p>
             We believe our time on earth is sacred because we see the Handiwork of God in every intricate leaf   ....or a single cell
(Remember a poem  or film that expounds upon that and you got the idea)
            </p>
            <p>
             All of that is great.
            </p>
            <p>
             But then think about...   If the earth is a beautiful "work" of the Creator, a color crayon drawing, imagine where the Creator Lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             It makes this world look like a splotch of grease in a  Walmart parking lot.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you want to try to feel motivated to forgive, search this on youtube: 
    i went to hell forgiveness
            </p>
            <p>
             and listen to the stories.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hell is not worth unforgiveness no matter what is taken from you in this life
            </p>
            <p>
             The only reason I know this topic is vital and important...
             <br/>
             STORY:    right before (close X relative) died, I watched someone  steal his business, his entire lifework (a building, pension, etc) and tell him to "never come back".     He lost everything he had built but as he lay on his death bed, he said -  I forgive him.
            </p>
            <p>
             For him, it was simple.   This life was    meant to   pass away.   This is all temporary.    We can't take it with us.     It is not important enough to let it stand in our way of getting into heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing is.
            </p>
            <p>

              Wow...just wow. It is the hardest thing to do and why? Just like these people that have info that would awaken the world and they don't share it why? What is the worst thing that would happen? You meet the higher power Jesus..whatever you call him and you have a fantastic story of heroism and paradise right? As you said you cant take it with you so surrender. Give what you can to make this world better, truer and forget the rest. YOU CANT IT WITH YOU. If only people got this.

             Have you read The Book of Revelation? Have you read where it says your own family will betray you to death? That iniquity will abound and the love of many will wax cold? That it will get so bad that flesh will no longer be able to live? This is it! This is so bad that it is hard for people to even be able to live. You're right we can't stop what is coming, but we can do what we can do. They don't win in the end. There is something everyone can do that will really help. If you go to a Catholic Church where the priests molest kids, stop attending. Many of the churches are false, like the Baptist churches, stop attending them! This will do a lot more than you could ever imagine. The goal is to separate from them. Get away from them. People are waking up and it is doing a LOT of good that they are! Then just fight them any way you can. Save food. Help your loved ones if they haven't turned on you. Get to know Jesus Christ it will do you a lot of good! Protect your kids as long as you can! Then pray pray pray!!!

              Thank you for these words. Especially about the Baptist churches. I am currently attending one (my in laws church) and it is absolutely dead! I am in a very strange place spiritually. I don't agree with most of what they teach. I'm a former seventh day Adventist and don't agree with some of their teachings either. I despise that the Catholic Church has infiltrated most churches and I feel that these infiltrated churches deny that it's happened. I'm only going for my kid but honestly I think I'd be better off in a home study group that could outright question everything. I'm also ordering the Apocrypha and the  Pseudephigrapha because if TPTB wanted it hid, I want to judge for myself.

               I would strongly suggest finding a sturdy, doctrine correct home church if you can. Read Micah 7:5 and follow it's advice.

               Ghost, I didn't read your full response and noticed you want to order the Apocrypha... you can order and read these, but these are definitely not Holy Spirit inspired and for a good reason. This isn't some recent TPTB that wanted it hidden... it was left out of the Bible b/c believers found it not to be inspired by God; it's not hard to find out why.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you know your church history it was actually the Church of Rome at the Council of Trent in 1545 that attempted to make the Apocrypha a part of the Bible today. Here you are rationalizing reading it yet the very people behind the elite level pedophilia globally were the very ones wanting to include it on the same level of inspiration as the OT... see how easy it is to be deceived?
              </p>
              <p>
               Just to give you a background on the Church of Rome (the Catholic church) and why they attempted to include the Apocrypha in the canon of the OT - It was a consequence of 1) Rome's exalted doctrine of oral tradition, 2) its view that the church creates Scripture, and 3) its acceptance of certain controversial ideas (esp. the doctrines of purgatory, indulgences, and works-rigtheousness as contributing to justification) that were derived from passages in the Apocrypha. The Council of Trent was the Roman Catholic response to Martin Luther and other leaders of the Protestant Reformation, which had begun in 1517.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is why it's so important to be a part of a good church that puts emphasis on the scriptures and not merely a heavy emphasis on speaking in tongues (like Pentecostal churches do)... speaking in tongues is not a sign of anyone's salvation nor a prerequisite for it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, on your comment about starting a home study group... that's all fine but IF and ONLY IF you use it to supplement your church that you are attending. Jesus and the disciples make it ABSOLUTELY clear in several places of the NT that recurrent church attendance is the model to follow and gathering with other followers under the leadership of what Paul wrote to Timothy as guidance as well as 1st and 2nd Corinthians for other Churchly functions and ordering.
              </p>
              <p>
               With all that said, the Apocrypha, together with other post canonical literature (esp. the pseudepigrapha, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the writings of Philo and Josephus, the Targums, and the earliest rabbinical literature) can be helpful in additional ways. They provide the earliest interpretations of the OT literature; they explain what happened in the time between the two Testaments; and they introduce customs, ideas, and expressions that provide a helpful background when reading the NT.

               There are several non-denominational churches that seemed to be well equipped and are biblically focused that have spawned from many of these Baptist churches b/c they've noticed the same thing you have.... if you need a good example of some you should visit the website of Christ Fellowship (out of Miami) and watch some of the sermons... they are definitely God-inspired and focus on biblical accuracy.

              <p>
               Another that I have found to be of the same caliber (if you want examples) Calvary in Ft. Lauderdale has been biblically accurate since I've been attending it so far (I'm pretty new there). They have TONS of videos online and LIVE stream all their services which is really quite awesome b/c you can be anywhere in the world and watch. They also have chat rooms when you watch with pastors and people to help you pray... They place a heavy focus on outreach as well, which is not the only prerequisite but it is a sign that the church is biblically and spiritually inspired.

               I'm sorry, what are you ordering? I feel the same way...grew up Catholic but hated it because it was mostly ritual (even as a teen, I would say "stand up, sit down, stand up, sing, sit down, kneel, sit down, stand up, sing. Where is the message? I want to learn about the Bible!) I've attended a Baptist church and others, and while I learned more about the Bible, I did not agree with ideologies...mostly those that are judgemental, since I don't believe Jesus would behave or respond that way. Anyway, I'm still interested in exploring my faith outside of religion, and would like to know what I can study or do myself. Thank you!

                The "hidden" books of the Bible. The Apocrypha and pseudepigrapha. Honestly, I learned more in the Adventist Church than I did in the Pentecostal churches I grew up in. They go in depth. Especially about the prophets. But seriously, I just feel like today's churches have totally lost their way. For example, the Baptist Church I attend (I won't join even though they've pleaded because I won't lie and profess to believe all their doctrine) has been searching for a pastor for over a year now. We've had some really good ones come in. They rejected one guy because... Get this... They didn't like the way he drank water. Seriously. I'm a faithful tithe payer, so I'm trying but just am lost when it comes to a church home. And I believe in holding brothers and sisters in the Lord accountable. But the Baptists are among the worst hypocritical judges I've seen.

                 I would agree w you on all counts.  Have been trying to find a church home for 10 years...going for my kid...upset that none of the attendees appear to be awakened at all about the spiritual battles that we are currently up against...trying to see past the people in the pews and focus only on Jesus and His power in my life...
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have been deeply enriched by podcasts of people of similar mind...although even these will disappoint (Hagmann and Hagmann, Russ Dizdar, Sheila Zilinsky, Dave Hodges, etc.) if you don't totally agree w all their viewpoints...
                </p>
                <p>
                 I guess it just comes down to you and Jesus and your relationship and where He leads you.  People are all judgmental - the sin of pride and boastfulness.  loving our fellow man is the most challenging of all trials especially in these times...

              While I know and see those who refuse to recognize evil forces at work, I have never understood those who recognize that satan exists, but refuse to acknowledge that the opposite must then indeed be true and exist. If everyone on this site asked for Jesus to intercede we would see results! There is power in His name.

            This is how so many of us feel. We MUST remain positive We MUST organize. I know, HOW? Little by little the word is getting out. I agree that because of the systemization of this evil it seems impossible to rout out. But people are waking up. Maybe I shouldn't but I do have a little faith in Trump. Do you have a link to share about how you got the number of missing kids?

             I agree about organizing. They will have less opportunity to deplete our energy and break us down if we literally form a chain of awakened people who have joined in energy and heart.

              You're saying out loud what each and every one of us are feeling and thinking right now. We all go through this feeling that "we're losing the fight" at some points in time. You're doing great, buddy. I mean, to have been awake for 25 years says a whole lot about a person. Kudos to you.
             </p>

              We might have lost many battles, but it don't mean we're going to lose the war. This is a marathon and not a sprint. Bravery and courage is in your blood and in the blood of millions of us. We just need more people to wake up. Isn't that what we're doing now? Give yourself a pat on the back and march on.

               thanks yea your right.. i get cynical.. for many reasons.. have had some victories of sorts however.. half of me doesnt even really need to get too caught up in human affairs, but its just the really dark shit that I cannot accept or allow to continue.
Im an information specialist.. a scribe.. a distiller of truth and lies. or at least its a role ive decided to take on while im here. Im a ghost in this reality.. I have no normal life in the usual sense.. I keep to myself but am plugged in to the neural net 24/7. But I also can do normal stuff like go swimming in the river, drink coffee at a cafe, enjoy times with friends.. but all the rest of life.. I stay away from. Have very low over heads and can leave with one bag in a days notice if I needed to. I have no kids or dependants, no pet even though I love animals.
Im a sensitive, I feel everything, its better to have my own space.. I need that. No idea why im writing all this.. I guess its cause im fully anon here.

                Thanks for sharing. I did share experiences here too and it's probably because of the anonymity also. However different we can be in our lifestyles and routines, we still are very much connected, because of the common goal we share. I mean, people from all walks of life coming together to fight a great evil together? That is bigger than anything I've personally experienced and I'm very proud to be a part of it. Peace :)

                 Whats happening to children now in this reality just makes me so sad/mad.. and other more philosophical stuff like "where are we" and the implications of that just totally blow my mind these days..

                  Kind soul. We need to channel our positive intentions and our attention to a particular mission. Once we get from A to B, we'll think about getting from B to C. If we plan too much in advance, it takes away from our motivation and short sighting and we start to stray and ramble. I've seen too many misdirection and distraction attempts coming into play to 'delay' or 'weigh in' on our investigation in order sabotage our gathering of evidence. I'm pushing back and so are many other voaters :)

                 Indeed..Ive been red pilled so many times now.. it amazes me every time.. im not religious.. but i know this reality is nothing like what weve been sold from birth to now.. nothing like it.. we live in a fantasy creation.. a made up version of what is. But even that people are waking up to in droves..

            We know Breitbart had incriminating video of Obama that he bragged about in public shortly before he was murdered.. He let his anger get the better of him.. This keeps happening.. All talk and no action.. Why warn the elites? Just release evidence if you have it.. Stop messing around with all their talk of oh gotta do this right and so on.. For fuck's sake!
