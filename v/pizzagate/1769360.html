            I happen to understand what you are trying to say about Jones and his involvement with pizzagate, but the perception I get is all that material is a superficial overlay to what WE are
            <em>
             supposed
            </em>
            to perceive. There are MANY more layers to the psyop we are not even conscious of yet. Roger Stone. Anyone hearing that name ought to be awash with red flags. This man was an instrumental friend of Trump's mentor and handler Roy Cohn, that fact alone, without even having much background information on Roy Cohn, should send people's attitudes about Roger Stone to the complete other end of the spectrum and throws a HUGE TURD in the cake batter that is Alex Jones, NONE of them should be trusted for ANYTHING ANYMORE.

            Either way, and whoEVER is working for whom,
            <strong>
             <em>
              this place doesn't take any shit!

            . I have to hand it to you folks, you are a rough and tumble bunch, and an intelligent crowd at that. I am elated that so many people have come here to contribute to this overwhelming egregore that has enveloped our world. You people question everything and are getting quite adept at recognizing the distraction techniques that have been being used on us in gattling fashion. I have seen that many of you are able to sense the nuances reverberating in those that say they have our best interests. I have seen you shake the conscience of those that say they represent us to the core and have taken them to task for their very own fruits, and I have to say, I am proud of you. It is still yet wholly unproven of whom works for whom among the 'truth movement', but the speculation and questioning is enough to keep alive that spark that continues to hold these people accountable and keep them on their toes just long enough to correct their course or face becoming obsolete. For that I have to say
            <strong>
             Thank You

            to this forum.

            I heard the segment and found it encouraging. Let's see where this goes. They're still protecting the DC pedoring for whatever reason, but this aggressive approach to get the pedos is good for now. The big revelation is how the pedos were stopping Trump's staff from clearance.

            They're throwing us a bone while protecting the pedophile satanist elitists. They're trying to sell us on, "Most of these guys don't even like children. They just wanted a legal good time and were drugged and compromised by Deep State." Sorry, we've seen the Podesta emails, the Comet Ping Pong Instagram and the thousands of links and other evidence that revealed a circle of people obsessed with pedophilia, pedophile art, child torture, underground bunkers, kill rooms, child coffins, satanism, satanic art, spirit cooking, feces eating, cannibalism, and lots of pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know our politicians are compromised. We can see it by the insanity of their policies. No doubt some of them were compromised in the way Cernovich describes. However, Pizzagate has revealed that the world is run in large part by extremely wealthy satanic pedophiles who believe in raping, torturing, killing, and eating children - and that's who we want exposed and brought to justice.

             I don't understand how not one compromised person has ever come out and just let it all out and said "We're all compromised, they've got shit on all of us". And if I was one that was drugged and put in compromising positions and photographed I'd say show the pics, I wouldn't spend the rest of my life living a lie and being a puppet because of it.

            Pizzagate is a small corner of pedogate, which we all know is true.
           </p>
           <p>
            If pizzagate was distraction or a false flag, it must been maybe the most retarded distraction ever. Pizzagate has already moved to the area of pedogate and thanks to pizzagate, there are now 100's thousands new people all over the world learning about pedophilia in the highest levels of societies, cases like Finders, Franklin coverup​, Savile, Dutroux Affair, Heath, Hastert, Silsby, human trafficking in general, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            So for me it's really hard to buy that false flag claim.

            Guys, we've seen too much to turn our backs on the children because someone labels it a psyop. It's like false flags where the government issues the order to kill people or blow up bridges...someone is still doing something fucked up, and we won't stop beating the drum for truth. Seriously, I've been here for a long time, I've seen amazing work here, and we have ALL seen messed up stuff. No giving up no matter who says what...we know the deal.

             This probably needs more exposure here on Voat, many of us are new to Cernovich and don't know the history.

            Just remember this: Whenever someone expose and denounce satanic child abuse and paedophilia, this person is fighting the good fight. People, focus!

            Some think that Pizzagate/CPP is a distraction? Fine! I don't agree with them neither. But if at the same time these people expose the satanic pedophiles, they are helping the cause.

            Cernovich seems to think it is all about control [by the deep state].  People are "ruffied" - drugged with rohypnol I assume - and then photographed with naked small children and then compromised - they will do as they are told.  He says the problem is Trump's people can't get security clearance unless they are controllable.  Quite why they don't just go to the police,  say they were drugged and it was a set up, I don't know.  Presumably they would lose all their perks, money, celebrity status, etc - be out of the club.

            He doesn't seem to mention the satanic ritual abuse, murder, blood drinking etc.  More to come on Infowars soon.  Why Infowars and not on his own channel?

              He just thinks blackmail has moved on from infidelity to gay to underage to babes and infants.  I think this is just for the low level soldiers.  The real players look like they are into the whole satanic torture, rape, murder, eating of flesh and drinking of blood of infants and toddlers.  That's how you get into the big boys club!

            That whole interview was kinda retarded. Pizzagate IS Pedogate, they are trying to divert us away from Alefantis - and Alex Jones, Cernovich, and even his guest Craig Sawyer seem to be suddenly acting on what we all know to be true and have for months. Suddenly, everyone cares, now that we have been told Alefantis is "probably innocent" - it was like they read off of voat from 4 months ago for their "breaking" stories. My friend Evelyn Pringle described the exact method of blackmail as what Cernovich described today a year ago on her show. That was not breaking news.

            God, what's not to understand? Of course the case pizzagate is real, everyone knows that including alex jones. Thing is, they turned the TERM into a weapon of psychological warfare, exactly as they did with the term 'conspiracy theory'
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Jones is all about winning the public opinion. And everybody knows you're not going to win that by keeping on shouting that "pizzagate is so real, really!"

             I noticed he did this a while ago. I just can't stand to watch Alex Jones and drama. Does he even mention the step-grandmother offering up her step-granddaughters for entertainment? He was literally in tears when I saw him report on it.

             I noticed his whole staff does it. Maybe they think it protects them from defamation claims? I mean - it totally doesn't - but Epstein is also very litigious when it comes to defamation. He's even suing his victims and their attorneys for defamation.

              Dershowitz's has been losing his defamation cases recently.
              <br/>
              He represented Wynn in this case in CA and NV and lost both times.

            Hmmm. What back and forth.
            <br/>
            1-Were you or were you not sued Alex? Make up your damn mind.
 2-Pizzagate is a distraction that the MSM pushed?  No it was labled fake news but the Podesta code emails and Alefantis' instagram were never addressed.
            <br/>
            3-Yes Mike we know this has to do more with Deep State blackmail than actual kiddy fucking but I am a little worried about the "I was drugged" defense.  Yes that may happen but I worry that will be used to try to stem the outrage that is building. yes we know the 6 media corps are comprimised.  Yes we know Huma and Weiner are not divorcing for protection - duh.
            <br/>
            4-All in all - more back and forth from Alex about how "psyop smart" he's been all along.  Then why the apology Alex?
            <br/>

             Jones was not responding to a lawsuit.   Texas law is you have to notify the person that defamed you are going to sue.  If they don't retract in 30 days they are liable for punitive damages.    So they were not at the lawsuit stage yet

             He was the first (or one of the first?) to alert people through his tweets that Podesta emails sounded like code and that the code was likely about pedophilia. I learned about pizzagate through Cernovitch.

              i learned about it through breitbart before he died, and he was jewish. They haven't figured out anything nerds on the internet didn't figure out 10 years ago, but they want credit for it. Even if they have to attack their own kind, it doesn't matter as long as they control both sides.

             God I hope not... they are trying to control the narrative right now and take credit for busting people they aren't busting?? The only trustworthy person seems to be Trey Gowdy. Has he ever been on Infowars? I can't recall...

            Well, when WL tweeted Ben Swann's video about PG, I figured it was legit. While I believe blackmailing politicians is a part of PG, it's not the only reason these pedo rings exist.

               He was effectively silenced. To my knowledge, he is just the co-anchor. And he has zero voice outside of that. But his attitude upon leaving the scene gave me hope - he seemed to insinuate that there are good things happening behind the curtain.

            Of course Sibel Edmonds has also been on Alex Jones Show, multiple times. It's virtually impossible to find anyone who has done anything of significance to fight the deep state, NWO, big pharma, military industrial complex who hasn't.

              Some of Jones's guests were later murdered. Nancy Schaefer (beautiful soul suicided with her husband for blowing CPS kidnapping ring open) and the D.C. madam immediately come to mind. I know there are others.

            Perhaps, but it didn't work. We still wandered into spaces they didn't want us in in DC. Tunnels, networks, processes.....For all I know.....the real #pizzagate culprit could be the one owned by State Dept. employee.

              What's really fucked up is that we quit talking about it exactly right after Alefantis told us to (by way of threatening Ryan/pizzagategear). Why didn't we go in even harder? I don't understand. I've mentioned a few times that we should explore that area more, especially since Alefantis doesn't want us to, and in the last interview I heard with Ryan he says there is much more to be explored re Pegasus (though for good reason, he won't be doing it). But nothing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think there should be a MAJOR push to go back to our roots - to take another look at all of the evidence we uncovered in the first few months, to see what we've forgotten, what needs more investigation, and as a reminder of what leads turned out to be false (like the Besta owner who was initially thought to be a State Dept employee).

             Seriously. What the fuck. Besta pizza changed their logo -
             <s>
              it is owned by a State Dept employe
             </s>
             e, and it's located two doors from another pizza place which makes no sense for a business that actually wants to make money. But Alex Jones is focusing on California now, and Cernovich is dropping limited hangout bs.
            </p>

             later edit: schooled on the State Dept employee thing, thanks y'all.

              I don't like Cenovich being buddies with that elite creepo Derchowitz.  I can just kinda feel that he's a kiddy fucker.  And I get irritated with Jones whipsawing around.

               That is the key right there. Anyone associated with Dershowitz is a criminal of the first water.

               I can't believe people here on this site posted so much hype about Cernovich. He's nothing in this. Just a prop for Alex Jones' entertainment for money making enterprises.

              I know what you mean. AJ must be aware of this meta at some level; he deals in revealing/exposing conspiracies, and of course, this will invariably lead to his own audience questioning him as well. I keep AJ at arms length for now.

             My friend, the truth is not found in dichotmies - it is found in the shades of grey. Let's keep our eyes open, as others here are saying. There are no heroes, nor is everything Alex ever touched demonized by association. I told you this yesterday, please stop harassing me and just focus on the content of the arguments and info.

              Your objective to this point at VOAT with respect to Jones has been to prove he is working for the CIA to cover up child sex slavery, and the claim is an abomination and demonstrably incorrect. The truth is, for some twenty-two years, Jones has committed
              <strong>
               unprecedented
              </strong>
              hours of terrestrial radio broadcasting time to telling the story of satanic child sex slavery, and he has had virtually every important researcher on as a guest to help further the cause, whether it's Gunderson, Passio, Icke, Edmonds, etc. Jones is a hero for doing this. Further, Jones went at the PG story very strongly until IW reporter was hoodwinked by a fake menu with maimed children for sale, at which point he was forced to make a change. Why would he go at the story in the first place if his sole job was to cover for it? Maybe because the simplest explanation is the correct one, namely that he fell for a trap, and had no alternative.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you call challenging your propaganda war against Jones harassment, you do not understand what
              <em>
               you
              </em>
              are doing. I am a sporting fellow. Back off on the attacks under the advice of a fellow Christian who knows more about Jones's heart than you do, and I'll stop confronting you at every turn. Let him work any angle of child sex slavery he can for the time being  unmolested by you.

               I agree.  I say the more involved in exposing this, the merrier.  I applaud Alex Jones. Cernovich, Paul Joseph Watson .. hell, anyone willing to put the info they have out there.  I had not heard about the "menu" (taken off Comet Ping Pong's website) ever being denunked.   But other than that statement,  which surprises me, I agree 100% with this post and say "THANK YOU" for having AJ's and MC's backs.

               You're wrong about Jones, and you refuse to look at the evidence. My thoughts about him are mirrored by many others. They are not personal, they are in keeping with my goal to help this investigation and the children.

                You're wrong when you think you're a Christian at heart. You and I had a lengthy private conversation at my initiative about the savage attacks on David Seaman. You told me you know Seaman better than 99% of the people posting things about him, having followed him on Twitter for many years prior. You said it was all lies and fabrication. I believed David, and I trusted your confirmation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now I am telling you that I know Jones better than 99% of the people viciously attacking him, including you, and you can't extend a modicum of consideration that I have studied all of the (mis)information you cite over and over again, and much of it is fabricated, embellished, and groomed for purpose in exactly the same way all of the information about DS was fabricated, embellished, and groomed for purpose. You extend no remotely similar courtesy to me as I extended to you. You're a hypocrite of an extraordinary kind.

                 I showed you how just a few days ago Alex went on a "Goddamn you fuckers" rant, linked you to it, and you ignored it, claiming to have a handle on what is Christian and what isn't.

                 My assessment of AJ is not personal against him, nor you, but your attacks on my character, even bringing religion into it, are personal and i'm asking you to refocus, and stop. Your breathless defense of Alex Jones is becoming a distraction to this sub, in my opinion. You're not going to change my mind, not by attacking me, nor by claiming to be an authority on the subject. I've been watching him from afar for a long time, and have seen nothing to get me to trust or like him. and please review the comments on this post - 90% of them agree with me about Alex so it's silly to pretend the problem is me.

                  How many times do you think I have to prove you're a manipulator of the truth and a hypocrite before external observers accept that there is something to what I say. You say I ignored the rant you linked to, yet here it is with my direct response to the video some 17 hours ago:
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1767181/8657133/10#8657133">
                   https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1767181/8657133/10#8657133
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You don't even have the integrity or common sense to validate your own claims before launching another salvo, and this shows you're unreliable.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Regardless, to recapitulate, the video of Jones swearing (oh my!) is highly edited and thus removes all context for what prompted the outburst. Frankly, it's mild under the circumstances. If the Good Lord is only letting in those who have never cursed, there's going to be very few people in heaven. How about you? Have you ever said anything like that? Do I really have to post your comments that contain some nasty language like that used by Jones in the video you cite in order to put your hypocrisy on display yet again?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You might have a very small majority of similarly minded folk on your side
                  <em>
                   in this thread
                  </em>
                  , but not remotely on the whole. There have been many favorable Jones threads at VOAT. Votes to my (Jones's favor) were 19 to 4 here:
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1754846/8595738/10#8595738">
                   https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1754846/8595738/10#8595738
                  </a>
                  That is the nature of VOAT. Opinions congregate in clumps. Claiming you have numbers on your side of this argument based on a few up or down votes in one thread is ridiculous.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My defense of Jones is not breathless, it's measured, and in fair accord with which you execute your malicious attacks. I am not trying to change your mind. I am trying to get you to recognize that Jones has followers for a reason, and one of those reasons is because he has been very effective at waking people up to the reality of child sex slavery. Let the man do whatever he can do at this time.

                    No, but I like Dershowitz the way I like stepping on a rusty nail. The world is a complicated place. Cernovich is saying good things, so I don't see why they can't be taken at face value right now.

                     Understood.  So I have my questions about AJ and Cernovich but as you point out they are going after the Pedos.  Imho if they are not on the good side then neither is Trump and there is really no hope at Justice.  I think that's why their veracity is such a loaded topic. Thanks.

                      It's worth keeping in mind that anyone who commits ten thousand hours of information to a recorded medium is absolutely ripe for manipulation. That's what makes Jones an easy target. People are able to extract and compile mistakes and things that were said in the heat of the moment, and aggregate them to form the worst possible picture. But this is called propaganda, and anyone interested in the truth before all else has to be on guard for it. I'll tell a quick anecdote to make a point.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Not long ago, I was defending Jones against another person. They claimed Jones is no Christian, and they produced a video that was to prove it. It was ten minutes long, and I believe in hearing out the other side, so I started to watch. The video opens with a sleuth who in a few moments is going to prove Jones is no Christian, but before doing so, he says wonderful things about Kent Hovind, a preacher who unjustly spent time in federal prison, and then asks me to support him. However 20Justice4All17, there was a problem. I already knew who Kent Hovind was, because Jones had already talked about Hovind's incredible plight probably twenty times on air, and even did an on air interview with Hovind from behind bars.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There is incredible irony in someone producing a propaganda video that is going to convince me that Jones is a wicked atheist when the narrator asks me to support the very same preacher Jones already poured his heart and soul into helping in any way he could. It actually brings tears to my eyes to know that for all of Jones's faults, on the whole, he does much more good, especially in telling the story of the worst crimes against children, and that's why I defend him ferociously, warts and all.

                       I have not followed Jones as closely as you have, but I remember people saying he was controlled by Time Warner because in his early years his public access station was owned by them.  That was ridiculous.  My uninformed  take is that AJ is a true outsider fighting corrupt authority.  This is what makes him an easy target.  Over time, he has been proven mostly correct, and with the election of Trump, he is slowly being brought to this new inside (i.e. Trumps side).  I don't like him backing of CPP, but he is making up for it by going along with Cernovich and Sawyer against the pedosatanists.  I wish him nothing but good will and I continue to watch his videos for information.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       With that said, i personally know people real heavy into him that were hurt so bad by him backing of CPP that they have now sworn him off.  I don't think that's a good idea, but eventually all the truth needs to come out about CPP in order to clear everything up with AJ for a lot of people (myself not included).

                        One thing should be obvious. He did not back off Alefantis/CPP because he's working for the CIA. That's what V___Z and others would like you to believe. It's preposterous. I hate Occam's razor because it is so overused and misused, but this is a classic situation where it applies.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Initially, Jones was on top of Alefantis/CPP angle and said on air multiple times how the codespeak in the JP emails and all the creepy artwork and Instagram pictures indicated something very bad. Then, one of Jones's reporters fell for a fabricated and planted piece of evidence in the form of a CPP child sex torture menu, and took to Twitter with it under the IW banner, making Jones  culpable. I believe this was a setup by Alefantis and Co. to get tangible evidence of defamation against Jones. All the skeptics asked why threaten to sue Jones not DS and all the other PG reporters who were saying even worse things, and they cited the lack of lawsuit threats as evidence Jones fabricated the story of being threatened by JA. But the reason why others were not bothered with should also be obvious. I've discussed this at length at VOAT prior. Jones and IW offered the biggest bang for the buck. Get a retraction from Jones and the PG investigation will be hampered, especially from a public opinion perspective. Get a retraction from Jones as a proxy for all PG investigators at any cost, and they would have their centerpiece story to run with in the MSM. And it worked brilliantly. You don't  get named the 49th most powerful man in Washington by being stupid. The simplest theory is he backed off because they had evidence of libel against him that they had against no one else, and they knew they would drag Jones into the den of the enemy, a D.C. courtroom, probably run by a virtual associate of Alefantis and Co. and bury Jones in litigation, and Jones knew this. Of course they got what they were most hoping for.

                        If it sounds implausible, think how implausible it was that Podesta would fall for a phishing scheme which would lead to email leaks. The world's a crazy place. For the record, I am a realist. Jones supporters and detractors are so polarized at this point, nothing is going to change anyone's mind. I counter the attacks when I see them out of a moral duty to myself and no one else. I know the real world impact is negligible.

                         It is terrible to hear this.  How badly has this hurt our efforts?  Makes me even more angry.  Can we recover from this? Man, these guys are so evil and sneaky.

                 I just want to say I respect both of you as researchers and commenters.  I don't know Jones or Cernovich that well.  I am glad they both seem to be going after the Pedo elite. It seems like what is missing in all this is any hard evidence. I was and am confused by AJ and DS backing off CPP, but I believe there is some kind of coordinated effort by the good guys to expose this.  I tend to think AJ is a good guy who is slowly being let in on the facts of this.  Idk? It seems like there is more than meets the eye with CPP and bests pizza.  We need hard evidence!

                  There has to be more.  There is NO WAY they are selling that many pizzas to afford that real estate.  This is clearly a money laundering or front for blackmail.   Would like to look at their books.

                  There is some hard evidence like the kids being taken out of Haiti by Silsby but maybe that isn't hard enough for you. It is for me! You also have witnessed, but for some reason they are never enough

                  We won't get hard evidence by running to California and declaring Alefantis innocent, as Alex is doing.

                   If I recall DS does not mention JA at all in this video. Again, I am puzzling over AJ.  Clearly CPP is a hot pedo mess.  But AJ, Craig Sawyer, and Mike Cernovich are not backing off of even bigger fish than CPP which creates more of an enigma.  I cannot write off AJ even though I don't understand his stance with CPP.

                    The big fish - the elitist pedophile satanists who control much of the world - can start to be glimpsed through the window Podesta and Comet Ping Pong opened up. Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich are telling us not to look there, but to switch our focus to some unnamed people in the Deep State who are blackmailing and controlling innocent politicians who actually have no sexual interest in children, but were set up. With all we've learned by looking into Podesta, Comet Ping Pong, and their many connections to pedophiles and satanists, we absolutely should not be looking away from them, and I'm suspicious of the motivation of anyone who tries to label them as distractions.

                   Right now, Jones's best means of having an effect on CP and child sex slavery is to get the message out that it's happening everywhere, not just in D.C. Jones cites articles daily about hundreds of arrests in California, so he has something tangible to work with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If Jones for any reason decides to start moving on the Alefantis/CPP angle some time in the future, you will find some way, any way, to make it appear fraudulent or opportunist, and you'll pick it apart and stomp all over it as being yet another ruse by Jones, because that's your MO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Jones has dedicated more broadcasting hours to tell this story of global child sex slavery over the last twenty-two years than any other radio personality, living or dead. You're probably tired of reading that, but I am going to bludgeon you with it until you acknowledge that it is a true statement You're a saboteur, and no follower of Christ. The children locked in dungeons in California are just as important as the ones in D.C., but not to you because Jones thinks they are just as important.

                  This is such bullshit. You don't need to bend over for Alefantis by kissing Alex Jones's ass. Alefantis is as pedo dirty as his ex boyfriend and all their Satanic friends. We need to move on past Alex Jones and hammer Trump, Gowdy and Sessions along with the FBI with any and every piece of info we can.
