<h1></h1>
<p>In December 2018, Raniere had submitted papers hoping to be released on bond for the second time. </p>
<p>In response the prosecution pointed to many of the allegations they made about the man when he was first indicted earlier last year as well as some shocking new claims.</p>
<p><strong>Those included the fact that Raniere had spoken in favor of incest, said gang rape was acceptable if the woman had an orgasm, and engaged in sexual relations with at least one underage member of his cult.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is also stated in the government opposition to Raniere\'s request for bail that he kept one woman locked in a room for two years after she refused to engage in sexual relations.</strong>     
</p>
<h2>Who Will Be Paying The Attorney Fees For The NXIVM Defendants?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In January it was revealed the other members of Nxivm who are facing criminal charges for a number of alleged offenses were cut off by billionaire heiress Clare Bronfman after Raniere blew through millions from her legal fund.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The Seagram heiress had created the fund to pay counsel for the other defendants in the case.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The exact amount of that fund has never been revealed, but the number has been reported as somewhere between $5 and $10 million.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But Judge Garaufis informed counsel that three-quarters of the fund was gone already, and with the trial set to start in late April there was no conceivable way that the rest of the defendants would be able to pay their attorneys once the money was gone from the fund.</strong></p>
<p>That is because Bronfman has elected to not replenish the fund she created, <strong>meaning that only she and Raniere are assured high-profile representation when the case heads to trial.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Smallville star Allison Mack, Lauren and Nancy Salzman, and Kathy Russell on the other hand may soon be getting court-appointed representation.</strong></p>

            The lawyers would have been champing at the bit to eat through that Bronfman money.  Now that it's nearly gone, no lawyer will want to touch them.

            Who will be paying the legal fees?  Also the fund has not been replenished. Why would we be surprised. These egotistical elites take care of themselves and throw the rest under the bus. I also winded what has happened to the Mexico faction of NXIVM such as Salinas.

             Well, I guess the Mexican faction is thriving. Salinas is rumoured to be the new guy in charge of NXIVM (not only the Mexican faction, but the US faction as well).

                   Barbara B was on the Board of. Dir. of Rainbow Cultural Garden in London faction. You prob won’t find it now. So yes I believe they are part of it. The Nidhes are part of everything that pulls in big money and power.

               I see a lot of comments saying he's blown through Bronfman's money for legal counsel or whatever..............True or not, keep an eye on all of Raniere's patents. The guy has quite a few. Most of them deal with electronic stalking.
               <a href="https://patents.justia.com/inventor/keith-raniere?page=3">
                https://patents.justia.com/inventor/keith-raniere?page=3
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Who is planning on buying his patents? Has he already been selling them? Are clandestine agencies/agents trying to buy these? Is that part of why he is going down?
              </p>
              <p>
               Blackstone Group and Jacob Rothschild Inherits Freescale Semiconductor Patent - result of engineers deaths on flight MH-370.
              </p>
              <p>
               So much as people claim this has been debunked, the fact remains the same, Blackstone and Rothschild own rights to this patent now, due to a lot of dead people on that missing plane.(I'm using this only as an example)
              </p>
              <p>
               So, don't think those patents have nothing to do with Raniere going down. Someone, somewhere wants some of his patents. Odd's are Raniere was asking too much and this is why the snowball went rolling toward his downfall.

                Yes. And / or maybe he slept with the wrong woman. Who was the person that owned the Freescale Semiconductor Patent? How is the Blackstone Group linked to Jacob Rothschild? Would you maybe have a link?

                 Rothschild and Blackstone have nothing to do with Raniere. I was only using that as an example of the strange coincidents that happen in life to give these elites what they want.
