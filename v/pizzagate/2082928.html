            Okay, I'm on it.  Thanks for making it easy.  I don't like reading a lot on the pc...not good for brain waves, read the research, so audio will be welcomed.

            Still sitting here in a bit of shock...missing the reason we were given guns.  But I love gaining clarity so thank you very very much.

            I didn't know about Agenda 2050...only Agenda 20.  When I read that so long ago thought no way in hell this is real, no way no way no way.  Gave me nightmares for a long time.  Then it becomes Agenda 30 and I go whew, not quite on schedule...maybe it will keep being postponed...I can't live forever lol.  On quick search it's called Vision 2050, got some reading to do.

            More reading, Weimer, thanks.  Yep, the implosion of other civilizations...Atlantis just a drop in the bucket.  Have you noticed (I'm sure you have
            <em>
             wink
            </em>
            )  that just about every month or so a new civilization is discovered that keeps pushing back the timeline for advanced civilizations?  This is known in some esoteric circles and the cannibal cabal knows this too.  It's the one thing that just might keep them from trying to nuke the planet bc whenever it gets to that point 'something' steps in and we have a reset.  I suck with stone tools btw.

            So we are the ones who were not vaxxed to hell and back...just the iffy polio vax.  Back then they just ripped out our tonsils/didn't need them/just a pia right?  Well not according to the immune system but hey, I stopped getting sick from fluoridated water and tons of sugar which was so popular to feed kids in those days.  Hostess ding dongs and twinkies were the rage along with trix, sugar pops etc...and wax candy lips, teeth, where you sucked out the sugar water and chewed on the plastic.  It's no wonder my tonsils were in a mix.  Still food was way more whole than it is today.  Fast food had not been invented yet by Al Gore along with the internet

           <p>
            Quite possible.  This is where we start thinking outside of the box and toss around possibilities.  Right now going just on observations...starting a race war has been in the works for quite awhile.  The biggest thing that stands between the ppl and totalitarianism is an armed population.  Sure the ppl would be out gunned but it gets messy real quick.  The armed forces cannot be counted on to be in total compliance with firing on citizens.  However if a civil war were to happen then guns would be confiscated for our own good.  trump is quite adept at reversing his promises...ie Afghanistan.  He says 'with regrets' that he has had to take a second look and guess what...send in more troops.  There is no way the deep state will let go of Afghanistan bc that is who supplies the poppies for heroin which the deep state uses for multiple purposes.  Afghanistan will be a vessel of the US as long as the deep state rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            So back to a civil war...trump who campaigned on support for the second amendment will with deep regrets have to reverse his stand...sniff sniff kinda thing.  If 'they' are not successful in starting a civil war with all the shenanigans going on presently 'they' might decide to have trump taken out in an effort to jump start a civil war.  Then we are left with Pense who is very very creepy imho.  Some rumors of his own pedo tendencies...who knows.  The importance of putting those in power is having blackmail material...bc then they will follow the game plan conscience or not.  Kinda makes you wonder what they have on trump doesn't it?  Astrologically the US has only been in this particular config twice, the Ame Revolution and the Civil War.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other observation, bc bollywood is predictive programming, are all the zombie flicks.  While dead ppl walking around seems a bit of a stretch what if something is in the works to have ppl go nuts and start eating each other?  Since the cannibalistic cabal is so fond of such/artist now depicting such with dinner galas and mock cannibalism...would that really be such a stretch?  Inquiring minds.
           </p>
           <p>
            And not to forget the push to normalize pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are just trends I see.  How would pizzgate factor into all of this...I'm really not sure.  But I do know if we know about pizzagate there is a reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our water, food and air are poisoned.  Vaccines are becoming mandatory inch by inch.  Another promise trump made that he will probably 'regrettably' have to reverse himself...sniff sniff.  The vaccines are designed to kill...it is that simple. The gov has authority to do whatever is necessary should some outbreak occur.  Test runs are being run with the measles scare.  Heck I had measles when a kid.  We all did.  Parents knew how to handle it.  When one kid had a childhood disease other kids were sent to spend the night to catch whatever and build lifelong immunity/it simply was part of childhood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Depopulation is on the agenda.  Agenda 30 is on the agenda.  I have yet to read The Protocols of Zion but on the tuit list.  The origins are in question but someone wrote it...predictive programming.  Ronald Bernard mentions it in several interviews.  He says it's the matrix we live in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is their any hope?  Certainly...this is the battle of light vs dark.  More and more ppl are moving to the light, abandoning fear.  Fear feeds the matrix.  If we can observe events from a neutral position, see clearly, then the matrix hold over us looses it's power.  In aikido the practice is to harmonize with your opponent/then your opponent looses it's power.  The power of clarity, connected to universal love will neutralize the negativity that we are swimming in.  It's going to take focus of intention and attention.  I 'think' the thing that the cannibal cabal fears most is our awakening.  Perhaps pizzagate is simply to keep us focused in fear...I really don't know.  Maybe they want us to be so shocked and freaked out at the atrocities that we can't access our higher centers.  It is hard with all we are learning, viewing, discussing not to feel a rip in our hearts and our silent cries in the night.  Can any of us really ever forget for even a little while that children are being tortured in the most horrific of ways while we sit comfortably in our homes?
           </p>
           <p>
            So I really don't know ESOTERICshade...but I watch, try to keep my head clear, avoid the poisons that infiltrate our bodies and minds as much as possible.  I practice 'things' that support my awakening and do what I can to find ways to harmonize with the myriad of energy streams of this present time/space.  Not there yet for sure but each day a little more progress.  Allowing myself to see the charades of the limited hangouts, gov agents posing as 'friendlies' and all the other drama that is designed to keep us chasing our tails with tales is helping.  I have looked for heroes in all the wrong places.  We are the heroes...we just don't see it yet.  It pains me to see such good ppl here treating each other with such disrespect, foul name calling, bickering, fighting.  Same goes for the ppl fighting in the streets.  If there can come the time when we see our inner contentedness and unite then there is no satanic force that can stop us.  Baby steps one day at a time eh?

            Yes I know/puzzled me initially.  What I've come to understand is information is 'leaked' for various reasons.  There has been a number of discussions about this in various places.  Why this information was leaked is speculation.  Could be since the deep state decided on trump/again various reasons/that it needed a scandal to further along the narrative.  Some speculation is HC tried to climb higher than her assigned position (too big for her britches) and so it was decided to toss her under the bus so to speak.  Just one theory of multiples.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thing is whenever info is 'leaked' there is a reason.  Too many inconsistencies over the years about JA.  Look I didn't want to believe this...I prefer to think ppl are well intentioned.  Most of us do bc we are well intentioned.  Perhaps having everyone go off on a chase of a pizza place and then the ff of having a fello shoot up Comet (could see that one coming a mile off) it would derail the movement/reduce the researchers to tin foil loonies.  Didn't work out like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think back to the 60's, my generation.  The resistance to Viet Nam was originally very normal looking college students and other young ppl.  Introducing mind expanding drugs was supposed to render us all basket cases.  Didn't work like that however...the very excellent mind expanding drugs on a youthful population in the process of red pilling gave the movement more momentum, not less.  If the CIA was basing our responses on test subjects in their labs (who didn't have very positive responses) didn't work out that way with us.  The more we 'saw' the more we opposed the war.  Eventually the project was shut down and the drugs disappeared seemingly overnight.  Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison all were taken out in a short time span/the movement collapsed and the yuppie movement was instituted.  It was so strange to witness this not knowing at the time the 'hippie' movement was a CIA production.
           </p>
           <p>
            Julian serves a purpose for the deep state.  If we stop taking everything at face value we might see the why's of where we are being herded.

            Julian CIA/took me a long time to get that.  How reliable is a supposed source that has said for years 9/11 is a stupid conspiracy and ppl should spend their time on real conspiracies?  The whole 'is he alive/dead or where the hell is he' is theater to keep ppl distracted and engaged in the school play.  Ppl have to suspend a lot of common sense and cognitive abilities to take seriously the Julian scenario (like they believe in gov deception and yet are supposed to believe the false narrative of 9/11).  Effectively- the mind learns to embrace completely different and contradicting perspectives which creates dissonance/which clouds the ability to think clearly.

            Their tweets look pretty crazy, but one thing has bothered me about Assange for a while - Embassy Cat. Julian's beloved kitten had his own twitter &amp; he posted a lot of pics about him, but since he's gotten his internet back - not a word or new pic of Embassy cat???

             i saw the dead mans switch codes go out on twitter. around the time pamela anderson visited assange at the ecuadorian embassy. and i have seen a detailed account on reddit around the time of the election that describes how the embassy was compromised by cia agents. whether at this point any of this is true. who knows. i hope he is alive thats all.

            POTUS and co. are running everyone's social media now, including Obama. That's why the picture of Obama with naked babies is the most liked tweet in history, in the wake of Pedogate.. We are slowly prepping the masses on mass disclosure.

             Interesting. Is that your theory or do you have links or personal knowledge that show it's more than wishful thinking? I would LOVE to start celebrating but I feel like Charlie Schultz with Lucy and the football so I need more than just hope.

              Trace Barack Obama's movements since February. There's a couple of things that can be done with him... options are open.

                Publicly arrest him and make him a martyr.

              </li>
              <li>

                Deport him and make him a laughing stock.

                Or he can admit his birth certificate is fake, apologize to the American people, take an immunity deal, and leave forever. At least then, he can have a shred of dignity.

               I like 3. Not because I like him (never voted for the community organizer), but it sounds the most plausible and he is out of here. I so could see choice 1 being so true. Forget that voice.

               2 and 3 would certainly explain why he's supposedly been out of the country for an extended period of time. I don't have more than a gut feeling to explain why I think the news blurb about him changing planes in Alaska was total bullshit. (I think he was already out of the country.) Please God, take Hillary down too... What's your theory on what will happen to her if arrests, etc. are actually happening?

                 In exchange she gets to walk? I can believe that scenario. Chelsea isn't a big enough fish (see what I did there?) that they'd want to keep her. Getting her parents is way, way more important. If you're right that she turns against them, I'll be laughing my ass off.

            VOTL is telling the truth. If you follow embasssy cat and Pam Anderson's timeline closely, this is proof.

             I hope it's true but I can't stop thinking about the Pam connection. Is she a honey pot or just a "great actress" in Hollyweird pretending to not be a part of it?
