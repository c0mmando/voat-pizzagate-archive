           It's a small thing, but it really makes all the difference. Dennis Hastert is, I'm sorry to say, NOT a convicted child molester. He was never convicted of any sex offenses. What he was convicted for was "structuring"(basically a way of hiding money from the government) and "making false statements". Neither of those were sex offenses.

             Because these pedos in high places pass laws putting a statute of limitations on pedo crimes. By the time a child grows up and can speak out about it, it's too late to prosecute most of the time. This needs to change.

              Statues of limitation are clear protections for individuals accused by the state.  They are a tool of liberty in a country when there is a presumption of innocence and a burden the state must meet before they deprive you of such liberty.
             </p>
             <p>
              How would you defend yourself if you were charged with a robbery that happened 10 years ago?  How good would your memory be?   How good would the memory of the witnesses against you be?
             </p>
             <p>
              Some crimes are so egregious like murder there is no statue of limitations.
             </p>
             <p>
              The DC statue of limitations on first degree child sexual abuse is 15 years.

            Hey great. Thanks for clearing that up madmanpg. We can now also say Al Capone wasn't a mafia boss either. He was a tax cheat...........
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously dude wtf is your problem? What's your deal here? Everyone knows what Dennis Hastert and his fellow Chicagoan Al Capone did. We're not the problem here.

             This isn't a white-washing. It's simple fact. If you choose to remain ignorant that is your choice. Dennis Hastert was not convicted of child molestation. If you claim that he was, you are lying. Your reference to Capone indicates to me that you didn't even read the post.

              Because your comment had no reason to exist. Everyone knows what Dennis Hastert did. Saying what he was actually booked into jail with is meaningless. It doesn't change anything and more importantly doesn't help us find evidence on other child rapists.
