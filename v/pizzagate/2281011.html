            How many people really need organ transplants???!!! Not as many as the organs being taken in my own estimation. So what are all these organs being used for? Are they eating them? Does anyone know the answer to this? Sorry been out of the loop on this and been in the CBTS Q research for the last month.

            ASTRONOMICAL PROFIT IN BLACK MARKET ORGANS

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Organ trafficking and transplantation pose new challenges
The international trade in human organs is on the increase fuelled by growing demand as well as unscrupulous traffickers. The rising trend has prompted a serious reappraisal of current legislation, while WHO has called for more protection for the most vulnerable people who might be tempted to sell a kidney for as little as US$ 1000.

            There are other products that are made from, and uses for, the fetuses of the minors caught in the sex trafficking business which we can explore in a later submission. The fetuses of trafficked minor children have many valuable uses for the traffickers of children.

            According to the World Health Organization, the going price for the seller/Donor of a kidney is around $5,000. The broker who purchases the kidney from the Donor/seller then goes on to sell it to wealthy transplant patients for an average price between $100,000 to $200,000.

            A good friend once told me in high school , that when you go in to PPH to see what your options are , you are told that a child will ruin your life ! That coupled with the fact that her own mother told her the same thing made it hard for my friend to make a decision . Not to mention she was only 16 😔 . She was also abused as a child in every sick way possible . Now she regrets her decisions . That place makes me sick to my stomache. I can't wait for the day the doors are locked for good! So many have suffered at the hands of PPH!

             Please tell your friend that she has HOPE.  I know many women who have had abortions, because they  were lied to.  Given no options.
             <br/>
             There is a support group for women called “Rachel’s Vineyard”
             <a href="http://www.rachelsvineyard.org/">
              http://www.rachelsvineyard.org/
             </a>
             Many women have been healed. God bless.

            Child traffickers and child molesters are using Planned Parenthood as a clearing house for abortions. Planned Parenthood is then selling the fetuses for a profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            These children need a remedy for this situation but the people in charge need to be jailed and responsible people that care about the well being of children need to be put in charge to find the best solutions.

             By Josh Brown - The Washington Times - Tuesday, February 1, 2011
A Planned Parenthood manager in New Jersey has been caught on video helping a person posing as a pimp trying to hide his underage sex ring, according to a video posted Tuesday by the pro-life group Live Action.
The video was shot at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Perth Amboy, N.J., on Jan. 13 by two undercover operatives — a man pretending to be a pimp and a woman posing as his prostitute.
In their video the “pimp” had a conversation with Amy Woodruff, the clinic manager, in which he said he was involved in “sex work.”
When the “pimp” tells Ms. Woodruff the girls are around 14 and 15 years old and speak no English, the clinic manager is shown saying “so long as they just lie … we just kind of play it stupid.”
