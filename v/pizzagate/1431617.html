   So, to stir up your tighty whites some more, why isn't there a clear attack vector? Are you just reposting here for community cred? My suggestions are in the mesage.

            Those boards won't prosecute shit. Be serious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators? Can they take out a whole elite network? Who you dealing with? The agency above the NSA? Cone now ... Don't be calling me a child when you yourself are staying the vastness of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you have done correct is called attention and awareness to the situation. But your efforts are disorganized and don't gather real Intel. Rather you are helping to scrub esoteric loose ends.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wrote in the beginning that certain people need to be hacked. Has that been done? Have you even gone to down to easiest marks? Doubt it!
           </p>
           <p>
            I see it as the fight club class against the rich. The rich are protected by other elites and the government. The people who do they dirty work are paid off. Yet, these are the ones who spill stories over beers in a bar. They have easy to access information. But all of those boards would rather play SJW Tumblr arm chair warrior, the very same type the name fun of.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this was serious movement, real feet on the ground work needs to be done. Loose ends abound that can't be shut down.

            There are a few more restaurants that are suspect, but nothing as damning as Comet Ping Pong. I think if you do find a lead that you can investigate first, you should do that before making it public. Though I suspect any place tangentially related to this is on red alert and cleaning up evidence.

             Why restaurants? Because they happen to use a bunch of cheap clip art as part of their sign?
            </p>
            <p>
             TBH, if I was making bank you wouldn't see me walking into a cheap place. It's called pride. And more obviously, you can't hide and will stick out like a sore thumb thus even more reason to stay away from what you are all trying to pin stiff on.

             Think about, why would some rich prick want to burger King? Why the fuck would they go there? Wouldn't they choose that $50 hamburger and enjoy blending in the crowd?

            I thought the best way to bring it down would be to try to somehow frame one of them as cooperating to turn in one of their own. Similar divide and conquer technique they use on the masses. Once they start getting paranoid about each other's loyalty shit will go down real quick.

             Let's say a rich pedo had a special room built. It's not like they'll fly trustworthy contractors in to do the job but rather employ local people who probably wrote this off as some kind of rich prick being more of an ass and was likely an ass to them. Even if they got overly paid they still would slip up and have bought something shiny or splurged somewhere. Asking the right questions to the fight club class will provide lots of good Intel.
            </p>
            <p>
             But too many people here are enjoying their own version of Tumblr and SJW'ing which makes me think that this is just a super 4chan tampon hoax on a new level.

              I'd be very impressed if this is a hoax. We don't have to take down the ring right now, I think the main goal now is to just comb the internet for more connections and evidence to convince people with. Most of population is still asleep.

               Why do you think you'll find answers on the net?  Are you hoping smart educated people keep their blog on Tumblr? Are you hoping they pass notes through classifieds or the National Inquirer? Or perhaps they brag about this on Snapchat?
              </p>
              <p>
               Comb it all you want, the pros have already been there and done that. The window for that closed pretty quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
               Delusional hope is just that -- delusional.
              </p>
              <p>
               You need bank statements, invoices, receipts -- a fucking real paoer trail. Pretending that the wikikeaks will spill there secrets, isn't gonna happen, the power behind wikikeaks is what they might have. Trump is gonna save the day! Bull shit! He's got 2 choices -- hunt down Hilkary and her posse or fight the war for normal citizens and keep his job. Bill is still alive so keeping his job and basic promises will be his choice. Because the very same elites you are hunting will take him out.

            There have been some trigger-happy followers of pizzagate who immediately went to several named people's facebook and instagram pages and trolled the hell out of them and anyone else who "liked" them. I heard that there was a mass down-vote of Comet pizza and some harassment. Then they bragged about it to the serious researchers like they were "right on top of this thing." Big bummer. However, a lot of pages were screen captured, which had in them leads to other possible pedo-friendly pages.

            A guy went into Comet Pizza on periscope and the owner kicked him out saying something like "You're spreading an alt right conspiracy" and the guy wasn't too obvious about it. So Comet Pizza is paranoid and they have DC police watching the place. I think Comet Pizza is what got us on to what they're hiding but there's nothing there to find now. Connections go to Abramovic, the State Dept, and the CF. This would include ambassadors in countries where it's easy to steal children....and gov programs that come into contact with children...like the Peace Corps.  That would be a new angle.

             Or convince a few highly paid auditors to fish out the juicy details. Rich people pay to have their records kept and cleaned. They don't do it themselves. Yet, look at how many people went traitor to dump information about our government -- 2.

            Yeah, the Comet p. location was burned by a couple guys with severe normalcy bias who thought there was nothing to it at all. Then a couple of other momos went outside to protest the place and that torched it even more. The rats have scurried away. The low hanging fruit was Alefantis' instagram account which revealed the pervy pizza shit and the multiple babies and the weird comments. That led us to his friends Instagram account one of whom has fun building toddler sized coffins.

             Spirit Cooking email comes out linking the Podestas to "artist" Marina Abramovic.
            </li>
            <li>
             Spirit Cooking video is seen depicting occult and sex magick messaging. Shown in video are TWO CHILD EFFIGIES DRENCHED IN BLOOD.
            </li>
            <li>
             Abramovic admits that it is both art and ritual depending on the setting.
            </li>
            <li>
             Prior to this code words were picked up on, pizza, hotdogs, pasta, sauce, etc.

            <li>
             Place Comet Pizza found in Wikileaks email. Pizza what's that?
(Bang there's your low hanging fruit. Researchers get into his Instagram where weirdo pervy pizza pics 'n' babies emerge.)
            </li>
            <li>
             Then, corroboration is made with FBI and occultic symbolism. Associated art in facility along with *
            </li>
            <li>
             Podestas who have DIRECT LINK to Alefantis also depicts an affinity to child love and the dark occultic black magick ceremonial shit.
            </li>
            <li>
             Since then more corroboration has come in terms of images AND information on other restaurants on the same block.

            <li>
             DOJ and political connections are revealed.

             Then if it was burned, it's easier yet to get into. Didn't it have a special room? Maybe, the actual layout could be mapped.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even if it was scrubbed clean, would they bother redoing the rooms? No, if normal contractors were used, questions could be asked in that case.

            Although I agree, I have to argue certain points. First, any evidence or activities that were happening at Comet Ping Pong have been removed and scrubbed because the story caught on. So, infiltrating these places or watching them would just be a waste of time at this point. No while I agree that there does need to be some organization, you have to realize that the internet has no authority to prosecute any of these people. When the story first broke, many complaints and tips were given to the FBI. We also know that the FBI watches what we are doing. So, by throwing out ideas, or unorganized information, it still does assist the people who have the authority to do something. So, it is my opinion that any piece of info or evidence does help in the long run, when put together with everything else.

             Being scrubbed or not, Americans aren't not completely thorough. Being watched, is quite the possibility but even if they make people disappear they draw attention. Because of redShitHole and your prolific activities you drew attention that keyed them in.

             You started a cat and mouse game and are playing against masters. So, if this isn't just some troll you have made all your moves public and should your hand while they sit back and chuckle and drink lattes enjoying your hard work.

             They maybe able to spin this but jailing a bunch of pedo hunting vigilantes won't go easily down in the US. Many good Bible Thumpers will raise hell.
