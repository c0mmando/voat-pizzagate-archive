            Haven't even read your post -- but finding myself again saying ...

           <p>
            This sounds like CIA/MKULTRA "humor" ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Comedians are very popular -- and usually manage to tell a lot of truth.
That's not necessarily something that the CIA wants ...

           <p>
            We're seeing a lot of "disgusting" stuff from comedians these days.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not enlightening or funny -- just disgusting.

             A good example of a comedian that said stuff he wasn't supposed to say is Katt Williams. The guy did multiple stand-up specials where he talked about the secret societies, the rituals, the gay shit that the execs force people to do, etc., and his career/life was literally destroyed. For months, he was arrested time and time again (often using grainy "security cam" footage where you couldn't even tell it was him), had custody of his kids taken away and all kids of shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's some examples of some stuff you're not allowed to say if you're a professional funnyman:

               He said in a statement that he thinks the Illuminati (he refers to them by name) thought he was gay because of the way he dressed and acted, so when they started grooming him to be a big star and he started getting invited to the Eyes Wide Shut sex parties, he didn't like what he was seeing and started talking about it in his standup. That's a big no-no. He also has bits where he says "Fuck Satan, he ain't shit" and he talks shit on anyone who worships him. So yeah Katt Williams pissed off a lot of people and they fucked his life up good.

               Katt Williams is a good person to research to found out what happens when you not only say "no" to the Deal with the Devil, but when you actually spit back in the faces of the elite.

                Pedo --

                Yes, I did watch a good bit of the video, but not previously familiar with him.
Very obviously, he was passing on a ton of info.
               </p>
               <p>
                Didn't get to the "Satan" part -- and do understand that certainly "Satan" 
worshippers exist, likely out of a willingness to be fooled or out of helplessness
and/or greed.
And the violence under cover of this "Satanism" does certainly exist.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, there is no Satan nor Devil -- nor Heaven or Hell.
These are all the inventions of Organized Patriarchal Religions in order to frighten
and control their members.
Vatican was certainly involved in "Satanism" and the CIA adopted it for their own use.
               </p>
               <p>
                "The world is intended to live in FEAR."
               </p>
               <p>
                The Old World Religions thousands and thousands of years before
organized patriarchal religions (male-dominated religion/one all-male god)
was invented to underpin Elite Patriarchy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Those religions had NO Satan, NO Devil, NO  Heaven and NO Hell.
They were centered in Nature and knowledge of Nature.
               </p>
               <p>
                Additionally, Reincarnation was eliminated from organized patriarchal
religion as it became "inconvenient" for Elites.

            This show seems to be all Kroll.  He is co-creator and is the voice for the main character and also for the appallingly disgusting Hormone Monster.

            He grew up in a conservative Jewish family in Rye, NY.  Here's the wiki on him:

             I love the fact that this guy can literally make a show about kids doing sexual things with each other, but if anyone tried to criticize him over it, he'd probably jump on the "you're just an Anti-Semite" bandwagon almost immediately. It's the ultimate "Get Out of Jail Free" for these fuckers.

              Yes, and they'll go to any length to preserve their "poor us" credentials.  Sometimes they get caught, though:

               All of the isolated incidents in the world wouldn't be enough to convince people that there is an entire group of people who call themselves Jews who really aren't. Real Jews being sacrificed to Satan/Ba'al by Fake Jews...I don't know who's Jewing who anymore.

            This is a strange cohencidence that the Netflix show Mindhunter has a serial killer that recalls having sex with his decapitated mother's head and also gives advice to the investigator on having anal sex with his girlfriend.

            Never trust youtube ratings and viewing numbers. They can easily be manipulated, just like the comment section. Youtube and this show are both created and run by kikes. They have a shared agenda which includes normalizing child rape. They work together in all things, including the promoting of this show. As degraded as humanity has become, I do not think this video would really have those comments and that rating.

             youre right home boy, for real i don't think there is any agenda behind the show, and whoever thinks it's aimed at kids might be a little paranoid. i'm 29 and i can relate to a lot of the show and what i went through when i hit puberty. it's a weird time in every ones life, and the show understands and reflects that. if they just gave it a chance and let themselves enjoy the show, because come on it is funny and truthful, and watched the whole season they would see in the last final minutes of the final episode of the season just how self aware the show really is. come on guys, not EVERYthing is part of the agenda.

             That is what people say who do not understand the intent behind creating it. Most people could be aware of this, make their decision as to if they want to watch it or not, and move on.
            </p>
            <p>
             When that same person realizes that this is a weapon created to intentionally target and destroy children they become an activists against this shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then they too look like a snowflake SJW to the blind. That is why getting people to understand the intent behind this stuff is important, and it isn't an easy task.

              No shit it's propaganda. That's what makes it so funny because of how blatantly obvious it is. It's like the heavy breathing pedo band and that russian spider-pedo man youtube video. It's so evil it's hilarious.

               Finding perverted things funny and enjoyable while finding it strange that normal people are outraged by it is, yes, perverted. I guess you can join your buddy in that category.

            It is meant for adults, but there is nothing keeping children from seeing this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saw a few episodes with a friend who I have managed to redpill on pizzagate, but there is so much he doesn't know yet or understand. It's designed to desensitize and it honestly feels like it's aimed at children. Also, who the fuck identifies with the characters who has a hormone monster? Sure, I felt horny during puberty, but I never felt the insane disgusting degenerate urges the shows characters feel.

            The worst thing about this is I personally know some friends who wouldn't see why this is so degenerate. They'd just say it's adult humor, like many other not meant for children cartoons. They also happen to be libtards, and while our friendships haven't totally ended I really haven't been able to stomach the insanity they believe and spew. Ugh.
Terrible having such mixed feelings about someone. They're good people with good intentions, just not that bright.

             I know exactly how you feel. You're describing a lot of my friends and family members as well. It kind of sucks sometimes when you can't even get your closest friends and family to wrap their minds around this stuff, makes you feel very alone and outnumbered by the zombie masses who know absolutely NOTHING other than what they're told by MSM.

            At the very least Netflix has to have an option of NOT INTERESTED. This shit was highly pushed and just looking at the pic knew it was defiling. Can't say the same for the kids that you KNOW are watching and tuning into this sick shit. Can't really blame them... change.org or something get this shit cancelled.
