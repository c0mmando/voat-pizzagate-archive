            That's an important find, because then things become even more interconnected:
           </p>
           <p>
            Wyss Foundation's billionaire Hansjorg Wyss is a huge donor to the CF!
Wyss was put on trial for illegal human experiments (five people died) with unproved pharmaceuticals (stem cell research related).
           </p>
           <p>
            I am wondering, if the human body harvesting could be the reason, why Hillary Clinton is lobbying for abortions even up to the last day -&gt; fully developed babies to harvest!
           </p>
           <p>
            Also interesting:
Wyss Corporation is located close to the Dupont Circle and to the Portugal embassy.
Madelaine McCann disappeared in Portugal and the e-fits show two persons looking like the Podesta brothers.
Madelaine McCann had the same iris deformation (looking like Coloboma) like George Soros.
           </p>
           <p>
            And one of the world's leading Parabiosis (=rejuvenation by young blood) researchers is named Wyss-Corey - if he is a relative to Hansjorg Wyss, has not been checked IIIC.

             I have very little doubt that Hillary's desire to legalize extremely late term abortions has to do with organ harvesting now.  Women were having late term abortions on demand in the Ukraine to sell the fetus for cash.  Hillary's claim that most late term abortions were done to save the woman's life was always blatantly false.  Most are done by young women who refused to accept the reality of their pregnancy until the baby was almost born. Nowhere near as many of the cases are genuine dangers to the mother and even many people who are fiercely pro-life are fine with exceptions in those cases.  Making it so that the reason for a late term doesn't matter is prepping for harvesting more aborted fetuses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you for the links.  I'm amazed at what happened with Hansjorg Wyss.  The fact that he got away with such blatant murder/manslaughter is mind-blowing.  The article by the deleted user is also superb.

            This may be nothing, and is my first time commenting so please excuse me.
           </p>
           <p>
            My grandmother is 95, and a few years ago she had a cut on her ankle that would not heal. They ended up doing a skin graft using baby foreskin. I always assumed it was because of the healing properties of stem cells.
           </p>
           <p>
            My brain automatically goes to the Jewish ceremony of suction circumcisions and makes me wonder if they some how knew of healing properties in infants when they started this tradition.

             That is an interesting idea.  I always assumed that for the Israelites it was because of their living in a sandy area where sand can get stuck in your foreskin.  I assumed that was the practical reason and it later took on a religious reason as well.  Circumcised foreskins in medicine are certainly a big business now though.  Don't even get me started on oral suction.  I'm of the opinion that a sponge is much better for the baby and much less gross.

            This is a crucial part of the story. If you have read Watched G. Webb YouTube you can see all the patterns and players.
           </p>
           <p>
            History with Ukraine. I believe in 2014. Ukraine govt. was getting "cozier" with Russia.  SHOCKING!  BREAKING NEWS!    There just happens to be a "revolution" from the Ukraine people.  Shocking our moral leaders demanded the Ukraine Pres. to go away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the script we can all write it now ourselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            A proxy battle between two big countries. Demand for removal of leader. Citizens are flooded with cash and training on how to protest. The money comes from hidden opportunist monsters George Soros (open society foundation). Then "citizens" are suddenly armed and amazingly similar to mercenary forces. An overthrow happens.  Everyday citizens have been given so much disinformation they do not even know who the good guys are anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            The state department of course is involved. Am I crazy to think that because the Soros emails have been revealed now to show this meddling before the election someone told the truth!!!! Or at least stopped blatantly lying to the American people's faces would change course.   Hell no
           </p>
           <p>
            The primary person with the most information who had a "reset" with Vladimir himself in selfie pushing a fake plastic button chose to run for PRESIDENT of the USA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her primary donors playing into CF and HVF (Hillary Victory Fund) were exposed along with her Friends former aides not only faced a moral crisis....they placed so many others nearly everyone with a moral crisis. All over exposure
Who was in power? 
Who made some serious cash?
Follow the money"
           </p>
           <p>
            What industries develop after these little little "proxy wars" 
Trafficking children? Looks like yes
Organ harvesting?
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow Obama and his buddy Soros and all their friends in congress are exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama then changes law about stem cells?
Now we are in researching the harvesting of stem cells from babies??
           </p>
           <p>
            Where is the moral compass?
All those in power when your moral compass is so depraved and you cover it up and lie you create masses of silent witnesses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silent witnesses have souls whose burdens suffocate them slowly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do your job the country is waiting. The people in this investigation are refusing to be silent? Our collective moral compass is suffocating you.
           </p>
           <p>
            It does not feel good does it. Being watched. Millions watching. Continuing to lie.
Stand up and be counted!
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary and friends championed on! FU to the rest of the world.

            You can only get stem cells from fetuses and from the umbilical cords of infants. I have only heard of stem cell treatments being used in Chinese trials for rare diseases. Supposedly, the person getting the stem cells feels about 10-20 years younger, but in the studies/personal accounts I read, it wasn't known how much was from the physical therapy the people got and how much was from the stem cells themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something that was being considered, last I checked, was that when a person was injected with the stem cells, their own shitty cells were not removed, so they were rejuvenated, but not cured from whatever was wrong with them. Let's say they had heart disease. The new cells would take over, so they would have a temporary benefit. But eventually whatever gave them heart disease in the first place would give it to them again. A genetic or environmental issue or whatever. So one would have to keep getting the stem cells, which was economically impossible.
           </p>
           <p>
            For a normal person. If you had unlimited resources you could drink up all the stem cells you wanted and stave off lots of different diseases.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only drawback was that there was not yet enough data to know if the stem cells would/could turn cancerous. Or that, possibly, you would put a stem cell in one place and it would mistakenly turn into something else. Your heart cells would turn into foot cells or whatever. You wouldn't want a foot growing in your chest.

            Sorry if this information is old. I stopped reading about this stuff several years ago.

            DESCRIPTION
Adrenochrome is an oxidation product of adrenaline (ephinephrine, norepinephrine). It has achieved mythical status as a deliberately-ingested psychoactive -- boosted by H.S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas -- though it is debated whether it has any psychoactive effects at all.

             Best sources of stem cells seems to be 3 to 5 day old embryos because the cells divide and can become any type of tissue. They are said to be 'immortal'

            Also there is a market for fetal body parts which have to be harvested and iced ten minutes after abortion and are special ordered.

             Bone marrow appears to be what they are primarily after in the Ukrainian case.  Oddly, they don't appear to be going after the embryonic ones.  They appear to want to wait till the fetus is well developed and abort or after the baby is actually born and kill it.

            Looked into how stem cells are sourced (sorry it is very sad and grotesque):
- Embryonic stem cells from 3 to 5 day old embryo (pluripotent so can divide and become any type of cell in body)
- Perinatal stem cells from mother's placenta and cord and amniotic fluid
- Fetal body parts harvested within 10 minutes of abortion, often in response to special orders [

            She was in the Ukraine yesterday?  That is insane. Would you mind if I asked for a link? I saw that she was there in 2012.  The Dailymail said she looked "broody" in her pictures.  Probably because she was just then seeing firsthand the innocents which were going to be harmed.

            I don't think you have gone nutty at all. It is all the same thing. If people (we humans) find it distasteful to bathe in the blood, drink the blood and eat the flesh they are taking a different tack? It really does seem more and more like this is a 'race' we are doing 'battle' with. I can't say I believe they are from outer space, because I am not sure there is an outer space anymore! So much is changed in this place we are now. They are definitely from inside the earth, or at least that is where they reside now. This 'race' has human allies and has been harvesting the earth and humans for thousands of years. Have you seen the video that shows that the mountains could really be the trunks of trees? Okay so yes, stem cells, organ harvesting, and this too probably-

            . I have heard of stem cells to fix tooth decay and i am interested, but it uses your own stem cells. I would never want anyone else's in my closed system anyway.

            Man...Stem cells could save many lives, they're hoarding and stealing organs. It's inhuman actually...those organs could save many children. Some organs, like kidneys...SAD. Selling your kidneys, that's such greed to make another sell an organ for a debt settlement. I hope they're taken down.

            Quoted from Publication below.
  "Kidney function and proteinuria were more severe in patients with PAX2 mutations than in those without the mutation. Moreover, the Coloboma score was significantly higher in patients with PAX2 gene mutations. Three out of five patients with PAX2 mutations had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) diagnosed from kidney biopsies"

Benghazi = Pizzagate
-Hiv Trial in Libya-
In April 2001 Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi made a speech at the African summit on HIV/AIDS. He told the conference that the world AIDS epidemic started when "CIA laboratories lost control over the virus which they were testing on black Haitian prisoners"[48] He called the HIV crisis in Benghazi "an odious crime" and questioned who was behind it."Some said it was the CIA. Others said it was the Mossad Israeli intelligence. They carried out an experiment on these children." He went on to say that the trial would be "an international trial, like the Lockerbie trial.
The prisoners were sued by several Libyan police officers for slandering them with the allegations of torture. However, on 27 May 2007, the prisoners were acquitted of these charges and the plaintiffs ordered to pay the legal fees.[46]

              You seriously need to watch George Webb's videos. Start around day 80 since he's already on 93. They've been raping and pillaging for a long time. Why are 15k organs missing from dead people in Syria?? Where is Gaddaffi's billions? Where did the children go after their parents were killed in the war? Where are all the women?

             Egypt –“ Qadhafi added that this act, which is a malicious sex crime, reveals the ugly face of those who introduced the AIDS virus to Africa in order to exhaust its strength and deplete its resources with the intention of gaining control over Africa. He remarked that Africa has turned into a market of high demand for pharmaceutical and other AIDS-treatment medical products. He claimed that international monopolies strive to continue disseminating the AIDS virus as long as possible in order to double their profits from sales of pharmaceutical products, which inhibit the effects of the disease.”

            This is big. Look into Tenet Healthcare. They donated big to the Foundation and euthanized many patients against their will during Hurricane Katrina. I made a post about it recently.

             Not so sure about that.   Worked for tenet.   While they had flaws this line they would not cross.  We are from Katrina.  A doctor was put on trial for said enuthusia.  Never convicted.  The.   You speak of. Dire situation you speak of.   No help was coming, no food coming in no electricity. No meds for women in labor.  No meds for anyone.   Suffering in the dark, being on the 6 th floor very high humidity ...... no one was euthanized !

              I can only thank you for forcing me to put more evidence out of the killings. Make no mistake, this is real, and they knew what they were doing. “If you don’t think that by giving a person a lot of morphine you’re not prematurely sending them to their grave, then you’re a very naïve doctor,” Cook told me when we spoke for the first time, in December 2007. “We kill ’em.” and here is the article. You are wrong, and I don't mean it to be personal, but this is serious.

            Maybe all the children are clones, that's why they don't feel bad about doing whatever they want to them. If they are involved in this human trafficking/pedophilia shit, I doubt a human cloning ban is going to stop them from trying.

            Since foetuses contain harvestable stem cells, maybe Trump's targeting of abortion clinics is connected. Pure speculation on my part.

             I've been thinking about this also. These NGOs that promote and offer abortion services to foreign countries then go on to sell the remains for profit . I don't blame him for stopping this. I am pro-choice and live in Canada, so there isn't an issue of availability or affordability, but these organizations would have to be meticulous in their accountability for me to ever support them, given what I know now about all this harvesting shit.

              Right, I agree. Although I'm anti-choice pretty much. I think if the child has the potential for a painful life, or is the result of rape that it is acceptable. However, I don't judge others who have abortions for other reasons (like many who are pro life have a tendency to do), just wish people were more in control of their actions to prevent "mistakes".

               I respect your position. For me, after the first trimester, extenuating circumstances such as rape, painful  or terminal life of newborn, or life-threatening issues with the mother are obviously acceptable to me, as long as the procedure is done humanely. It's probably not appropriate for me to comment as I live in a different Country with a much lower population and different healthcare- Plan B and long-term birth control options should be the focus of, if any, public funding...Mistake? Here's your abortion. 2nd time, here's your abortion and your tubal ligation, lol.
              </p>
              <p>
               I read snippets of a Planned Parenthood document recently and I guess I was ignorant before because I was a tad sickened about some of the methods used past viability. I guess I think it should be more like euthanasia than preserving the best specimen for a scientist. It should be done with respect because most people having a mid or late term abortion are not making that choice lightly.
              </p>
              <p>
               St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital relies on public donations for 75% of its funding; Planned parenthood and these NGO will have to find other funding.  I wouldn't doubt that the President is now privy to information on the dark-side of some abortion providers and trafficking would seem to go hand in hand with it.

                  Yeah, I think people are waking up to the amount of comfort that can be gained from focusing on what unites us rather than divides us. Even if the subject matter that causes the discussions is so dark. But maybe it's because off rather than in spite of... Makes everything more relative.

            , stem cells goes hand in hand with cloning and then onto human trafficking. They state there is a danger in the belief that a "pure race" will be "manufactured" for the eventual elimination or enslavement of the "non-pure populace."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Knights of Columbus is the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization. Founded by Father Michael J. McGivney in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1882. There are 1,918,122 members in nearly 15,000 councils,  with 302 councils on college campuses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Membership is limited to "practical" Catholic men aged 18 or older. Membership consists of four different degrees, each exemplifying a different principle of the Order. The Order is a member of the International Alliance of Catholic Knights.
