<p>Take a closer look.</p>
<p>Here is another video. Don\'t you think it\'s a bit weird if they are arresting someone that the cops are all completely still with their guns trained on the restaurant?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-washingtondc-gunman-idUSKBN13T0YE">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-washingtondc-gunman-idUSKBN13T0YE</a> </p>
<p>&quot;The Reuters witness who was inside Comet at around 3 p.m. ET said he was paying his bill when he saw a man entering the restaurant\'s front door. &quot;It appeared to us he had a long rifle with him. We scattered,&quot; he said.&quot;</p>
<p>-&quot;appeared&quot;</p>
<p>An unidentified 35-year-old man was being held for questioning after police were called to the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in Washington near the Maryland border, said Aquita Brown, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department in the nation\'s capital. </p>
<p>Brown said no shots were fired and there were no injuries.</p>
<p>The police state themselves that no shots were fired and no injuries. </p>
<p>-He\'s 35 years old
-And make no mention of a gun!</p>
<p>So how is it this article and video starts off with a 20 year old man &quot;allegedly&quot; walked into comet ping pong with a rifle.</p>
<p>Hilarious, somehow he has no need to be indentified... any other person walking into a business with a gun would be.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Man-With-Assault-Rifle-Arrested-at-Comet-Ping-Pong-in-NW-DC-404634716.html">http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Man-With-Assault-Rifle-Arrested-at-Comet-Ping-Pong-in-NW-DC-404634716.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;A bartender at Comet, who said he didn\'t see a gun himself, told News4 everyone inside started to panic as the man walked to the back of the restaurant. Customers and employees evacuated.&quot;</p>
<p>D.C. police spokeswoman Aquita Brown said they detained a 28-year-old man from Salisbury, North Carolina, the Associated Press reported. </p>
<p>-Ah so no mention of a gun.</p>
<p>-Now hes 28 years old.</p>
<p>&quot;The incident has not been linked to terrorism or to recent threats to the business, which started when an online conspiracy theory started circulating, police said.&quot;</p>
<p>Figures. All reports say to check the police twitter for updates, lets go there. Also they just said it has nothing to do with comet ping pong. Right here quote from the same spokesperson.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DCPoliceDept">https://twitter.com/DCPoliceDept</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://voat.co/user/DCpolicedept">@DCpolicedept</a> tweets are as follows.</p>
<p>A photo that says that &quot;chief Newsham provided a media update&quot; Which is just a retweet by the police department of the mayors twitter.</p>
<p>So the only thing they have said was &quot;Suspect in custody with armed rifle&quot; which points to the reporter on scene twitter. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/Ramerieznews">@Ramerieznews</a> who did the wusa9 video.</p>
<p>This random persons twitter posts video\'s of the scene of comet ping pong. But not close enough to see anything. just cuts of the video report posted earlier.</p>
<p>This is an earlier tweet from her.</p>
<p>Told <a href="https://voat.co/user/DCPoliceDept">@DCPoliceDept</a> supervisors are searching but so far no evidence of gunman discovered. Heavy investigation underway  <a href="https://voat.co/user/wusa9">@wusa9</a> #pizzagate</p>
<p>And after being unable to find any valid video or text response about chief newsham\'s media update. I\'m going to go with the eye witness reports than all these websites who\'s sources are literally just tweets!! LOOK FOR YOURSELF PEOPLE!</p>

            Maybe we should see what his sentencing is. If it's light, it may suggest that he was a paid actor. We know the DNC paid agitators during the presidential campaign.

            Twitter has removed the tweet about a suspect arrested with assault rifle! There literally is no police source stating that they found any gun at all! This is so obviously fake please let every media outlet know!

            These pedos are scared shitless..
            <br/>
            This false-flag is either to 1: shut down CPP's current location and move to a more secret place and/or beef up security at current location, or 2: make it seem like pizzagate people are crazy "terrorists" and are just making up fake stuff..
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is proving that armchair warriors can have some amazing fucking power.. What are the chances some "gunman" would go in and start "shooting" just at the same time pizzagate is uncovering some deep dark shit..

            Agreed. There is absolute inconsistency in all accounts. Not to mention watching Jake Tapper start yelling at random people with doublespeak with the "what makes you think there wasn't (an investigation)?" A news reporter who doesn't report the news who basically responded with "I know you are, but what am I?"

           <p>
            And here's the witness who gave the CNN account also contradicting the narrative about shots fired.
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205044956/https://mobile.twitter.com/bayreef/status/805593857744310272">

           </p>
           <p>
            So we're to believe a gunman with a rifle came into the place (narrow surroundings too), walked by everyone, found the owner, pointed a rifle at him, and he ran out and called the police, but somehow the servers who knew too calmly walked over to the tables and told people there was a guy who walked past with a rifle and they all calmly left while some took their food and drinks, and everyone hung around outside to see how it all worked out, some with kids, because you know, keeping people nearby an active shooter situation is normal protocol now.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the story. What a story. No holes there.

            What the actual fuck? The one guy says that a family that had been in the restaurant came into the restaurant he was in across the street. The family said they didn't see anything but that the managers told them they had to leave. I'm sorry but you didn't see a guy walk in with a rifle???

            The article about it was written before it happened! in the washington post. It says a gunshot fired into the ground, but no one said anything about hearing any shots. In fact, I heard people specifically saying no shots were fired. The article also says police were huddled behind cars, not knowing what he would do. It was written by this guy, who usually "covers the arts, among various other topics":

            The "gunman" is an actor in several movies and recently hit a 13 y/o boy with his car, seriously injuring him, in October. My guess is that they had leverage over him from the hit and run and offered him a crisis actor/false flag gig in exchange for the charges going away.

             Sometimes kidnappers and rapists hit their victims with their car to initiate the attack. Not saying that's what happened here, but puts an interesting viewpoint of the information out there.

             Correction.  Missed one of his credits.  He did act in one move, the Mill.

             Not an actor.  Check his actual credits, he's behind the camera.
Edgar Maddison Welch	...	production assistant
These two are on the same film

            Anyone find it strange old Edgar Maddison Welch is an actor and a writer of screenplays?
How many red neck's do you know who enjoy writing screen plays?
And he's in low budget movies?

               You don't need to be an actor to be IMDB.  Thousands of nonactors are on IMDB.
               <br/>
               Here's the IMDB page of one of my favorite people on IMDB.  He's not an actor.

               To be clear E.M Welch does

                have one onscreen credit.
               </a>
               , but his first two credits are for production assistants jobs.  Believe me, you do not need any acting skill to be a production assistant.  This is an entry level "gopher" position.  I was a production assistant in college on a few films, even got on camera once, when they needed extras at a party around my age.  My scene ended up getting cut.

                "You don't need to be an actor to be IMDB."......I'm not sure why you consider this important. Edgar Maddison Welch has done work as an actor. He just wasn't a very good one.
And his other credit are just as damning, storyboard artist and writer: 
"The Mill (storyboard artist) "
"Writer, Mute (2011))"
This is where I point out you're either a CRT shill or have tin ear when it comes to measuring people up. An Artist/Actor/Writer doesn't lose his mind and run into a restaurant with an assault rifle looking for Pedophiles. It's just not possible. Sorry. I don't make the rules.

                 What is a  CRT shill?.    My point is there are tons of people in film credits with zero acting skills.   If this is someone playing a role, the set dresser or the lighting guy may not have the skillset.

                 If you think that people who have acted don't commit crimes, that doesn't hold up.  See Robert Blake or OJ Simpson, etc.

                  "who have acted don't commit crimes".....Robert Blake and OJ Simpson committed very personal and selfish crimes of passion against women in their lives and anyone unfortunate enough to have been with them at the time.
Running into a restaurant to save children from suspected abuse is just about the antithesis of what Blake and OJ did. Trying to save children is a SELFLESS crime. It's in no way excusable, far from it. I'm just talking about what type of person would do something like that.
You'd expect maybe a very religious person or someone who suffered sexual abuse themselves.
I'm not picking that up from Edgar Maddison Welch. Old Edgar seems like a happy go lucky guy, artsy, writer of screen plays, anything goes kind of dude whose never been in trouble with the law before besides a car accident.
What's a much more believable explanation to me is Edgar being involved in low budget movies in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. probably knew James Alefantis who DING DING DING is also involved in low budget movies and also lives in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S..
So he get's a call from James Alefantis asking for a favor and maybe a lucrative paycheck to help fight Homophobia and a new generation of Deplorable shit lords unleashed by Donald Trump. 
Who knows what happened. All I know is there's an epidemic of Hate Hoaxes on the left. They never seem to end. And this fits right in with the meme don't you think?

                    "criminal record includes.........underage driving after consuming alcohol and misdemeanor drug possession charges.......driving while intoxicated".....LOL, looks like old Edgar is a real hardened criminal. Please. The only hint of credibility is Edgar's "religious zeal" which sort of reminds me of his "criminal zeal" which is about in line with any other red blooded American male.....No, religious zeal would be like attending Seminary or setting up a website like badselfeater.com , that kind of religious zeal ;-)...........And to be honest that's an awful lot of quotes to have on hand just minutes after I made my comment. That's not good "AreWeSure". That points to you being a paid shill for a new "industry" which DING DING DING James Alefantis' old boyfriend's is very familiar with and his service to will forever live in infamy.......Oh and I almost forgot David "Bat Shit Crazy" Brock's motive here. He's been acting "Bat Shit Crazy" a lot lately. Ever ask yourself why? Just maybe old David wants to stay out of jail? Are you with me?.....muahahahahaaaaaa

                      You never even acknowledged the Hate Hoax list or the possibility Edgar is putting on a show. Normally adjusted people don't rush into restaurants with an assault rifle. People who do that don't generally come out alive and if they do someone's dead inside. I've never even heard of someone doing that and then thinking better of it and politely walking outside with his hands up. Maybe you're young and naive. I'm not. Edgar's whole story doesn't make sense. Someone that mad would show sings of, duh, being so mad they're on the edge of sanity. People like that are by definition not rational. ;-)

             Bro, I'm from the same county that Edgar is from.  Salisbury is largely considered urban, albeit it's still a very small town in conservative NC. I know dozens of people who write, do stand up, and all variety of creative stuff.  We're not all rednecks.

              "dozens of people who write.....".......You built what's called a Straw Man. I never said those people don't exist in your town. The point being they're not rednecks. Make sense?
In other words people who write, do stand up and other creative stuff aren't so bigoted they grab an assault rifle. Only a knuckle dragging red neck would do that. A much more likely story is Edgar was HIRED to play a redneck. Edgar isn't a redneck he just plays one on T.V..

               You're making a straw man that red necks can't be creative, or that creative people can't be rednecks.  He most likely exists somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.  It's naive to assume that he is purely an "actor" just because he has a single writing credit on IMDB for his dad's video production company.
              </p>
              <p>
               Furthermore, he didn't have an assault rifle, and NC is an open carry state.

             Look at his time stamps! The first mention is 9hrs ago. The first article by The Washingtonian was exactly at the same time. So either Google and Twitter have the same time stamp or the coordination of this is off. A guy who rarely tweets suddenly is there to debunk Pizzagate, post a pic of the "suspect" that every news media is asking his permission for using, and talking about how wonderful a place it is. I think he said the food was "delicious" about 10 times in replies to people asking why he was there. I'd start looking into his tie ins to these people.

            Not following your logic fully.  Two consecutive tweets by DCPolice, doesn't this mean they nabbed a guy with a gun?

             Right but it does not specifically claim to be the comet ping pong "shooter" it only links a tweet that was tweeted at them from a follower.

              What are you talking about.  It doesn't link a tweet, it is its own tweet, and it follows its own previous tweet.  Context is important.

               Maybe I said it in a confusing way. My argument is that the tweet had no content besides
              </p>
              <p>
               "suspect armed w/ assault rifle taken into custody"
              </p>
              <p>
               Upon clicking the tweet it forwards you to the tweet from RameriezNews which played the video linked in this thread. How does that count as an official statement from the police?
              </p>
              <p>
               It shouldn't and it's obvious to see this is shady journalism at least.

            If there turns out to be no gun, this is a huge deception and the dude that was captured is a fall guy, maybe even picked at random to draw attention away from something else.

            Edit:  It, however, still reinforces the "fake news" from the "alt-right" angle with the public.  It's all propaganda material!

            Could be that...but we will never know...cause for sure they won't release that information if THAT is the reason..would lend legitimacy to PG and we can't have that. NC plates on the car..cops say not related to PG, WaPo runs immediately with Tim Kaine type OMG GUNS (when it was knife) post instantly relating it to PG...no gun seen by most "witnesses" employees "deal" with him...perhaps employees recognized him. We won't be able to figure out more until his name/age is released. THEN it should be quite easy.

            I was wondering how they would be able to stage a false flag without directing people in droves to examine the shocking circumstantial evidence. I guess this is how: a relatively innocuous incident that just allows them to mention it in passing. Perhaps a bit about an outlandish conspiracy theory, repeat the words "assault rifle" in every story, and may even toss in an implication about the "Alt-Right".

             I think on some level they're testing the waters, to see if they could turn the tide very suddenly against Pizzagate in the public's mind, and it failed. So they quickly backpedaled on the sensational aspects.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now it's "Just some dude." and "Somebody thought he had a gun." Their operative can now walk away without incident and they can finish up whatever clean up operation this was all a distraction for.
