<p><a href="https://twitter.com/WallStForMainSt/status/846859160763465729">&quot;Wall Street for Main Street&quot;</a>, a very large (over 60K) Twitter account interviewed David Seaman about a variety of subjects.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason Burack of Wall St for Main St: <em>I really do hope that the charges do start to come. I heard in January from one of my contacts here in DC who works next to the FBI building that charges were going to come for Republicans and Democrats to this pedophilia ring... you know, the whole &quot;pizzagate&quot; thing that the media tries to label it as, it\'s a lot bigger than that...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>David Seaman: <em>Oh definitely. This is an international scandal, and we\'re talking about child abuse by elites in multiple countries over many years, and it\'s much more than \'was there a basement in a pizza shop where Hillary Clinton was killing children herself\'. No. Nobody is claiming that. Nobody reasonable. And yet, that\'s the bar the media set, they\'re like &quot;Oh, OK, we\'ve fully disproved this aspect, so there\'s nothing here&quot;. Wait a second. There\'s a lot here that doesn\'t make any sense. It seems like there is child trafficking occurring.</em></p>
