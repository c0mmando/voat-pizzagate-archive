            We should try to read through it and establish a cliff notes. It would be said if we fail to get behind something that we have been calling out for, worse still... if we get behind it and it shuts us down. Let’s be informed, and trust God to open the right doors.

Keep Aaron Swartz' legacy alive:
"Along with developing an early version of rich site summary, or RSS, technology, Swartz is credited with co-founding the popular Reddit website that allows users to vote for their favorite news stories of the day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Increasingly active in efforts to make information more readily available on the Internet, he also founded Demand Progress, a lobbying group that advocates for civil liberties and government reform.
           </p>
           <p>
            In that role, Swartz led a successful effort to stymie the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2011, which sought to restrict access to websites that illegally shared copyrighted property. The bill was eventually withdrawn after widespread protests.
           </p>
           <p>
            "He refined advocacy for the progressive and open-information movement," said David Moon, program director for Demand Progress. "He was ultimately pretty brilliant at that.""

            <p>
             The House of Representatives is about to vote on a bill that would force online platforms to censor their users. The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA, H.R. 1865) might sound noble, but it would do nothing to stop sex traffickers. What it would do is force online platforms to police their users’ speech more forcefully than ever before, silencing legitimate voices in the process.
The House Rules Committee is about to approve a new version of FOSTA [.pdf] that incorporates most of the dangerous components of SESTA. This new Frankenstein’s Monster of a bill would be a disaster for Internet intermediaries, marginalized communities, and even trafficking victims themselves.
             <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865">
              https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865
             </a>
             The bill changes section 230 of the CDA, the law that protects website owners from liability for what their users post, to carve out an exception for instances of human trafficking. Site owners can be held liable and subject to a criminal fine or imprisonment for not more than 20 years.
WHAT THIS MEANS IN PRACTICE IS THAT ALL IT WOULD TAKE FOR A WEBSITE TO BE SHUT DOWN AND ITS OWNER ARRESTED IS A FALSE FLAG OPERATION OF SPOOKS ENGAGING IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. ALL U.S. SITES WOULD BECOME FORCED TO IMPOSE EXTREMELY HEAVY-HANDED MODERATION AND CENSORSHIP OR SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY, 8CHAN INCLUDED.
THIS BILL HAS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND WILL LIKELY PASS UNLESS HEAVY RESISTANCE CAN BE ORGANIZED QUICKLY AND ON A LARGE SCALE.
Voting on the House Floor is scheduled for THIS TUESDAY. Start spreading this information on as many websites as you can before it's too late. If you know anyone with a large audience try and get them to spread the word. If this bill becomes law then it's GAME OVER for free speech on the internet.

             Just notified a bunch of activists.  They will not like this.  They are Progressives and hate anyone clamping down on the internet.  Thanks for the information.  Others please pass this on.

            I don't know if this is a trick because I have not looked into it. We should look into it and see if we can figure it out. Instead of playing with legislation all the time they could, you know, enforce the laws we have, and actually start arresting child traffickers in mass.

            They could also stop creating them by cleaning out the military and arresting these people. They know what these people are doing. They know.
