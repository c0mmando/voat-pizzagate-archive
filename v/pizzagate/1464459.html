            Remember FBIAnon tip about Cheryl Mills' prior job. I did some research and it was with NYU.  Mills played a central role in helping build a campus in Abu Dhabi in UAE.  NYT wrote article about labor abuses, etc.  Of course, NYU donating $$$ to Clinton Foundation.  In addition, Mills also involved with NYU building campus in Shanghai with the same charges, of labor abuse, slavery, etc.  again, donating to Clinton. I think needs more investigation.

            So on the Facebook of the Human Trafficking Center, where Monica worked, there was a memorial post about how she had worked there. Interestingly enough, there was a notice that the site itself (12/3) was down for maintenance (it's still down). Then I tried looking for cached sources and I found this with an article linking the HTC as the source:

            I've searched their site source code. IMO the align of picture is a bit weird, because when you type code to align "/Div", you dont need to match the size of above "/div", just put a "align left" is enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            But someone can maybe explain it better than me ?

            Here's an interesting post from one of the Haiti corruption blogs that Monica Petersen linked to in this FB post:

            "Monica Petersen, Condolezza Rice, Korbel School and the Haitian Elections: Monica Dead or US Gov Agent?"
            <a href="https://miningawareness.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/monica-petersen-condolezza-rice-korbel-school-and-the-haitian-elections-monica-dead-or-us-gov-agent/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Choice quotes:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Condoleezza Rice attended an International Politics course taught by Josef Korbel… Rice later described Korbel (who is the father of Madeleine Albright, then a future U.S. Secretary of State), as a central figure in her life… In 1981, at age 26, she received her Ph.D. in political science from the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Rice was George Bush Jr’s foreign affairs tutor, before she was his National Security Advisor and Secretary of State. In fact, Condolezza Rice was National Security Advisor to George Bush Jr when he worked with Canada and France to remove Haiti’s President Aristide from power a second time in 2004. The first coup against Aristide was orchestrated when Bush Sr was president. President Clinton actually formally restored Aristide to power during the Bush interregnum (i.e. between Bush and Bush).
           </p>
           <p>
            Haiti had elections on Sunday. An American named Monica Petersen, supposedly working in Haiti, allegedly died one week before the elections. This is one of several important points that avid conspiracy theorists have overlooked. Haiti is of geostrategic importance for shipping, so the US will always involve itself in Haiti for that reason alone."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Everyone, including us, appear to have overlooked a key fact: She was supposedly a graduate of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, (part of a private and probably very costly university). Students from Korbel “have interned with the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Defense, the United Nations, the FBI, the OECD, and World Vision International, among others."
           </p>
           <p>
            "We hypothesize that Monica may not be dead at all, but rather be working for the US government in relation to the Haitian elections in some undercover op. It appears unlikely that she would have gotten into Josef Korbel or graduated if she was against the “system” (US Foreign Policy, Policymakers, State Dept., etc.). It is possible, however. If she had gotten her Ph.D. it would be close to impossible.
           </p>
           <p>
            [Update: We found this information that a Monica Petersen was teaching at an elite prep school in Port-au-Prince called Union School. It is nowhere near Caracol or Morne Bossa, which are in the north and where she was supposedly going to snoop. It doesn’t change the fact that she could have been working for the US government or pulled out of the school to work for the government during the elections. On the other hand, there are many people there who could want her killed if she said the wrong thing. And, people have been kidnapped simply because it’s an elite school. It’s hard to believe that anyone who believed in social justice would be able to stomach teaching there."

            I just looked at that list of CTR shills, and noticed the name Jeff Koons. In Alefantis' previously public Instagram account images, (
            <a href="https://sli.mg/a/gaffhM">
             https://sli.mg/a/gaffhM)
            </a>
            ) there is a pornographic one which is of a photograph in the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Jeff Koons. All it consists of is an extreme closeup of an adult male violating a small girl. I then wondered about this Jeff Koons so-called artist. I found out that he was, in "2002
-Appointed to the Board of Directors, International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, Alexandria, Virginia". (From jeffkoons.com - biography and honors.)  Really? Is this how he advocates for missing and exploited children? By continued exploitation? And in his spare time he shills?

             That Jeff Koons image is from the Whitney, not MOMA.  The female model was his wife who was 40 years old.

             Yeah the porno art guy is a child exploitation protector.  Why is it that every single person in this spider web worked with children in some capacity.  Juvenile delinquent Girl Scouts, social worker in charge of guardianship recommendations, etc etc etc.  here's an article on Koon's "work in child exploitation"

              Knowing what I know from his porno 'art', it makes me sick to my stomach to read his comments about children. And I wonder if the little girl in the porno photo is one of his current six children or if it's the one he gave up for adoption at one time. It could also be any one of the poor victims he's supposed to be helping through his Koons Family Institute.

            I always found the neighbors comments about Silsby during the Haiti scandal to be the most interesting Intel on her. IIRC he said something about her not being friendly and he was surprised she'd be involved in trying to help children bc she just wasn't the type. Something to that effect. So it didn't strike him odd that she was caught trying to steal other people's children out from under their nose, he was most surprised she'd be associated w anything that actually helped kids, was my impression. 
I'll see if I can find the article...

            I'd suggest PM'ing her family and straight up asking through FB. Or PM her friend that was posting the original info about her death. I don't have access to that info. Maybe someone here has the original thread with those links? Worth a shot.

            So that duckduckgo listing probably shows the description for a missing member on that page.

            Having visted that page multiple times since october, I've seen no mention of Monica Peterson on that website. Hell, I'm surprised they have Laura Silsby's picture STILL UP after all this.

             The search engine DuckDuckGo still shows traces of Monica Petersen being listed on AlertSense's executive team page. This is a cached result and will likely be replaced with a fresh version in a few days. The live site has no mention of Monica Petersen and possible has been scrubbed before or soon after her death.

              I'm talking about the link IN the search result.   I went to it now,and there is no mention of Monica Petersen on that page.  So yeah, maybe we need to dig on the alertsense site and see why that search result came up saying "Monica Petersen was in Haiti.".

               Clearly they had all the reasons in the world to remove her from that page as soon as people found out she was dead. Why would they leave her on a site that directly connects back to Hillary Clinton?
