           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Two days before his death, Epstein put his fortune in a trust
            </p>
            <p>
             The deceased billionaire Jeffrey Epstein signed his will two days before he stepped out of prison. The unmarried property icon without children entrusted all its properties to a trust, the beneficiaries of which are unknown. The document has been submitted to the fiscally favorable Virgin Islands, which are under US custody.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the documents, the value of Epstein's assets is estimated at $ 577 million. That fortune is now part of 'Trust 1953', perhaps named after Epstein's birth year. In the will itself, which has 21 pages, no beneficiary is mentioned by name. Only the names of the persons responsible for the execution of the estate are mentioned, in this case Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, who would have worked with Epstein for a long time. The two men could not be reached for comment, reports the New York Times .
            </p>
            <p>
             In the will, the businessman's home in the New York district of Manhattan is valued at nearly $ 56 million. His ranch in New Mexico would be worth 17 million, his property on Parisian Avenue Foch 8.6 million and the two islands in his possession - Little St. James Island and the recently purchased Great St. James Island - are estimated at a total around 85 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to those property properties, there are $ 307 million in shares and other investments, plus $ 56 million in cash. His private aircraft, boats and cars are worth 18.5 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             By using a trust, Epstein makes it more difficult for alleged victims to claim compensation. A significant number of lawsuits are taken into account by women who claim to have been abused at a young age.

            Abuse
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The authorities arrested Epstein earlier this year. Prosecutors state that between 2002 and 2005 he sexually exploited dozens of underage girls. They were allegedly paid to perform sexual acts at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach in the state of Florida and aboard his private plane. He was sentenced to a 45-year prison sentence.
            </p>
            <p>
             On August 10, he was found dead in his cell. An autopsy showed that he was hanging himself. That happened in the federal prison in Manhattan, where he was previously placed under strict surveillance due to a previous suicide attempt. Guards should have checked the condition of Epstein every half hour, but that didn't happen.
            </p>

            Trump signed an EO a few months ago that is supposed to force convicted traffickers to fork over their assets to their victims.  It'll be interesting to see how this one plays out.
