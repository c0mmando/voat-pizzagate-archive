            Far as I know he's still alive, so that's technically still an option.

            The fact that CEOs have not begun "taking hikes and not coming back" or "shooting themselves in the back of the head" continues to amaze me.  How much more will it take?  I get that people are loath to begin taking revenge until they have nothing left to lose, but are there no terminal cancer patients with a sense of duty to their country?  Are there no suicidal maniacs?

            I went to the source site and can't believe the attorney general said what's being reported. Because where are all the fireworks....the trumpets...the thunder from the clouds?
What this man has said is earthshaking. This is the chief law officer of the land unleashing the hounds...and we get silence?
Even if this is just more trickery, those words are living. That might explain the silence. If I was a pedophile, pimp or human traficcker...especially a vicious murdering raping torturing one...I'd be too scared to breathe right now...much less make a sound.
This is unbelievable and either 
 dummies don't know what the AG had declared or they are too
dense to understand what he has declared. I believe when they find out the abominations are going to drop by 90 percent even before the people in kevlar start chasing.
This world is coming to a conclusion because a whole lot of power has just put a whole lot of power on notice.
And we get silence from the media?
Unbelievable.
Blessing and protection to all whom it concerns.

             Nothing will happen. Words are wind. Here you sit, zero arrest made. Zero charges. Zero consequences. They control the courts, DOJ, FBI, CIA and your government in general. Staments and proclamations are supposed to appease you. Looks like it worked. "everybody gets the truth, nobody goes to jail".

            I suspect the key to bringing the entire Podesta / Clinton crime syndicate down is to arrest enough of the small fish and make 'em squeal in exchange for lenient sentencing. I hope this is what's taking place!

            Is it true that Sessions recused himself of Clinton and Comey?    If so, how would he be able to take down the government heads or corporate heads?   The 2 headed beast.

            I hope so much for this to be true, there have been so many let downs.....I want so much to see these people leaving a courtroom with chains on their wrist and legs, loaded on a prison bus and, put in a prison cell/cage the size of the ones they put little children they have captured in, they deserve the same torture, not being able to stretch out their arms or legs, or to straighten their necks or backs, or even lay down, but I realize that will never happen, so I will just have to settle for them being put in an 8 by 8 cell......and they should never be able to leave it....and no TV, Books etc.....just a cell to go slowly insane in.

            Dave Seaman?.. please.. the guy is a band-wagon jumping, self-promoting coward who deleted all his pizzagate videos, when he got scared of John Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has been exposed by several people already as a disinfo phony shill.

             I have an idea (12 day member) how about you post a video calling John Podesta a pedophile on youtube with YOUR real name and use your face in the video. Once you have done this then you can call David or anyone else a hack but until then bring something to help the cause or just STFU and eat a dick!

              i actually used to have one of Dave Seaman's old deleted Pizzagate videos on my channel.. one of the ones he was too afraid to have on his own channel, but i deleted it, not because i am afraid of "John Podesta:", but because i don't want to give that coward more publicity.
             </p>
             <p>
              And no, asshole, i don't have to do jackshit, because unlike (((Dave Seaman))) I am not interested in being famous, or making money from pedophilia victims and you tube videos, like your scumbag hero, who is always trying to take down videos that expose him as the phony shill that he is......
i wouldn't be surprised if you were one of Dave Seaman's sockpuppets..
             </p>
             <p>
              BTW, ask your valient hero to post some videos exposing George Soros.. i have two of them on my channel..
But he is not going to, because he works for Goldmoney

                Real Independent Journalists do what they do, because they love journalism, not because they want to make money at it.
James Corbett has been an independent journalist for over 10 years, and he has exposed everyone and everything.. and has never taken any videos down, because he is honest, not a phony youtuber, jumping on the pizzagate bandwagon to make money.
               </p>
               <p>
                If Dave Seaman wants to be a journalist  (which he has never been.. he worked for Jezebel and he got kicked out of it, for self-promotion) and wants to make money, he should go and work for NYTimes or the Wapo.. but we know he will never get hired there, because he is not even a real journalist, he is a phony self promoter. Watch the videos i posted, and get back to me.

                 I'm not arguing what Seaman has or hasn't done.  What I am saying is everyone needs a funding source.  Hell, if I had put a paycheck in Bitcoin when Seaman was talking about it (like anyone pumping a stock for long term), we wouldn't be talking as I'd be on 1000 acres somewhere where I'd never be found again.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I will completely disagree with you over Seaman being a journalists.  Those POS on the nightly news who call themselves "journalists" - those are not journalists - those are party apparatchiks.  Don't forget it was Seaman who was booted from HuffPo for reporting on HRC's health.  that was journalism IMO.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hate or like Seaman, and you can argue the smaller details, but that is what trips everyone up here.  They focus on the details too much sometimes.  And I think MM/CTR knows that.  They throw something miniscule out there, and everyone gloms onto, and obsesses over, said morsel.  Rather than looking at the big picture of things.
                </p>
                <p>
                 At the end of the day ask yourself,  has Seaman done more good than "harm"?  And if so, in what ratio of percentage "harm" versus good?  Lump in the items you mentioned above and I'd say Seaman has done 80% positive and 20% negative ("harm") via self promotion, Bitcoin slinging, etc.

                  Seaman never worked for the HuffPo, 
Most HuffPo reporters submit articles there for free, and so did Seaman, he was just trying to do some self-promotion.. so he could have never gotten fired, because he was never paid and he was never an HP employee. HuffPo doesn't pay its writers.

                  Seaman is just another opportunist trying to make a buck from pizzagate and Youtube. 
One more time, watch the videos, so you can understand what he is and where he comes from.

                   I'll look at it again, as I am not above changing my mind.  However, not that I am a fan of HuffPo, but they do clearly dispute the notion that "HuffPo doesn't pay".

                   If you want to go into semantics - was Seaman a W2 employee for HuffPo?  Probably not.  Did Seaman receive a 1099 from HuffPo?  Probably.

                    The articles i am sending you about the Huff Post are recent.. and they are not made up.

                    The HuffPost doesn't pay its bloggers anymore and Dave Seaman probably didn't get paid, considering the date..
                    <br/>
                    Dave Seaman was and is a nobody.

                     Yeah I found an article on Medium that was more recent which pretty much says they accept content from 10,000+ writers who are not paid.

                      you can't argue with a Liberal... give it up. They don't use facts, just opinions they get from CNN and delusional libtard friends.  Has GrDec provided any facts other than he is a pole smoker?

                      Dave Seaman is a phony, opportunistic liar.

                     <p>
                      What damage do liars and dishonest people do?

                     <p>
                      What happens when a company discovers that someone lied on their resume?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      What happens to people who lie under oath in a court of law?

                     <p>
                      What would happens if your significant other had a relationship with somebody else and lied about it?

                      You make it sound, as if lying is normal, and liars and dishonest people should not be judged and should be loved

                       - And people who get paid to smear others do exactly what you are doing.  You proved my point.  No "unaffiliated" person would waste as muh time and energy as you are without 1) an ax to grind, 2) it is their job, or 3) both 1 and 2.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Keep up the good work.  I doubt you are able to find better employment than 15.25/hr, so carry on.  We see you shills for what you are.  Shills.

                        Going by your own twisted logic, only a paid shill would spend so much time and effort defending a phony like Dave Seaman, because it is obvious you are obssesed with defending the guy.. why do you care so much about him??

                       Call into question DS's motives fine...but I can question your motives even more so as you sit behind a newly formed anonymous handle.
DS may be what you say, but don't think for a minute he doesn't have more balls than you do, regardless of his intentions.  Compared to DS, you are a Eunach...and I don't even disagree with your assessment of him.

               Yes, but he was convicted under Trump.

               The Trump admin worked out his plea deal and his jail term.

                 and there lies the problem...  this immunity and non-disclosure is sickening.   They want the public to fight for the politicians and go to war for them at the drop of a word, but apparently aren't  fit enough to get the real truth from full disclosure of all issues.

                   That's the problem, the public aren't allowed any type of honest full disclosure, not only in the Weiner case, but all cases. They might declassify documents but even then censoring and deleting is a massive problem.   This is wrong.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This promotes the problems we're seeing right now.  The public want the truth and they aren't getting it.   That's why this forum is in place, or didn't you put that together yet.  Legal basis for disclosure?  How about full transparency from officials with the purpose of  preventing    crime  that is prevalent globally. 
*note:  the officials work for the public, the public don't work for the officials.  It's all ass backwards to protect a criminal playground and that's exactly what's happening. .

                    You've been lied to about the Weiner laptop.  The story was the NYPD got the laptop first and were on the verge of making arrests, then the FBI bigfooted them and demanded the case.  The NYPD was worried the FBI wouldn't got after all these supposedly dozens of gutwrenching crimes, so they copied the evidence and if Comey didn't come through, they were going to leak all the evidence.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Well it didn't happen.   The NYPD didn't leak all these supposed evidence of horrible crimes.    It didn't happen because the story was a fake.  The NYPD were not the ones who seized the laptop, the FBI was.  The FBI HAS had possession of it all the way through.

                     You say that FBI was in charge of the investigation, not NYPD.
That wouldn't be in keeping with regular protocol.

                     The story I heard was that NYPD had access to the files.  Regardless of who got there first,  wouldn't NYPD have access to data on those files?
                     <br/>
                     Are you saying the NYPD wasn't aware of anything on the files?   If so, why wouldn't they come forward in a press meeting and clear it up?   Did I blink and miss the meeting that clearly said they didn't know what was on the files?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Do you have  mainstream media links and official link interviews to back this up? What would they have to lose by providing an honest explanation? What do they have to gain by not providing one?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     What about the Clinton Files that weren't allowed disclosure.  Are you also saying that is fake and there's nothing on those files either?  If so, then why not provide disclosure? Why the secrecy?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If politicians and government workers would just give honest news reviews, instead of using the mainstream media as a fake propaganda machine,  these stories wouldn't become as mixed up as they are.

                      Yes, this was the story.   However, this story said that NYPD seized the laptop and that was not true.  The story further said that the NYPD backed up the contents of the laptop before turning it over the FBI.  There would be no legal basis for this.   This story did not come from official sources.  The truth is the FBI were the ones who seized the laptop.

                      No.  This was a federal case and it was federal subpoena by the US Attorney who filed it.  It was not the local Manhattan DA that deals with the NYPD and local cases.

Vanity Fair :The story broke in the Daily Mail on September 21, and
                      <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/james-comey-fbi-director-letter">

                      I'm not sure what you are speaking of here.  If you are referring to Hillary Clinton's personal emails, the policy of the State Department was in order to comply with the Federal Records Act, if a person used a personal email account, they would have to review their emails and turn over emails that were government records.  There's no requirements for her to turn over her personal emails per State Department guidelines and was held up on Court when people sued to have them released.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      When the State Department asked for her government emails, she tasked her lawyers with going through her account and determined what was a government record.  They did this by a series of searches I believe.  Some of the emails she turned over to the State Department were returned back to her because they were determined to not be a government record and did not require archiving.   Some emails were missed.  The FBI uncovered these through forensic means, but determined there was no effort at deception.  (For example, they had been deleted years ago or their did not show up in search results.)  The FBI determined they made a good faith effort in determining which was which.    Compliance with the Federal Records Act does not result in a criminal investigation by the way.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Why the secrecy?  Personal is personal. The bulk release of work emails is highly unusual as well.  You can request certain emails through a Freedom of Information ACT request, but you can request " your whole Inbox and Outbox."  It doesn't work that way.   These were released because a judge ordered it.    (Fun fact.  Even if she used a state.gov account, she would not be in compliance with the Federal Records Act, because the State Department technology was so far behind the times, this was not automatically compatible with the archive software required for email.  The tech now is, but they were just rolling that out during her tenure.)

                      You're comparing apples and oranges.   The Schwartz case is a local case and never involved the FBI.  The Weiner case was always a federal case.  The local DA announced they wanted to look into it, but the feds got the subpoena first.  Also the Weiner case crossed state lines as the 16 year old was in NC.

                           This is how you wind up repeating fake nonsense stories. This on you then isn't it. If you can't discern between good reporting and bad reporting in the NY Times or in the "MSM", if you simply reject all of it you are not looking to be informed, you're creating an information bubble, a bubble designed to you make you feel better.

                          Do you not realize that I could tell you the same in reply to your position that  media other than  NYPD, apparently a fashion magazine name  Vanity Fair, and .... what was the other news rag you said was reputable?

                          I could say that you are rejecting  scores of news outlets, or information outlets, and if you can't discern between good reporting and bad reporting,  if you simply reject all of it you are not looking to be informed, you're creating an information bubble, a bubble designed to you make you feel better.

                          So, you're saying that I should  look at these 3 media outlets and learn to discern which articles are fake or real?

                           Are you not aware of Vanity Fair?   Yes, they do glitz and glamour, but they do news and politics too and their journalism is well reported.  The author of that Vanity Fair piece is Bethany McLean one of the best investigative reporters around.   She wrote the Defiinite Book on the Enron scandal and co-wrote the best book on what caused the financial crisis.  I highly recommend these two books.

                            I always saw vanity fair in the checkout isle and viewed it as a fluff rag.  I didn't realize there were  decent articles in that book,  thanks for the  different viewpoint, I'll check it out.

                            How did I get the idea about the NYPD...    that's just the problem,   there were a few different stories and at this point I have no idea how exactly to determine what sources are true.

                            It's really such a  sad state of affairs.  Like most of the rest of the world I don't have inner access to private information, making it difficult to do research on my own.

                             In a lot of ways, they are like an upmarket People magazine, their focus is on the rich and high society.  But they also do some good articles.   They specialize in scandal and crimes among the rich.

                    No they are not.  The contents of the laptop were examined in two separate legal cases.   You don't get see all my stuff, even if I commit a crime.  You only get to see the stuff that is presented as evidence in a court of law.  You don't get to determine what is AWOL.

                    You realize essentially what you are arguing for is a system where a person's enemies can plant a whole bunch of fake stories in ideological news site ( which is exactly what happened) and then use these lies to justify a deeper and wholesale invasion of privacy based on the principle of "clearing the whole matter up."

                    You are basically arguing for a standard on the basis of a deliberate deception campaign that lied to you.  The idea is that NYPD was about to make a bunch of arrests based on Wiener's laptop is false and several of the claimed facts that this story rests upon (NYPD got the laptop first) are shown to be false.

                      You are not an official, are you?   Many of these officials are corrupted from   polticians, to judges and government employees who work on their teams.    They are not allowed to be free from the public eye because they work for the public.  This is exactly how  pedo crime was swept under the rug in the Franklin case, Project Flicker,  the Dutroux case and many other cases including Weiner and Clinton.

                      If full open disclosure was promoted within the political and government official system the scenario you paint would  be nipped much easier.   The problem is that they not only have full privacy, but  in many cases they have full immunity, or lax consequences.  It's due to this lack of disclosure that such scenarios that  you present are easier to put in place.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      For example, Project Flicker.  People in higher ranks became implicated and exposed.   It ended up being shut down on ridiculous claims that there wasn't enough funding, or at least that was one story that was used. 
NO! 
As a result it's been hidden to this day.
Actually, the public should protest and demand the Project Flicker Senator Grassley investigation be re-opened under  FULL disclosure so none of the roaches can hide.

                 The Weiner case was a federal investigation, which is why he was finally convicted and going to jail.

                 The Schwartz case couldn't possibly be a Federal case, but, why didn't this guy get caught under Obumma? 
i am sure he didn't start being a pedo after Trump took office. LOL

                    You are showing your ignorance with every post.  No, Attorney General Sessions does not direct local law enforcement.  That's why Manhattan also has an Attorney General.

             Enrique Pearce was arrested last year, but sentenced to a measly six months recently.

             I'm intrigued by the similarities in the two cases, Pearce and Schwartz. One's a west coast Democratic power player, the other east coast. Both found with thousands of images and videos of abuse, including of infants.
