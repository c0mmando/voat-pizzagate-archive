<p>Something is going on...and it\'s very coordinated, and there are a lot of accounts in on it. I\'ve followed countless &quot;sock&quot; accounts that have been tweeting out random things. But they aren\'t so random when I look them up. There are clues literally everywhere. To what end? I think we\'re witnessing it in the making right now folks. I think there are tons of anonymous accounts that are leaving clues for the public and law enforcement and the public. AnonScan\'s riddles, I\'ve spent a solid 24 hours straight and found out A LOT of things. Between Pizzagate and the &quot;coup&quot; going on, they know it all.

<p>One acct I was following for a couple of days seemed to be in the &quot;know&quot;. I wish I had gotten a screenshot of it, but in reply to one of the comments, there was a  the bottom half of a cropped picture - of Ben Swann\'s &quot;Going Dark&quot; post - with the comment #trust. So I put that guy on my alerts and watched every tweet. Too confusing to explain how it all came about right now, but AnonScan blocked him and warned everyone about #trolls. A few minutes later, I get a follow from a brand new account and a message. <strong>It said #trust.</strong>  Is it him? Or just referencing Ben because people would recognize that? I can\'t say, but it was enough to get me looking. </p>

<p>Now, on one of AnonScan\'s posts, he has a video of an audio recording of the World Trade Center and how it didn\'t make sense how the structure fell. I started searching Wikipedia. I haven\'t gotten too far into it yet because I keep finding other things, but here\'s something to start: </p>

<p>Click the link for Deutsche Bank Building: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank_Building">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank_Building</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Opened in 1974 as Bankers Trust Plaza, the building was acquired by Deutsche Bank when it acquired Bankers Trust in 1998. It was part of the skyline of Lower Manhattan. The Deutsche Bank Building was heavily damaged in the September 11 attacks in 2001 after being blasted by the avalanche of debris, ash, dust, and asbestos that spread from the collapse of the South Tower. 5 World Trade Center will eventually replace the building, expanding the ground space on which the World Trade Center stands, as this land was not part of the original World Trade Center. The structure has since been completely dismantled, clearing the way for the construction of 5 World Trade Center and the World Trade Center Vehicle Security Center.</p>

             I want to, but I'm not sure it would be good to get too detailed. I may end up deleting it based on some other feedback I got. Maybe resubmit it I don't mean to say that I have any actual answers, just ties to some other stuff. Besides, this only relates to Pizza Gate by the way of Ben. So it's relevant, but not exactly. It's not getting any traction here anyway.
