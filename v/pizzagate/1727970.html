             I agree, but it does show the extent to which is it a problem. Hopefully they'll catch a bigger fish some day.

            Excellent post. Have you been following every single arrest? Is there anyway that you could update the 1500 arrests number?

             I have been aggregating news stories that reference child sex trafficking and child pornography (often times there's multiple stories of the same instance). I worry in updating the numbers on that infographic that I would duplicate some instances and miss others. I try to pull as many arrests as I can, but there's a lot and it's hard with life and a job. I am willing to post a similar round-up weekly, however.
