The law enforcement members who were arrested are Carlos Cruz, Louis Failla, Cliff Nieves, Giovanny Rojas-Acosta, Rene Samaniego, Giancarlo Raspanti, and Steven Nieves. Many other people were involved, as the NYPD did a three year investigation on this issue.</p>

<p>I think this goes to the heart of the pizzagate issue. While there don\'t seem to be any noticeable names involved, it shows how bad government corruption can be. (The first article does criticize Mayor De Blasio\'s policy of less police transparency but that is about it for public figures.) Here we had a government agency employing people involved in crime on the side. When some of the people doing the investigation found out, they tipped off the criminals so they could better hide their operation. </p>
<p>Two years ago, when pizzagate first broke, we were told to laugh it off by people like Stephen Colbert saying that Comet Ping Pong doesn\'t even have a basement (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y)</a>), despite the fact the James Alefantis himself said it did a year before. (<a href="http://archive.is/03Lhm#selection-1585.572-1585.612">http://archive.is/03Lhm#selection-1585.572-1585.612</a>) All we wanted was the local police to do an investigation so we could know for sure if our worst suspicions were true. Instead we got this dumb &quot;I stand with Comet&quot; out of the D.C. police chief. (<a href="http://archive.is/jaUpf">http://archive.is/jaUpf</a>) Because the police chief wouldn\'t investigate, we were permanently labeled &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; for even believing that a police force could be corrupt enough as to cover up sex crimes. I think this New York story shows how a police force can become corrupt. </p>
<p>I could have put this story on the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">/v/pizzagatewhatever</a> subverse but I know we have a lot of new Voaters and I wanted to take the time to explain to them part of why I still come back to pizzagate. I know many of the users on the new GA subverse were put off by the vulgarity on voat. While that is allowed here (and needs to be for free speech purposes) this sub is far too focused on investigative work to go around saying random nsfw words on each others\' posts. Also, we believe that claims should be backed up by evidence. Therefore, most of the discussion is based on connecting the dots to other previously known material. Blanket statements about race get down-voted if they have no evidence to back them up. If you don\'t care for the rest of Voat, you may like it better here.</p>',

            2 important aspects of police corruption . The city of Durham , NC refused to send policemen to Israel for training. Why would this even be necessary? Could it have something to do with the many killings of innocent people and the explanation being Oops? Policemen seen on their videos killing for no reason. Reminds me of the country of Israel's ability to murder Palestinians with impunity.....for their land. Or just because of hatred. So, could Israel be actually choosing who will police the US? The state of Conn. was sued for only hiring police men and women with IQs of 100 or less. This is a lot of control, and not a stretch that the motive is destroying US.

            No one ever asks enough questions about Sonny Grosso. Had a cop in Canada tell me that the film French Connection (which is about Grosso and his partner) pocketed the money and got away with the whole deal. Grosso is very scary, very connected and very dirty, in my opinion. The ending of French connection never made sense. Watch it again. The money 'disappeared'.People get killed over revealing these things so please save this. I am getting very spooked these days

            The reason some of use naughty words is because we'd like to bash in Jimmy Comet's fucking face with a fucking brick. Or maybe that's just me, I don't know, but I'm not afraid to admit it. If a few bad words are enough to scare you away, you don't need to be in this fight. We are dealing with KID-FUCKERS, so anyone with a weak stomach or girly sensibilities should just leave forever.

             I do not always agree with you, but you are more right than you realize. There is nothing stopping actual children from viewing what we are communicating. I guess I am kind of used to it now, but no, I will never accept this as a way of life. That being said, if there was one place to curse out LOUD ...

               Free speech.  Get over it.  I say niggerfaggotkike over there, and restrain myself here, it's not neccessary.
I'm not a basement dweller, and have never played a video game in my life.  I guarantee you I am more educated than you.   You're on VOAT.  Toughen up your sensibilities.

                     Ahh. There was this guy who threw a cast net off the Ringling bridge, and it caught up in there. He jumped off the bridge and almost drowned for that same thing. He did have an over sized version. Still down there. I will get out the metal detector when I get the time. 4'th to 6'th pylon from bayside  if you have the old map.

                 I'm just glad I hit some kind of a nerve.
I don't go to parties, so can't answer questions about that.  My friends seem to like me just fine.  We are a little nerdy.

            deBlasio has been easing up on the police dept. and therefore allowing coverups.  Here is an article about how he does that and also how he was reading to children from a book titled Secret Pizza Party book.  de Blasio has so much to do with what is happening in the NYPD and the corruption faction of police officers.

             , thank you for the detailed explanation of PG relevance you included in your thread. Could you edit to add this link that carm has found showing DeBlasio is likely part of the pedovore cabal? It does add to the relevance.
