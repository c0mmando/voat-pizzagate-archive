            According to the owner of the bar Seth spent his last evening at, the owner helped Seth get a cab that evening (Crime Watch interview) while he was out of town with his family in Ocean City MD at the same time (Webb interview today). In other words, the owner is a time traveler who can teleport between multiple locations instantaneously.  Meanwhile, the official story is that Seth did not know his own address, which was close to the bar he frequented. Instead, he actually lived at an address a 40 minute walk away from the bar he went to all the time. He must have spent several hours each day just walking back and forth to the bar since he would stop by multiple times throughout the day.  This whole story is starting to sound like Vince Foster 2.0.

            I don't know if this has already been discussed in another Seth Rich thread but this information was posted to Facebook 2 days ago:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Independent citizen journalist George Webb suspects Rich was drugged, interrogated, then dumped on the corner and shot: "They propofoled him at 2AM, he gave up everything under drugs, and they rolled him out of the car at 4:15 AM." He'd been revived enough to call his girlfriend Kelsey Mulka, apparently at 4:17, and had been at a bar so perhaps attributed his condition to alcohol. "
             <strong>
              He went to the hospital at 4:20 AM, and he talked with his parents and brother. He was sitting up and talking with them, but he was still a bit groggy from the propofol
             </strong>
             ." He lived till 6 AM, over 90 minutes after the shots. "Then the nurse anesthetist took him out at 5:59 AM" or an EMT finished him: "Trainees are a favorite. They are gone in a couple of days. No footprints. Off to another hospital.﻿... I can take an ex-con, train them in two weeks to hang a drip bag, and then I am good at that hospital until somebody lodges a complaint, then I move him out. I still get six or seven "sleeps" out of him before someone complains." Or possibly Seth Rich had been drugged with something designed to interact with anesthesia.
            </p>
            <p>
             "If there was the slightest possibility that Seth might be anywhere near close to death, the hospital would have had him on a heart monitor, a breathing ventilator, all sorts of drips, and literally everything a person needs to stay alive after being shot. What happened at the hospital makes no sense." -- rockguitarnow
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              “They were very surprised he didn’t make it,” Aaron Rich said emergency responders told him. “He was very aware, very talkative. Yep, that was 100 percent my brother.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             "So, an assassin(s) pushed a drugged Seth Rich out of their vehicle and shot him while they remained inside? That may explain the bruises and why no shell casings were recovered. They landed on the floor of the vehicle. The police were there in a little over a minute. Anyone on foot would have been caught. Who has possession of that convenience store video? Scary thought... Some operative was surveilling the scene and saw that Seth was still alive when the police came, and called ahead to someone at the hospital." -- Lane Change
Webb explains the original set-up: "You can do the extraction off the street in a number of ways. Usually a pretty girl needing help with a tire, etc. You have the accomplice come from behind with the chloroform or whatever they use now. You usually explode something or stage a loud fight at the end of the street. Big move covers the small move. Once in the car, you go to a garage. He never leaves the back seat. He gives up [the name of Assange's now-dead lawyer] Ratner first (but I believe they already know that from [Clinton Foundation's former, perhaps extremely former employee Eric] Braverman), and then he gives up Jones and MacFayden." MacFadyen is a deceased American investigative reporter and deceased director of WikiLeaks. "The grogginess means Seth dissipates the propyfol.... When the police withhold the details, you know something is up. I think the two shots are necessary to signal the JTTF team to come pick him up."
Webb also surmises, "Somebody leaked the NSA trace of Seth's calls to Ratner and Jones. I don't think he is killed just for emails. Usually, there has to be a meeting. ...It is after he gives Murray the thumbdrive in the park. He is going to call somebody in London to make sure they got the stuff. Hillary doesn't care about the intermediary. She didn't know who the contact point was in London. That's what they wanted.

             Who could they know? They were in Nebraska at the time. Is there evidence, besides something Webb said sans proof, that they spoke with their son in his last hours?

              That information was also in the Washington Post.  This is why I posted this because of the conflicting information.  And did Seth talk to his family at the hospital ?
