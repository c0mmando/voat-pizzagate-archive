            I was pretty overwhelmed during the red pill, obsessed even. I was in a pretty dark place for a while, and I could sense that people around me thought I may be losing the plot. So I got my shit together again.

           <p>
            The way I see it now, is that we know what's coming and are waiting for everyone else to catch up. It could be a long game, so it's important to maintain credibility.

            Same. I still talk about it though. My mom thinks I'm falling for those fake news sites. I have told her that I never have and am probably more savvy in that regard than most other people as reddit is a great filter and I'm very skeptical.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've spent hours on this without finding any real holes or bullshit. I've seen a lot of disinformation though.

           <p>
            They'll know I was right all along once this blows up.

            I feel the same way. I had one friend belittle me for quite a while but I had another that actually read the link I sent him and came back the next day and say "FUCK YOU" because he went down the rabbit hole and is where we are now. We've discussed it a few times since then and he is in pretty deep.  So it's possible that many won't listen, but if you can wake up one or two people it's a win. Chances are they may be able to wake up someone you couldn't reach and so on and so on.

            Just bring it up gently, let the people find the information for themselves..have you heard about pizzagate? Really big on the internet, suspected pedophile ring just like there was in England, leave it there you have hopefully created enough doubt for further investigation!

            Use memes.  It is first an outlet for our feelings of powerlessness.  And second, it is the most powerful way we can fight back. Make them strong on the themes of the evidence we uncover here.  Spread them everywhere with burn/anon/smurf accounts.  All over social media, links in the comments sections, everywhere, push the subconcious to focus on this, and we will prevail.  IT IS AN INFO WAR.

            Make memes and post them online anonymously on youtube comments, with burn accounts, everywhere you can.  Make memes about transactions for kids and include pictures/references of the companies and people involved.  We need to fight satanic magic with memetic magic.  This will infiltrate the subconcious of the public and soften the ground for the really hard to stomach stuff.  It will also relieve the feelings of powerlessness alot of us are having.

            What I do is focus on the positives. Like did you know according to (real) surveys that 75% of Greeks, 45% of Russians, 14% (ish) of UK, 51% of France, and over 60% of populations in Hungary and Slovakia and the US believe, like you/us, that an evil shadow government is trying to take over the world?
           </p>
           <p>
            So you are not alone.I have felt the same as you - hugs - but around half the world is starting to realise that people like you and me and the others are here to help set things straight.....it won't be long.

            That's foolish. What we're talking about is just as real as real life. In fact, I'd argue it's far more important to be spreading the word locally than on a forum of like-minded people who already know a majority of what you have to say.

            Hey there! Hang in there, Kikkoman. I would say the prescription for what ails you is to go to the zerohedge article and just read through the comments! The zerohedge article is not complimentary about us researchers, but once people start seeking out the truth on their own, they come back and shut down the shills and plants. Also, check out the YouTube comments on the Alex Jones video "Pizzagate IS REAL." Seems that if you try to explain it to people, their normalcy bias prevents them from hearing you, but when they seek out the evidence on their own, they absolutely see the light! Don't get burned out. Just take a step back and let God do the work for you. You'll be amazed. After all, you are doing HIS work! He's got your back.
           </p>

            I'm with you man. I'm married and I talked to my wife about what went on in the_donald every day up until the election. I am lucky she is  redpilled and doesn't look at me crazy. She does ask me every now and then if I'm okay, though haha. I really hope this evil gets uncovered. We are all here with you!

             Fight them with memes.  Spread the memes with anon/dupe/burn accounts on social media, in popular threads and groups, on instagram, link in comment sections, get the meme magic to infiltrate, permeate, and educate the public.  This election proved social media is more powerful, and we can crowdsource with noble volunteers way better than they can pay shills and write algo's to fight back.

            Most people don't want to believe it - hell I don't want it to be true either.  I have a few people close to me that I can talk to, or at least can tell them to go research and they will.  Sorry we can't be there in person, but you are not alone in the search for the truth.

            you can give clever hints to people about it, and let them search for it and then they'll tell you. or just tell them the truth, about how you discovered a piece of info with strong arguments and happening stuff like that to  children jus breaks your heart, me personally all this got me messed up reql bad.

            There is also the thing of if you talk to just anybody about this, they might be on the side of the bad guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've talked to my sister about it, but I haven't even begun to tell her all the depths of depravity that are being uncovered.  This is the levels I bring up trying to talk to people about it:
1) have they heard of wikileaks?
2) have they heard of podesta?
3) then try and bring up the pedo rings connection
4) if you haven't lost them yet, then bring up the spirit cooking and satanic implications
5) if haven't lost them still , bring up the golden dahmer art and the pics behind podesta on a wall of cannibals
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not easy but if they can get even the first couple parts of this, it's a good start.

            We feel the same way.  Alien talk on another post on this sub made me think Biblical end times may be near...  I've mentioned this on another comment but what if the recent world wide cooperation on climate change is a farce?  Breitbart Glenn Beck InfoWars have shown articles before on how NOAA and NASA other organizations have falsified temp. data.  What if it's just a ploy to draw attention away from other issues...  Also anyone remember when Glenn Beck had melt downs on FOxNews and would always say he's on to something big but never really went into it.  Then had to leave Fox, said he had health issues, now has own channel.  What were his health issues?  Does he know???

             Use memes, make sure the connections in the memes are strong and heavy in evidence we uncover during investigation.  Use memetic magic to fight the satanic propaganda.  It's all about the subconcious.  Themes should be "are you really on the top of the food chain?"  "its 10pm, who's fucking your kids", etc etc etc.  Make burn/anon/smurf accounts on all social media sites and spread them with links in comments sections, popular groups with activists and the religious.  Remember, the internet is a series of hyperlinks, much like a human brain made of neurons.  The more of those links that relate to this topic, the more we will infiltratre, permeate and educate the public to realize they are prey and livestock.

            If you really want to talk about this to people IRL you will have to build up to it and focus on hard evidence when you do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Start with small things that have been proven. Operation Mockingbird, MKUltra, and things of that nature because they have been well sourced, proven, and eventually the government admitted to them. This should lay the groundwork for this to at least be plausible.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hardest part will be to sound a bit sceptical about the whole thing when you lay it down. You do this to feel the person out and if they seem to shrug it off then don't push it and never bring it up again. If they seem to believe some of it then talk with them some more about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most people will want to keep their head in the sand though. It is to be expected and you can't hold it against them. This is a lot of fucked up shit and no body wants to thinks these sickos could be calling the shots for everybody.

            Just focus on the BEST/STRONGEST evidence, and don't feel like you have to convince people.  Some people just will not want to hear it.  Don't waste your breath/energy on them.

             Faced with actual evil, most people look away. It's our instinct. People simply don't want to believe such horror actually exists.

              I wouldn't necessarily say "most people," but yeah, a lot of people either can't handle reality, or just don't care enough to face it (i.e. not actively evil, but passively evil).

            I know how you feeling mate. I didn't even bother to start talking about this with anyone because I know, that every single person I know gets all their information either by the big newspapers /tv-news channels or at BEST from facebook.
I know no single person, who knew even reddit before i told them about it. Fucking Germany. Good sheeple country no.1.

             fight them with memes.  make memes involving real connections and spread them with burn accounts dupe accounts anon accounts.  spread them everywhere, infiltrate the public subconcious to soften the ground for the hard to believe hard to stomach stuff. Think of all the weird ass advertisements you've seen, think of all the l33t memes that get spread.  spread this stuff so that it becomes assumed, that is how we will out them.  Once people are looking for it, they will see it.  Educate, infiltrate, permeate.

              Amazing my ass, they play the public like a fiddle. Extended election cycle, keeping NDP at the front the whole time getting people tired of it. The last little bit switched to Trudeau and he won, easy as that.

            your family isnt the only people to inform you can try to tell others as an alternative

L.T General flynn involvement
If you associate this with respected people or institudes its harder for them to deny it
How are they going to discredit the entire nypd or lt general flyn?
