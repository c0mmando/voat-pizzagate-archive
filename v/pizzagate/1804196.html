Also Pizzagate related because I think Virginia where the poster is from is the state with the highest missing kids number per capita in the whole country, out of our 800,000. Missing kids that the center for missing and exploited children claims.
The bottom of the poster says Contact Curtis Kindred and has a phone number. I wouldnt know why people would need to call first. Searching Curtis Kindred in Google images brings only four results the top one was this image of a smiling little girl with a ping pong paddle at a ping pong table. If thats is a weird coincidence, it\'s very weird.

I searched Curtis Kindred and found none on facebook, but a Connie Boone Kindred on facebook who is connected to the poster by the last name and her employment at suffolk parks and recreation whos name is also in the flyer and looks like they sponsored the event. It says she started working at suffolk parks and recreation in 2012. Its not clear to me if either Kindred had anything to do with producing the poster with the pedophilia logo but its strange the name Curtis Kindred brings up the image with the ping pong little girl and that they are in Virginia. Connie Boone hasnt posted for a while -November 8 2016 a political flyer is the last one and second to her last post of 2016, Sept a pic of her daughter ( the twin that survived Dynasty, Destney died) who looks disabled in a wheelchair making pizza.

            This has Research Me written all over it.  Will help out later.  Ping pong, hearts and swirls.  Parks and recreation?  A lot of kids go missing from parks.  That's just for starters.
