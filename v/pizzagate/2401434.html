<h1>Muskogee Police Concerned Child Sex Ring May Have Other Victims</h1>
<p>MUSKOGEE, Oklahoma -</p>
<p>Muskogee police have made a second arrest, and identified a second victim in a child pornography case that started with the arrest of a firefighter.</p>
<p>Now they\'re concerned about other children possibly involved - and say the case involves at least one child being used for sexual exploitation - with the knowledge of her mother.</p>
<p>Zackery Perry, former Muskogee firefighter, and Melissa Skelton have both been arrested in the investigation.</p>
<p>Muskogee Police held a news conference Tuesday, February 7 to discuss the arrests and ask other possible victims to come forward.</p>
<p>&quot;The potential is that there are more victims,&quot; said Muskogee Officer Lincoln Anderson. &quot;That\'s why the investigators are going through the electronics, the phones, to see what\'s there, to make sure they don\'t miss anything.&quot;</p>

            Evidently, when dealing with the government and its underlings, we're brushing elbows with pedos st about 3 in 10 or something. A thorough background check or psych eval is sounding pertinent

            American Airlines agent saves 2 teenage girls from human trafficking scheme
           </p>
           <p>
            Law enforcement officials say that a quick-thinking airline employee, aptly named Denice Miracle, likely saved two teenage girls from a human trafficking plot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Miracle, an American Airlines agent at California's Sacramento International Airport, was working at the ticket desk on Aug. 31 when two girls, aged 15 and 17, approached her counter, according to KOVR.
           </p>
           <p>
            Miracle said the teenagers, who were trying to board a flight to New York, had a small number of bags with them, but no form of identification and no adult guardians.
           </p>
           <p>
            The vigilant employee began to think something was seriously wrong when she noticed that the tickets, both first class, were purchased online with a credit card under a name that did not match what either of the teens had provided.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It was a first-class ticket. It was very expensive. I told a supervisor, 'I'm going to call the sheriff. It just doesn't feel right to me,'" Miracle said.
           </p>
           <p>
            When deputies arrived at the airport, the teens admitted that their pricey tickets were purchased by a man named "Drey" who they met on Instagram.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently, the stranger told them that if they flew to New York for the weekend, he would pay them $2,000 to model in a music video.
           </p>
           <p>
            Authorities say they located "Drey" on social media, but after briefly making contact with him, all of his accounts went dark.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We attempted to look him up on Instagram," said Deputy Todd Sanderson. "Just a few minutes after our contact with him, he erased all of his profiles on social media."
           </p>
           <p>
            When Deputy Sanderson informed the teens that their tickets had no return flights, he said they became defensive before ultimately accepting what could have happened to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            "They were somewhat flippant about – 'No, that can't be true' – and I said, 'No, the airline says you have a one-way ticket, and in my belief, you're going back there not to do the things that you think you were going to be doing.' And they said, 'I wouldn't let anything happen that I didn't want.' And I said, ‘Well, you probably wouldn't have a choice in the matter,'" Deputy Sanderson said.

            bullshit! he was a voluntary firefighter. sure he wasn't perfect, but he still volunteered to help. he still put his life on the line for no benefit. are you better? really? with your paid work and different mistakes, you are really better than this guy? fuck off, you just judge his mistakes as worse than yours, because fucking fat angry bitches agree with you and jews taught it in school and the media. you are not better, in fact you are most likely a great deal worse.

             I know. And can you imagine the scope of this? All it takes is this nickel-and-dime firefighter scumbag churning out porno and enlisting desperate, stupid scumsucking mothers to hand over their daughters. It's probably going on in every city across the country. ... and look at the damage it does.

              <p>
               Remember Slick Willy's campaign slogan The Economy Stupid?  It wasn't that. It was always The Pedos Stupid! That's the threat! These pedos are all part of the problem and are vested in destroying America. Open Borders? Yeah! Imagine what havoc they could wreak with that policy in place. And as for imagining, imagine what in roads we could have made if real journalists had concentrated on outing pedos and not this Russian Collusion narrative/propaganda. But then the press is part of the problem. All the real journalists have been replaced by this sick bunch that's hell-bent on advancing/normalizing molesting kids.
              </p>
              <p>
               Keep churning out fake news, propagandists, and we'll keep calling you out for it.

             Perry was a Muskogee firefighter until his arrest a month ago. He resigned the same day, and, despite his work there as a clown promoting fire safety, police said the accusations only involve his time off-duty.   I BELIEVE he was a firefighter but also worked there as a clown promoting fire safety.  This is probably how he got close to kids in his spare time, off duty.  Just trying to set the record straight :)

             What I don't understand is why the f*cking FBI hasn't reached out. The child was taken across state lines so it was human trafficking/kidnapping. The FBI has the resources to go through and help identify who is in this crap! Oh, I forgot! The FBI is too busy helping Killary cover up her sins.

              Firefighter.  Remember the post about week ago?  Firefighters voted a former Sex Offender as their Captain. The mayor was OK with it.  Maybe there are more of these across the country. Pedo rings.  Wow.  In the firehouse.  It's a Shocking Thought.

                This is all making me so sick.  I think this is happening on purpose.  Are they allowing these guys to find jobs within the Fire Dept.?  They are possibly put in there to facilitate the rings?  There seem to be many of them lately.  More and more, like with the police as well.  Frightening actually.

                 This is about the destruction of our society and the rebuilding it into Sodom and Gomorrah. In that blind CDAN item where people thought it was one of The Beatles enty was talking about, I did a little research on John Lennon. The man was a scumbag pedo POS who beat his wives/girlfriends. He made mention of Caligula and said that going on tour was like that. They asked how they could keep his image so clean if that were true and he said he had no idea how they did it. I'm saying this because that was when ... in the 60s? And they've had how long to work on this destruction taking place? And even in the stories of old Hollywood, the people were pervs ... and now it's even worse.

                  Wow.  I remember researching the British Bands a while back and that there was a little blurb about John and his first wife.  Was it Cynthia, something like that.  Some type of abuse.  There were a lot of the male bands that got away with that stuff because they were being protected by the studios and the press already.  Mick  is another one that should be looked into.
