            I think Comedy is a great way to tackle this subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe "Epstein's Temple" can join me in ousting Marina Abramovic and claiming the entire bloodline for myself (whatever is left when the cleanup is done). As "The New Artist", I could sure use a Temple! I haven't yet figured out what my secret code number will be, but maybe 94, since I am taking over #Cult93.
           </p>
           <p>
            As The New Artist, I can invent and celebrate ceremonies in your home that will leave your guests saying "WTF! Did I Just See!". There will be no more piles of dead animals, celebrity chefs or... even... any celebrities at all really. There will also not be any red hands holding baby heads... This unsacrificed #Cult93 child of the White Rabbit does not practice or allow child abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is why my first pronouncement as the new Pope of the Devil Worshippers who didn't perform enough to warrant a death sentence is to announce :
           </p>
           <p>
            From now on, all babies thrown out with the bathwater count as a sacrifice to Baal until Baal is officially canceled (I don't have an official date on that yet.)
           </p>
           <p>
            I decide to meet the Devil Worshippers halfway and manifest illumination on the many hypocrisies they uphold via their double standards and gaslighting campaigns.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once aggregated, all of Satan's Leftover Suppôts will form a Service to Humanity class and serve "The Illuminated" (it's just regular people who awoke of their own volition, there's no initiation beyond doing a lot of homework!)
           </p>
           <p>
            The God of The Illuminated is Uriel, God's favorite prince, bla, bla, bla, read the bible, the guy is a beast and he rains down destruction on Sodom and cough, cough Hollywood!
           </p>
           <p>
            I used to read Voat.co between October 2016 and January 2019. I was evaeverywhere. I've had to create a new account and will spam your comments with these excepts so I can regain enough trust to be allowed to tell you about my research over the past 18 months.

             The real secret doesn't have much to do with the paedo stuff. The media focusses on this because we have been educated to think that rich men deserve to have young women (it's socially aspirational) and when someone mentions child abuse, middle-class people put their hands over their ears and say: "Not my business!". So there's not that much blowback if the media just focusses on these aspects of the case.

             I know what happens at Wonderland parties because I was conceived at a Wonderland party.

             Jeffrey Epstein and his #Cult93 of TV influencers have acquired American scientists via blackmail. And as we saw with Wuhan Lab Lieber at Harvard, China gives scientists money which they don't declare. 50+ have been "fired" from the NHS database. THIS is related to Epstein and China's 1000 Talents.

             It's been going on since 1948 in my small home town with a 5,000 capacity "ward of the state" mental hospital.

             This will never happen, imo. Certainly not in a UK court, and they will never extradite him to the US.

              It is a pleasure to be back. I have a fully documented story of the medical kidnapping of 20,000 children which includes an avalanche of begrudgingly turned over evidence in the second most shameful event Canadian history. The first in the destruction of more than 50,000 Native American children in residential schools. Both scandals executed by the same people, for similar eugenists purposes! It will take me forever to turn this into videos! But I have hours and hours of confirmation of everything that people allege via #Pizzagate!
