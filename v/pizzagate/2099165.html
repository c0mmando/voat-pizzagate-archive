<p>What happened to Gemmel is a peek behind that curtain of respectability that Dems hide behind. This is what\'s going on! We knew it from the emails, but now everyone knows it! A petition has been started that is demanding Democrats return Ed Buck\'s money! </p>

            WEHOtimes.com reported
            <a href="http://www.wehotimes.com/witnesses-both-encouraged-and-discouraged-to-testify-in-ed-bucks-investigation-of-gemmel-moores-death/">
             http://www.wehotimes.com/witnesses-both-encouraged-and-discouraged-to-testify-in-ed-bucks-investigation-of-gemmel-moores-death/
            </a>
            that at an Aug. 21 West Hollywood City Council meeting, Gemmel Moore’s mother told councilmembers that Ed Buck’s victims need to be given immunity from prosecution so that they can come forward and testify against him.  “I want you people to put pressure on whoever needs pressure so that these people can get immunity and I can get justice for my son.”
           </p>
           <p>
            She also astutely pointed out Buck’s political donation history as a potential stumbling block, telling the councilmembers, “I’m sure maybe he’s donated to some of you.  If you guys can look past that.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, according to the article, Councilmember Lindsey Horvath was the only person sitting on the dais who had not taken campaign donations from Ed Buck, either directly or through a PAC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mayor Pro Tempore John Duran, who was characterized in the article as “perhaps Ed Buck’s largest recipient of largess,” reportedly gave this warning to potential witnesses:
           </p>
           <p>
            “Before anybody speaks to the Sheriff’s Department, you need to be aware that the Sheriff’s Department does not grant immunity. The West Hollywood City Council does not grant immunity. The only agency that grants immunity to a witness is the District Attorney’s office. That type of immunity needs to be pre arranged through legal counsel speaking to the District Attorney before immunity is granted.  Transparency doesn’t always work with the criminal justice system. Transparency can subject you to criminal arrest and prosecution. So, before you do anything, you should seek legal counsel to advise you on how to move forward. Before you speak to law enforcement.”
           </p>
           <p>
            An activist present at the meeting, Ashlee Marie Preston, called Duran’s statement “witness intimidation,” noting that young, black, mostly homeless sex workers who take drugs are unlikely to be able to afford to retain attorneys.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT:  Also, the article says Mayor Pro Tempore Duran "has told people that he has represented Mr. Buck in the past."

             These people are filthy dirty. Giving money to a campaign should not in any way entitle anyone to preferential treatment. Donations are to get the politician you believe will be the best for the community/city/state/country elected, not to get them to do your bidding. It's so disgraceful.

             The only question is if there'll be justice for Gemmel or whether The Cannibal Elite will sweep this under the rug along with all their other dirty little secrets.

            Oh, there is an ongoing investigation. The LA sheriff reopened the case at the insistence of Gemmel's mother. Here's the link to the post:

            It documents that a lot of other stuff like code words, other victims coming forward, Gemmel's diary entries.

            The link to only the investigation being reopened is here:
