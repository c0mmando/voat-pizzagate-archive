            Satanic Panic, what a joke. Just a way the Luciferians and satanists try to dismiss what they are up to. Sadly, MSM echoes their lies. The False Memory Foundation is another attempt to discourage the truth. Ties to the CIA and many at the top of the Foundation are pedophiles

            I think you're right. Seems like TPTB are afraid the truth really will get out there this time, so they'll try to paint it as another round of satanic panic. I noticed similar comments on the Intercept article and an Austin Statesman article comparing this case to the Salem witch trials. Sounds like talking points are being crafted.
