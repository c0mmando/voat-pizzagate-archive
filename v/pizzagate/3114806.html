<blockquote>
<p>Barbra Streisand is under fire for comments she made about two men accusing Michael Jackson of sexually assaulting them as children.</p>
<p>The legendary singer and actress <strong>said that Wade Robson and James Safechuck — whose allegations against the late King of Pop resurfaced in the recent documentary “Leaving Neverland&quot; — “were thrilled to be there” and that what allegedly happened to them “didn’t kill them.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Streisand, 76, made the strange comments to British newspaper <a href="https://archive.is/RB5N1">The Times</a> in a piece out Friday, in which she also <strong>said that Jackson’s “sexual needs were his sexual needs.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>She says she “absolutely” believes the allegations of abuse by Robson and Safechuck, but puts more blame on their parents than The Gloved One.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“His sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has,&quot; Streisand told The Times. “You can say ‘molested,\' but those children, as you heard say [grown-up Robson and Safechuck], they were thrilled to be there. They both married and they both have children, so it didn’t kill them.”</strong></p>
<p>Streisand, who crossed paths with Jackson during their careers, added that she feels sorry for both the alleged victims and Jackson.</p>
<p>“I feel bad for the children,” she said. “I feel bad for him. I blame, I guess, the parents, who would allow their children to sleep with him. Why would Michael need these little children dressed like him and in the shoes and the dancing and the hats?”</p>
<p>Dan Reed, the director of “Leaving Neverland,” seemed shocked at Streisand’s comments. “\'It didn’t kill them’ <a href="https://voat.co/u/BarbraStreisand">@BarbraStreisand</a> did you really say that?!,\'” Reed tweeted Friday.</p>
<p>Others were equally outraged.</p>
<p>“As a lifelong fan, I am deeply disappointed about your remarks regarding Michael Jackson,” a Twitter user going by Lisa Bee wrote. “I don’t understand how you could be so dismissive of the abuse that he inflicted and the damage that’s been done. It’s so unsympathetic to ALL victims of sexual abuse.”</p>
<p>Another, whose name on Twitter is simply Jen, wrote, “What you said about Michael Jackson’s victims is seriously disgusting. Victims are not thrilled to be molested.”</p>

            Thing that really gets me is a person says something like this and they just get away with it!!!!! If you’re a lib, you get away with it! Sometimes they feel like they have to apologize for it sometimes not. No one to
Hold them accountable for it anymore. The more they talk the more it seems it might be normalizing it to people!

             It's a tried and true method used by the pedo establishment to deflect when the heat of public scrutiny is turned up.
            </p>
            <p>
             They dissociate from and self-righteously proclaim to be evil a dead member of their clan or, alternatively, throw a living one under the bus when the statute of limitations for criminal action has safely passed.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yes, it does seems to be a coordinated effort.  The question is:  Who gives the marching orders?

              Satan. Lucifer. I'm not being glib, I'm 100% serious. If you mean who is his #1 field marshal, I doubt there's only one. They are rich and powerful people, sure. Some of them we know, some we don't, but the point is they are legion and they are expendable. Until the antichrist appears, at least. I don't know if the Antichrist mentioned in the Bible has been born yet. I'd like to hope so, because that means Jesus is coming to take care of this mess. 🙏 Other than that I think your comments are SPOT ON!

            Unfortunately, she is still under MKultra. She may be able to sing a bit but there is an emptiness within her soul. She doesn't know what it's like to control your own mind and body. So sad.

              Do you find her somewhere? Podesta's been around .... not her.  Send a link if you find her making any response to the news.  Many had expected her to announce her candidacy this weekend.

            Barbara Streisand has strange tastes in art: likes Ego Schiele Austrian painter that died age 28 in 1918, known for his explicit nudes
           </p>
           <p>
            " he and his lover were driven out of the town by the residents, who strongly disapproved of their lifestyle, including his alleged employment of the town's teenage girls as models. Progressively, Schiele's work grew more complex and thematic, and, Schiele's studio became a gathering place for Neulengbach's delinquent children. Schiele's way of life aroused much animosity among the town's inhabitants, and in April 1912 he was arrested for seducing a young girl below the age of consent. "
           </p>
           <p>
            " He also displayed incestuous tendencies towards his younger sister Gertrude . When he was sixteen he took the twelve-year-old Gerti by train to Trieste without permission and spent a night in a hotel room with her.[4]In 1910, Schiele began experimenting with nudes and within a year a definitive style featuring emaciated, sickly-coloured figures, often with strong sexual overtones. Schiele also began painting and drawing children."
" and the 12-year-old Tatjana von Mossig, the Neulengbach girl whose morals he was ultimately convicted of corrupting for allowing her to see his paintings."

            That actually may be her giving voice to a common Hollywood elite attitude implanted by their own handlers as a something they could grab onto while coming to grips and dealing with their own "grooming". She's maybe just the one who was said it publicly first.

            I'm a bit shocked. I admit I hadn't expected that from her. I hope she gets drowned with Tweets, and comments by people telling her what an asshole she is.

            Too bad both of them had already admitted MJ didn't molest them, and their stories are so full of holes they are easy to discredit.   Dru Story News has this covered.  Things people will say and do for money.

            So with that logic, Babs, we should just dismiss all the allegations against Weinstein. I mean, it didn’t kill them, so they should just take it as a learning experience. Right?

            SAY WHAT?  Is she saying she believes he did it?  That's what it sounds like to me.  This *itch is demented and evidently was molested herself if she actually believes what she said.  They were married?  SO WHAT!!!  You know what?  I have experience with this problem in the family.  I will not divulge what or whom but let me tell you one thing.  There were years of therapy and it was never resolved.  Some people just cant come to terms with what was done to them.  SO NO, just because he was a famous person like her, she cannot just blow it away.  People that are famous do not get a ticket to do whatever just because SHE things they and SHE are special.  They are NOT.  Actually all of them are sick for wanting to constantly have our adulation and constant approval.  So There.  Actually I have disliked her for years.

            Well, sounds like Old Babs is an enabler. We know Barbra has had a very checkered and bumpy ride to the top of Hollywood ranks and we know she had to pay dearly for that title, especially being the Queen of entertainment for any elitist Jewish personality that ever existed. Lock and Load Voat, looks like Barbra pasted a target on her back.

             <strong>
              hated
             </strong>
             her for years.  My dearly departed husband always asked me why.  Other than I really hated her mannerisms and singing, there was always something that nagged at me.  Now I know why.  There was just something when I looked at her that said EVIL.

              Oh yeah, I've always felt it too, never liked her or her music. She was quite good looking when she was young however and I'm pretty sure her musical talents were accompanied by the lifelong cult she was groomed into as a child. Just like Michael. Her words are not "strange", just very revealing.

               Funny how you sense those things and have nothing to base them on at the time.  I know people that hang on her every word and me well she makes me sick.  I can't even have her on for a minute.

                When I was just a young boy I had a very hard time comprehending the concept of Yentil. There were many "films" of that era that utterly and totally confounded me as a child and that confusion, over time and repetition, inevitably has lasting effects. I remember specifically freak ass movies that left certain marks on us from that generation, shit films from Woody Allen walking around dressed like a perverted robot, horror films with Donald Sutherland, and horse faces like Cher mark certain periods for us Americans, some see the positive and 'fun' elements of it but others can and have observed, that over time, what we have been witness to is a

                 All I have to say is that I am so glad I am not part of that demographic.  She and her ilk hob nob around with those like HRC and friends.  That's enough to make me sick and barf. I just wonder what in the world she does to keep looking so good for her age.  Although she still has an evil ugliness I cant describe.  I have to say there are many I don't like but she is at the top of the list.

                  What does Babs do to look so good? What they all do—eat children, torture them and drink their blood, they use their dead bodies in crimes for their skin. Now we know why God told us not to eat blood!!!!
