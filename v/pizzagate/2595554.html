            what the fuck is this movie?? I saw a couple clips on youtube after seeing your post and it looked a little weird but like it could just be one of those innocent "kid befriends a kooky adult" disney type stories so I decided to put it on while i made lunch and I'm only 20 minutes in and what the FUCK. the whole movie is blatantly about sex, showing the lawn boys fingering and eating out the housewives (in front of the little girl even) who are all fucking the lawn boys and it looks like Sam Rockwell's character even had a sexual thing in grade school with one of the douchebag guys?  wtf?
           </p>
           <p>
            the Mischa Barton girl takes her fucking clothes off in panties with no top to howl at the moon in the first 10 minutes wtf and literally everything the dad says to her sounds like what a parent trying to convince their kid to suck a producer's cock would say after the kid resists...like coaxing her to be a good girl and her pretty face is what sells the cookies and she should keep going back to try to please the customers etc
           </p>
           <p>
            even without any pizzagate knowledge this is a weird movie, to combine so many sexual scenes alongside the kid befriending an adult stuff (compared to just an innocent disney movie that's completely G-rated), but WITH pizzagate knowledge every line the dad says is creepy...he's chasing a higher position in the community to have control over it like a producer or politician and sending his daughter around "selling girl scout cookies" telling her to sell herself.  it's just fucking weird if you look for undertones and metaphors to it
           </p>
           <p>
            this whole movie so far reminds me of the part in An Open Secret when they show guys like Sean William Scott having to do weird low-budget clearly gay tv show pilots that are just an excuse for producers to molest them or whatever to get into the industry
           </p>
           <p>
            and of course, Mischa Barton (the little girl in this movie) has a meltdown later in life:

           <p>
            and left hollywood completely at some point.  just a coincidence I'm sure
           </p>
           <p>
            I googled some reviews because I wanted to see like, wtf?  did this movie get a good rating, did anyone mention the creepy undertones?  and of course on a fucking pedophile forum:

            other gem from that thread:

           <p>
            "The time that I have spent with children I have loved the times where we have held hands in public or went to a movie together and cuddled with each other. I feel so bad that I went further than that with children and wish that I had a time machine and wasn't so selfish in my actions with young children. I wish that I would have kept it legal and just cherrished them for who they are and not what I wanted from them."

             from the script, this is one of the douchebag guys that makes fun of Sam Rockwell's character and then chases him down out of sight of everyone else...there's purposely a ton of sexual tension, the hole he makes in the guy's shirt is where his nipple is and when the guy holds his hands it's a sexual caressing thing with his finger, like no misinterpretation possible:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              SEAN: Hey, McKay County School. Sean Torrels. Third grade, remember?
             </p>
             <p>
              TRENT: No.
             </p>
             <p>
              SEAN: I was only there a few months. My parents pulled me out and put me in private.
             </p>
             <p>
              TRENT: Oh yeah yeah, your dad drove that...that blue BMW.
             </p>
             <p>
              SEAN: Did he? I don't remember.
             </p>
             <p>
              TRENT: I remember. It was the only new car in the school parking lot that winter.
             </p>
             <p>
              SEAN: We were friends, right?
             </p>
             <p>
              TRENT: Nah, just in the same class. (TRENT reaches out and pokes his finger in a hole in SEAN's shirt) Should know better to come to a party dressed like shit. In third grade you had better taste. (SEAN takes TRENT's hand and holds it)
             </p>
             <p>
              SEAN: My bet was that you could of made a good surgeon.
             </p>
             <p>
              TRENT: Like your daddy?

              fuck that was some weird shit. When Trent puts that hole in the shirt I have no idea what that's supposed to mean, and then he full on kisses the guy on the mouth later in the movie. I guess this is supposed to mean he's gay and had no interest in the girl?

              I had to turn this movie off 3 times, I was just too weirded out to keep watching.

              And the scene right after that it shows her dropping her panties down and peeing on a truck and then one of the douchebag guys who was fucking one of the housewives in an earlier scene drags a bullet down her body in a sexual way and says she smells just like her mother and tries to reach under her top, what is this movie:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               She dumps TRENT's hotdogs in her father's toolbox first. Then she sits on top of her father's truck near the edge. She slides her panties down and begins to urinate down the windshield. Then she climbs inside the truck and turns the wipers on, smearing her revenge. She opens the glove box and pulls out a gun, points it at the windshield and says
              </p>
              <p>
               DEVON: Go ahead, make my day. (BRETT scares her)
              </p>
              <p>
               BRETT: BANG! Oh, daddy's gun, huh? (he takes the gun) That's pretty dangerous. (he takes one bullet out and touches it to DEVON's lips) You ever wonder what one of these might feel like going in. (Slowly, he moves the bullet down her chin and to her chest) You smell like your mom. (he inches her button-up shirt open)
              </p>
              <p>
               DEVON: Get out! (DEVON slides to the other side to get out of the truck)
              </p>
              <p>
               BRETT: Hey! Sshhhh!

            , please check out our submission guidelines in the sidebar (view desktop site if on mobile). We require a description of how you think the movie relates to sex abuse of kids by the global elite (pizzagate), as well as at least one supporting link. Unsourced discussion posts belong in our speculative subverse,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            I've given this our 24 Hour Grace flair in case you want to expand the submission so that it fulfills the rules. Otherwise, this will be removed per Rules 1 and 2.
