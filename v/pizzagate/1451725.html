            I could see that is some ways.  The focus on essencially therapy sessions considering MKULTRA increases neurological suseptability partially through schock.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are ways I could see the oposite.  If they opperate like a typical secretive power structure then they will be absorbed into the general power structure because it would operate on selfish desires on the inside.  They would have to keep the organization super flat so that even powerful people just below the top are subservient in away that would keep them from pursuing their own coruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            A theory I have on defeting MKULTRA is just that getting people out to nature is a good idea.  Highly abstract stimuli are a part of it as well.  Not that brains can't take that but starving them of anything else besides what I call "hard edge stimuli" is not good.

            Its very interesting that NAVY has so much power.
I think the reason is the NUCLEAR SUBMARINE, once they discovered URANIUM subs and it became obvious that they could stay under water for years, that no human, or normal human could tolerate the NAVY took on the super-soldier meme of the CIA program ( operation paperclip nazi-ss )
           </p>
           <p>
            By subjecting infants to rape and raised in cages later as adults living in submarines would seem like heaven.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was all for the good of America, oops I mean Nazism.
....
Every agency adopted this program and MKULTRA is just one of 100's of names for manchurian-candidates.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            NASA is also involved all along as it would be preferred to send super-soldiers to space as they wouldn't go mad in closed space, having been conditioned since birth to live in a box.
           </p>
           <p>
            NASA like operation-paperclip was a NAZI-SS program from the state all started by german nazi elite
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, remember that BUSH family put HITLER in power, and BUSH owned RCA-UK, and today its called SERCO-GROUP and controls almost everything on earth.

            There were 3 main areas for warehousing 1,000's of stolen children the processing was ran by US-NAVY-INTEL, CIA just did the Planning. The idea was the super-soldier, super-spy, ppl who couldn't be interrogated because they really didn't know, but could be activated to kill anytime.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 3 training centers were area-51 the biggest, ,china-lake ridgecrest secret bases, and sheridan,oregon a HUGE Jesuit Monastery...
.....
Get this you can google it, about 40+ years ago a main processing center for stolen children was the Jesuit Monastery in Sheridan Oregon, an isolated castle that was used with a nearby secret CIA airport and abandoned logging buildings.
           </p>
           <p>
            20+ years ago Scientology took over the location and its there main school, Tom Cruises kids have gone there. Today they call it the HIGH-SCHOOL for scientology, they frequently have men with uzi sub-machine guns at the entrance the castle is about 2 miles from the highway the uzi-men always drive black suburbans, nobody goes in out except parents with id and staff;   A very secretive place to this day
           </p>
           <p>
            Scientology is CIA, Ron Hubbard was a real CIA agent
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA has always run the child sex slavery world wide, ... why you ask? Child fucking is a $10 billion USD / year biz, just like illegal drugs the CIA loves black-book cash.

            I'm not sure if I'm serious about this post or trolling.  Maybe it's a superposition of everything.  I just thought I'd share and people can make of it what they will.
