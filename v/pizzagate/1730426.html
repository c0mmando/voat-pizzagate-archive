<p>I warned you guys. I told you this was a bad idea, and I got called all kinds of dirty names, including pedo, shill, and more. Today\'s protest made us all look like a joke.

People had misspelled signs talking about Satanic Ritual Abuse (yeah, normal sleeping people will believe that). Three people had &quot;I love my church&quot; shirts on.

<p>Neil Wolfe is completely unhinged, and is going to get propped up as  the &quot;new face of Pizzagate.&quot; Luckily no one got hurt at this event.

<p>Just imagine Neil shouting at people, and talking about cannibalized children in the basement of Comet Ping Pong with David Shurter giving speeches about being the anti-Christ and plugging his book - On CNN and FOX News. The protesters were not viewed as courageous people standing up for children, they were viewed as psychotic terrorists invading a neighborhood. If you want to help the situation, this absolutely is not the way to go about it.</p>
<p>Just to let you all know, I still stand by my initial analysis that these protests were a terrible idea. I think today\'s events prove my point.</p>',

            I will no longer be reading or responding to your childish attacks.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you really cared about this issue, you would be able to take your own ego out of this and look at things objectively. I think you might have other motivations, such as your religious beliefs, or possibly political beliefs. This is not about you, me, Jesus, or politics. Every move someone makes is scrutinized with a magnifying glass. There are people on the other side reading every single word being typed here. I am sure they love reporting back at how disorganized and divided this group is. I am sure they are chuckling at all of the counterproductive personal attacks that take place. I bet Podesta himself watched every second of the protest yesterday reveling in the response that was garnered from the general public. Mission accomplished, no one in the general mainstream public will ever take this seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope you find whatever you are looking for in life.

            Protesting is a good idea, but we have to do a better job of sticking to facts in a rational manner instead of charades like this. The media will make us out to be loons regardless, but if people on the ground see otherwise, we'll do much better at waking people up.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I still say we should be protesting at media HQs, not just in DC.

            I have given plenty of ideas on how to help. Some people might not be able to help more than influencing their circle of influence. I honestly don't care what anyone thinks. I am used to having unpopular ideas. Ever since I watched WTC7 go down, I have been speaking and seeking truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            If something is going to damage this cause and the people fighting it, I will speak out against it, every single time. We need to wake up the general public. We will not be able to do so if PG is in the news in a negative light AGAIN. We are not going to do it if people associate child trafficking with David Shurter and other unhinged self serving nuts harassing people and insulting people on the streets. I was a lot less angry about it when I first started discussing why this is a bad idea. You know what I got? A bunch of wanna be Christians calling me a pedo and a shill. So you know what, I don't care if people don't like my opinion. Most of the people ignoring facts and reality are nothing more than a danger to this movement, and will eventually be a huge stumbling block that we have to overcome.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hello, Mister FBI agent, I have some evidence relating to worldwide human trafficking... oh and this is my friend David Shurter the Anti-Christ, you might have seen him on the news discussing his most recent trip to Heaven with Johnny Depp. Can we go arrest Alafantas now? He called a girl a hoetard."

              Thanks man. We really need to focus on a core, easily digestible message that can easily be shared, articulated, and understood - even by the normies. I think the #pizzagate hashtag should be rethought. Honestly I think the entire topic needs to be thought out. We all know that PG isn't a theory. We also know it doesn't just revolve around a little pizza shop in DC. I bet if we focused more on the big picture, we could bring many more people under the umbrella. If we continue to be associated with comet and the comet shooter, no one will take this topic seriously. Oh, and we need to leave SRA out of it. It makes us look like Westboro Baptist. No religion, no politics. This is a humanitarian issue PERIOD.

               I completely agree! I am having such a hard time red pilling people.  When I talk to people about it they all say "oh is that the conspiracy theory thing that caused a shooting at that pizza place? And well I lose all interest after that.  They won't even come to voat to see what all has been discovered.  I have just started spamming people with YouTube videos.  The only person that believes me is my Dad lol. It's a shame...

            You have been hostile with my opinions for days now. Were you at this protest? Is that why you are taking this so personally? If you cannot see how bad this entire thing was, then you are too closed minded to help. Sometimes you need to live in the REAL WORLD. I want JUSTICE. What I don't want is a bunch of amateurs continuing to feed the propaganda machine. They have enough ammo as it is. Everyone there looked like a bunch of nuts. I tried to warn against it, and of course, everyone is too busy feeding their own egos to look at the bigger picture. The only disgrace is these farcical events. It really annoys me that you people won't look at reality. Quit living in this fantasy land and act like a damn responsible adult.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you want to fight corruption and evil, or do you want to LARP in the streets like a child? You aren't going to win the hearts and minds of the general public by harassing and intimidating them in their own damn neighborhood. Fist fights and insults don't solve anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next event is going to be an even bigger joke than this one. The mainstream media will be there to catch Neil screaming at people, and to hear Shurter high as a kite rambling about his trips to heaven and his upbringing as the anti-christ.
           </p>

            THAT DOESN'T SOUND CRAZY TO YOU?????????

            This pedo gate is huge, it's global. It takes time and dedication. We have to slowly awaken the public and appeal to white hat agents who have no idea about the compartamentalized institututions &amp; secret socities. Can't expose pedo gate without exposing the other. It's hard work awakening the sleeping masses.

             I have stated before collecting money is a bad idea.  Very bad.  I do not want to be connected to this idea.  I also do not think protesting in front on CPP is going to do any good.  WH is the place.  The whole idea is to get Trump's attention to move with the investigation. This will look like a Freak Show if this continues.  Do you remember the Bernie Marches?  Thousands Marched.  Did they stand around making crazy statements?  Yes, the MSM did not cover them either.  But people on the streets saw it.  That is the whole idea. To wake up the people.  The media knows what is going on, they will not cover it no matter what.  But waking up the people is our goal.  If we just March and Protest it will get attention if we never give up.  We are attracting the Nut Cases.  Bad.

             This event had roughly 4k raised. Wolfe is the main organizer for the next event. They are getting close to 10k.

              Nobody should be paid to do this stuff. Expenses, sure, but there is absolutely no reason why the amount of money raised should be more than the number of people attending - so unless there are thousands of people there it's pretty much embezzlement.

              I saw your video and I gave it a thumbs up. Totally agrees with your logic. The idea of protesting in DC, appealing to the very powers that run the whole thing is like you put it 'walking inside the lion's cage dressed up as a steak.' 
Now I do believe that protests can work wonders if they are organized and done the right way. This one looked way too rushed, unprepared.

               Watch the livestream that those independent journalists took at the event. They saw some people that were photographing the protest. Two women had telescopic lens DSLR cameras, and they looked almost identical. Also, there was a guy that the protesters were talking to, and it actually seemed like he was supportive or open to learning about PG. He ended up being with these two photographers. I don't know who these people were working for, but they were definitely putting faces to names for SOMEONE. Everyone that attended has been identified by the other side.

                It is far better to organize pizzagate awareness days localy, within ones sphere of influence. In your neighborhood, inviting neighbours, friends, local police (vetted of course) build a network. Let the snowball roll down the hill with its own momentum. Garher evidence, documents. Make huge, colourful posters that show the tree of corruption. Do it the right way. This is much bigger than the Podestas &amp; Clintons. Many of the pedophiles in 20 years they will die off natural causes, but this abomination will not stop!

             It does not cost 4 grand to buy some posterboard and markers from the dollar store, and I doubt this protest had a sign making station, let alone drinks and food to hand out to protesters. Doesn't seem like the organizers even stayed around long enough to need to stay hydrated... What a scam!

            I don't know. Why don't you call me a shill pedophile and chase me down the street? That's what all the tough guys do.
