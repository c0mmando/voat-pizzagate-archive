<p>The book I provided the link for below (IN NO WAY DO I HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH THIS AUTHOR OR TRYING TO PROMOTE) but it was written in 1992, 25 years ago, and it is literally pizzagate in a nutshell.

In America, they\'re are 4 to 5 &quot;brides&quot; of satan at all given times. At these ceremonies, it talks about how satan actually manifest himself in the flesh during important initiations and sacrifices etc.</p>
<p>Well, if you guys remember guccifer when he sent a letter from his jail/prison cell to fox news, he said specifically &quot;Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priest, a goddess of this occult, satanic shadow group&quot;</p>

<p>I have full faith in Trump bringing this down, but even if you\'re not religious: I hope you can see the stuff involved in pizzagate is not actions of a mere human. This is a SATANIC OCCULT, and by guccifer\'s own admissions, the guy who HACKED AND SEEN her emails, she is a high priest; a &quot;bride&quot;, of Satan.</p>
<p>This stuff is big guys.

            Hillary is definitely the High Priestess the Supreme Witch that's why the globalists are so angry she was denied the Presidency they believe is rightfully hers. She has always thought she was entitled to be President she wanted to be Queen and it was taken away from her. That's why I was so damn happy on Election Night. To see the evil bitch witch LOSE the job she wanted most was awesome.

            I guess she's playing on the dark domino of duality. 'm not surprised Clinton believes this and worships as she does.  I remember watching an interview a few months ago stating that she was convinced she'd win the election. She said it was already done.

            Both sides appear to believe in a  bride.  I've heard of the bride of Christ, but didn't know Satanic groups have a bride of Satan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some folks believe this  is a split-off projection, similar to what might be paralleled as  mpd.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever it is, she definitely believes it and wants to empower it in her life.

             The thing about satanism and the top tiers of the hierarchy is that satan uses and manipulates "his" people. Like magicians for example, he uses them until he cant use them anymore. He allows them to possess a certain amount of power to perform the stunts they do which are impossible to normal humans, and he takes them out when hes done using them by stripping their power away while they are still under the impression satan "has their back" still.

             IMHO, Hillary was told she would win the election, and she lost. Satan is almost finished with her, and he's looking for a new high priest to take her spot. Which makes sense when you see she A.) lost the election B.) shes going downhill and facing who knows what kind of legal charges and C.) her health is

                If you're implying that the woman on the left looks like the red Satan figure on that poster, I do kind of agree.  Comparing to anyone else on the poster, I am not sure I agree so much.

            The thing about Clinton is that she is too incompetent to run any type of organization, plus, the whole Satanic Occult thing would never have any type of monetary payout for you to involve herself in.  So, there is no direct benefit for her to be involved with this.

             Reminds me, I remember FBIanon saying that she was "too careless." But then Larry Nichols says she's the brains of the Clinton Crime Family (kind of doubt she has enough brains though, esp at this point in her life and health).

            We are sinners by nature and we are proud and do not wish to acknowledge that there is a God because we want to do our own thing(s) and not be bothered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore it is easier (or more comfortable) to come up w/ a thousand and one ways and reasons to dismiss the idea outright.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is ridiculous to say that Christ was a "good man" yet he was delusional in his claims of deity.

           <p>
            Okay I am a 46 year old man who has never been particularly religious.  My father is a true believer.  We never went to church much as a kid.  I am talking about you could count the times on my hands.  In 2006 I had a moment where I believed and started to go to a church that was next door.  Went about five-seven times and stopped after I couldnt get my wife to go.  She is an opposed entirely.
           </p>
           <p>
            After this Pizzagate stuff broke I started to get confused and more interested if only because the Satanist seem to believe and seem to hate the sheer mention of Jesus Christ.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have done some research online and in books and have found about the theory that the Old Testament was originally four distinct books that were put together as one in a kind of blending process around the time of the Babylonian Exile.   I have printed out and read the parts and how they flow when broken up into four stories.  It does seem to have some merit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay as a part of my Pizzagate research I came across a Documentary called Zeitgeist: The Movie
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbIu8Zeqp0">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbIu8Zeqp0
            </a>
            It starts with a process of describing the parallels with the Egytian God Horus and Christ.  It also broke down the Three Wise Men and the Resurrection story as being an Astrological Allegory.  It was fairly convincing.  They go so far as to dispute if Jesus ever existed but was kind of creation from Religious and Mythological ideas that were already thousands of years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            So this leaves me very confused.  I personally believe there was a man around the time that did go on a Religious mission.  Attempting to get people to believe his ideas and he got crosswise of the Jewish Leaders and the Roman Authorities.  I do believe he was crucified.  My personal belief is that he did not die on the cross but was brought down when they thought he was dead.  That he recovered enough to meet his followers again but after a month or so finally was brought down by the injuries he sustained during his ordeals and died.
           </p>
           <p>
            I kind of believe his followers expected him to be a military Messiah for the Jews and were confused and shocked he died.  That the more passionate of his followers had an epiphany and in a way of trying to understand why God took their Messiah early began to think of Jesus as a scapegoat for all of Humanities sins.  The same Jewish custom of driving a goat around and putting all their sins into it and killing it.  That Jesus was just a final and supreme scapegoat.  Then over time the other Religious stories already going around were worked into the miracle component of the Jesus story.  And this became the accepted idea of what Jesus was.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe Jesus was an inspired Human who really did come up with a much better way for humanity to treat each other.  It was truly a miracle jump in human thought.  I believe these Satanist hate Jesus so much because his beliefs force their human sacrifice to be forced underground and out of sight.   His humanitarian nature is go kind and frankly good that it goes against their evil ideas.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the Rothschilds believe entirely that the Book of Revelations is true and are using it as a blue print of what world they want to create to bring about the antichrist and the return of God which for them is Lucifer.  They are setting up the world for a war to match with the Endtimes Stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I kind of believe that even if you dont believe Jesus was the Son of God and did all the Miracles in the Bible.  The point is the Satanist do believe most of it and they are the driving force leading Humanity at this time.  So a greater understanding of the Bible and Jesus and the Occult is very very important for all of us to acquire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay this is my two cents.  I could be totally wrong.

             Yeshua/Jesus did actually incarnate on Earth as the son of God, however the "God" of the bible (Jahwe) is actually Satan. Read the gnostics.

            <p>
             Think about it - if Jesus were merely "some guy" who taught nice things, why do people attack Him?  They don't do it to Buddha, or Confucious, or Mahomet, or Plato, or Marcus Aurelius, etc. So why Christ?

             The book The Passover Plot espoused the fake crucifixion you speak of, that is one evil and spooky book. The Beatles were into it when Paul died (yes he really did die).

               What the book hypothesizes is evil. Straight from hell. I was going through a (Biblical) spiritual conversion when it dropped in my lap (metaphorically speaking) and I wrestled hard against spiritual wickedness in high places. I destroyed the book and I hate even the mention of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               The whole point of Christianity is that a real physical human sacrifice (which had to be none other than God in the flesh) was necessary to atone for man's sins. "Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin." This is why the heathen are so obsessed w/ human sacrifice, the point being to make a mockery of the one-time true sacrifice (or in their own minds, to provide their own sacrifices, over and over, in hopes that the multiplicity of them will appease the one true God).
              </p>
              <p>
               The Passover Plot denies the reality of this, and the book logically speaking doesn't even make sense. It's ridiculous. A dead and non-resurrected Christ would not, could not, have sparked one of the greatest movements in the history of man. Christ's followers turned from cowering men to fearless leaders overnight. It was seeing the risen Christ that emboldened them. They risked their lives over it. (Thomas, of "doubting Thomas" fame, was so skeptical that he insisted that he be allowed to personally put his hands into the nail and sword prints of the risen Jesus Christ, which was granted to him. Whether he actually did it or not is not stated.)

               The Roman church does this also in that they sacrifice (in their own minds) Christ over and over again in the mass ... their teaching of "transubstantiation," is that when the participant partakes of the wafer, the body and blood of Christ become real, which is blasphemy and outright cannibalism. They are a false (and worse) monolithic religion and global force/farce. Their followers kneel and worship the "holy father" who is just a man. "Call no man on earth father." The apostles were repulsed when men bowed to worship them and gave a strong rebuke.
              </p>
              <p>
               A conversion experience is the only thing that will open one's eyes to accept and see this. The Reformation era has the truth, and some authors of today that espouse their teachings, there is very little real Christianity nowadays.

                 So-called "reformed" churches are the only ones w/ the real truth, though they have become corrupt and sold out also (there is a "famine in the land" at present). Most of the decent ones are Dutch, and there is the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland which is (most of them) sound. These all follow the puritan reformed pure teachings of the Reformation era.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Free Presbyterian Church (they have branches in various parts of the world, not many) is where Trump's mom's family is from, Scotland ... this is what made me begin to keep an eye on Trump, and what interests me about his new-found interest in religion (Christianity), albeit at the moment he is surrounded by phonies, but God can work through phonies. I have a clip if you want to see it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You might be put off at first by their strictness (the aforementioned denominations) which some mistakenly label legalism (though legalism does exist and is just as erroneous as false liberty).
                </p>
                <p>
                 But one can obtain salvation (conversion, regeneration) outside of the church, by prayerfully seeking, from the scriptures, an internal working of God in and through Christ, which subsequent "subjective" conversion will 'agree' wholeheartedly with the "objective" word of God. It comes down to blood, the blood of the God/man Christ Jesus shed to placate an angry God for our offensive sins.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yes I know this is a hated and maligned thing, an "angry" God.

            I've never been religious, always strongly spiritual regardless of any questioning I have done.  But in researching pizzagate and realizing the pervasiveness and depth that evil reaches in this world and even affecting us all through political action.... my faith in a more traditional sense is now stronger than ever.

            Ha! So crazy you bring this up. I have thought about linking it MANY times. Read it back in the late 90's, was freaked out, then told later that it was made up. That the women involved admitted it wasn't true. So I had kind of just accepted that. Then as all this unfolded I have thought back to that book many, many times. Especially bc it was west coast based, correct? Elaine was the woman's name who was the disfigured satanist priestess. She loved her position of power bc in the real world she was a nobody and even unattractive bc of disfigurement from cleft pallet I believe? Anyways, it lines up w scenarios played out by survivors who have tried speaking out. Paul Bonnaci comes to mind.

Satanic...
Occult...
Your misusage of the word occult,  and misunderstanding/ignorance of the difference between occult and cult is amusing.

            Pardon my interruption, I'm keeping up with what you guys are doing over here and reading through this discussion reminded me of this radio broadcast from Paul Harvey in 1965. Some of you have probably already heard it but seeing that there are many here that are open to the possibility of satan and given the state of affairs in the US maybe it will be another check on your belief system.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's worth a listen if you haven't heard it. Pretty spot on predictions of exactly what has happened in the US in the last 30 years or more.

            I appreciate your research and think it's not insignificant, but I don't think that because Satan is worshiped, he's real. One does not follow the other. Furthermore, just because God is worshiped does not make him any more likely to be real. There have been countless pantheons of gods worshiped throughout time. Also, this author appears a nutjob on a religious mission. Satanism might be a genuine aspect to this, but I feel like it's likely just a front for Rh negative blood, genetic material and organ harvesting. They might use satanism in mk ultra, i could see that and there are some odd ties between the manson family and some of the bands of the 60s and 70s to the MIC.

            The opposite of good is not mistakes were made. That might be on the continuum, but it's not on the far end. There is a spiritual component to life, I have personally experienced it without seeking it out, and these people have methods of manipulating that spirituality for their own deranged purposes.

            One of Bill Clinton's former hitch men Larry Nichols said, when Clinton was Governor of Arkansas, that Hillary would go once a month on a weekend to some Witch church in California.

            OP, please understand that Hillary being a satanist high priest doesn't prove satan or god are real. It just shows she and her circle take part in a satanist religion. In my understanding, satanism is used as a mental framework. Taking part in the rituals and other satanist activities has the effect of preparing someone's mind to accept the horrible stuff these people are involved with. In the end, it's politics, not religion.

            Oh come on the satanism has to be a cover/traumatizing/gaslighting instrument at the highest levels. No rational human being could believe that shit, just like no rational human being would believe a single letter from the bible.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's mostly not what people believe that matters here, but what they want you to believe they believe. It's mind control much like christianity itself.

             "No rational person would believe the bible," yet millions do. I think it's very possible they do believe it.
             <br/>
             I don't believe in gods or devils, but since I know many, many christians- most people I deal with- it's not hard to imagine some people truly believe in the flip side to that story.
             <br/>
             What I worry about is people making it into a religious thing, "those of us that believe in god will overpower the evil satan worshipers," because I don't have a belief in god that motivates me. I have a sickness for corruption and abuse. Don't need a god or conversion to want to stop it.

              That was kind of my point, but also that I find it hard to believe that the supposedly sophisticated and well educated (if twisted) people we're after believe in any of this.

             dont think of any usual portayal of "satan". start with a blank slate and try to picture a conciousness separate from human conciousness. its attributes are a) sentient; b) intelligent; c) non-corporeal; and most importantly d) parasitic. the "satanic" rituals work because we are in an associative universe. like calls to like, so the act of a ritual calls upon the 'power' of all the times the ritual has taken place before. it sounds weird, i used to shrug it off to. but we all have to stretch our minds a little bit to understand all this. the what-you-see-is-what-you-get idea of reality isn't enough to account for everything we now know anymore.

            The date of that Guccifer letter is interesting, September 23, 2016. When did the e-mails drop? Is it somewhere in all these e-mails that have now been made available going forward that Guccifer originally saw material that supports what he states in that letter to Fox, or is it other e-mails? Also, all the hits I'm finding in a search are copies of the second page of that letter, as shown on the Fox site, the number 2 circled in the upper right-hand corner means there's at least a first page, and at least a third page would have him signing his name.

            Along that train of thought...for anyone interested try reading: The Gurus,the Young Man, and Elder Paisios by Dionysis Farasiotis.  The back jacket starts by "This powerful memoir tells the story of a Greek youth who, out of a desire to know the truth empirically, began to experiment in yoga, hypnotism, and various occult techniques."  He ended up visiting and staying at monastery in Greece, and he also visited some Hindu yogis in India and through some terrifying experiences, discovered that not all was as equal as he assumed.

            I think it's important in these discussions to define "Satan." What do these cultists believe Satan actual is? Is it the literal Biblical version? I've heard that Satan could be a reptilian-like alien, an entity from a lower dimension trying to break into our dimension, or an ancient artificial intelligence that wants to destroy all biological life. So what's most likely the true nature of what is referred to as Satan?

             Lucifer/Satan(The Adversary) is a rebellious angel. He can't have and will never have his own kingdom. Well,  maybe for a few brief, fleeting moments, but we'll get to that. Resentful and jealous, he now hates YHWH and opposes all His goodness. He cannot attack YHWH directly, but he can attack that which YHWH loves. Satan hates you, because YHWH made you in His own image.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's been a long, wild battle. Satan and his angels for millennia have been manipulating human affairs. And now with this pedogate stuff, it appears working directly with some humans, promising them wild wealth, limitless fulfillment of pleasure and lusts, and intoxicating power. Working over the centuries and centuries to guide human civilization to one day create a global government, with all humans under one single authority. His authority. I don't know how he'll do it, but The Adversary will establish himself as the ONE TRUE GOD of Earth and have all humans worship him.
            </p>
            <p>
             It gets a little complicated, but soon after the real God will say the charade is over and YHWH returns, in the flesh.

              Lucifer is not Satan. But Satan and YHWH are actually the same entity. Read the gnostic scriptures to see through this complicated stuff. The "God" of the Old Testament is none other than Satan, that's the whole point.

            There was a Podesta email in which Tamara Luzzatto cattily complimented JP on being a "gorgeous Sunday bride".   Yes a bride at one of their infamous "book group" meetings at a time when Podesta was in trouble with how the election was running.   You remember the "book group" of "The 25 Adopted Ones"  or "Mary Followers" and all that.  The email was weird.
           </p>
           <p>
            I commented about it on a thread someone else made, if anyone remembers her "Sunday bride" email please let me know.   I can't seem to find it at the moment.

            A lot of the reviews for that book are like this: "This book literally unleashes demons. Dr. Brown (who lost her license in the 80s) even states so in the Forward. I've read this book two times (12 years apart) and both times, I've had the same bad warfare experiences. It took me that long to figure out what happened. I am not the only person I know that this has happened to. I have to wonder if this book isn't a tool for evil disguised as a tool for good. Jesus says that his yoke is easy and His burden is light- all this book manifests are problems, evil manifestations and manipulated scriptures (such as not to fast and to respect demons). PLEASE DO NOT READ. Your life will become very difficult and scary without reason. Jesus wants us to be free, not going through warfare for no reason but to undo what curse a book has unleashed. If you own it, burn it."

               The real question is, why the predilection for Haitian orphans?  Because they understand Voodoo, so IMO when they are being involved in this torture/rape/ritual murder, they are probably FREAKING the f$&amp;% out!   Which it appears these sick fucks want!

                Some even have theories of the eartgquake origins itself - HAARP, DARPA - but that is what I call a conspiracy THEORY - circumstantial evidence without back up.

            lurch91,the link to the book you have mentioned "he came to see the captives free" written by Rebecca Yoder Brown MD for me is well known because I do have this book and have read it several times.I am a born again Christian and I do believe that yes we are dealing with dark spiritual forces not actually fleshly ones and yes as Christians we have to be prepared.I do believe Rebecca Yoder Brown.

            Fair post. Im not 100% sure Im a Christian, but since Pizzagate started I'm prolly above 90%
           </p>
           <p>
            the thing I cant reconcile is: When almost the entirety of the Christian Church is part of the satanic infrastructure, where do you go to participate? what source do you trust but your Gnostic intuition?

             Only trust God because he is our only hope to regret the evil. The Bible says even the church could be deceived and that Satan will dress like a wolf in sheeps clothing.  Participate  in your home with the Bible and God.

             MolochHunter, if you want to be a Christian you do not have to join a church you just have to believe in Jesus and his sacrifice. The Catholic Church is only a small part of the world of Christianity and yes it is led by a Satanic Pope, I'd recommend not focusing on that aspect of so-called Christianity and just look for true Christianity. Plenty of Catholics have no idea how evil the Pope is or the infrastructure they support for that matter.

             This is basically the path to Christianity I was taught as a 5 year old when I asked my mom how to get to Heaven. A simple prayer.

             Ya that's what i tripped out about when i had a violent jolt out of athiesm/mild occultism into Christianity. I recognized it as the truth but was irritated about it, lol. I joined the Catholic church and found truth through the sacraments, especially the Eucharist and confession, because God set it up to contain truth no matter how many corrupt members there were. It is not about institutions. That was my skepticism my whole life (why Hell? Why all these dumb rules like go to church on Sunday give tithes etc?). It is God as a lover doing everything in his power throughout all history to protect us from choosing evil and hell.
It requires a pretty intense paradigm shift.
Reading St Faustina's diary blew my mind enough that i was open to a perspective change. He uses all kinds of things.

             a good place to go. If you see all the big ones, Jesus, Buddha, Gandhi - they all went at it alone, later to create followers. Most people won't create any followers this lifetime, but going at it alone is key.

             Moloch guy, you have to go back to the protestant reformation for the truth, things have become quite corrupted since then, and much of professing Christianity has been co-opted by spiritual wickedness in high places. So it's kind of lonely right now for true believers.

             Just do not trust man. Any church that raises any man or "leader" above Jesus Christ is a red flag. Highly recommend reading The Case for Christ. Written by a man who was an investigative reporter for Chicago tribune as well as a lawyer and atheist.

             The temple is inside you.  Jesus spoke in esoteric metaphors that we have not fully grasped until now.  We never questioned God's voice (the church) until recently.

             I dropped from my strict Christian upbringing and dove deep, deep down into the darkness and the occult.  I was ravenous for any knowledge I could come across.  I only realize now I hungered for secret truths.
            </p>
            <p>
             While I found the thought of sacrifice repugnant, I do believe I sacrificed something more valuable than flesh during those times...my spirit.

             It has only been through deep meditation and understanding of the Gnostic Jesus and gospel that I have found myself again.  I still have so much to learn, but this investigation has peeled back the blinders to the duality of the situation.  That 'good' and 'evil' do exist, just on a different level of understanding that I never had before.

             If you look in the book of Revelations, in the beginning Chapters the Angel of the Lord has a problem with all Churches but one.  The Angel details what issues Gid has with each one including Satanism.  With that said, there are true blessed believers in each.  I think the trick is having a healthy skepticism about the organization, but valuing true believes.  The Bible clearly states the Christain faith is a process, so everyone is on a different point in their journey...but certainly we need to recognize they hypocrisy, corruption, and evil within church organizations when we find it.
             <br/>
             It was a hard pill for me to swallow finding out Billy Graham is part of this evil. Brings to mind the passage where Jesus, at the judgment seat tells those who claim to have done great things in His name, 'Depart from me, I never knew you, you workers of lawlessness'...

             Just because these people worship Satan doesn't make him real. Monks spend their whole lives devoted to what they believe as being a God and that also doesn't mean he's real. These kinds of people simply convince themselves these made up entities exist.
The same way many people completely believe the earth is flat or shape shifting lizards have taken over DC. (David Icke)  Or Erich von Däniken and how what he thinks is the absolute truth. How can he and Zahi Hawass, The Egyptian archaeologist who is convinced his theory is the right one. How can both be correct ?  Neither of them can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that their own theories are the right ones. People are easily convinced and because of that they actually follow through with the practices of worship or study which to them is real. The only thing that is real with this type of thinking is these practices they do that are quite real. The acts they do in the name of their beliefs are real even though its based on fiction. I find it hard to believe that a God that is all knowing, all loving, all forgiving would sentence his creation to ETERNAL BURNING if they don't do it his way.. Thats a pretty damn serious punishment to put on his people. Its not real. Those are words of man. Those are words of a Dictator. "My way or die"  Not a God. So keep your mind open but not so open your brain falls out.

             the bible is still something external. the big trick is coaxing people to always keep their attention focused outside of ourselves (we can all think of 5 ways they do this right off the bat). I would suggest to anyone an experiment. find the calmest place you can (this includes electromagnetic waves, no good), give yourself enough time where you don't have to worry about being late, etc. and just let your mind do it's thing. think about something or nothing if you want. do this a few times. see what happens.

             Good and evil exist side by side within every religion, institution and person.  Goodness is always a choice.  To me God gave us free will to make the choice and a heart to help us know right from wrong.

             You participate by discussing the issues with people who have some knowledge of the facts. You can trust a methodology which seeks consistency from the natural means of recognizing truth: reason, felicity, and insight.

             Well, if Satan is real and Christ wasn't LARPing when he claimed to be God and warned people about the dangers of demons, where else would Satan focus his most intense efforts but on those attempting to follow his enemy? Jesus warned repeatedly of this very thing; it's no surprise so many Christians fall. But where is there evidence "almost the entirety of the Christian Church is part of the satanic infrastructure?"

             Do not be tempted by the promise of special hidden knowledge available to a few elite insiders (
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_heresies#Gnosticism">
              Gnosticism
             </a>
             ). That shit is eerily similar to the
             <em>
              modus operendi
             </em>
             of the power-mad Pedocracy we're stalking. (It also has been recognized by Christians as a heresy since the 2nd century).
            </p>
            <p>
             As for what source to trust? Have you ever taken a peek at C.S. Lewis'
             <em>
              Screwtape Letters
             </em>
             ? How about anything by G.K. Chesterton? The real Jedi, though, if you really want a logic workout, is Thomas Aquinas.

               I have noticed a change in publicly defined gnosticism.  It used to be using your senses and intellect to perceive creation (free of dogma) and now it seems full on luciferia.  Don't know if the original idea was coopted or is now truly revealed.  I am not one who thinks religion is the only way to find  God so don't consider the former definition evil in nature,

             I wouldn't say entirely....but there has been a concerted effort to infiltrate and corrupt major churches.  Any church promoting world unity under global religion and blurring the lines between religions are probably compromised.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a clear agenda a foot and the evidence is so out in the open and clear cut but way too numerous and voluminous to post in this one comment.  I just say to you, once you start digging regarding satanic and well more precise lucifarianism, it never seems to end.
            </p>
            <p>
             For me it started when I realized that the EU building in Brussels was modeled after the half built Tower of Babel.  For the life of me, I couldn't reconcile why a generally non-religious European Union would choose to model their building after a story from the bible.  That is until I reread about the Tower of Babel and considered its meaning.  That one clue got me looking into symbolism used through out the EU and then of course history of symbolism and then down the rabbit hole I went.
            </p>
            <p>
             So my point is, this is something you have to research yourself.  But believe me, the information is easy to find.  This involves a global agenda of power and control and everyone should be trying to research what it is these people actually believe and what these people are trying to achieve.  It matters not what you personally believe, but you should understand what the elite believe.

              well, exactly - I don't doubt for a minute now that THEY believe in Satan, Lucifer, Baal, Moloch or something so close its semantics to distinguish it.
             </p>
             <p>
              But its not a fait-accompli that I therefore conclude Satan to be real, ergo God. I just do to err on the side of existential caution.

             none, necessarily, but the problem is that moral-gnostics, such as what I feel "conspiracy theorists" are as a FAR better fucking label, are not organized in any formidable structure as of yet, and we desperately need to find a way to continue decentralized but more organized...

             The Word of God is the only place to go. The King James bible, as old of an edition as you can find. Read it front to back, pray for understanding, and then you'll be equipped to evaluate the degree of corruption of churches you visit. Jesus didn't come so we could continue to have other men between us and God, He came so we could have a direct relationship with God.

              The Christian Church came before the New Testament, the NT Bible was agreed upon by Christians for use within the Church (Orthodox) in an effort to counter all the early heresies of people who sought to incorporate Christianity into their own way of thinking.  The early Bishops took the letters that had circulated for years, and through a long process, distilled the core into a 'Canon' that was agreed on by the early Church.  That doesn't mean that everything about Christianity is only in the Bible. Having people relying solely on their understanding of what they've read (too often out of context), is how modern day Christians have over 40,000 denominations which continue to splinter as we speak.  There's a whole Church history before the 1500s that isn't Catholic and a whole history before 1054, when the political tensions with Bishop of Rome resulted in them breaking off on their own.

              couple of days ago I had a thought - I'd long known that the scriptures were only compiled and selected for the Bible in the 4th Century, with many of them written in the years after Jesus death
             </p>
             <p>
              What was going on in the Roman Empire in the years after Jesus's death?  Caligula. How much of the Bible was written as a social bulwark against the re-emergence of Caligula

              I look around at the temper of the times and everyone's freaking out about who the next Hitler is gonna be.   But I've felt since November 2016 that if this Paedostocracy prevail over Trump then we will be surely counting the days before the emergence of the next Caligula

              "direct relationship with God" - that's Gnosticism. I believe in the goodness of Jesus, and the God he spoke of.
But the God of the Old Testament? Petulant, arbitrary, unforgiving. You cannot cite the Old Testament God as an example of unconditional love.

               Yes. But, the Bible gives clear indication of what God's intention is for how we are to interpret the Old Testament. It is dead. At the moment of Christ's death, the curtain between the holy and most holy sections of the Temple was ripped from the top down. It's a new covenant, where the God of the most holy is come out of that ritualistic seclusion and yes, connect directly with you.

               Have faith and try to be like him, not just in words, but in actions. Open up your heart and be  generous. Forgive those who have wronged you, and ask for forgiveness when you have wronged others. Repent, but also use the brain God has given you to better yourself and your life. Educate yourself and be humble. Most importantly, don't be afraid of anything, because HE is with you. And He knows your heart.

               The Old Testament was revolutionary for its time.  Consider this:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                The Hebrew law was a huge burden on the people that wrote it
               </li>
               <li>
                it was radically revolutionary in its human (and animal) rights comparably, while the rest of the world was feeding babies to the fire and enslaving their neighbors.  It was a ruthless barbaric world.
               </li>
               <li>
                the next phase shift in radical reformation of the human condition came with Jesus - and make no mistake he claimed to be Emmanuel, God incarnate
               </li>
               <li>
                the Israelites lived in a dangerous time and went through many genocides through history but here we are, Israel exists as prophecied and the Jews exist as a people despite all odds.
               </li>

               You are correct there... Believe in the teachings of Jesus. Forget the Old Testament. You don't need to be born again or saved from your sins... all of that is invented. There is good and evil and that's all we need to know. Jesus was real, taught unconditional love and forgiveness, and that we are all ONE with GOD... Not that he was a God to be worshipped... your instincts are correct.

                Actually to make it into Heaven, you do need to be born again. I was born again after a near death experience in 2012.. pleaded with God to spare my life (did not want to go to hospital and possibly get in trouble so I just depended on Him to save me) and if I lived, I'd be a warrior for the Good side. I've seen so many miraculous things.. both good and evil things that have totally transformed my perception of this world since then.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also during said heart attack, whenever I'd get near a TV or computer screen.. it would go haywire and fizzle about with static. That was the CRAZIEST part of the whole thing.
               </p>
               <p>
                But not as crazy as the things that happened after.. mainly being pursued by the dark side on foot during an episode in Austin TX. Phew that's a whole other post..

                 Are you telling me that if someone makes a massive contribution to #Pizzagate and bringing down the Satanists, but for whatever reason of their upbringing did not become born again - even if they believed in Jesus - that they would not be granted the kingdom of Heaven?

              its interesting. Orthodox priests have always been allowed to marry. So they have an allowed path of sexual release/relief - I've oft wondered how much of a function that plays in their comparatively lesser participation in paedophilia

               Yes, Orthodox Priests can marry before becoming Priests, they can marry once.  Bishops are not married.  An interesting point is that the Roman Catholic Church is historically less forgiving of members who divorce.  There are many differences between the two actually.  At any rate, regarding the pedophilia topic, the Alfred Kinsey documentary I watched mentioned how the influence of his bogus human sexuality research (which tried to normalize pedophilia and claimed incest and sexualizing babies was a good thing), extended into American culture to the point that even Catholic seminary applicants/candidates were required to take classes from the Kinsey Institute, and the men who were more 'open' to homosexuality or pedophilia were brought in over more traditionally minded candidates who were weeded out.  That, combined with the no marriage rule...we can now see the result decades later.

             And I'm not trying to force it down your throat, or anyone's for that matter. Im just saying if you believe in good, you believe in bad. And if there is a Satan (bad), there by logic has to be a Good (God).

             You should check that book out, anon. If pizzagate wasn't so undeniably true, the stuff in that book would sound COMPLETELY fake. But knowing pizzagate IS real, and the depth it goes to, it makes the impossible sound realistic; which unfortunately is very real. Let me know if you check it out!

            Yes, Even Bill Clinton alluded to it in a speech... She is and she is evil and i would not doubt the conspiracy theories that she suffers from Kuru.. just because she had some very strange and dark episodes during the campaign. The seizure she had in front of reporters was quite creepy and if you look at the video very slowed down there is a point where her eyes go complexly black... I know i sound weird but I watched it several times and it looks like they do go completely demonic black. I am so glad she is not our president. Going to get the book! thanks.

            Thank you for letting the public know of this.I do believe this a 100 %.In fact ,Cathy OBrian,a former mind control victim,came forward in her book "Trance-formation of America" with exactly the same description of Hillary Rodham Clinton. She describes her as a "mind control "handler and a witch.
