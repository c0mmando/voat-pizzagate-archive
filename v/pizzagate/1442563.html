<p>British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell has been described by Virginia Roberts and others as Jeffrey Epstein\'s #1 accomplice in the grooming and procurement of underage sex slaves in the late 90s-early 2000s. Her role in the Epstein scandal was exposed as far back as 2007. 
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1363444/Jeffrey-Epstein-Robert-Maxwells-daughter-Ghislaine-hired-girls-paedophile.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1363444/Jeffrey-Epstein-Robert-Maxwells-daughter-Ghislaine-hired-girls-paedophile.html</a></p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell has ties to Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family (accused of raping Virginia Roberts). More importantly, her father was British MP and billionaire media mogul Robert Maxwell, who was exposed as an embezzler after his suspicious death in 1991. Maxwell was also widely believed to have been a Mossad asset/operative for many decades. </p>
<p>Robert Maxwell famously owned a massive yacht that was named the &quot;Lady Ghislaine&quot;, the same name he gave his daughter. He fell off that yacht and drowned in 1991. </p>
<p>Why is it, then, that the Clinton Foundation chose to sponsor the Terra Mar Project (TM), which was founded/still currently led by Ghislaine Maxwell? And what exactly is TM? </p>
<p>A quick look at the Terra Mar Project reveals that its primary focus is on &quot;preserving the commons&quot; of international waters. </p>
<p>FYI, international waters are not inherently subject to national laws (this could apply to gambling, prostitution, drug trafficking, even murder, etc.)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters</a></p>
<p>Let\'s say you were fixing to commit murder on the high seas. According to International Maritime Law, you can only be prosecuted for murder by the government that the ship is registered with. </p>
<p>However, many ships (especially those transporting illegal commerce) opt for a loophole called &quot;Flag of Convenience&quot; - that is, the ship\'s owners register their ship in a third country that isn\'t their own. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience</a></p>
<p>Often the countries that offer easy &quot;Flag of Convenience&quot; registration are poor and corrupt, with woefully inadequate legal systems. The West African nations of Liberia and Guinea-Bissau are notorious for allowing just about anyone with $$$ to register their ship under Flag of Convenience rules in their country. Both of those countries (especially Liberia) are political and economic satellites of the United States. </p>
<p>Point being, if Ghislaine Maxwell wanted to register a yacht in a place like Liberia, then sail out to international waters and revive Epstein\'s Pedo Island parties on the high seas...well, it\'d be incredibly easy to do, and incredibly hard to prosecute, EVEN IF THEY WERE CAUGHT RED-HANDED.</p>
<p>Check out this TED Talk Ghislaine Maxwell gave about TM in 2013:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClySKaQmjig">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClySKaQmjig</a></p>
<p>This is a potentially yuge thread in the dark web of PizzaGate. We KNOW that Ghislaine Maxwell has been a procurer of underage sex slaves, for convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. </p>
<p>Why in the hell would the Clinton Foundation choose to partner with Ghislaine Maxwell\'s pet project NGO, especially in the years leading up to Hillary Clinton\'s second run for President (2011-2013)? </p>
<p>Why the hell did nobody bat an eye when Ghislaine Maxwell was selected to give a TED Talk about ocean sustainability in 2013? </p>
<p>All of this stinks.</p>',

            i defend lawless international waters. consider how social contract works. there should always be available some space where people can choose to opt out of society and law. there SHOULD be international lawless land as well, but good luck getting that to happen.

            ugh. i cant upvoat (haha- i accidentally typed that and then figured out it works, in this case. anyways...) I guess I don't comment enough. But thanks for posting this. I only have like 13 upvotes and I thought it was a VERY direct, easy to understand link. Appreciate you looking more into this &lt;3
