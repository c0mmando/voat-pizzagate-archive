            Of course (((Stephan MoneyJEW))) will never mention the fact that his (((tribe)) are the ones who pretty much control all of the maintream porn industry in LA and Florida.
           </p>
           <p>
            As with all of the disinfo agents (Alex Jones, Sweigert, Seaman, etc etc) they love to talk about the problems, but they never mention WHO is truly behind pedophilia rings, children trafficking, etc

            <p>
             EVERYBODY who is anybody in media is a JEW.  That's the first lesson idiots here need to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second is that Jews stick together and defend each other, even across continents, for the most heinous of crimes.  I have yet to read an account of Jewish Ritual Murder where the perps didn't have nonparticipating Jewish townsfolk serving as accessories (hiding the bodies, disposing of the bodies, destroying murder weapon[s], lying to cover them, etc.).

              The "Jews" (they are not really Israelites) are at the tippy top of the pyramid, with people like Soros and the Rothschild Family/Dynasty. They are the pedo-satanists who run the globe, the "men behind the curtain." They are into pedophilia because they believe that they are allowed to do these things to non-jew (goyim) children, as it says so in the Talmud. And the Satanism comes into play with the Freemasonry and Kaballah that is mixed into their belief system. But the point is that the "fake Jews" at the top of the power structure see themselves as the rulers of the Earth, and all others as their slaves.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, these "fake Jews" have to have the world leaders under their thumb. So they get leaders into compromising positions, either with drugs, partying, hookers, or, their favorite commodity, little kids. Like Jeffrey Epstein, he will get powerful people onto his "Orgy Island," and when they engage in sex with one of his slave girls, he films them (every article about Epstein says he had cameras EVERYWHERE in his mansion in Florida) in order to blackmail them later. So the "Jews" hold all the cards, and they use the goyim as a shield to keep anyone from discovering their activities. And if any of the goy slaves act up, the "Jews" can simply out THEM as a pedophile, and they'd have all the evidence they needed to do it, or they can simply have them suicided.
             </p>
             <p>
              tl;dr Not only Jews rape kids, but Jews are the people giving the orders at the top of the chain. Period.

            Oh, my this sounds very difficult to overcome.  The only way to get off of this is to get help, but as usual, just like any addictive behavior, people do not seek this on their own.  I think the Gov. is certainly not going to create any places for help, since they closed all the mental health places and there are not even many for those with drinking problems.  I wonder if there are such places for Porn Addictions.  This sounds like a Horrible Rat Race.

             WTF are you talking about?  The "addiction recovery" industry is BOOMING, with a "facility" on practically every corner, thanks in large part to our TAX dollars.  That is with a 7% success rate for in-house treatment centers.  Not to mention addicts are on DISABILITY, another TOTAL FAIL.
            </p>
            <p>
             It sounds like you want MILLIONS to draw a taxpayer-provided disability check for their "porn addiction."  YOU can pay for it.  WE have had enough already!

             I think they would prefer that people not be able to get help, so they become weaker and weaker, unable to fight back against the Deep State as they legalize beastiality and pedophilia.

              Yes, my exact feelings as well.  With all the things we know they are already doing, or even suspect, this we know.  That they would be happy to corrupt the male human race and abuse the rest of us.

            This will be another way they will destroy our men and lower the population count.  Men need to talk to their sons and have a man to man talk and get them help if they think they are caught up in this merry-go-round of porn and this sex high they are achieving.  This is all so very sad.  Men talk to your sons.

             The more extreme, novel, and unrealistic porn is, the more addicting it is. Surely, some of today's porn addicts would be active sexual deviants (look into why women in their 30s are having bladder/sphincter control issues) but most are just addicted to the latest and greatest, and without it, in act or in media, they often can't enjoy themselves or even relieve their...Tension.

             OK, this is a really touchy subject.  Why is there all of a sudden a huge increase in porn viewing?  Almost always men.  Some women, but I may be wrong, I think they follow along to please their men or they think they need to join in to be cool.  They also watch when they are in the industry, sucked in because they have been forced or need the money to feed a child or themselves.  Here comes the hard part.  Are these men having a difficult time having sex with their partner (if you know what I mean) and are afraid to bring this up so they are watching porrn?  Is something happening or being done to create this problem? There seems to be a very large number of men doing this, it is like an explosion.  Also, there would be a monetary reason for this problem to be created.  Right? Videos Videos and more Videos of Porn.  Money Money and More Money.

              Women are very much into porn. It is women's porn that elucidates how porn works. Stay tuned for what you are not expecting in a few paragraphs. This is one of my favorite topics and I have been scrutinizing this for decades.
             </p>
             <p>
              Porn activates the pleasure sensors in the brain. It is a push button brain candy that predates the digital age. As you watch more porn and coordinate pleasure seeking and porn (masturbation) it dulls certain aspects of life that would normally lead to pleasure (sex with your partner or masturbation based on imagination). Porn is the product that creates a pemanent customer. It offers a substitute to sex that is usually much more readily available and also requires zero effort. From a sex education standpoint (in consulting) I was able to talk about this with men between 20-80 and it's very interesting. Most men are completely oblivious to how porn plays their fiddle. However, once the trick is revealed, it makes porn inefficient. It's not necessarily a great red pill to swallow if it removes from your choices something you enjoy. It's fine to watch porn as long as you know it provides no nutrition and will contribute to someone being lonely for the rest of their life (I said lonely, not alone).
             </p>
             <p>
              So, recently I have discovered women porn and it's a godsend. What is women porn? Pinterest or any site that has infinite scroll. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, unboxing videos, etc. are methods to excite the "Surprise me! What's next?" part of the brain that is often excited by porn. This non-sexual form of brain candy is incredibly similar but it doesn't carry with it the shame that gets lopped onto anything sexual.
             </p>
             <p>
              What makes me the saddest about young men today is that they discover sex as a product rather than as an activity. Sex has been intermediated by people who perform non-pleasurable activities that are unsafe for women. The style of porn depicts men having sex AT women rather than WITH women. It helps explain the immense amount of dissatisfaction women have with male partners. Also, statistically, the amount of life satisfaction men exhibit is inverse to the amount of porn they consume. Of course I could only come up with this stats from talking to 40-50 men about this topic specifically so it is not a universal fact.

               Wow.  Thank you for your very candid report.  So possibly spilling the beans to the men about the effect that porn has could be a possible cure.  They for sure are in their wonderful world not suspecting what is going on, just like being in the middle of any addiction.  I also think a sad think is that fathers are not talking to their sons about this.  Of course a lot of them are porn watchers themselves.  But those that have young sons need this to be part of that Man to Boy Sex Talk.  If they are not doing this, they are doing a great disservice to their sons.

                The questions about sex I get from people in their 20s are absolutely astounding and show that sex education is absent from most people's childhood. However, those who have co-opted sex to sell young men everything (I call them douchebag overlords of the seduction industrial complex) make young men think they know everything about sex because they have spent a decade consuming porn. The only thing men know about sex that they didn't know in the 1950's is that women definitely do not have teeth down there.

                 We must make sure that we talk to our men those that have tween sons.  They must take responsibility for their sexual knowledge, and I mean true words, not stuff Grampa told you.  Although, that may be even better than what they learn from porn.  There has been a large lapse in this regard.  Also, a few words from Mom and the female side is a good thing too.  They need to know how a female feels about certain things.  They have been made to believe all kinds of false ideas by listening to their idols, ads, and movies.  They need their Dads Straight Talk.

              I believe porn is an addiction for a lot of men, and wherever addiction and capitalism meet there's investment.  Aside from monetary reasons, what we now recognize is the purposeful degradation of human intimacy, sex as a commodity, people as just objects for sex, normalizing the path towards pedophilia and bestiality as "just sex" or "It's true love", whatever it takes to destroy the human spirit (this is useful for Globalists, to break bonds of family and dehumanize people, confuse their allegiances, their priorities, their identities, even now, their use of pronouns!)
             </p>
             <p>
              In the Kinsey related video (I'd have to find it), the former photographer for Penthouse Magazine describes the addiction of porn and how it leads to pedophilia for a lot of men.  The cartoonist who created the "Chester The Molester" cartoons, (for Playboy Magazine I think), was himself sexually abusing his young  daughter, which inspired many of his cartoons.  Other cartoons depict and make fun of Sex/murder combos, women and kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's a pathology behind the porn industry as the dark side, human trafficking is always accessible somewhere in the background.  While porn doesn't cause most people to become Ted Bundys....Ted Bundy himself clearly stated (just before getting executed) that without a doubt, without exception, every rapist and sexual murderer he had known in prison was deeply involved in and deeply addicted to porn.  The rise in child abductions in recent history (milk carton kids) coincided with the mainstreaming of pornography.  The list goes on.

               You Are A Red Pilling Expert.  I highly agree with everything you have written, but sadly admit this is going to be the Fall of America (just like Rome).  The cartoon was probably the way they were introducing more porn without men thinking it was disgusting.  It is sick thinking that some were living vicariously through those drawings.  I think that is the very plan they are using on us.  The Fall of Rome.

               I've heard that Bundy interview. Chilling. The way he glares at the interviewer, like he'd kill him if he could, is so creepy. I get the same creepy vibe when I see James Alefantis or John Podesta speaking. They're all just creepy pieces of shit.
