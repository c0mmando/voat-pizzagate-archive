            Yup, Oprah responded debunking the story.  Thus making the case that people who don't drink the Kool Aid are conspiracy nuts.  Y'all forget that a large part of Bill Gates Event 201 was about 'fake news' and conspiracy theories to do with coronavirus stories?  What do you think that was all about ??
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest you make a list of the 'Truthers' who were pushing the Oprah was arrested BS story.  They are traitors to the truth movement.

             MB2, did you look at a lot of the tweets? I watched this unfold yesterday, and replied to a number of people that it was fake news. But what was amazing was the hundreds and hundreds of black people tweeting about Oprah -- they were talking about her school, John of God, Weinstein and spreading a bunch of hilarious gifs roasting her about kids in her basement.  I had no clue there were even that many black people on Twitter. The overall impression I had was of a lot of folks who were pretty damn aware that pizzagate is real. These folks are not going to riot in protest if Oprah or Holder get indicted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Event 201 -- and many of those spreading it right now -- are doing so to discourage and demoralize those who know the truth. To make us believe what you just stated, that a debunked rumor about arrests will effectively discredit and neuter "conspiracy nuts." And most importantly, in combination with the social isolation and the stress of perceived physical threat we're experiencing now, to break us. They want us quaking in terror, lashing out at each other, and slipping into apathy. They absolutely DO NOT want us getting excited and sharing our research like

             has been doing while they've got "conspiracy" hashtags trending.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Pizzagate" is the turd they can't get off of their shoe, no matter how much they bleat about it being nothing but shit. It has wormed it's way into the public consciousness. We can turn their trending hashtags into our platform. But only if we thicken our skin, laugh at their efforts to terrorize us and
             <em>
              press on
             </em>

                Seems there are many many morons who think pizzagate has been 'debunked'. We already lost that momentum a while back.  I'm thinking that opening up the internet again just serves to keep people 'busy'. I still don't see any meaningful movement.. just a high-tech system working feverishly to clamp down on everyone.  In a few days the Q movement will find out whether they've been played or not.

             I know the arrests part was fake news, I wonder how the masses all started trending this and who started it unless it was done intentionally by Twitter and picked up by people. MSM now is reporting on it.

              Gamepwn, I would bet $1000 that Twitter set this hashtag trending themselves so the media could then report on the evils of "fake news". Did you see the video posted the day before with the 24 hours-only availability? The one posted by the gun guy?
