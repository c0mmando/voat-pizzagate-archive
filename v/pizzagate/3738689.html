Spence leaned over one of the video monitors, and, after tapping a few of its buttons, he replayed the concluding minutes of our conversation. At that moment, I felt shrink-wrapped by cellophane, and I found it difficult to breath. As I silently stared at the monitor, Spence casually smiled and explained to me that his entire home was bugged for clandestine surveillance, and “CIA operatives” had installed the concealed video cameras throughout his house.</strong> He couldn’t help himself from crowing that his surveillance equipment was state-of-the-art, and the camera that captured our conversations was embedded in the living room’s thermostat. <strong>Spence then divulged that he blackmailed the rich and powerful.</strong> I remained stunned and speechless as I watched myself discussing my life and escort service on the video monitor, but, after a few minutes, I started to swell with anger. However, I didn’t express my anger to Spence, because, at that moment, I was undeniably frightened of him, and I’m also not a confrontational person. Once Spence had flaunted his blackmail equipment, he dispensed a grave threat about the “consequences” if I uttered nary a word relating to his concealed cameras. He then dismissed me. I walked out of his house in a state of shock. My mouth was parched, and an adrenal chill coursed through my body. A montage of the video footage of me discussing my life relentlessly overwhelmed my thoughts as I drove home that night. I was utterly dumbfounded by King’s disclosures too. I have to confess that I was in a state of denial about King’s revelations, because they were so bizarre. I found it hard to believe that people could be such unequivocal monsters. But Spence had videotaped me discussing the particulars of my life and my escort service, so I was now susceptible to blackmail. I no longer viewed Spence as a mere client—I felt he controlled me. Indeed, he started to tell the escorts I sent to his home that I worked for him. The escort service had started out as a carefree venture that was enjoyable and exciting, but Spence had imbued it with a sinister gravitas.&quot;</p>
<p>-from Vinson, Henry W.. Confessions of a D.C. Madam: The Politics of Sex, Lies, and Blackmail . Trine Day. </p>
<p>When Vinson refused Spence\'s and King\'s demands to become involved in pimping children, Vinson claims that Spence sent men who were CIA operatives over to his house, where they broke windows, busted up his house, and intimidated Vinson further. Vinson claims that when this intimidation didn\'t work, Spence invited him to his Kalorama mansion to talk. Vinson claims that present at Spence\'s mansion on this occasion, <strong>was a member of George H.W. Bush\'s cabinet. Vinson further claims that this Bush Sr. cabinet member verbally intimidated him, telling him, &quot;I can withstand a background check. Can you?&quot;</strong> Soon after this in 1990, Henry Vinson\'s prostitution ring got raided, and he was indicted by a grand jury on 43 charges, including pimping, racketeering and credit card fraud, all related to his prostitution ring.</p>
<p><strong>In the next part of this series, we see how Greta Van Susteren herself becoming part of this horrific story unfortunately. Van Susteren was Henry Vinson\'s personal attorney. I believe a very good argument can be made that Van Susteren played a very significant <em>legal</em> role covering up the names of the powerful people connected to Craig Spence\'s prostitution and trafficking network.</strong></p>',
