<p>WARNING: Voat Doxx Alert; CDAN\'s The Web Part III Instagram Terror Provokes Retaliation From The Coven</p>
<p>Be careful folks, looks like <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/">Crazy Days and Nights</a> has stirred up some controversy in some pretty influential and out of the way places that specialize in the Hollywood rumor mill. Evidently, one of the longest running and juiciest Hollywood gossip  sites around (and quite often correct) <a href="https://www.lipstickalley.com/">Lipstick Alley</a>, has encountered some pushback from a member posting a thread about Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington from CDAN\'s blind, massive pushback, <strong>and a doxxing FROM THE WIDOW IN QUESTION</strong> - things are getting heated up ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>SATURDAY, DECEMBER 23, 2017</p>
<p>Blind Item #2 - Widow Doxxing</p>
<p><em>&quot;Apparently if you are the wife of a singer or musician and you speak out against the widow, then you get doxxed by someone associated with the widow. It gets worse. The unknown person has been posting photos of the children of those speaking out. I\'m guessing it is an older family member related to the widow.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Vicky Cornell. She had a lady and her children doxxed on instagram this week. A member of Lipstick Alley. She also had the Chris Cornell LSA Threads Tumblr shut down and HonorChris.com shut down without real warrant. She was a busy bee this week. Thank you Enty for continuing to shed light on this evil woman. May god always bless you. XO</p>

<p>I hear Vicky is trying really hard to go after Lipstick Alley. They brushed her off with laughter. They got big lawyers. Bigger then hers. They are 13 threads into it about the topic of Chris and Vicky. They aren\'t going anywhere. Neither is Enty.</p>

<p>And to the font who just posted this on LSA &quot;One of VK/TKs stupid minions....or them?? RE-doxxed in the comments of today\'s blind. It did NOT go over well. That person\'s IP was immediately tracked to Sacremento,CA. We will see.........&quot; All I can say is dumbass. LOL. I am definately not in Sacramento. Do you think I am Inland? LOL.</p>
<p>@ Don Kieballs what were you saying about being slow? LOL.</p>
<p>LSAers keep driving the traffic to CDaN. Enty likes to profit off this topic... it is hot for him... just like AN. </p>

<p>As you can see, voaters, this has escalated into quite a hectic scene, I bring this here for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To warn this community about how nasty and vindictive this group has already become.</li>
<li>Inquire as to the status of VOAT mod and admin as to any similar doxxing, ddos, legal threat or coercion from above said parties.</li>
<li>This to ensure safety of the forum as to origin and possibility of attack.</li>
<li>To serve as an example as to our (LSA,CDAN,VOAT,TMD,LOP,GLP) efficacy, we should all be very proud.</li>

<p>A very good friend of this former B list actress who started as a child turned reality star says she was the middleman so to speak of a financial transaction which saw the former actress put herself out publicly in a place which cannot be good for her career. I hope it was a lot of money.</p>

            Something interesting I pulled out of that  LSA thread that had their doubts about someone  else at Chris Cornell's funeral:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             He is running a brothel out of his house
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.foxella.com/he-is-running-a-brothel-out-of-his-house/">
             http://www.foxella.com/he-is-running-a-brothel-out-of-his-house/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This blind would actually be a good one for the big blind of the day.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, I wanted to get it out before Monday because it is really juicy.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, this former A list mostly movie actor who royally screwed up one franchise but still has another one where he is tied for second banana with two other actors is running a brothel out of his house. Despite all of the gay/bisexual rumors, our actor certainly has a reputation for loving strippers and other women who make their living in sexual ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, he has taken his love for those women and his need for money and combined them.
           </p>
           <p>

             Bingo.  The Emanuels are all three involved in different aspects of the NWO plan.  But yes, Arie being one of the Top Agents in Hollywood will be deeply entrenched.  There was a situation already where he had to apologize for someone accused that worked for him.  You can bet your Sweet Bippy that others under his tent and he himself may end up on CDAN.

              Hallelujah!!! You get it!! Their daddy trained them well and they have the mossad (henceCIA) acting like their very own army. Trick is, let these guns for hire and boots on the ground realize they are protecting and policing for the EVIL scum!! At some point, each of us, in our lives, has to be accountable for our actions. Now, once you are trained or tortured into a sociopath mind set, then perhaps developing a conscience is tough but I am an optimist at heart and I think we can turn the tide once the 'boots' realize who they are doing the dirty work for.

               I had read where the bodyguard was ex Mossad.
              </p>
              <p>
               And that bodyguard was Heidi Klum's ex bodyguard.

               I had a comment all ready but because of voat being down late evening and all night til now, I lost it. Their father now works as a pediatrician at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago.  How does that grab you?  Kind of scary.  He was part of a group that murdered in Israel and I wonder if he is wanted there.  They all have dual citizenship.  Very Patriotic Family.

              Their problem is, that the wolves are gnashing their teeth and want more and more.  They will not stop for they know there is more to come.  The rest of the story has not been told and they want it told.  I have said this before.  It is too late.  The Cat is Out of the Bag and You Can't Stuff Her Back In.

                I agree. I don’t know if that proof is out there now but I think it was or still can be. They have made mistakes before. There is no way he is not his son. I don’t know how a person could ever kill any child let alone one that is the spitting image of himself.

               I agree.

               It's why they had the media pummel #pizzagate. Calling people crazy used to work. So they labeled it a conspiracy theory and anyone believed it nuts and expected it to be contained. Guess what? It didn't work this time.

              <p>
               Whether there's a higher power involved protecting key figures and those trying to help, I don't know. It's what I sense. And a personal anecdote seems to confirm this. Right around ten years ago, someone commented about it being the End Time. I replied, "Not yet." They asked why I thought that and I said, "Because some are on the fence. There'll come a time when everybody has to choose a side. They'll have no choice. The issue will be so great and so grave, they'll have to, and that hasn't happened yet."
              </p>
              <p>
               I consider this that issue. We can debate all we want about infidelity, shady business practices, and skimming money off the top, but pedophilia and the molestation of children? There's no debate, and you're either on one side or the other.

                 And they are pulling out all stops. I've never seen the media engage in such reckless propaganda. They are deliberately smearing and trying to sway opinion of our POTUS. If you liken the coverage of Trump to that of The Kenyan, there's no comparison. The Kenyan received accolades for destroying America and his failed policies, alleged criminal activities, and questionable alliances were all lauded. It was a huge part in deceiving the public as to what that commie/paid Soros puppet's intentions were.

                   Oh, absolutely! But the Bushes got blasted by the press. They're every bit as bad as the Clintons, but Bush got called out every step of the way. Romney also. He's part of the #deepstate and a betrayer of the GOP., but the SOROS-puppet got slammed by the media. Of course, now that he's trying to damage the POTUS' reputation, he's a genius/oracle and someone we should listen to. So while both parties are DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY, it's the dems that took the lead in manipulating the press. Why else would journalists have been sending the articles they were writing to the DNC, the people they were writing about, for approval on what they'd written? I've never heard of such a thing! Yet there it is in black and white in those emails. And people don't see how scummy the media is? How it's in bed with the DNC and The Cannibal Elites?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Oh, that's right! The people that believe the false narrative never actually read the emails. Why would anyone want to know the truth? It's crazy .... because when the lid blows off this story and the dark secrets are revealed, they're gonna be forced to know! It's gonna be all over the internet!!! They can control the media, but they sure can't control what's taking place!

                     Had a huge argument with someone in my neighborhood this summer over our POTUS. She had the nerve to quote Johnny Depp and tell me how much she admired him. Yes, she was using Johnny Depp as her moral compass. So I went off on PedoWood and the debauchery/perversion that goes on there. I told her the secrets would be revealed. She, too, looked at me like I was crazy, but I got the last laugh. The Weinstein story broke the following week. She won't even look at me now. She's too ashamed and she knows she was wrong and can't admit it. And Weinstein is the tip of the iceberg.

                      I bet she can't look in the mirror now.  She knows that she is living and has been living a lie, unless she admits the truth to herself.  The hardest thing to do, is looking at yourself.

                       It's true. Admit you were wrong and move on. It's what I did. It's not easy, but it's the only thing that works.

                       Most of us didn't know. How could we? It's been covered up for years. Always accept the truth when it's given.

             Yeah well I wouldn't give much credit to the people of LOP because the place is filled with idiots bots and paid shills for the past few years now whereas it used to be a place where debate and research were encouraged.  I give credit to Marco only,  the owner of the site,  because I use the place as a great platform to write and store material.  However,  there are occasional good ppl threading good material.

             The Metal Den.
            </p>
            <p>
             They have had millions of views on the Cornell/Bennington  story,  for a site that did nothing before but cover metal bands and their gigs.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've never been a big metal fan,  more of a (former) Deadhead,  even though I've seen Suicidal Tendencies,  Fugazzi and Jane's Addiction back in the day....
            </p>
            <p>
             But hopefully,  with Randy's help and enough of his fan bases angst for Chris's death,  someone we all know as of late will be visited by a virtual Metalocolypse.

              ...  Lol,  and que jew baiter DonPeeHole's critique of the 'metal'  bands above.  Which I agree aren't 'metal'  bcuz I could never stomach all the other trash like ozzy,  metallica,  crue,  poison and all that shit.  Like I'm sure DonGloryHole has a Journey vinyl stuck in his ass  along with all his nazi memorabilia.
