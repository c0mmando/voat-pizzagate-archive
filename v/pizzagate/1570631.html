<blockquote>
<p>New information from Wikileaks is about to shake up the political world. Those in question are “Republicans in name only” or “RINOs.” An email from John Podesta to Huma Abedin that was released as document number 1078645 is about to turn the speculation that certain prominent Republicans who opposed Donald Trump into the truth that they were, in fact, not just disloyal to Trump and the party but were on Hillary Clinton’s payroll.</p>
<p>The email, sent in July of this year, describes how funds were being diverted from Clinton’s campaign to the Super PACS of Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, and John Kasich.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strangely, there was no direct link to the Wikileaks Podesta email in question. There is also no information on this supposed news site about who its writers and editors are. When I searched Wikileaks for email 1078645, no such email ID was found.</p>
<p>The &quot;news&quot; story quoted the email directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“JB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign. Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet key word searches pulled from this alleged direct quote also turned up no matches in Wikileaks.</p>
<p>BEWARE. This looks like an attempt to smear both Republicans and Wikileaks. Watch out for USA News Today. Always vet sources.</p>
<p>Perhaps those with more technical acumen than me can see who this site is registered to?  This may be part of the same elaborate disinformation campaign that dreamed up the &quot;Russians hacked the election&quot; narrative and is warning Russians can plant CP on computers.</p>',

            The CIA is totally aligned with the Dems at this point.  I guess all the Bush plants were run out of the CIA and replaced by Obama and the Clintons.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dems are quickly becoming a complete criminal organization and the media is either in on it, or so ideological that they believe that the ends justify the means.

             The US is an Oligarchy.  According to Carroll Quigley in "Tragedy and Hope" in 1900 over 50% of production was controlled by 26 families.  At the top are the Rockefellers, followed by the Morgans, Mellons, du Pont, Astor, Cabot, etc.  Here is a quote from Tragedy and Hope about the Democrat party (I'm sure the same can be said about Republicans, they are both identical):
            </p>
            <p>
             More than fifty years ago, the Morgan firm decided to infiltrate the Left-wing political movements of the United States. This was  relatively easy to do since these groups were starved for funds and eager for a voice to reach the people. Wall Street supplied both. The purpose was not to destroy, dominate, or take over but was really three-fold:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) to keep informed about the Left-wing or liberal groups;
            </p>
            <p>
             2) to provide them with a mouthpiece so they could blow off steam;
            </p>
            <p>
             3) to have a final "veto" on their actions if they ever went radical.
            </p>

              Oh, I'm not high on the Republicans either.  They are just laying low because they have a majority.  My point is the Dems are 100% integrated with the MSM and CIA, which is scary as hell.

            The supposedly quoted email looks totally fake and sounds nothing like any of the real Podesta emails. Nobody would explicitly state in an email that HRC had spoken to someone personally on a matter this big.

            Senator Reid said they were going to give  false intel to mess up Trump.

            All they have to do is email a lie, which could be a way to discredit WikiLeaks from this point on.

           <p>
            Shouldn't Reid be charged for this?

             i think they in fact have some stuff on Trump..what make me think that is one tweet from Embassy Cat end november , where it say "can't decide what bird is more tasty ,bird beginning with a C (clinton?) or bird beggining with a T "(trump?) ..maybe iam wrong but, its look like a coded msg, and its the only easy explanation i had...

              Randomly saw a link to this place on FB, just so you guys know this
              <em>
               specifically
              </em>
              is the same group that owns US Uncut. (spammer of all those fake post-election hate crimes) That particular Macedonian is a hardcore Berner. Obsessive about manufacturing things to harm Clinton in some way no matter the angle. (I hate that shit because there's so much
              <em>
               real
              </em>
              shit out there about her already, thanks a lot fagort!) US Uncut caters to Berners, this site caters to, well, this group.
             </p>
             <p>
              Similar to that one that interviewed with WSJ and other msm sites to help build their narrative, he's a "leftist-no-matter-the-cost" even if that means drowning his own allies' credibility. In that guy's case if it was something that reflected poorly on Trump
              <em>
               and
              </em>
              got him money, he ran it. Just exchange Trump for Clinton for this guy's series of sites.
             </p>
             <p>
              See CS' comment below for help on spotting these, also throw a couple of the shameless "we-report-anything"
              <em>
               known
              </em>
              sites, from dailybeast to WaPo into google, when you see a strange looking quote. If the quotes also don't appear there they're probably fake. Generally speaking be suspicious of anything launched 2014 onwards. If it's something that wouldn't make the MSM/clickbaiters (stuff like CIA movement, or foreign coups and the like) go hop to an older left-ideological focused site like Counterpunch or FPIF.org and see if it's mirrored there.
             </p>
             <p>
              One thing that also helps is that there's very often a lot of incestuous link-partying going on (think Gawker) so if you notice a whole bunch of places with ads leading you in a circle, that's a nice indicator too. (Since it's usually plaintext adblock shouldn't block them.) Basically if the 'news site' styles its refs to partners like a generic blogging platform it's a fakeout.

              There was a report that a high percentage of the news sites that popped up during election were coming from a small town in Macedonia.  They earned their money when they got a lot Facebook hits.  It was sites like these that caused people to look into how to deal with fake news.
