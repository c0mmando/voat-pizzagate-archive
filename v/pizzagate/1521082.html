            AreWeSure what the heck is up with you? I got suspicious yesterday after our little conversation in the comment section here:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1533662">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1533662
            </a>
            . So I looked up your posts. This is the first one I followed. I expected to see Mssr Tevfik Arif caught
            <strong>
             In flagrante delicto
            </strong>
            with an 8 year old girl. But what do I find? A normal looking Turkish guy in a nice suit in a picture with Donald Trump. And I then learn the guy was acquitted.  O_O
           </p>
           <p>
            So what's up AreWeSure?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday you didn't consider the possibility that someone running a web site with a secure download page no Pizzeria would have makes it more likely they're serving up Child P********y. And if it's kiddy porn then keeping your web server in a locked closet instead of hosting it remotely in some data center makes a lot of sense. It's weird that you would totally overlook something so obvious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you ignored the highly suspect bullet hole in CPP's computer system put there by Edgar Welch in what seems like a 1 in 10,000,000 shot. That's not rational to accept those odds. Ever hear of Occum Razor?
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor
            </a>
            ? The simplest explanation is usually the correct one. But you went with the 1 in 10,000,000, that's sketchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            So again what the heck is up with you? Why are you here?
