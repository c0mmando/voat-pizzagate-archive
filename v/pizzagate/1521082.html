            AreWeSure what the heck is up with you? I got suspicious yesterday after our little conversation in the comment section here:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1533662">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1533662
            </a>
            . So I looked up your posts. This is the first one I followed. I expected to see Mssr Tevfik Arif caught
            <strong>
             In flagrante delicto
            </strong>
            with an 8 year old girl. But what do I find? A normal looking Turkish guy in a nice suit in a picture with Donald Trump. And I then learn the guy was acquitted.  O_O
           </p>
           <p>
            So what's up AreWeSure?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday you didn't consider the possibility that someone running a web site with a secure download page no Pizzeria would have makes it more likely they're serving up Child P********y. And if it's kiddy porn then keeping your web server in a locked closet instead of hosting it remotely in some data center makes a lot of sense. It's weird that you would totally overlook something so obvious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you ignored the highly suspect bullet hole in CPP's computer system put there by Edgar Welch in what seems like a 1 in 10,000,000 shot. That's not rational to accept those odds. Ever hear of Occum Razor?
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor
            </a>
            ? The simplest explanation is usually the correct one. But you went with the 1 in 10,000,000, that's sketchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            So again what the heck is up with you? Why are you here?

            He could have paid off the cops, but if it goes to trial the judge gets some moolah as well. Most  probably a Turkish police shakedown for money.
