<p><strong>How Did Epstein End Up With Wexner’s New York Townhouse?</strong></p>
<p>Last weekend, investigators used crowbars to pry open the doors of Epstein’s Beaux-Arts townhouse on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. The building once belonged to Wexner, who purchased it in 1989 from Birch Wathen, a private preparatory school, and then embarked on major renovations. According to Bloomberg, Wexner transferred ownership of the building in 1998 to a Virgin Islands business called NES LLC with which Epstein was affiliated. In 2011, Epstein transferred ownership of the home to Maple Inc., a Virgin Island–based company he controls, according to The New York Times. The transfer document did not list a purchase price, which the Times says indicates “it did not involve any exchange of money.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of Epstein\'s activity at the apartment building appears to be business-related: New York state corporate registrations tie 9 East 71, an LLC named after his townhouse, and NES LLC, which owns the townhouse and pays his pilots\' paychecks, to the building… All 4 of the named \'coconspirators\' in Epstein\'s plea deal have been associated with the building.</p>

            Alefantis is part of LLC that owns a Pizza place in Fla.  that employed some guy we were investigating. Memory fails me now. But yes these LLCs are connectors I believe. God I wish I could remember. I think it was related to the guy that flew an airplane into a building. He lived in Fla. mad 😡 the LLC is located in DC.  Comet Pizza is same LLC as the pizza pace in Fla.

                I will try to help. Not good with researching on phone. I ran with it last year cause it made my blood boil when I read it may be possible that there has been blood in the cement. Someone said this may be why we can’t find Our Missing Children. Gut wrenching.

                  The present invention relates to the use of blood in the construction and building industry, whereby blood and extracts of blood containing haemoglobin are used as air entraining colloids. The recommended process for preparing a lightened material consists in associating a construction element chosen from the cements, mortars and concretes, with at least one air entraining colloid chosen from whole blood, globules, red blood corpuscles and haemoglobin.

                  Sickos. Can you imagine how much blood is used by CEMEX?  How do you even get that answer. They are worldwide. I’m sorry but we have blood shortages and these Arseholes are doing what with it?  Patented no less. Southwest Generation Co.LLC is in NM too. What an area to get all that blood from. Immigrants.

            Here is the North end by telephone. Area code 321 is the area code serving Brevard County, Florida, Space Coast Region and Seminole County, Florida. Often called the countdown county the area code has been in use since November 1, 1999; it was assigned to Florida (instead of suburban Chicago) after a successful petition led by local resident Robert Osband to commemorate the Space Coast's impact on Brevard County. The code refers to the countdown sequence which has launched many spacecraft from Cape Canaveral.[1][2]
           </p>
           <p>
            When it was activated in 2000, area code 321 was used as an overlay for most of area code 407 in the Orlando area, except for the small portion of Volusia County that includes Deltona which was in 407 at the time (it is now in 386). However, no 321 numbers were issued in the 407 area from 2003 until 2015, when 321 numbers were issued for cell phones in Osceola, Orange, and Seminole counties due to high demand. With the 407/689 overlay, 321 remains frozen in the Orlando area with new 321 numbers again being assigned only in Brevard County.
           </p>
           <p>
            321 also is the area code used for SatCom Satellite Phone units. Harris/Caprock Corporation has maritime satellite calls going through its corporate call center in Melbourne. Spook sat. Possibly picked up in the islands. I think they have a station in the Atlantic to get calls through, but was Epstien using this channel, or was there some other electronic devices there? All speculation at this point, of course.

             Very interesting Yog, thank you... I heard a similar theory about Comet P, that it actually was (code)named after the phone service on which THEY communicated and operated - a safe channel, away from oversight. There is a telecom co by the name of Comet, but I have not dug further...
            </p>
            <p>
             As you have brilliantly pointed out, Satellite phones may also be used by THEM in similar fashion. Being able to ID them via the 321 area code will certainly help when looking at the LLCs and public information connected to these NAMES.
            </p>
            <p>
             Communication is a very compelling angle to work this case. What are the safer more encrypted, or untrackable methods of communication predators may prefer? Do any known associates own telecom co's that might be able to shield an operation of the scale it seems to be?

            Davie is right south of Alligator Alley, now known as I 75. That was, and is still, the main corridor of drug/other transport in my State. Nothing has changed in Miami. The Israeli Mafia runs the place.
