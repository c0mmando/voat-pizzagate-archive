<p>Last spring, Hillary stopped at a senior\'s residence in Harlem and played a lively game of dominoes with the residents. She shimmied and laughed as she played and said she was taking dominoes to the White House. Fawning CNN reporters described the event in the Tweet linked to above as &quot;Hillary dominates in a game of dominoes&quot; and featured a gif of Hillary winning the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clinton engaged in a lively game with three men, shimmying her shoulders and drumming her dominoes on the small table as the game intensified.</p>
<p>&quot;You play good! Oh my God,&quot; one player told her.&quot;</p>

<p>What does this have to do with Pizzagate? A great deal, I believe, since the game of &quot;dominoes&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the most sinister themes in the Podesta emails. The &quot;dominoes&quot; emails between John Podesta and Herb Sandler are cryptic and strange and involve a ghastly crew of characters. </p>
<p>The domino games take place in Martha\'s Vineyard in late summer of 2015 and 2016. The game in 2015 occurs, as far as I can tell, during the Labor Day weekend in the house where the handkerchief map was found.</p>
<p>I have spent a great deal of time studying the domino emails and believe Hillary\'s high-profile profession of love for the game is heavy with meaning. Furthermore, the possible double entendre of the CNN tweet describing her as &quot;dominating&quot; the game should not be ruled out.</p>
<p>I have no proof, but I believe it\'s possible Hillary learned a sadistic, evil variation of the game of dominoes during her many visits to Haiti and passed it on to John Podesta who taught it to the Sandlers. There is an email dated on the day before the realtor asks Susan about the handkerchief where Susan Sandler thanks John Podesta for teaching them the game and says she\'s getting a set. There is also talk of &quot;Podesta rules&quot; and &quot;Sandler rules&quot;.</p>

            First off, that video and worldcorp. has no relation to podesta or PG. Even if it was, how is the code words relevant. The only slang found for pasta is sex, sooooo, playing dominos on sex????Doesn't make sense. Everyone wants these things to be true soooo bad BC they want evidence. Its these ridiculous connections and conclusions that discredit us and PG as a whole in mainstream society.

            Dominoes has never been shown to be be pedo code, the only trifle of evidence for pasta being code for sex is on urban dictionary in the fifth definition ranking. Anybody can enter those definitions, its user submitted. Last, cheese pizza not just cheese has been shown only BC its an acronym for child porn. Even if all these words all legit pedo codes they don't ever work in the context they are going to be used. I Do believe in the elites and human trafficking but not this. Its not logical and everyone is letting emotion determine their opinions.

            The Pizza Pac logo with one and two slices of pepperoni, looking like 1 and 2 domino. Which is also what the Dominos pizza logo looks like.

            Just to throw in another creepy bit of information, dominos are sometimes referred to as bones or cards. What was that hint about cards someone made?

            But one thing is clear, Hillary is high functioning like all true psychopaths. If we had no idea about the emails, we would not blink. She had liberals fooled for decades. What am I saying, she may as well decapitate a toddler and they would still worship her. Liberal progressive has become a mental disease.

            Given how she laughed at Kathy Shelton's ordeal, I suspect that Hillary could be a natural born psychopath who is into sexual sadism, child torture / murder. Cathy O'Brian names Hillary as one of her handlers. Ted Gunderson laid it all out - Deep State head hunts for candidates who would serve the NWO system - they are selected from a pool of psychopaths (mostly from prominent satanic inbred families) Trump could be a deviation from the norm. I do not rule out the possibility of Trump having engaged in sex with an underage girl 13 - 16 (pubescent, according to Milo) but as far as abusing little children - there had been no rumors. He is clean. Deep State is not content with having a little dirt on a president, they want the Podestas, Ted Heath, homosexual pedo/satanists. They want Trump out.

              I said there is a possibility but this makes him a fearherweight. Milo clearly said that having sex with a post pubescent teen is not pedophelia - it is statutory rape. Pedophelia involvea children, who have not reached sexual maturity. We have to categorize pedophelia. Gradation. Raping a 3 year old and having consentual sex with a 13 year old are not the same thing. Keep that in mind. Remember we are dealing with sickos like Podesta, we have to lower the bar. Trump is a saint by comparison even if that allegation about that 13 year old girl is true.,They need serious dirt - Obama was gay and into hotdogs, plus a tranny wife. Hillary - we need a list. Ttrump is clean - relatively speaking.

               Who gives a fuck what Milo said. There is no such thing as consensual sex with a 13 year old because it would involve coersion, trickery and deception. Maaaaybe at 16 or 17, but not 13. No way!

                I am saying that we have to set the bar low. For chrissakes we have monsters like Skippy and Ping Pong freak torturing and murdering and possibly eating children and we are focused what Trump allegedly did to s 13 year old girl - let's set priorities first.

               No, that would not make him a featherweight. If Trump abused a 13 year old then that is MAJOR dirt. It sounds like you're saying for someone to have sex with or rape a minor is no big deal.

            Please people, I've said this before and I'll say it again. The domino theory is a dead end and we need to focus our research elsewhere. When the Sandler's wrote that email to podesta it is obvious that it is old boring politicians trying to be funny. Do you think I'd be better at dominoes after eating pasta or after eating pizza. They are obviously foodies who would throw themed pasta or whatever dinners and then play dominoes. Just look at this logically. I'm not saying Podesta is not a sicko just that there is nothing to Dominoes.

            She must have been so Giddy with the thought of her winning (she was so sure) and what she would be able to get away with there.  Just like the rest of them .  Their trafficking in children on order.

                 Faces of kids i knew in my life, their sweetness and happiness, adorableness, cuddliness (thats not a word lol), i keep seeing their happy trusting faces and the thought that someone could do that to kids around the world, do that to their own kids...fills me with this cold hard rage and it takes all of the happy memories and hope for people in my arsenal to keep my head above it.

                  I know.  We have to keep our hearts soft, but nerves like steel.  That is the only way we will get through this.  They are depending one us.  The others tricked them broke their trust.  Not us.

             Remember how Donald could not go in the White House for weeks. It was because Hillary had already picked the Drapes ..... and 'trap doors to secret tunnels... and sound proof doors ...... and S&amp;M paraphernalia .....
After the election backfired for the Clintons &amp; her pizza gang, all had to be cleared. No trace had to be left. Donald spoiled their party, they cannot stand him, and want to get rid of him. Donald must expose the whole thing if he wants to stay in office, or may dare I say, if he wants to stay alive! Donald must know that they know that he knows! He has no option. But he also suspects that many from his own team might be implicated. Howard Stern's words ring true - what has Donald gotten himself into! He was about bringing jobs, securing borders ... he had no idea that he was literally taking on the Satanic Order! Hillary, Soros, Obama, Mccain, are after him, and they have Spooks watching his every move. He must make his move or else pedos will win - again!

               He should stay and govern from his Trump Tower. I would not spend a day in that Satanic house. I bet cooks at the white house kitchen are CIA .... need I go on. Trump has to go to Trump Tower and start war on pedos. It is going to be a mighty battle but Trump has entire US Military on his side. Beat that Soros!

                I agree. That is probably why he upped Military Funding.  They will be doing the dirty work.  He cannot trust too many other of the Alphabet Depts.  Here is a strange think I saw on the local news this morning.  Ivanka attended some function with Trudeau.  I was amazed.  This could of course be trying to tamp down any upcoming articles about Justin and his strange extra curricular activities.  The picture taking I believe is an eerie warning.  Someone should text him, but hopefully he is already arranging precautions.

            Uh, looking for meaning in this seems like a stretch to me. She just got done playing dominoes with some seniors, and then says she is going to bring dominoes to the White House. Any politician would have said the same thing, IMO.

            More subliminal messages from the W*ore of Babylon.  I could not resist.  We should ask Podesta  to Tweet his instructions for his game.  Podesta's Rules- Domino Game for Dommies.  God, he makes me sick.  I don't know who I hate more, her or him.

              Whore of Babylon is Madonna. She has been anointed by that moniker for a while. Hillary is the Witch - she is actually pictured wearing a witch's hat. Sick, depraved psycho woman.

               Yes i remember when i was first going through the bible and religious discussions on this the first thought for me was kim kardashian lol "The great prostitute" but i heard madonna later on and that made so much sense.

               I've been looking for a wealthy native american family line that has irish druid and native shaman bloodlines. I read that the occult leadership in the US is headed by a female that fits this profile and she is named Hepsebah (occult name i guess). She would be very wealthy and powerful (but perhaps not publicly) and the occult people think she will or has birthed the antichrist. I guess to establish base in NA they needed a native american shaman mystical bloodline mixed with druid. I find this interesting and want to explore more.

                 Yeah, i'm thinking that just like the shadow government the top occultists have less of a public profile. Like the politicians are the public face and decision makers, the real string pullers stay in the dark.
