This was a male class who had forfeited all rights, were property of the Queen or Sublime Ladies and were considered to be &quot;on the level of a normal farm animal&quot;.[1]</p>

            . This sounds pretty twisted all right. Unfortunately, we have to have a connection to elite child abuse in order to leave it up here. I will give this our 24 Hour Grace flair, in case anyone can find a connection. After that, we'll have to take it down if nothing turns up. The flair should give it some eyeballs, though. This sounds very much like NXIVM.

              , who spoke Russian and might have been able to help, but I just saw that he deleted his account for some reason. :-(  Any idea why he nuked his account? He seemed like a decent sort.

                  Well, Kev is on Paol. I called him out on some of his bullshit, and he made a fake account over there in my name. I made
                  <a href="https://archive.fo/kqiDp">
                   a post proving it
                  </a>
                  , and within five minutes he wrote
                  <a href="https://archive.fo/kqiDp#selection-3857.0-3975.54">
                   a dismissive TL;DR comment
                  </a>
                  and

            ( closedsociety404 proposed this, but i think it is important to suggest some easy solutions beneftting most people as often as possible after naming problems as well ! )
           </p>
           <p>
            about things going grossly wrong and things ( like demanding from each and any politician to declare income and revenue, this alone can easily cut curroption by half ! ) that are common denomitors beyond the game played with pitting all those various groups against each other !
           </p>
           <p>
            important as well to watch the global delopments ( china crisper surveillance etc, india aadhar demonetization, .. ) and inform people that the lokal problems are pieces in a much larger puzzle !
           </p>
           <p>
            so i repeat some points i want to get across : check ahuwahzeus for background info, watch and share

               <p>
                Her Majesty Patricia I., the Empress of the Womania Empire and Queen of the OWK is therefore asking all OWK followers and fans for a financial contribution (donation), intended exclusively for the roof and outside wall reconstruction of the Tower.
               </p>
               <p>
                Donations can be made not only by the endless number of slaves, servants or submissive visitors, who in the last 19 years have stayed in the OWK Area, but also by "remote" supporters and fans of the OWK

              LMFAO did u ever see the video I made all about Sweden being ruined by women?  It was the 2nd country to let them vote, now look at it HAHAHAHAHA

             <p>
              I made another one of all the nigger cock they suck, inviting "refugees" into their homes to fuck them and not reporting it when they rape their daughters.

              Finnish women (first worldwide to get the vote) pay migrants 20 euros for sex at train stations.

               stop the mysogonie .. btw my ccp was moved to -4 from 28 in a flash after my last post .. i love these free speech echochambers - so i cant post anymore ..
              </p>
              <p>
               gab doesnt show elsagate,  minds - overstock - soros , not to talk about twatter plebbit fakebook etc
              </p>
              <p>
               the memoryhole is really turbocharge, so cache and share things, even more import talk 2 at least 1 person IRL and alert them
              </p>
              <p>
               ( closedsociety404 proposed this, but i think it is important to suggest some easy solutions beneftting most people as often as possible after naming problems as well ! )
              </p>
              <p>
               about things going grossly wrong and things ( like demanding from each and any politician to declare income and revenue, this alone can easily cut curroption by half ! ) that are common denomitors beyond the game played with pitting all those various groups against each other !
              </p>
              <p>
               important as well to watch the global delopments ( china crisper surveillance etc, india aadhar demonetization, .. ) and inform people that the lokal problems are pieces in a much larger puzzle !
              </p>
              <p>
               so i repeat some points i want to get across : check ahuwahzeus for background info,  watch and share

               "Utopians"  are playing a  murderous game of tribal &amp; racial politics we should be moving away from.letting them play divide and conqueer :-D

               media detox - as elsagate type stuff is going main((stream)) - buy local pay cash, and grow some food and share it with people you like.
