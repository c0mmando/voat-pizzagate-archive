<p>The Other World Kingdom (frequently abbreviated OWK) was a large, commercial BDSM and femdom facility, resort, and micronation, which opened in 1996 using the buildings and grounds of a 16th-century chateau located in the municipality of Černá in Žďár nad Sázavou District, Czech Republic.[3] Although not recognized by any other country, it maintained its own currency, passports, police force, courts, state flag and state hymn.[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The land and buildings were offered for sale in 2008 with an asking price of eight million euros.[5][6] The sale particulars suggested the property was suitable for use as a hotel, restaurant, residence, or old people\'s home.[7] As of 2016, it was still for sale.[8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The OWK styled itself as a matriarchy, where women rule. It also had strong BDSM and female dominance themes. The state\'s goal &quot;is to get as many male creatures under the unlimited rule of Superior Women on as much territory as possible.&quot;[1] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Below the Queen was a series of different classes. The first was the &quot;Sublime Ladies&quot; or &quot;Ladies citizens,&quot; who form the Kingdom\'s nobility. To become a citizen, a woman had to fulfill certain criteria. These were:</p>
<p>-The woman must have reached the age of consent.</p>
<p>-The ownership of at least one male slave.</p>
<p>-Obeying the principles and laws of the OWK.</p>
<p>-Sending an application for citizenship.</p>
<p>-Spending at least five nights in the Area of Queen\'s Palace.[1][11]</p>
<p>The next class was the Queen\'s subjects. These were men who followed OWK law, obey the Queen and pay her taxes, but have some rights such as &quot;freedom to travel, own property and deal with such property, have children, change employment, enterprise and state his opinion.&quot; The lowest class is the &quot;Slave&quot; class. This was a male class who had forfeited all rights, were property of the Queen or Sublime Ladies and were considered to be &quot;on the level of a normal farm animal&quot;.[1]</p>

            . This sounds pretty twisted all right. Unfortunately, we have to have a connection to elite child abuse in order to leave it up here. I will give this our 24 Hour Grace flair, in case anyone can find a connection. After that, we'll have to take it down if nothing turns up. The flair should give it some eyeballs, though. This sounds very much like NXIVM.

                  Well, Kev is on Paol. I called him out on some of his bullshit, and he made a fake account over there in my name. I made
                  <a href="https://archive.fo/kqiDp">
                   a post proving it
                  </a>
                  , and within five minutes he wrote
                  <a href="https://archive.fo/kqiDp#selection-3857.0-3975.54">
                   a dismissive TL;DR comment
                  </a>
                  and

            stop the mysogonie .. btw my ccp was moved to -4 from 28 in a flash after my last post .. i love these free speech echochambers - so i cant post anymore ..
           </p>
           <p>
            gab doesnt show elsagate, minds - overstock - soros , not to talk about twatter plebbit fakebook etc
           </p>
           <p>
            the memoryhole is really turbocharge, so cache and share things, even more import talk 2 at least 1 person IRL and alert them
           </p>
           <p>
            ( closedsociety404 proposed this, but i think it is important to suggest some easy solutions beneftting most people as often as possible after naming problems as well ! )
           </p>
           <p>
            about things going grossly wrong and things ( like demanding from each and any politician to declare income and revenue, this alone can easily cut curroption by half ! ) that are common denomitors beyond the game played with pitting all those various groups against each other !
           </p>
           <p>
            important as well to watch the global delopments ( china crisper surveillance etc, india aadhar demonetization, .. ) and inform people that the lokal problems are pieces in a much larger puzzle !
           </p>
           <p>
            so i repeat some points i want to get across : check ahuwahzeus for background info, watch and share
           </p>
           <p>
            "Utopians" are playing a murderous game of tribal &amp; racial politics we should be moving away from.letting them play divide and conqueer :-D

            i didnt post so much, so its easy to click through :-DD especially the sub give the gist easily
           </p>
           <p>
            media detox - as elsagate type stuff is going main((stream)) - buy local pay cash, and grow some food and share it with people you like.

                Her Majesty Patricia I., the Empress of the Womania Empire and Queen of the OWK is therefore asking all OWK followers and fans for a financial contribution (donation), intended exclusively for the roof and outside wall reconstruction of the Tower.

               <p>
                Donations can be made not only by the endless number of slaves, servants or submissive visitors, who in the last 19 years have stayed in the OWK Area, but also by "remote" supporters and fans of the OWK

               stop the mysogonie .. btw my ccp was moved to -4 from 28 in a flash after my last post .. i love these free speech echochambers - so i cant post anymore ..

               gab doesnt show elsagate,  minds - overstock - soros , not to talk about twatter plebbit fakebook etc
              </p>
              <p>
               the memoryhole is really turbocharge, so cache and share things, even more import talk 2 at least 1 person IRL and alert them
              </p>
              <p>
               ( closedsociety404 proposed this, but i think it is important to suggest some easy solutions beneftting most people as often as possible after naming problems as well ! )
              </p>
              <p>
               about things going grossly wrong and things ( like demanding from each and any politician to declare income and revenue, this alone can easily cut curroption by half ! ) that are common denomitors beyond the game played with pitting all those various groups against each other !
              </p>
              <p>
               important as well to watch the global delopments ( china crisper surveillance etc, india aadhar demonetization, .. ) and inform people that the lokal problems are pieces in a much larger puzzle !
              </p>
              <p>
               so i repeat some points i want to get across : check ahuwahzeus for background info,  watch and share

               "Utopians"  are playing a  murderous game of tribal &amp; racial politics we should be moving away from.letting them play divide and conqueer :-D

               media detox - as elsagate type stuff is going main((stream)) - buy local pay cash, and grow some food and share it with people you like.
