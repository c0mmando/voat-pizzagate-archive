<p>DUST IS A BIANNUAL MAGAZINE BORN IN 2010 BASED BETWEEN BERLIN AND LONDON AND DISTRIBUTEDWORLDWIDE.

IN OUR RESEARCH WE CROSS CONFLICTING TERRITORIES, WHERE STRUCTURES COLLAPSE AND THE WESTERN CODES OF APPEARANCES DISSOLVE INTO DIFFERENT KINDS OF CHOICES, DIFFERENT KINDS OF DYNAMICS. WE LIKE TO UNDERLINE A SILENT GEOGRAPHY, AT THE MARGIN OF MAINSTREAM PATHS, IN ORDER TO REDISCOVER A STRONGER ATTACHMENT TO LIFE, SOMEHOW MORE VITAL, GENUINE AND AWAKE; SOMETHING THAT IS HARD TO FIND IN THE ANESTHETIZED YOUTH PRESENTED BY THE DISORIENTED CIRCULATING CULTURE.

WE OBSERVE THE COLLAPSE OF STABILITIES TAKING PLACE GLOBALLY AS AN IRREVERSIBLE SHIFT OF SCENARIO THAT’S PUSHING YOUTH TO AN URGENCY OF CHANGE, AN URGENCY TO FIND A NEW AND PROPER VISION. AS MANY DO, WE FEEL RENEWAL TO BE NECESSARY IN ALL FIELDS, BASED ON A MORE PERSONAL SENSIBILITY. IN LIGHT OF OUR CONCERNS AND INTERESTS, THE REALMS OF COMMUNICATION, VISUAL CULTURE, ART AND FASHION NEED TO BE RECONSIDERED FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW. OUR MAGAZINE IS INTENT ON CREATING, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ANY CULTURAL PRODUCT PRESENT IN THE MARKET, THIS NEW VISION. WE CONSIDER THE MAGAZINE A LABORATORY OF IDEAS AND CONCEPTS THROUGH WHICH WE SEARCH FOR A NEW ESTHETIC AND TO GIVE THE IMAGE NEW VALUE. OUR PERSONAL INTERESTS GO BEYOND THE IDEA OF COOLNESS, TRENDS, WAVES OR ANYTHING ESTABLISHED BY POP CULTURE. WE PREFER TO DIRECT OUR GAZE TO THE BASIC, GENUINE WAY THROUGH WHICH YOUTH EXPRESSES ITSELF, FROM WHERE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED.</p>

<p>So their mission is to &quot;explore the universe of youth&quot;, and to enlighten what they consider the &quot;genuine&quot; aspects of youth. Seems to me their mission is to normalize sexuality in youth</p>',
