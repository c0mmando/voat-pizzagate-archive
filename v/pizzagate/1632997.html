              Election fraud by manipulating computer voting machines is very real.  This article interviews a man who used to steal elections all throughout latin america for pay, and he says it is just as easy to to in the US
              <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-to-hack-an-election/">

            <li>
             <p>
              The "Gems" software can manipulate the resutls of elections state by state, by using basically one computer guy or so per area who hacks (actually uses a back door in the software) through local serviers where voting results are sent.   It is called "fraction magic" and Bev Harris is the leading expert on how it operates.  if you look at this search you will find a myriad of videos explaining how it works.
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Bev+Harris">

             <p>
              In her opinion Hillary tried to steal the votes from various states but failed.  However, in the trying, wouldn't she have needed to place individual tech guys strategicaly throughout the US, probably in small office spaces, and paid them payoff "salaries" as Tech Support?  I'll answer that - yes.

            OP you may have discovered the mechanism by which HRC planned to alter the US election results, an action which I have no doubt whatsoever that she is perfectly capable of trying to do.

             Go for it. It does seem odd but I don't really know about this type of business and how they connect. There is plenty to research.

             There are some reasonable explanations in  the comments that might be worth checking before you start researching tho.

            The multiple locations are likely individuals/small operations of "sub-contractors" working for TSR.  I have seen this where contractors have a phone at a location for the length of a project, then it changes to another location, or goes away.  Some may be "leftovers" from prior projects at a particular location.  I doubt Google monitors/maintains these, not at all sure though.

             Government contract purchasing vehicles allow local governments to more easily identify reliable partner resources, especially for large scale information technology (IT) projects such as the development of a new website.

            So they are an IT solution provider that's been vetted by a federally-approved procurement sourcing agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it just that TSr.inc supplied an IT solution there? But if so why is it registered as a business there?

           <p>
            TBH as you can probably see I don't know much about all this but what I get from my research is there feels like a conflict of interest and the ability to do some back hand deals somewhere.
