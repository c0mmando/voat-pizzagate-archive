<p>&quot;CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) — Authorities say a South Texas woman has pleaded guilty to sex-trafficking a 9-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Maria Candelaria Losoya appeared Aug. 1 before a federal judge and admitted she was responsible for the assault of the victim in exchange for money.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old remains free on bond pending sentencing scheduled for Nov. 16. Losoya faces up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine and also must register as a sex offender.</p>
<p>Authorities say the abuse began in Brownsville in 2012 and lasted roughly three years.</p>
<p>Losoya later traveled with the victim three hours from Brownsville to Rockport so the assault could continue.</p>
<p>David Wills, a former Rockport resident accused of assaulting the victim, was arrested in July and released on a $5 million bond.&quot;</p>
<p>I noticed the exceptionally large bail for David Wills and thought to myself... &quot;who the hell bails out on 5 million??&quot;. Seemed like more money than the average folk can afford.</p>
<p>Turns out David Wills from Rockport is the former president of the Michigan Humane Society as well as the former VP of the Humane Society of the US. Even though the mainstream media hasnt touched it... There are plenty of articles documenting his ties to these organizations available. </p>

            Okay, what we have to watch out for is the networking that goes on in getting these pervs in positions of power. Willis was called out in 2010. He embezzled money from the HSUS and tried to float the combining of HSUS and the Michigan Humane Society which would have meant the HSUS actually running and controlling pet shetlers. The pervs must have wanted to get their hands on animals ... God only knows what they were going to do to them, but look what they're doing to kids!
           </p>
           <p>
            Willis was also grooming a scumbag to take his place. IT'S CALLED NETWORKING! They get in positions of power, change the laws, rules or regulations, install a successor and BINGO! Another place corrupted. They can use it as they will. It's the pattern. Like them tapping that skank whore Kamala Harris.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the 2010 article on perv Willis:

            I certainly will.  God knows Wayne Pacelle,  who heads the Humane Society of the United States, has been accused of some shady stuff in the past.  Now that we know one of his generals is a pedophile well, that certainly makes us curious to keep digging....

            Found this written in 2010 (prior to child rape charges), a lot of info in his connections. I bet the roommate who always vouched for him in jobs is a pedo too. So much embezzlement too.

            David Wills was fired from his job at the Humane Society in 1995.  This article chronicles a strange littany of shady dealings and sexual harrassment complaints against him before they finally cut him loose:

              Wow.  This is a much more coherently written account.  Good find, and with a photo too.  What a scumbag this Wills guy is.  I concur with your comment about the roommate.  I also think it's likely that his mentor, John Hoyt, was his gay sugar daddy.  Hoyt got Wills the job at age 19, making him "the youngest person to ever head a major Humane Society."  I also have a hard time believing Wills only abused one child in all this time.

               I was thinking Hoyt was his roommate bc that's who I was referring to that could also be a pedo that got him jobs, my bad, I guess I read it too quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
               I wasn't thinking Hoyt was a sugar daddy but more of a co-pedo. But either theory could be spot on, or a combo of both.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wills just got caught abusing the one child, no doubt there's many many more, he just didn't get caught with them.

            Holy shit.  First I got red-pilled with the Podesta e-mails and Voat.  Then -- BAM, BAM, BAM -- I learned about all the names that are allegedly connected to this kind of shit:  the Catholic Church, the Bushes, the Royal family, Mccain, Schumer, Lindsey Graham, the Clintons, the former Hot Dog Importer In Chief, Jethro on the Beverly Hillbillies, Tom Jones, Captain Kangaroo, about a third of all elected officials in Washington, DC, almost all of Hollywood and the music industry,  on and on and on.   Dammit, and now a big shot in the dadgum Humane Society of the US.  Holy shit.  It's everywhere.  WTF?   Why can't they just beat off and leave the little ones alone?  (It's a rhetorical question.   I get how complex and lucrative this all is to these psychos.  I just wish our innocence were not lost, and I sincerely wish nobody was forced to suffer....)

Global Blue Technologies CEO David K. Wills' name has been removed from the company's website. He is charged with the human trafficking of a child for sexual purposes."

             This is from 2010... allegations of other crimes..
"David Wills landed the presidency of the Nashua (NH) Humane Society in 1972 with the help of then-HSUS president John Hoyt’s recommendation. When he took over, he was just 19 years old, making him the youngest person ever to head a major humane society. Wills left six years later amid accusations that he stole funds, with estimates ranging from $10,000 to $2 million."
