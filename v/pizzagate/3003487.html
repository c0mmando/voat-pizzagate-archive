<p>Let\'s go back to a significant pizzagate post from a few years ago, thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/u/hey000">@hey000</a> about a suspected pedophile pizza parlor front in San Francisco, Goat Hill Pizza.   
</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1442209">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1442209</a></p>
<p>Here is another great link by <a href="https://voat.co/u/ASolo">@ASolo</a> explaining the Pelosi Insider Trading Connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1721813">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1721813</a></p>
<p>There was also the Guccifer 2.0 leaks which revealed that Pelosi\'s email account was registered with Goat Hill Pizza, who, by the way, made numerous donations to the Democratic Party.  The Guccifer leak had her credentials to log into a campaign website, and after doing a password reset on her account, sources said the email address said that it was sent to an <a href="https://voat.co/u/goathill">@goathill</a>.com email. </p>
<p>On page 2 of the document, &quot;Certified List of Elected Candidates for the November 2, 2004 General Election,&quot; Pelosi\'s email is listed as &quot;[email protected].&quot;</p>

<p>Goat Hill Pizza\'s owner is Philip De Andrade who was a former staff member of Nancy Pelosi as recently as 2013.

<p>In late 2016, The Conservative Daily Post presented a good analysis about Goat Hill Pizza being used as a front.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Philip De Andrade, under Pelosi\'s instruction. buys a legitimate business under his real name when he isn\'t working for the government any longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pelosi, like an idiot, puts her real name on the email sign-up for GoatHill.com, thus making herself into Philip online and providing a paper trail to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register the domain name in Panama to make data requests more complicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a loophole to make money appear out of thin air.  In this case, a wage subsidies program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money cleaned.  Untraceable, unless more leaks come out.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Guccifer 2.0 leak also found Pelosi on a list of people who received money through another loophole - funds by funneling them through government bailouts (TARP) directly to herself - and not just her.  Dozens upon dozens of Democrats, and billions of dollars were involved.</p>

<p>Goat Hill Pizza\'s primary location is 300 Connecticut Street, San Francisco, while Comet Ping Pong, before it burned to the ground, also had a Connecticut Avenue address.</p>
<p>Goat Hill\'s logo is of course, the head of a goat which could be depicting Baphomet, the popular symbol associated with Satanism and the Illuminati.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goathillpizza.com/">https://www.goathillpizza.com/</a></p>
<p>According to a NY Times article from 1987, Philip De Andrade was on Nancy Pelosi\'s team:</p>
<p>&quot;Others went back to college, enrolled in law school, or otherwise joined the economic system they once spurned.  Still others went into business for themselves here, continuing to seek a measure of independence.  Mr. De Andrade helped start a pizza parlor; he now works on the staff of Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat recently elected to represent San Francisco in Congress.&quot;</p>

            Allison &amp; Allison was the architectural firm of James Edward Allison (1870-1955) and his brother David Clark Allison (1881-1962). Originally based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1910 the Allisons moved to Los Angeles in Southern California. At first they specialized in public schools.

            posed a question as to whether anyone checked WikiLeaks for any emails to or from goathill.com.  A few of us checked and could not find anything about Goat Hill.  So, that got me to look further into Pizzagate and Goat Hill and what I found was an article which incuded a section about the origin of the word, "pizzagate."  It appears to have been written about a week after WikiLeaks released Hillary Clinton's emails, where John Podesta entered the picture.  The website is "Encyclopedia Dramatica" and the article is titled "PizzaGate."  Scroll down quite a bit to the subtitle "History of the Term."  This is what it says:
           </p>
           <p>
            The term "pizzagate" was associated with Nancy Pelosi;s Goat Hill Pizza in California before it was associated with Jimmy "#chickenlovers" Comet's Comet Ping Pong in the DC swamp.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before Halloween, 2016, the phrase "Pizzagate" was used on 4pol various times, apparently unrelated to the Podesta brothers.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              In February 2015, the term "Pizzagate" was used in a Super Bowl XLIV thread.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              In April 2015, the term "pizzagate was used to refer to some pizza place in Indiana refusing to serve gay people.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              In March 2016, the term"pizzagate" was used to refer to The Donald eating pizza in some wierd fucking way in 2011.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              In October 2016, the term "pizzagate" was used to refer to the idea that Nancy Pelosi used Goat Hill Pizza in San Francisco as a front company, saying Pelosi had a goathill,com email address on myngp.com
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            By November 3, 2016, the term "pizzagate" on 4pol had been mentioned in connection with WikiLeaks, in a thread about "elite pedo rings" and Podesta and "Cheesebay" which referred to an earlier thread on November 3, 2016 about the seller "cheesybay" on eBay.
            <br/>
            The first Mention Of Comet Ping Pong on 4pol was on November 3, 2016.

              I thought that Pizzagate came from The New York Pizza Connection back in the 80's..

              Even then they admitted that they talked in code.... 
"Conceding that he talked in code on the telephone, Mr. Badalamenti denied talking about drugs, but he refused to explain what was being discussed. Mr. Mazzurco testified later that they had talked about importing ''precious stones.'' The wiretapped conversations showed the defendants were talking about shipping ''shirts,'' ''22 parcels'' and products that were ''pure cotton'' and ''10 percent acrylic.'' Division Intensified

               Was the term "pizzagate" ever used in conjunction with that? I didn't see it mentioned in that article.

                No.. it was called Pizza Connection to lampoon the French Connection.  I was being abstact.. sorry. I'm trying to bring attention to the mafia using pizza parlours.
The main family behind the Pizza connection was the

                </a>
                and the Bonanno's and Gambino's still work together

                </a>
                using the same methodology.. (Giovanni Gambino still owns a Pizza Parlour..)
And.. The Gambino  Crime family that ran the pizza Parlours posing as heroin and coke selling points (who would suspect a pizza parlour.. they're everywhere)  is very friendly with the Clintons.

                </a>
                But that isnt all.. Roger Clinton Jr, RapeyBills half brother is well known to Gambinos..Read this..Go past the Marc Rich pardon stuff  (he's the one who got the Clintons in touch with Russian Oligarchs for U1 normally...)...(although.....it does explain how Dodgey Rogey got into the 'pardon' business.

                who was rewarded by Clinton by being promo(d to FBI Director.
So whilst I may have pulled the pizzagate label a little too far, I would like to point out that the modus Operandi of hiding in plain sight under a pizza parlour has been known for some time..

             I did a quick search and did not find anything, but did come across a random non-WikiLeaks piece which claims that the term "pizzagate" was initially used in referring to Goat Hill Pizza.  Will share when I have a few minutes to do so.

             When it came time to turn this project over to a general contractor, we knew whom to call. Chris Stasinos, CEO of Tribeca Builders, and
             <strong>
              Lee Alefantis, Stasinos’ New York partner
             </strong>
             , can both boast proven performance records with one-off restaurants and high-end retail, hospitality and residential clients across the country.
             <strong>
              Past projects in New York include the Hillstone restaurants, Zegna’s Fifth Avenue boutique and Tom Ford’s Madison Avenue boutique, and The Standard hotel
             </strong>
             , for which Stasinos collaborated with our designer Eric Cheong. Meanwhile, Alefantis, who for many years owned his own firm in D.C. prior to his move to New York, has overseen many restaurant projects, including The Caucus Room. We’re glad we can count on Tribeca Builders to manage this project.

             Hey, retard: Pelosis father was a literal shabbos goy.  Thats far more significant politically than any Italian mpb ties.

             Indeed the italian mafia is nothing compared to the jewish mafia; tjats why hollywood jews make so many movies about the former, to fool dumb people like you.
