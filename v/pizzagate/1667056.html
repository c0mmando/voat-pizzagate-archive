            I just can't take how they say "Debunked." The only debunking is them saying "It's been debunked." Sandy hook was carried out so terribly I knew a few months afterward it was so fake. Remember the DAY AFTER it happened, some of the grieving parents were on the news. This was maybe two days after this happened. There eyes would look far worse. I've been to so many of these real life incidents of parents actually grieving and this interview is unbelievable. If your child was just massacred, I promise you that your hysterics would be much more than this. This is complete acting. The dad would not be this stoic either. The thought is sad. Even though I know this interview was staged, and fake, it's still pulls at you. Also, when your child was just massacred, the grief is so heavy, the grieving faces normally look beat to hell.

            Those in the exercise wouldnt "know" they were there as cover.  They may come to suspect but wouldnt have proof.  They dont blow whistle just like those LE that probably know more about info on weiners laptop but arent getting in front of cameras and singing.  They want their carreers and lives

            Not sure why this is downvoted. Any time I try to blue pill anyone, I avoid posts on any message board and go straight for the source information and facts. Anonymous 4chan posts have zero credibility.

            The subject of this board.  The idea that John Podesta's emails used coded language.   And that the code referred to sex with children.  That is a belief system, one that keeps growing and growing.

             There has been no better explanation to date. We are waiting. Some of these code words are known in the underground pedo community. So it's the logical conclusion. These people are not CIA, NSA or FBI; no reason to use coded words in regular email unless something nefarious is going on. They don't strike me as the drug dealing type. The fact that none of them  have come forward to explain these emails with logical facts as to why they used these codes also is highly suspect. Just as it is suspect as to why Caris parents have not come forward to claim Alefantis innocence RE pedophilia, esp. when their own daughter is at center of controversy. The silence is deafening in Pizzagate.

              This whole community is completely immune to evidence.   What would these folks coming forward accomplish?  The Sandy Hook parents are still trying to convince the nutters that they children were actually murdered.  When people do come forward, it just becomes more fodder for people to invade their lives and their children's lives.  If people are going to believe your friend is cannibal pimp to the hollywood elite, there's nothing you can say to them that would make them change their minds.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your logical conclusion is arrived at by a series of leaps.
             </p>
             <p>
              A. I don't understand what these people are referring to
             </p>
             <p>
              B.  Therefore they must be speaking in code.               A GIANT bit of speculation, for which you have no evidence
             </p>
             <p>
              C.  Your evidence is that other people have used common words in their codes and these are not spies or drug dealers, so therefore they are using pedophile code.             Another massive leap in logic.
             </p>
             <p>
              Every other bit of evidence uses this as the basis.
             </p>
             <p>
              As an example of poor reasoning, let me ask you this, do you think pasta with walnut sauce is code?   If so, why?

               "The Sandy Hook parents".........I don't believe Sandy Hook was fabricated either.
              </p>
              <p>
               9/11 though, was a total inside job. The planes, passengers and terrorists were real. Everything else was an egregious fabrication:

               But I really came here to remind you AreWeSure that total objectivity is required in any investigation. Making up your mind one way or the other is......problematic.

              <p>
               Refusing to look at evidence of a greater conspiracy by the CIA to use Pedophilia to control politicians..........is problematic.

               You can change that though AreWeSure. You can commit right here and right now to do the right thing. You can start caring about poor, destitute, black Haitian throw-away children right here and right now.

               Those words by themselves I don't believe would be code. But combined with the other so called codes and in the context in which they are used, over and over again. than it is very likely code. Otherwise they are non nonsensical .
              </p>
              <p>
               This is nothing like Sandy Hook conspiracy which included a very small fringe of the population. PG includes a much wider segment of the population and not politically bound to one party or ideology as you would like to portray. So your argument that if these people came forward is all for naught is flawed. Not really the same 'nutters". We are a very diverse group of people all coming to the only logical conclusion . If these people came forward, the benefit would be that this may all be alleviated or even stopped altogether if they showed proof or explained their actions. Staying behind the scenes exasperates the issue. They are not too smart if they don't see this. Well, they are not smart at all if they are using sketchy code language hidden in their emails like common drug dealers. YOU never offer an alternate possibility for their use of code. Ever. Why is that? Because there really is no logical one is there?  I have family that were big time drug dealers in the 1980's. BIG TIME. They used codes in everything because phones were tapped 100% oft the time. So even in light conversation, having nothing whatsoever to do with drugs they would automatically insert code out of paranoia and habit. This is the pattern I see in these emails. It's not one or two instances, it's taken all together, there appears to be a pattern of code/language with these people , previously agreed upon. Not explaining it and labeling it all as FAKE NEWS makes it even more suspicious. It reeks of major cover up and even a fool can see this. Media is going out of their way in their complicity. It really is very telling.

               Walnut Sauce is walnut sauce. But in pedo land it is also black boys. And how do you share a slice of pizza between several people?? How do you play dominoes on pizza?? Please tell. Now it could be code for something else, besides children, I've explored that possibility here. Like CP or snuff live viewing parties or heaven knows what else. But it is code. Any reasoning person with an open mind will arrive at that conclusion.
              </p>
              <p>
               These codes are pedo codes. Don't believe the internet. Ask a pedo. The odds of them being used over and over in email exchange within the same circle of people highly suspicious.

               “hotdog” = boy
“pizza” = girl
“cheese” = little girl
“pasta” = little boy
"walnut Sauce"- Black boy

            They use children because they are sacrosanct and initiate a visceral reaction. Like the Orlando gays.The first thing is, "How can you even let those words come out of your mouth, that this was a hoax, these are children we're talking about here." So the objectivity and reasoning and critical thinking is immediately lost in the emotional reaction. Same w/ the holocaust (not saying one way or other) ... but it's illegal to even talk about in some countries. There's immediate emotional reaction and a shutting down of critical thinking.

            The Patriot's Day movie is in your face too. Has a Sandy Hook memorial, and then the bad guys say that the U.S. government did 9/11.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think CIA/Mossad gave movie to make Patriot's Day (and United 93). It makes me wonder whether Deepwater Horizon was an intentional accident to justify anti-oil regulations.

            The book The Memoirs of Billy Shears by Sir Paul McCartney (yeah that one) explains a fair bit about keeping people quiet, N/D's and buying people off and threats. Yet some people do talk and secrets get out ("I have no problem keeping secrets, it's just my friends that I tell them to") ... that's why John Lennon said "There's only 100 people in this world that know what our music is about." Probably wasn't even supposed to be that many that should have known. Below is absolute proof that threats are used. (Tippet murder witness.)

            As its discourse suggests, this propaganda campaign is using the now familiar “conspiracy theory” label, as outlined in Central Intelligence Agency Document 1035-960, the 1967 memo laying out a strategy for CIA “media assets” to counter criticism of the Warren Commission and attack independent investigators of .

            I don't know. My comments here are based on Chris Bollyn's book Solving 9/11. He points out that Mossad false flag operations typically have staged drills at the same time. In one chapter, he lists 3 different examples (terror attacks from long ago that I was not familiar with). The drills were also at Sandy Hook and 9/11.

            Nice find pede. Sandy Hook was the most egregious shooting hoax we have ever seen. The fact that he is even bringing it up....

            I believe 9/11 was an inside job, as was blowing up the ATF building in Tulsa, as was the Boston Marathon bombing given someone looking amazingly similar to human trafficking professor Claude d'Estree got his face caught by a random cell phone video..........

            Here's a pro tip: whenever there is a government drill for a fake exercise at the same time that a real terror attack happens,  is 100%false flag every time. It's a like a signature.  They do it to confuse the situation, covert their tracks,  and have everything leopard in advance. FEMA was in NYC the day before 9/11.

              Look back at the scene. It is very sterile and calm, no panic, no parents buckling at the knees, no ambulances rushing in, no medi-vac helicopters, very surreal. There was no mass evacuation of any kids. Should have been some wounded survivors, there's always survivors, on and on.............

                I know the problem, it is difficult, and what you say is the reason most won't even consider it. "How could so many people lie etc.?"  I use this to help me, from Sherlock Holmes. "Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth."
               </p>
               <p>
                People will remain quiet for a number of reasons. Things are compartmentalized and the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing. If you watch the entire (fascinating) interview w/ grassy knoll shooter James Files he talks about these things, people are kept on a "need to know" basis. For example, this shooter knew Oswald but the shooter's boss (mafia) did not know Oswald. The CIA and the mafia were working together, not all knew what the other was doing. It is very sneaky and deceptive stuff.
               </p>
               <p>
                There were low-level military guys who were forced to sign ND's after they (unknowingly) participated in the illicit autopsy of JFK at Bethesda, while MP's stood blocking the doorway. It is a fact, they are on audio stating how traumatized they were. Some of the Sandy Hook participants could have been notified that it was a drill only after the events and told to keep quiet. Below is an example of an intimated witness of the Tippet cop killing.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/zTjq7jz8b5g?t=135">
                 https://youtu.be/zTjq7jz8b5g?t=135
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you know that in the famous footage of the arrival of the Kennedy casket that JFK's body was not in that casket? It arrived at the back of the autopsy room in a shipping casket 20 minutes earlier and the body was in a body bag. This is a confirmed, documented and indisputable fact.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you have military or intelligence involved, threats, bribes, money, non-disclosure agreements for actors etc. then it can be carried off. Thousands of people worked on the atomic bomb and had no idea what they were doing until afterwards (of course I know that's not a great comparison).
               </p>
               <p>
                Once you have a few "aha" moments (like 911) it becomes easier to spot things. Like Orlando. Fifty people killed and the story just kind of disappears. That's a lot of burials and carnage. How did they handle the cops during all this? Who knows exactly, but they did. Maybe they were told to "stand down." And therefore kept at bay, in which case they wouldn't have a clue as to what was going on. Intelligence personnel are controlling the operation. (Look at Operation Gladio sometime.)
               </p>
               <p>
                The documentary (and others) Noble Lie explains that the OKC bombing was a false flag. It is quite obvious. Psychopath leaders and the MSM lie to us. It's sad and it's shocking, and some would rather crawl back in their comfort zone hole.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sorry for writing so much. But back to Sherlock. If you see multiple things about Sandy Hook or whatever that don't make sense to the point that it seems impossible to believe, then whatever is leftover, regardless of how ridiculous or implausible or preposterous it seems, it has to be the truth.

              All of the people in the drill think it is a drill. Very few people actually know the truth. It is highly, highly compartmentalized.

            Don't be distracted by Sandy Hook curve ball he is laying out the opposition's narrative which is, my emails were stolen so I'm a victim regardless of there content, and that Russia colluded with Trump, or Russia blame game for everything.  It's desperate imho

            I'm sorry, but your comment sounds like typical limited hangout stuff. Oh, they lied, but it's just 'cause (insert some innocuous detail that doesn't really matter much to the case) but ignore all the big discrepancies and questions. Maybe your cop friend was told something untrue, or maybe they told you something untrue but I don't think what you've expressed explains much.

            You guys want to know something I have been thinking about because I've studied the bible my whole life, is the Jewish aspect of all of this. After Jesus was put to death by the Jews, God broke his covenant with them. They were no longer his chosen people. Now I believe what the bible says about who really is ruling the world. It actually says Satan is the ruler of the world. Wouldn't the devil use the people God forsaken to do his bidding. They had started it in the days of the Apostle Paul.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over 40 Jewish men “formed a conspiracy and
            <em>
             bound themselves with a curse
            </em>
            , saying they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.” This “oath-bound conspiracy” showed just how determined those Jews were to murder the apostle. If they did not succeed in carrying out their plot, the end result, they believed, would be a curse, or an evil, to them. (Acts 23:12-15) Their plan, sanctioned by the chief priests and older men, was to have Paul brought back to the Sanhedrin for further questioning, as if to ascertain matters concerning him more accurately. But en route, the conspirators would be lying in wait to pounce on Paul and kill him.
           </p>
           <p>
            These kind of men have always been conspirators, trying to control the outcome and using satanic means, such as curses or spells. It's a culture that has existed with them for thousands of years.

             Well, Paul also talks in several epistles about the special place of the Jewish people...i.e. That they were entrusted with the Oracles of God as well as in bringing salvation to the world through Jesus...yes non believing Jews have missed the mark and are out of Gods current plan of salvation throughout Jesus...but his promises to Old Testament Patriarchs will be fulfilled through Israel, and ultimately God will give them a chance to repent during the Great Tribulation..and some will.
             <br/>
             I agree though that there is a sect of Satanic Jews that worship the devil i.e. Rothschilds, Soros et all.  I think we need to be careful about not painting with too broad a brush though.  Remember our Christian fathers and our savior Jesus Christ were/are real Jews

              I agree with most all of the two statements above, however the amillennial view is the Reformation puritan view, no tribulation period, and no physical reign of Christ on earth, only spiritual, w/ his people reigning w/ him. He then returns (this is the one and only rapture) at the end of this period. I trust the Reformers and Scottish Covenanters, John Calvin, etc.

                The reformers were doctrinally correct, even on eschatology. They were giants among theologians, and walked the walk too. Things have become corrupted over the last few hundred years. The book below is the best for understanding end times, from the puritan's viewpoint. (The link isn't to Amazon but they do have it.) You will reign w/ Christ if you are born again (converted, regenerated), and follow the Lamb "whithersoever he goeth," and avoid false prophets! God bless you :)

             It's good but the "switching Tippet's body for Kennedy's" body is not correct. Although it is proven beyond a doubt that there was a casket switch aboard Air Force One, to enable a nefarious autopsy. See David Lifton and Douglas Horne. I wish everyone would watch this confession of James Files, grassy knoll shooter, it's great, and educational. Explains so much.

            I'm sorry, I don't really understand this - is it required we believe sandy hook was a coverup to believe in pizza gate? Because I believe thoroughly in PG but I think sandy hook actually happened. Is there a list of conspiracies were supposed to also believe in if were also trying to take down Pizza gate?

             Some shootings are real, like the five Dallas cops (but killed by whom would be the question there), others are staged, like Sandy Hook, Orlando, and San Bernadino. (Although the killing of the couple might have been real.) San Bernadino lawyers are on youtube stating the couple were handcuffed before taken out of the vehicle riddled w/ bullets. It might help if you read a bit about (wikipedia) Operation Gladio. In the U.S the design is gun control and ultimately state control. But Trump and the people thwarted that.

             They were in the statement of faith by the sign-up sheet at the entrance. Are you asking if you're allowed to think differently? Just do it. I lean towards it being fully staged, but I have gone back and forth and I have a number of events in my mind which I am not sure about. The Boston Bombing I would guess might be something a number of pizzagaters are also suspicious of. Please stay and express your thoughts, though they may differ. Knowing that governments will and have staged deaths unfortunately still leaves us with the hard work of figuring out which times this is the case.

              The Saudi prince terror tourist Obama (Michelle?) visited in hospital convinced me, plus lots of extra paramilitary and police but bombing still happened. From there looking back at sandy hook it seemed obvious it was a lot of disinfo, staging or blowing things out of proportion.
Can't have your eyes open and not be skeptical of everything government does, all the news that is shovelled out.

              Best to read up on it yourself and not rely upon newscasters who spin and pre-digest what you are supposed to take as true.

              I don't believe "Nobody Died at Sandy Hook" which is the conclusion of this book on the subject.. -

              - but I do know it can't be proved that anyone died there. Also, the Pizzagate perps are desperate to keep this one under wraps.. Best to look at the logic and learn to  think.

                I don't have an informed opinion about the man, but it is worth taking/leaving his SH facts at face value cause they are independent of him and come from other sources.

            He's a lobbyist and coverrer upper of things for CIA. Therefore truth is not even important to him. It's what he believes and how convincing can he be for others. But for all the times he says uhh, umm, uhhh, he's a terrible nervous speaker.

             Bad actor. So bad I'm starting to think he could be a patsy.
            </p>
            <p>
             P.S. Alephantis is a much better actor than this drooler.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Pizzagate is certainly not staged.. Their staged events are so transparently shitty [if you look close and study them] with such poor crisis actors , it hard to imagine someone acting the part so well of Podesta and Alephantis. Skippy really is just a shittly actor? Likley Certainly, Not just someone who is playing the part of one.
            </p>
            <p>
             But yes it fits, he's as bad an actor as the dog -bad crisis actors of various staged events.
            </p>
            <p>
             .People are used to swallowing bad - actor pills?.. A good actor must really be able to command a high price? Like W. Bush?
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone could fool the public if they are framed properly by the Mass Media? Also framed properly by the State Prosecutors and Courts, anybody could be considered a criminal?

            Subterranean is what Pizzagate participants are - (Does Skippy appear nervous to you ?)  The notion of the shooter firing one shot that hit the hard drive located in the back room is a conspiracy theory beyond belief and could be considered fake-out news). When Skippy says "Our Democracy" (repeatedly) is he referencing the one you and I enjoy or the one he and his ilk enjoy ?
           </p>

            Did the election prove that fake news slapped Hillary down ? Or, did the Russians do us a favor ?

             The term "fake news" was rolled out to quash pizzagate and emails from Wikileaks specifically. Ditto the "Russia did it" mantra. Tells you all you need to know to get it.

            I have no doubt Sandy Hook was bullshit, what I struggle to get my head around is how they managed to keep all the crisis actors silent. Is it just one big giant cult involved? Don't these people think to themselves that theye just lied to the entire world?

             I think deep down they think they are better than other people..  they  have convinced themselves that they are doing it for noble causes(liberal brainwashing  by government officials)and the hush-hush nature must be maintained bc the average person is just to stupid to understand it for their own good... they understand the outrage and blow back  if unmasked and they love the attention they get as a victim , hero and ,all around do-gooder they imagine people see them as do to their role in the farce.

             MK Ultra. All of these actors are monarch mind-controlled. I guarantee you this. There is no way in hell they'd let anyone be a part of a psy-op of this magnitude without them being MK'd.

            Like others in this thread Sandy Hook is the one that opened my eyes to all the blatant duplicity and illusion that we are force-fed by the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            I almost feel like high-profile people talking about Sandy Hook is a way of distracting from all the other false flag and hoax shootings there have been since that one. It was certainly the most ridiculous and emotionally disturbing but we received a constant diet of fake shootings after that one from Obama.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who thinks Sandy Hook was real also has to believe

            On a side note, how much longer are we going to take this? If we cannot find anybody in the government that can take this force down that controls our government, what is the next step? Just asking because I tire of this but I am not sure what needs to be done. Podesta isn't going to jail or any of the child rapist/torturer/murderer's. Surely we can't just say aw dam, guess nothin we can do about it?

             Best thing is to try to influence the public with what is going on and get them off the Main Stream news and TV. As long as the majority are mind - controlled anyone who tries to "do something" will get tarred and feathered. cf. What just happened to PeeKay in Australia . -

            It goes without saying that he would say that. Sandy Hook was the nonsense that Redpilled me, so i have to laugh at his lame attempt to defend every last lie.

            I remember reading the sandy hook conspiracy theories at the time and thinking the inconsistencies were odd, but still not enough evidence for me to believe. Pizzagate woke me up as not only did I see the evidence, but I saw it play out since it first hit reddit. The behavior of the media and certain individuals were very telling. Fast forward to today and I have no doubt sandy hook was CIA.

             They lie and think that each contained incident will be examined upon it's own merits and the MSM will cut out the exposes or get ahead with a disinfo one etc...  The problem is over the years you start counting the tabs of "something still just isn't right" feelings that each of these incidents produces and you start to listen to a "Conspiracy Theorist" here and there for humors sake, and you think most of it is crap, but then you find one event that somebody hits dead on and exposes....  then the whole thing unravels,  and layer after layer of the mask upon mask is pealed off, until at last your an "anti-semite holocaust denier" who can't get through to the average person because you start sounding crazy spiting out facts, and when you tell them "oh but I'm not racist and I don't think all Jews are bad" the only thing they hear is that your back peddling and contradicting yourself.  Welcome to the twilight zone my friend.

             What really woke me up was seeing the whole MSM work together in the cover up of pizzagate. That tells me we only have an illusion of independent journalism in this country. Then you look back to the events of recent history and you question when else have they lied to us?

              Everything....the entire 20th Century has been one big fucking con job......Jews took over Fed Reserve...then did the bubble and crashed the market in 29  to buy everyones stocks for pennies on the dollar......look at the movie the Rothschilds made about themeselves.....look at the ending.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaHtxlSDgbk&amp;t=1861s   the Jews fund both sides of the Napoleanic War.....then they have spies on the battle field of Waterloo....they see Britian wins the battle...their spy gets the information back to them in London a whole day ahead of the British Military.....so what does the greedy Jew do?  Does he tell everyone and have a party his side won?   NO the damn greedy bastard tells the stock market that Napolean won the battle and England is dooomed......the market crashes...looses 96% of its  value.....people all over england go bankrupt and loose all their life savings....and this greedy Rothschild then steps in and buys up all the stocks on pennies on the dollar.....and in one fell swoop he goes from owning from about 10% of Englands GNP to 50%.  And the snickering bastards are so proud of their cheating they finance a whole movie about them......watch it...its free....on Youtube...The House of Rothschild....watch it...they made it themselves....

               This all goes back to Sabbatai Zevi who was actually the master of Adam Weishaupt and de Rothschild before they were big names. The Sabbatean-Frankist cult is behind this, what Zevi believed was "getting closer to god by breaking every rule" and he basically split Judaism over it. His long term goal was to reclaim Israel, which the Jews were cursed to never attempt again.... So it really explains how he started the seeds of Zionism. Everything started in 1666....

                 Awesome!! I am glad someone took the time to watch it.  All the info is out there, we just have to find the truth ourselves!!

                 There is another video that was recommended that looks similar, I have not gotten a chance to watch it yet (over 6 hours!)...

              This is very true and not just the media from one country but internationally too. That's a very disturbing thing to come to realize because it suggests that we live not just in a time of cover-ups and false stories but a true alternate reality that is manufactured for us. I don't like it one bit and would very much like to do something about it.

            On the History Channel on June 25, 2001 the World Trade Center Project Manager said the Twin Towers were designed to have a Fully Loaded Boeing 707 crash into it. He even said the building's exo-structure could take multiple 707 hits.

            Yeah right.."debunked".  Sandy Hook was one that really opened my eyes.  They lie.  They lie big time and there's a lot of them about.  Wolfgang Halbig continues his pursuit of Justice.  Sickening.

               Seasons, GPS, satellites, world travel, and the rest of the solar system do suggest the Earth is indeed spherical.

               But you know what, short of funding your trip to the 'Ice Wall', can you tell me one solid reason WHY it would be important to lie about the shape of the planet/plane???  What difference would it make, as opposed to Pizzagate, where we are trying to remove treasonous, blackmailed politicians from positions of power, and stop/prevent the sexual abuse of children?

                 What proof do you have that video is not computer-generated or touched up?  Since that is what you accuse NASA of doing (for good reason, granted)?
You know the satellites are at 160km and this video is allegedly from 40km up?  That is a big difference, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever seen a  3m object from 120km?  I am not sure I have.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But more importantly, my one question to you was: Why is it important to lie to people about flat earth (conversely why is it important for you to 'expose the round Earth hoax')?  Thats all I want to know.  What will change in the world if people were to 'admit' the Earth is a 'plane'?  Would it change the way airplanes fly from one location to another?  The way ships sail?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I mean, with the Moon Landing hoax we learned about the unspeakable acts America was covering up, in its international drug trafficking and genocide, so it exposed the lengths those in power will go to mislead.  What additional revelation does acknowledging 'flat Earth' provide?  Or none?

                   But NASA's budget being diverted to other purposes than they publicly state is not contingent on telling the public the Earth is a globe.   Say the Earth was flat, couldn't NASA just say "We need $20 billion dollars annually to study the infinite plane, the dome, and the Ice Wall"?  And then fake the images of those, pocketing the money, just as they do currently?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Isn't it more likely that there are people in the Intelligence agencies seeking to discredit 'conspiracy theories', and use bogus but seemingly plausiable 'conspiracy theories' to mislead and misdirect people?  Something along the lines of "For a study in gullibility and persuasion, we want to see if we can convince people of absolutely anything, for e.g. that they live on a flat Earth".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Why else would 'flat Earth' be prominently promoted on Youtube?  Does that make sense for something that is supposedly being 'covered up'?  That even without searching for it, YT promotes FE videos to people?

             So-called "David Wheeler" showed up as an actor in several other events. Some investigators make a specialty of just studying that spook. It would be funny, how blatant it is, if it wasn't so scary - not only for how sick the perps are but  for the millions upon tens of millions of citizens who are financing this by their payments to those who own and mock them.

              Look into the Medical Examiner on the scene; that will really blow your mind.. 100% Fraud. I guess he sold his free house [more houses sold for 0$ as with "Pizza St. ] and moved to Florida.

              " the whole State of Connecticut is corrupt. The U.S. Justice Department and FBI have totally sold out on this because all this would be a cake walk for them to confirm but they choose silence. It is just not believeable they do not know all this and even monitor these comments. I would bet some one of them is reading this right now. Even the "distinguished" Henry Lee, Ph.D., former top medical examiner and crime scene investigator for Connecticut has suddenly clammed up too. Now think of all the honest medical examiners, pathologists with M.D. degrees, and other crime scene investigators throughout the nation and world who have also clammed up on this. The whole thing is like an Agatha Christy Novel in spades. Almost every normal investigative source is totally compromised to hide the truth. How could they get away with this? How could second rate criminals like this accomplish such a feat for relatively small gain? Why are so many authorities going so far to hide their criminal conduct? I don't get it, do you? Many people involved have also mysteriously died or disappeared. Wolfgang has been muzzled. James Tracy has been fired. Nothing has happened to any of the perps. This is astounding. Is there something even more sinister going on here that is behind all this totally criminal conduct by our government at so many levels? I have also never heard a peep from the normally big mouth of Trump on this either."
