<p>Relevance: One of the key points of the Cannibal Elite’s agenda is to destroy the next generation. The easiest and most proven way to do this is through child molestation and ritual abuse.

Gender identity is one of key features of a healthy personality, so it is being targeted through social engineering.

This sets forth many advantages for the Cannibal Elite’s war for dominion of the world. For one, it eschews the notion of a God-given identity in dismissing biological functioning as elements we’ve “assigned” instead of inherited from Our Father.

<p>This post is dedicated to the aforementioned theory that this is being played out by members of the PedoWood community in participating and fostering this diabolical scheme. Members of this cabal are sacrificing their own children to set forth the illusion that “gender choice” is a just cause and not suicide to our promising youth. And the victims chosen are positioned to be role models for other children—and parents – to follow. This is what I allege is happening to Shiloh Pitt and the deconstruction is happening before our eyes.  
</p>
<p>I’ve grown increasingly alarmed by the images of Shiloh Pitt splattered across the pages of glossy magazines and uber sophisticated websites. Since infancy, the media has glibly portrayed this child as some sort of vanguard of a movement and the torchbearer for transgenders everywhere. But the fact that that toddler was dressed in boy’s clothing is an unanswered question and not a solution. How did this little girl get to be disguised by what she’s not? And why is she being lauded for being confused and psychologically unsound if this was her choice? I suppose I draw a lot of my opinions on what’s taking place on the incestuous adultress Luciferian whore raising her. If it was another she-wolf and not the cosmetically-enhanced alcoholic shell that Shiloh is cursed with as a mother, I might not think there’s a hand behind the curtain pulling the skeleton’s strings. Since I had some time, I went dumpster diving – just to satisfy my own speculation on what is occurring, and folks, it’s worse than I ever thought it could be. Stringing together the clues sent a chill up my spine and left me distraught as to how such abuse could play out in the media without anyone interfering and preventing the crime that took place. My mind insisted I do something for this child, so this is me fighting for Shiloh and shouting for someone to help. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first dove in the dumpster, I thought the main focus would be on this cross-dressing thing going on in Shiloh’s life. This first article I’m posting is a prime example. Note that this one had a News Director from Life and Style Magazine that questioned WTF happened to Shiloh, and a psychiatrist that just glibly glosses over everything in an effort to normalize the deconstruction of a tender soul. She even sets to stage for parents to “follow their child’s lead”, adding that kids know what’s best for them and if you don’t go along with what they want, it’s a rejection and proof you don’t love them. The advice is poison that can only lead to catastrophic end because nothing is mentioned about setting boundaries. If parents don’t set boundaries, it’s a guaranteed recipe for disaster. </p>

<p>A couple things in the video need to be highlighted because they’ll come into play. One is that the “transformation” happened after the family returned from a trip from France. Shiloh is THREE. The other is that everyone at the magazine was SHOCKED by the change in appearance. In other words, normal people not in this game to normalize and spread an agenda are SHOCKED that parents would deliberately turn their beautiful little girl into a boy. The cover for this happening is that Shiloh CHOSE to be a boy, but was it a three-year-old that initiated the change? Were Whoreangelina and lush Brad following Shiloh’s lead? From the article: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jenner didn\'t find Shiloh\'s \'do hair-raising either, and she says a Shiloh by any other name is no cause for alarm. &quot;I\'m not concerned about Shiloh being called John, as she probably chose it herself,&quot; Jenner adds. </p>
<p>Regarding the haircut, Jenner says: &quot;I think it\'s still girlie, it\'s not shaved back and sides like a boy\'s cut. And who knows, perhaps she cut a chunk out of her own hair and her parents had to cut it shorter to fix it. Children do it all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet another photo shows Shiloh sans hat, with her formerly girlish blonde locks cut (allegedly by Shiloh herself with safety scissors) into a short, boyish style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is! The allegation that Shiloh cut her own hair, but did someone see the greater part of the iceberg buried in the propaganda. It’s this: </p>
<h1>&quot;I\'m not concerned about Shiloh being called John, as she probably chose it herself</h1>
<p>WTF does she mean that she’s not concerned with Shiloh wanting to be called JOHN?!!!! Her name is SHILOH!!! Houston, we have a problem!!!! A HUGE problem! It signals a disassociative state! Any health care professional should know this! Any parent should be aware that it raises red flags! But let’s hear what Whoreangelina and Lush Pitt have to say: </p>

<p>“She only wants to be called John,” Pitt told Oprah Winfrey in a 2008 appearance on her show. “John or Peter, so it’s a Peter Pan thing. So, we’ve got to call her John.” ‘Shi, do you want -’ ‘John. I’m John.’ And then I’ll say, ‘John would you like some orange juice?’ And she goes, ‘No!’ So, you know, it’s just kind of stuff that’s cute to parents, and it’s probably really obnoxious to other people.”
Two years later, Life &amp; Style magazine ran a cover story asking, “Why is Angelina Turning Shiloh into a Boy?” 
Jolie told Vanity Fair in a 2010 interview that Shiloh has been exploring her identity since the age of three. “She wants to be a boy,” Jolie said. “So we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boys’ everything. She thinks she’s one of the brothers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I thought Shiloh cut her hair with safety scissors? Now Whoreangelina is stating that “we” had to cut her hair. And no one is majorly concerned about a three-year-old insisting on being called John? Why? Yes, children pretend, but parents usually put a boundary up and only call them the pretend name when they’re playing or in costume. They tell the child that they can’t use their pretend name any other time. And, naturally, it would be Oprah where this info was leaked. The NWO shill Oprah makes everything right. </p>

<h1>Is It Weird for Shiloh to Lose a Tooth at Age 3?</h1>
<p>Why is little Shiloh losing her teeth when she\'s only 3? I can see why Pax is, but not Shiloh.
—MamaMe, via the Answer B!tch inbox</p>
<p>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have not—shocker!—issued a press release answering questions raised by photos of their daughter Shiloh Nouvel\'s gappy smile this week. But according to pediatricians, the front tooth loss experienced by 5-year-old Pax is within the scope of normal, but 3-year-olds? Not so much, I\'m told.
It is explainable, just not common. So what\'s going on inside the Jolie-Pitt household? Read on, and decide for yourself...

             Absolutely. And I did find more on that magic age of three. It is important to the Illuminati.

             I also found an article about Brad after the divorce. He comes out and says that Angelina cut Shiloh's hair.

            Angelina Jolie used to frequent a satanic church in West Hollywood in the late 80's and 90's. The 'attendees' would do things like surround and laugh at children brought there, point at them, and yell obscenities at these young kids. They would then escalate to more violent torture like using pins to draw blood and putting pins under fingernails, pulling hair, stepping on them, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, fast forward to recently and Jolie has hooked up with Brad Pitt.
           </p>
           <p>
            How did Jolie end up with Pitt, one of the most 'sexy' men in Hollywood? Was he 'awarded' to her?
Also, even more curiously, Pitt supposedly developed a curious disorder called ' facial blindness,' which prevents him from remembering peoples faces. Yup.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The 49-year-old actor says he has developed facial blindness, where after meeting and engaging with someone, that person's face disappears from his memory as soon as they walk away. If they ever come in contact again, to him, it's like meeting an entirely new person.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

           <p>
            How convenient. What 'faces' did they need him to conveniently forget? Was this recent condition 'given' to him through hypnosis / trauma?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's been apparent Pitt and Jolie never really got along and that there is more going on ... 
The kids ... my theory was they adopted kids from countries they wanted 'access' to. Cambodia is a big trafficking hub (human/drugs). Any trips there by Jolie and company just appear to be 'family trips' to the kids home country.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wouldn't be surprised if the kids were a big experiment for Jolie. She's tortured children for decades. These kids are a culmination to her and the cults experiments? She is a fucking evil bitch. Period.

             Freakin' thanks! UpVoat for this. Wish I could give more than one.
            </p>
            <p>
             You don't happen to know the name of the church in West LA, do you? Would love to dig into that a little more.
            </p>
            <p>
             Absolutely, Pitt was a reward. In that video I posted where she admits to be a Satanist and a participant in S&amp;M rituals, she admits that for active membership and loyalty that members are rewarded with blackmail. This blackmail can be used how they see fit. Therefore, they gain advantage and control over someone and gain power as they gather this more and more. I believe she had something on Pitt. He wasn't there out of love for her. He couldn't stand her by all accounts ... and do you blame him? He drank/she drank. I remember one housekeeper talking too much and saying all they did was drink, and that no one went near the children. The kids were left on their own. And Whoreangelina? She stayed in the shower and cried and cried in the evenings. Yup! Perfect adoptive parents.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for validating this. I can see the effects of her twisted personality on these children. Shame they can't talk and tell someone what is going on. As for Pitt, definitely seems like a hypnotic/mind control thing. Could be from too much trauma. There's got to be ramifications for allowing abuse of your daughters ... if he wasn't actively involved himself. But Shiloh chose her father to live with. Good choice, Shiloh! Of course, the media glossed over it, but yeah, I don't blame her from getting away from that sick, sick, twisted bitch. 
Here's the fluff piece. No mention of ritual abuse.

              I don't but I can try to find it. Often times they just rent out regular churches (I know) or community centers.

              Brad Pitt was always a hot commodity in Hollywood. I actually feel bad for him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yeah, seems like that she was running those kids back and forth on trips. Hard for kids to form relationships with anyone like that. From the outside it looks like they have it made, when in reality they are treated like commodities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Notice how Jolie hasn't had any big movies lately... but she did have a run of big Hollywood hits before.
             </p>
             <p>
              Her role in Maleficient is a pretty good depiction of what she is really like... she wasn't acting.
On her IMDB page, her quote is: "There's certainly a side of me that isn't completely... sane. Or completely 'even' all the time. We all have our dark sides."

               Thanks. So the church isn't a fixed presence. I say this because there is the Satanic Temple in LA.
              </p>
              <p>
               Brad is bought and sold. He had to stay married to that shrew for how long? Must have been hell. Nothing worse than living a lie. And I just mentioned in another reply that he absolutely said that Angelina cut Shiloh's hair. He said it AFTER the divorce. If he is the more innocent one in this situation, it had to have been hard to sacrifice a daughter like that. She had to go through a lot of psychological shit because of the abuse. Plus he can't be innocent of this He had to be a member also or why would he be being blackmailed and passed around?
              </p>
              <p>
               I remember a few notable stars getting the hell out of PedoWood. Has to be a rough place to live and stay out of that shit. I would imagine temptations are constantly thrown in non-members paths to get them over to the dark side. Pathetic really.

                The thing is, they ensnare innocent people all the time.
               </p>
               <p>
                They can blackmail a variety of ways...
They use women who don't seem to have an agenda... who lure the guys into rooms with hidden cameras. Now even if the man was single, who in their right mind wants that video out in the public?
               </p>
               <p>
                Another way is they drug people without them even knowing it. Once your drugged they can do almost anything, capture compromising photos, videos, etc.
               </p>
               <p>
                I've had people threaten to file frivolous lawsuits against me for 'falling' on my property just to get me 'beholden' to them, racked up with attorneys fees etc.
They have 1001+ ways to blackmail or get a person beholden to them, it does not only happen to those that are willingly evil.
The easiest way Pedowood does it is have the star around 'questionable or illegal activity' they think is part of the movie, which ends up being
                <em>
                 surprise
                </em>
                another way to blackmail the star.

              So why, dental stuff? Not sure, but it could be that it gives them an avenue to drug the children (anesthetic for tooth procedure). I knew a pedophile that would have their victims go to a certain dentist who would put them under anesthesia and then 'deliver' them to the pedophile.

               Those poor kids. I tell you my heart goes out to them, and there is something that someone told me a long time ago. Dude was into satanism, and that's all I'll say. he probably opened up a bit too much because he told me they were required to have a tooth pulled as a test that they were sincere. He showed me a back tooth they'd ripped out. So whether they were initiating her, or just terrorizing her, I don't know. I'm leaning towards both. I mean, her brother had his tooth out so they matched and looked alike. Then there was her appearance drastically changing. Then there's the lesson that she's nothing and that these people had total control over her. Now this is a three-year-old kid. How would she process that? Well, her mind would be open to her identity being switched/transferred to this male alter ego. It's that simple and that diabolical.

                Yes, it seems they like to target very young children. I could never really figure out why I was targeted and tortured so young, but now things make more sense than ever.
               </p>
               <p>
                The tooth thing never happened to me (or did it? I can't remember if it did.) But I was always threatened with pliers and told they would pull out my teeth one by one if I didn't go along with the program.
               </p>
               <p>
                The alter ego thing is very real. Through torture at a young age, they seek to break bonds with parents and friends, and establish a 'Stockholm syndrome' where the victim is in a helpless state and supports their torturer. The name of the game is control, and they seek total control of their victims.

            What is wrong with the name Shiloh anyway.  It could be either or, right?  This is completely nuts AND sick.  The Trauma the child gets to lost her teeth (I refuse to call her he) is from her Stupid Parents.  They are surely being paid for this Claptrap.  This is Disgusting At Best.  Not only do we have to contend with these Idiot Stars they will be foisting their Damaged Children on us.  Poor Little Shiloh.  Pray for her.

             Exactly. Shiloah is a boy's or a girl's name. The fact SHE became fixated on the name John had to do with Peter Pan. My own theory: if a child undergoes indoctrination to get them to bond with say Peter Pan, they're being programmed to be a boy ... a certain type of boy. But if a girl is programmed to like the more feminine Disney archetypes, and Alice in Wonderland, they stay feminine ... maybe even become hypersexual sex kittens.

             Sick stuff. I couldn't believe when I was doing that research.

              Here we go again.  I have to say this more often than I want.  The stuff we read from day to day does turn our stomachs.   Peter Pan Alice in Wonderland.  Little did we know.  We thought it was all innocent Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales.  Pedo-Tales.

               I know. But you know, it's good we did. It shows our innocence. For someone to make insidious games out of these tales, they have to be projecting their hearts onto the material -- and their hearts are not innocent like ours.

                Yes, sometimes I wish I could turn back the clock and pretend this never happened.  But then I would now know what cruel things they are perpetrating.  Better to know.

                  That's the problem though.  History seems to repeat itself with new generations.  Young people don't listen to the old and the old die off.   Hopefully people are waking.

                    They don't listen like we did.  I did not listen early on that much, but later I did in my 30s and 40s.  I listened to my Mother, she is a great teacher.  She is Our Angel.  She is 90.
