<p>&quot;<em>I want you to have before it comes out in the media and courts this coming Spring 2018. It is a major criminal and civil action filed by the wife of a big California Republican politician.  It will involve #1 #2, #3, and others.  This is very real.  I\'ve gotten permission to share this, but I\'m not allowed to share the name of the woman or her husband yet. I was told I can share that with you a month prior to their filing going public.

<p>The woman who is filing the legal action was raped by Henley at the age of 15. The larger picture is filled in for people to solve here:</p>

<p>Henley was ID\'ed very quickly, as the blind gives out clues that are widely known and have even been published in the MSM (with details about the 16-year-old girl whitewashed, and the 15-year-old left out completely.)</p>

            I'm really surprised this was allowed to be leaked in any form -- why would she tip her hand after decades? She's not (yet) afforded the relative safety of a white hot spotlight, and everyone involved knows exactly who's involved. I pray for the safety of this woman and her family.

            I'll believe it when the victim speaks out.  Henley is an asshole, and everyone knows it.  But whether she comes forward is another issue:

            Hombre. I hope this woman stays safe!
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It's hard to know what the best approach to the identity of her and her husband. Publicity might help keep them safe, but the Clintons have had people with a very high public profile killed, more than most Deep State politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            In some cases it may have helped, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            One example is Monica Lewinsky. She was terrified after a threat by Bill Clinton, and by the murder of White House intern Mary Caitrin Mahoney:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.wnd.com/1998/10/1218/">
             http://www.wnd.com/1998/10/1218/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.myforrestgumplife.com/mary_mahoney_murder.html">
             http://www.myforrestgumplife.com/mary_mahoney_murder.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Linda Tripp said the reason she decided to publicize Monica Lewinsky's affair with Clinton was to get her in the glare of publicity so high that a murder would be out of the question, and it seemed to work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Murder is less frequent, and tends to be done on less high-profile types, in the entertainment industry, but it does happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe keeping their identities quiet is the way to go, to avoid tipping off Henley and his enablers and to avoid stirring up the nest of bees, or maybe publicity is the way to go.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't have any answers. Does anyone else?

            What was the documentary made by a professor on runaways exploited for sex trade? This blind reminded me of him, but I cannot remember his name or movie. There was a YouTube round table on him from the 1980s.

             Maybe the Dude in Big Leboski was trying to warn us when he said he hated the eagles man-- they play Hotel California introducing the Jesus character who's shown to be a pedo-- some clear political subtext is certainly happening in the film,

               There is a stark contrast between the minority of dark arts masons that have control right now and what I would call "builder Masons." Builder Masons try to build things up instead of tear down and destroy. I think Trump is a builder Mason and I just do not see the dark art Mason signs in Trump's history. He has some gangster affiliations but he is not a destroyer in my opinion.

              Best way to think of it is, the Hollywood cabal chooses who they make a "star" and who they market. It takes millions to market a celebrity and make them a "star." So they choose only those that fit their agenda... that's why so many are involved in that stuff.
Hollywood is a very, very small industry. Everyone knows everyone, only a few companies run everything. Hollywood is financed by illicit activities.

                It is a big avenue of revenue for Hollywood. It won't kill it off, but it's a start.

               <p>
                I think the absolute scale of the illicit Hollywood money moving through the American and world economy is staggering. They have in a way taken over the American economy, many sectors, decades of infiltrating ... embedding themselves in the world and American economy.

                Street level dealers and child porn rings raising money for upcoming movie projects for Directors and movie production companies all over. Top players get invested, don't want to lose their stake and keep it all quiet.

             I've been following developments in the Ronni Chasen murder case. David Snowden Beveryly Hills Police Chief blamed a patsy even though major media sources and witnesses said it was very obviously a pro hit.

             Did not know at that same time period then Los Angeles City Mayor Villaraigosa was being investigated for ethics violations. He got away with a small fine.

             "Ooooh, I like the Mayor McPuto-raigosa guess! He’s literally the most pathetic little rat fuck rodent and was a cholo gang banger in his youth."

              For any (like me) who need a primer on the Ronni Chasen murder, Hollywood Reporter did a decent summary, published on the anniversary of her death last year:
              <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/what-happened-night-hollywood-power-publicist-ronni-chasen-was-killed-947580">
               https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/what-happened-night-hollywood-power-publicist-ronni-chasen-was-killed-947580
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Interesting to see who shows up randomly in the storyline and pictures. Mark Ruffalo's brother, a Hollywood hairdresser, is one of the few unsolved murders of BHPD.

                Yes I contributed a lot of research to that DL thread. Especially the info on how Ronni Chasen was killed and the possible motives.
               </p>
               <p>
                Periodically a poster on DL will bring up her murder on new threads re which unsolved murders haunt you the most. Always the answer is the same. That is too many powerful people want the specific circumstances of her murder squelched. They definitely do not want it solved.

              I always found the Ronni Chasen case intriguing because we all love Hollywood gossip and also all the recently pedo directors and stories. I think her ties to the "rat rodent" LOL are the best yet. Please share and continue to contribute. I think a lot of people around the world were obsessed with this story from what I read on other forums.

               Must ad on DataLounge (40% of us are straight females) focus was placed on works of art used as an investment. One can lend the art to museums for prestige honors and a tax write off. Issue is it's a business fraught with forgeries. Hard to tell the difference at times. However when one discovers they bought art claimed to be an original, and it's not, all Hell breaks loose.
              </p>
              <p>
               Never connected the art to pizzagate as I assumed they were always talking about museum quality works.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also consider that Ronni was murdered in such a way as to send a message to others.
