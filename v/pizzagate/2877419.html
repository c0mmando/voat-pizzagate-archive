            Harrah was a manager of child actors and a former child actor himself who’d been a long-time member of the SAG Young Performers Committee, which he co-founded in 1975 and chaired from 2001-2003.   An Open Secret's Amy Berg interviewed Harrah at SAG union’s offices in Hollywood on March 26, 2014. He abruptly resigned from the committee a few days later.
           </p>
           <p>
            Harrah had questionable relations with some of the child actors he once represented; some of them even lived with him at his home. During the interview, Berg asked him if he is “attracted to young boys.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Joey Coleman, a former child actor who was once Harrah’s client, presents a taped phone conversation in An Open Secret that  in which Harrah acknowledges that he’d made “unwanted” advances towards him when Coleman was a kid.
“I didn’t like when you tried to have me sleep in your bed and touch me and everything,” Coleman told Harrah on the phone. “I hated that.”   “Yeah, and that was something unwanted I shouldn’t have done,” Harrah replied, unaware that he was being taped. “And there’s no way you can undo that. But it certainly is something I shouldn’t have done.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Harrah  is a single man, has never been married, and works with children. He said, "I do not believe that I have ever harmed anyone.”   Harrah had boys between the ages of 10 and 17 living with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Harrah says that he had been molested when he was a child, but was vague about the details. “I suppose somebody did, but I would be hard-pressed to remember anything specific,” he said. “But it was not uncommon, let’s put it that way.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In An Open Secret, Harrah attempts to explain how child molesters are sometimes misunderstood. “So much of what goes on in these situations happen almost by accident,” he said
           </p>
           <p>
            Harrah says he gives this advice to children who have been molested: “Where I’ve had the opportunity to talk to someone about it and said, ‘Look, this is not a terrible thing unless you think it is. It’s just something that happens to you in your life.’ ”
           </p>
           <p>
            Harrah admitted that he had not complied with California’s Child Performers Protection Act, which requires criminal background checks on managers, publicists and photographers who have unsupervised access to young performers.
           </p>
           <p>
            SAG threatened to sue the producers of An Open Secret.  SAG &amp; SAG-AFTRA are protecting their pedo mates.

            WOW.  You are surely correct.  There is a concerted effort to keep info about Phillip Linton off the internet.  I did find this but don't know if this Morgan Linton is related.  But the coincidences about where he works and connections, well you decide.  He has connections to Dreamworks  and worked as an intern there and he mentions Steven Spielberg.   Very interesting article.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://medium.com/@morganlinton/from-engineer-to-unpaid-dreamworks-intern-640e9a3e3daf">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            My internship was in the story department at Dreamworks which was located on the Amblin lot. This is the same location that Steven Spielberg works out of which means that yes I did pass him in the hallway from time-to-time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Never stop Steven in the hallway to talk to him, pass him a script, or just tell him he’s awesome. Apparently people had done this before and been fired for doing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still looking for connection for Morgan's connection to Phillip.

             Side note on the Goonies if you watch the special features they have all the kids as adults doing a commentary and they talk about the special van that was on set.  Very weird and creepy. Also of note Sean Astin starts to say thank you to Cindi Lauper for something when he is stopped and pulled out of the room.  There is video footage of the commentary.  Check it out.

              Someone brought up that Goonies Van and wondered what happened to it.  I wonder what happened in it.  Maybe it's on Spielberg's property as a good luck charm.

               I don't know but that sent my alarm bells up right away. I really wish they would have let Sean Astin finish what he was saying about Cindi Lauper though.  I wonder what that was all about. How did she help him??

              Doing Time on Maple Drive was an amazing movie that they didn't do hardly any PR for- which was weird bc it was Jim Careys first dramactic performance which was truly great.  Wonder if that is why???

                I feel the same way now. That was when he was at the top of his game.  i don't go to movies at all anymore now that I know about all the abuse the children have been going through.  It makes me sick. I used to be a huge movie person.  I even with to film school and tv and film editing in Burbank CA.  I could never work in that industry now.

                 Boy, just think how we thought things were and what we know now.  I just wonder if movies have dropped off.  Wonder if they lie about their cash intake.  Possibly they make so much money on trafficking they can fudge the numbers.  There must be so many people that don't go now after being awake.

              AIDS can cause cancer, by shutting down the immune systems ability to kill off tumor cells.
             </p>
             <p>
              AIDS typically kills its victims via unstoppable infections as a result of T Helper cells (ie the generals of the immune system army).

               That is so good to know.  I was reading today about Michael Landon dying of Cancer but I also heard he had Aids.  This is good information.  Thank You.  Of course they would call it Cancer and not mention Aids.  Landon was also abused I believe.

                Kinda interesting off topic a little side note on Micheal Landon is some of the Indians (I'm part Cherokee) in Oklahoma are convinced his family killed him bc they reached out to him to try to offer their medical (Indian) treatment when he was ill and they blew them off.

                 That would not surprise me after all the things we read from day to day.  I looked up Victor French who had a long playing part on Little House and they went on and on in his wiki how he and Landon were the best of friends.  They were in 3 shows together.  I got the impression that they were lovers for many years.  There definitely was something going on.  You should read his wiki.  Anyway in Landon's wiki it hardly even mentions French at all.  A small blurb.  Very telling.

                  Hmm that is interesting bc I remember seeing them in a lot of stuff together.  Yeah I am old.  Indian medicine is interesting and I have found they have helped me way better in some ways than modern medicine but some things not so much so who knows if they could have helped him.  But I think if I had a deadly disease I would try their way first.

                   What they put us through nowadays is enough to kill us.  If we don't die from the disease we die from the cure.

             Yes, I went to SAG after I was put on some kind of list and blacklisted as an actor. All because i wanted to know what my ex wife was up to and who had threatened to hurt my 4 year old son if he talked to me. 23 years later, still, no answers. My children stolen and career destroyed. Hollywood protects the creeps, as does ACTRA in Canada. Sadly agents all go along with it as they want their actors to keep getting work. Someone like me, disposable. In Canada, watch out for Lesa Kirk, Jerry Jordan(Jordan and Associates) and Susan Glenn from Glenn Talent. Easier to destroy my life and career than come clean.

            They should be scared.  You especially have been relentless regarding the horrid murders of Heather O'Rourke and Judith Barsi.  I don't know Linton or Harrah.  Don't watch tv or movies much.  But I am ready to dig.   I know others will too. UpVoat as always.

             "Perhaps our lawmakers can find some way to preserve Safe Harbor, assuage the talent agents, protect the actors and still rein in the renegade managers. The Screen Actors Guild certainly hopes so, as do many personal managers who are appalled at the way in which some of our colleagues seem to have hijacked our profession.
