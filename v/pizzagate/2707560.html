<p>I was re-reading David McGowan\'s <em>Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder</em> (Part 1 of the book entitled \'The Pedophocracy\' details among other things, the Dutroux scandal in Belgium and the Franklin &amp; McMartin Preschool cases in the U.S. and while it can be found online as a standalone essay, the book in its entirety will be in the link below) I came to chapter 5 which detailed the Country Walk Babysitting Service operating in the Country Walk housing development in Dade County, Florida back in 1984.  The management company responsible for this housing development was Arvida, a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company.  Country Walk Babysitting Service was a front for child sexual abuse and child pornography production.  There appears to have been collusion with authorities in operation as well, as the operator of the &quot;babysitting service&quot;, Francisco Fuster Escalona, a.k.a. Frank Fuster (he ran the child abuse/porn ring with his underage wife Iliana), despite being a convicted murderer/child molester on probation for the latter crime, was allowed to set up this business which violated the terms of his probation by brining him into unsupervised contact with children.  Fuster\'s probation officer also had no problem with the fact that he self terminated his court ordered psychiatric treatment in August 1983.  When allegations of child abuse were made, police responded slowly and sceptically, allowing Fuster to dispose of/destroy a great deal of physical evidence.  Similar to the McMartin Prescool case, the parents seeking justice for their abused and exploited children were subjected to anonymous harassment and death threats.  Indeed, the parents might never have received any measure of justice were it not for the fact that many of them were law enforcement officials themselves.  Fuster was sentenced to over 100 years imprisonment and Arvida/Walt Disney Company, despite maintaining that Fuster\'s &quot;babysitting service&quot; was not connected to them, paid $6 million in compensation to seven of the victims.</p>

             I recently read in Dave McGowan's
             <em>
              Weird Scenes Inside The Canyon
             </em>
             of how Jack Nicholson bought up neighbour Marlon Brando's property when Brando passed away, then immediately had the site bulldozed, supposedly because it was structurally unsound.  McGowan was at a loss to explain how someone who could afford to buy their own Polynesian island was living in a derelict property...

            Is it any wonder that a lot of "ex priests" settle in Florida? One of them mentioned in the 2018 Penn Grand Jury report on diocesian child abuse drove the train for 15 years at DisneyWorld after he "retired" from the priesthood.

            Dutreaux Affair

            When little girls started disappearing last year, police questioned Dutroux--after a lapse of some months. They searched his house three times and said they found nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time, two 8-year-old girls were dying in Dutroux's cellar prison and a police officer heard them calling out. But he said he thought the cries came from a neighboring house.
           </p>
           <p>
            Was this a case of incompetence on an almost unimaginable scale, or did Dutroux enjoy police protection?
           </p>
           <p>
            With four children and young women known dead, two rescued and 10 missing, the question is convulsing Belgian society as a parliamentary inquiry begins into police handling of the case.
           </p>

            It was only a little more than a year ago that 350,000 people, a huge assembly for a nation of 10 million, marched in silence through the streets of Brussels to express their anger and outrage over another case: the official bungling and possible high-level cover-up in the investigation of kidnappings of a number of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Too late, the bodies of four girls who had been abducted and sexually abused were found in jury-rigged dungeons in the southern city of Charleroi. Marc Dutroux, a 40-year-old unemployed electrician who had already been to prison for kidnap and rape of minors, and his schoolteacher wife and convicted accomplice in the earlier crimes were charged in the deaths.
           </p>
           <p>
            A parliamentary inquiry into the Dutroux affair found numerous instances of institutional bungling and corruption and concluded that police and judicial agencies failed so abjectly as to "put at risk the state of law."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Corruption and spinelessness are eternal," Hugo Claus, this country's most celebrated Flemish-language writer, said in a recent newspaper interview. "Stupidity and mediocrity accompany our existence. And in Belgium, this is amplified."

              I agree.  That is why they tried so hard to bury the truth.  We must keep papers and books for we can pass them on, they can scrub the internet.  That is why they have gotten rid of some libraries in schools and cut funding.  I notice in these two articles that there is favor in the truth towards the children, not so much nowadays.  Nowadays they are trying to make us believe these children made up the stories.  Very sad indeed. Yes it is haunting.  I too believe that a possible ring could exist. High Level.

             Regina Louf a survivor of absolutely the worst, most heinous and vile abuse I’ve stumbled upon, wrote a book which ties in directly to the Dutreaux Affair. She was ritually abused from a generational family. I could not comprehend a grandmother doing the shit she did to a baby and onwards. She was taken over and over to be raped, tortured unimaginably and horribly beaten and abused as a little child to people in high places, including at the Chateau de Amerois the mothers of darkness castle where politicians, UN and royalty were present for the child parties. I won’t go into details but she is very brave. These people were all through the police, politicians, doctors, everywhere in Belgium all satanic, luciferian, freemasonic evil dark people. Interesting to note that at one point she said that the women were often worse than the men. The owners of the castle were the pharmaceutical giants who made antidepressants and other mind altering drugs. MK ultra was said to have been practiced there, as well as up to one hundred young children in the basement dungeon kept in cages whenever needed. It all sounds far fetched and unbelievable but after really researching it a while back and references made in court docs and victims testimonies I believe it to be true. They had some kind of alter that rituals took place under “one thousand points of light” and I recall reading that a child was sacrificed every evening (no proof of this point but it was mentioned). Some of these sick bastards really enjoyed very young pregnant girls and tortured them during pregnancy and especially during birth. Apparently this castle was scrubbed from gxxgle maps and when called out it magically appeared back on it. The castle is also no longer dubbed the mothers of darkness castle meaning where they did their magick and rituals. The mother of darkness was moved to another castle. Sick beyond belief this happens.

              IMO, Regina Louf is a credible witness. The policemen who first had conversations with her believed her (they were later removed from the case).
             </p>
             <p>
              She was able to describe one of the houses where abuse had taken place in detail - the house had a very complicated architecture, so nobody who wouldn't have been there in person would have been able to describe it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I feel it is always good to go back to the Dutroux case, and read about it, because it has all the 'classic' elements of elite pedophilia and satanism, and shows how these groups work.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a great 45 min. video I'd recommend watching:

             </p>
             <p>
              It shows how the white hats in Belgium tried to look into the case, but were all removed.

               I believe Regina, too. And to me one of the saddest cases is that of Manuel Schadwald. Not nearly as much info on him as with Regina but enough to break your heart and, again, the story about him is believable. Has ties to the Stasi and Amsterdam.

            Hi Podge. Could you add the titles of your previous posts, so people know what they are specifically  referencing (per Rule 3: "EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post (except when markup is used to embed links in the specific text they support).")? Thanks.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Also, I wonder if anyone could look up back issues of newspapers talking about these crimes back in the day? That would be a great optional addition to this post and corroborate what the guy says in his book.

             Suggestion: You might want to consider breaking the text into paragraphs, it will be easier to read then. ;-)

            I've had enough of people not wanting to believe that Disney was not an evil person.  I was one of those before swallowing the Big Red Pill.

            Read about the relationship Walt Disney had with Bobby Driscoll.  Bobby was his love until he was 12.  Then he dropped him like a hot potato.  Too old.

             One of the cutaway gags in an episode of Family Guy depicted Walt Disney forcing Minnie Mouse to pose nude whilst he painted her.  I wonder if that was an allusion to Disney's paedophilia, given all the other little nudges and winks Family Guy has contained.

              Wow.  I am shocked any show outed Disney.  They mostly all stick together when it comes to supporting each other's pedo activities.  Minnie Mouse Porn?  Disgusting for Our Children.  Shame on Walt Disney.
