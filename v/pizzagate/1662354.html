           <h2>
            A discussion thread dedicated to exposing Instagram underage inappropriateness.
           </h2>
           <p>
            Today I was flicking through Instagram posts, stopped at a picture showing a woman's lips, with eyelids glued onto them and makeup to make them look like an eyeball, pretty weird visually, whatever, I am not disturbed by simply weird stuff, but this image made me stop and look for a couple miliseconds and became interested on reading what people had to say...
           </p>
           <p>
            I accidentally tapped on this user's name when trying to access the comments section for the post - Not the first time this happens while browsing Instagram on my phone, call me clumsy fingers if you wish... Anyway, I landed at the user's feed and at first it seemed as if I was looking at yet another photographer's hedonistic feed, dedicated to mainly erotic pictures of herself, which is totally fine by me...
           </p>
           <p>
            About 10 seconds later,
            <strong>
             I noticed one picture, featuring an obviously underage boy, laying down naked on the shower floor, this picture being framed in a way that it started to show his pubis, and figured out this was her son because of the caption...
            </strong>
            ~~~ https://www.instagram.com/p/BHPN5HIjkJN/?taken-by=valeria.tb~~~ further down, another post of the kid totally naked, showing his rear end, ~~~http://www.picgist.com/media/828323916547699957_435054684~~~At this point I am starting to feel like something is very wrong with this person, considering the previous pictures show her in highly sexual poses, and even sporting a ball-gag ~~~http://www.pictaram.com/media/1207699660094388051_435054684~~~, which again, is fine by me as long as we are talking about adults...
           </p>
           <p>
            I continued going through her posts
            <strong>
             and there is the kid again, taking a bath in a bucket, with a caption that reads " Caldito de pollo" which translates to "Chicken soup" which kind of resonates with the infamous "chickenlovers" comment on mr. Alefantis' now private Instagram feed.
            </strong>
            ~~~http://www.picgist.com/media/603307869668455875_435054684~~~
           </p>
           <p>
            There is one more seemingly straight forward portrait of a very young child with the caption "La inocencia de fuego" which translates to "Innocence of fire" or "Flaming innocence" with a bunch of tags, amongst which is #babygirls, and 3 comments, 2 of them coming from men, one of them has the nickname "BobSagetLovesVag" who literally comments: " So beautiful 😍😍😍😘😘😘👌 " ~~~http://www.picgist.com/media/1063860689410012470_435054684~~~
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Perhaps in the eyes of the majority there is nothing wrong with this, since Instagram mods or users who have viewed these seem to not care, as they normally do when an adult woman's nipple is featured, which seems to get taken down seconds after being posted... Perhaps I am too old fashioned, or have been following pizzagate / pedogate so closely that I am becoming oversensitive..? I don't think so.
            </em>

           <h2>
            Please, look into this, and let me know if you also have trouble archiving the Instagram feed. I do not want to post any screenshots, I refuse to hold these images in my computer even if it is for a brief time.

            Thank you and be safe!!!

             !!!! MOST IMPORTANT !!!! WHATEVER YOU DO, BE RESPECTFUL, LEAVE SOME ROOM IN YOUR HEAD FOR DOUBT, AND GIVE THIS WOMAN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AS WELL - JUST BECAUSE I AM DISGUSTED BY THESE IMAGES IT DOES NOT MEAN THERE IS ANYTHING ILLEGAL, OR "WRONG" ABOUT THEM. AGAIN, BE RESPECTFUL AND RESPONSIBLE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS HERE, ESPECIALLY MINORS, THIS IS NOT A GAME.

             Yeah, seems this Gustavo taking the pictures is her partner, possibly the kid's father?? There are millions of Gustavos in the world, I am sure the Worldcorp video is unrelated, but then again it is not possible for me to say the two are unrelated... Notice that some picutres depict Sado-Maso, and others are made in a morgue... there must be something fucked up in these people's heads to be posting such pictures on the same feed where they post their kid's pictures... Good catch, this is scary!!
            </p>
            <p>
             I checked "bobsagetlovesvag" profile and noticed there is another user calling him a pedophile
             <a href="http://www.picgist.com/media/1063981034225784331_2158124596">
              http://www.picgist.com/media/1063981034225784331_2158124596
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Seems like that user is another photographer by the name of Marc Dussault.
            </p>
            <p>
             Going back to Gustavo, could not help but notice this video, showing yet another greek sculpture:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             this one has a baby/fetus in it...

              https://www.instagram.com/p/BLZkdbrAPcX/?taken-by=vj_gustavocisneros
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The guy is a very talented VJ, and looking at his art, he seems to be way into the dark side of things, highly sexual too, lots of symbolism...
            </p>
            <p>
             A very ambiguous pic on his feed, not sure how old this "schoolgirl" is

              That statue looks like the alefantis statue. And that school likes really young. Even if worldcorp is unrelated this guy definitely suspect
