<p>This is not a Mod-Attack btw.</p>
<p>It seems that regular PG Voaters\' posts are still being deleted due to the rules of posting in this verse not being covered.</p>
<p><strong>I believe we are missing some great info because of this, and new posters are getting disheartened.</strong></p>
<p>Looking though the deleted posts regularly (as this is where a lot of good info is found), I find that many posts would have not been deleted had the posters ensured they covered the rules.</p>
<p><strong>FYI, and to help, here\'s the recipe I use (found over time), to get my posts to <em>always</em> stick -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simply posting a link will ensure your post is deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If posting a link, create your post as a \'Discuss\' post, and write a couple of sentences in the post box to describe what it\'s about.  Then, just to make sure, add a sentence saying how it relates to PG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it\'s a headline without a link, you need to again, write the above in the post, and also include a link or two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This recipe covers all the rules on the side bar. There\'s always a way to get something to pertain to PG (if it\'s a genuine post with good info), and always something to link to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here\'s a great link / post by <a href="https://voat.co/user/freeagent37">@freeagent37</a> posted earlier, which because it\'s just a link, will most likely be deleted.

<h2><strong>How to ensure great posts aren\'t slid into oblivion - Helping the \'New\' section and new posts</strong></h2>
<p>Along with some trash and spam, a lot of great posts can be found in the \'New\' section. There\'s a constant stream of \'new\' posts.  
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, shills jump on them quickly and downvoat them.  Even 2 downvoats to 2 upvoats ensures the post doesn\'t gather any traction.</p>
<p>Two downvoats to even 4 upvoats means that others may decide, without looking for themselves, just at the voats, that it\'s an irrelevant post. Often this is not the case, and important posts don\'t get viewers because of shill tactics.</p>
<p>The \'new\' section I spend a lot of time in, upvoating and commenting on the good posts (any positive comment when I don\'t have time to write a full one), so that they\'ll gain traction quickly and not be slid (lost because of lack of interest). Comments help threads get to the \'Hot\' list and it doesn\'t need many.  
</p>
<p><strong>Example of an amazing research post being downvoated into oblivion today ---- <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1781115">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1781115</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suggest we all spend time checking the \'NEW\' section, to ensure we\'re not losing important info because of shills.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Edit - Editing Posts</strong></h2>
<p>Every part of your main post can be edited using the \'edit\' button below your post.  The only thing that can\'t be edited is your headline, so imho it\'s important to take great care over this part.</p>
<p>Use of all capital letters and \'click-baity\' headlines are generally seen as annoying by PG Voaters, so we can try to bear that in mind too, while making sure our headlines look interesting enough to click on.  Use your imagination :)</p>
<p>EDIT 34 ;) : It\'s customary if you edit your main post, to write \'EDIT\' before it. This ensures others see your up-to-date / added / new info.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit your post as many times as you wish, but not your headline.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>This relates to Pizzagate and our investigation here, because it\'s important that we don\'t lose info due to posts being deleted.  Also, so that we\'re not losing great posts due to shill tactics on the \'New\' section.</p>
<p>Hope this all helps, cheers and happy posting :)</p>

            Don't let your posts be deleted if they're good research dude, re-post, re-post, re-post while making sure you cover the rules. If you do they can't be deleted.  You are valued, as is your research (and everyone's).  Rock on.

            Then why do threads that are personal testimonies getting deleted then?  Because they don't provide any links?  Give me a break...

             Yes, indeed, because they don't include links.  Add a couple of links and your post has to stay.  Weird rules but they've been made to make this place nice for us. Try it and see.

             I think it's because you have 3 upvoats and 3 downvoats (shills - see?).  Your voat score is therefore zero.  You need more upvoats.  Here's one.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or, do you know you have more upvoats?
            </p>
            <p>
             SEE PEOPLE how the SHILLS are managing to hide important research????

              Mods have a certain degree of interpretating the rules. In this case, the helpfulness to the investigation is greater than this concern, don't you agree?

                  Regardless what FuckwitAPedia says, (I can't believe you're citing this source?!), it is important to the investigation and covers all the rules.  imo if you're

                  </em>

                   Haha you can keep repeating it if you want, and it still won't be true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Wikipedia compiles different sources from all over the web. Anyone can edit a page, that's true. But, to say that the few things that people do change spoils all of the valuable information on the site is utterly irresponsible. Careful of the compositional fallacy here.

                  <p>
                   Also, saying I'm either for you or against you because of this (which you claim is semantics, which I claim you're simply not following the rules) is entirely laughable.

                  <p>
                   I'm certain people won't fall for such basic attempts at persuasion.

                    Whatever dude, go talk semantics and Wikipedia somewhere else. imo if
                    <em>
                     you are

                      Um... what are you actually getting at?  That this is a meta discussion?  Meta discussions
                      <em>
                       don't include links
                      </em>
                      as far as I can tell. That way, with links, one gets around the rules and the post has to stay up.
                      <em>
                       That's a meta discussion per PG Voat
                      </em>
                      .  So I'm letting people know how to get around the rules.  What's your beef and why are you so against this? I'm sorry, I don't understand your motives here.

                         One of you has to be reasonable here. Even if my reasoning is flawed, I'm just an annoying douche, or whatever else you might come up with, this guy literally admitted that he's trying to get around the rules. I'm still a little confident that you're not fucking with me. Anyone care to prove me wrong?

                            No.  As an [O], I'm mostly here to take care of the mods acting up, and deal with some of the bigger issues.  The mods [M] tend to be the keepers of the day-to-day here, as I do my best to keep my distance for myriad reasons.

                            As it stands, one former mod/janitor who left of her own accord, and one janitor found this to be OK, and I have no idea if it was discussed with other mods, or was a sticky at some point, either of which would indeed supersede the normal rules of the subverse.

                             (janitor, not a mod) was the one to challenge this. If you're going to make the above statement, while ignoring the first quoted statement above, you're honestly challenging any shred of integrity I was under the impression you had prior to this.

                             Not only does this attack my character, it deflects the argument and leads us to a diluted conclusion which straw mans my argument. This person is literally saying, "if you're not with us you're against us" because my claim is that this topic is meta discussion, despite whether or not privatepizza or sensitive think this is a semantics argument, and therefore it's against the rules.
                             <strong>
                              If I'm in the wrong, and sensitive thinks it's okay to be lenient on certain aspects of certain rules, then we need to hammer down the definition of meta so this doesn't happen in the future.

                             Let me make this crystal clear: My position is that this is meta discussion, plain and simple. Their position has turned into a semantics discussion. This is very awkward, because semantics should be my argument. If they didn't agree it's meta, they shouldn't care about it's various uses or meanings, it shouldn't be vague like that. Their argument would be much stronger if it were along the lines of, "This isn't meta because of X." They wouldn't need to fall back on challenging the meaning of my language if it was clear enough that this argument didn't need to be had.

                             Everyone deserves to be held to the same standards (even more so, the mods), especially when it comes to organization being almost necessary due to the sensitivity involved in the subject matter here. Don't play games with me, or the rest of the community. We don't deserve posts like this or

                             resigning as a mod being on the front page. We don't deserve the luxury of her drama, and the audacity it takes for you or other members of the community to endorse this behavior is not only alarming, it's unacceptable and down right irresponsible. The thought that this sub/site might be compromised never bothered me before, but the fact that I'm seeing this shit for multiple days in a row now only because "omg my feelings!" is the rather disappointing. You're all better than this.

            Do you have any ideas on how we could start getting the huge amounts of evidence and coincidences organised? My worry is if we all started moving this over to something as big as wikipedia they could pull it like Reddit.

             Yes I'm with you here and your concerns are mine and other PG Voaters too.  I'm unsure we can have a 100% foolproof backup or organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, because of these concerns we have a 'research consolidation' project going on over at /pizzagatewhatever with a small team of us PG Voaters collating all research.  We create threads of everything found and also add the articles, threads and images into private libraries.  This way, if anything happens we've as much backup as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a huge undertaking and we could really use some consolidators to help. Pick a thread / subject and collate all the info available, archive it, organise it and save it to a private library.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're up for lending a hand (we just work when we can - no pressure what-so-ever), just send me a pm.  Anyone who's interested can do the same.  Cheers :)

              I had no idea! I wonder about you adding a line at the bottom of your post letting us know about this? It's very important and I'm sure you'd get a lot of help, but not so sure people will see this comment.

               Thanks V, for your support and idea! And yes, at first we were going to solicit help by posting on various threads, but in the end we were wary of trolls :) 
Don't know if it's too much paranoia or not, idk... and we were also getting into a groove with how it would work, and how to share things out, get a system going etc. Now we've got that down, so maybe we'll post a solicit or two now as it would be great to get some help !   If you fancy coming on board, ace!  Cheers :)

                Absolutely - this is such a great idea. Don't hesitate to add mention of this to every pizzagate post you make, because I don't think you'll get away with posting here exclusively to call attn to this project. Might have to sneak it in ;)

                 Yea, that's why we had to make it over at /whatever, (and our new sub for the project /PizzagateProof). We'd planned to sneak some advertising in with some good threads. Thing is, this isn't really cool, so we'd have to make a plan so everyone in the team wasn't spamming at the same time lol.. we don't want to annoy.  But yea, a mention in posts we post would be nice. Thanks for the idea!

                Yes!!! The project is now at our new home of /PizzagateProof. Apologies! However we've yet to move some of our finished threads over there, so work is going on at PP, but consolidation threads still at /whatever until we move them over. Between homes ; ). Come on over to PP!

             I believe (not 100% mind you), that it's not a meta discussion when it includes a link.  Maybe a mod can set this straight?

               Yea... I just found it out by trial and error.  If your post gets deleted,
               <em>
                for sure
               </em>
               you haven't followed the above recipes, so if that happens, take a look and re-post it / edit it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, yes, if you see a great post, a comment really helps when it's new.  Now I have 4 upvoats - 0 downvoats on this post and a few comments, it's on the 'Hot' list already.  It doesn't need much. Thanks for your comment :)

            Yep, thank you very much Privatepizza. 
It's really not too hard, to create a post that will be allowed to stay and I'd be more than happy, if I wouldn't have to remove any posts that actually link to some good info...

             No worries, glad it's of help to posters, and for the mod-team. I think you get more hassle than you deserve, if only people would cover the rules it'll be easier across the board hopefully.  Cheers for your comment :)
