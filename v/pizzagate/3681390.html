<p>So one of Savile’s gimmicks as a DJ was as Teret puts it the “invention of ‘Dance Tempo’”  – or perhaps more widely, an almost scientific attention to which beats cause which effects. While it appears Savile had little emotional feeling for music, or love of the music he played, he had a deep appreciation of musical tempo which appeared to be analytic and focused on how to ‘direct’ or ‘conduct’ a dancefloor, full of “punters” as he might call attendees at his club. And as simple as it being a ‘smooch’ session or a ‘dance’ session he took a long hard look at what kind of ‘control’ or ‘power’ this represented to him: “It’s not power, it’s an effect” as applied to other areas of his life. Savile’s keen sense of opportunity comes with a sharp sense of timing in order to take advantage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Savile claimed to have naturally strong hypnotic talents , which he proceeded to hone under the tutelage of a Josef Karma on the Isle of Man, Douglas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Savile claimed that Karma had offered to teach him about hypnosis, and they worked together for a few weeks before he started to hypnotise people under his tutor’s guidance. He said he found that he could do it quite easily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘So when I came back to Leeds after the six weeks, I found…’ he paused for a moment to relight his cigar, ‘a hypnotherapy clinic. They’d get patients in and let me hypnotise them and try to sort them out, and I learned various techniques. I don’t use it very often.’</p>
<p>He cackled and looked straight out to sea.” [In Plain Sight, Dan Davies, Loc 3197]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted to know about the mysterious powers of hypnotism he claimed to possess. The pitch and cadence of his voice, a voice that became the standard-issue impersonation for just about every British citizen born before 1980, occasionally induced a drowsiness in me, especially if subjected to it for long stretches at a time. After a few hours listening to his pulsing drone – and occasionally being scolded for interjecting with a question or request for clarification – I invariably found myself needing a break….</p>
<p>So when did he first realise he had powers? “I was in the Isle of Man doing a disc jockey thing in Douglas, ‘ he replied. ‘And in the hotel I was staying at, because I was the star DJ at the time, the waitress came across and said – er – er what’s his name now?’ He groped for the name of the hypnotist he claimed had recognised his powers. I knew the name and reminded him: it was Josef Karma.</p>
<p>Josef Karma. Yes, he was doing a one-man show at the Royal. So Josef comes over to my table. And I said to him, “that’s a fascinating game is that.” And he said, “You can do what I can’t do Jim.” And I said, “What’s that?” “You can do mass hypnosis. You probably don’t know you’re doing it but you know the effect you’ve got on people. You know what you can do but you don’t know how it comes or what it’s called. You can do mass hypnosis and I can’t.” ‘</p>

             He admits to once having a religious moment:

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <em>
               “There are times when I’ve felt God very close by me. When I was in the Holy Land, I never felt the need to go into a church because I was far too concerned with being in the wilderness. Now in the wilderness, down by the Dead Sea and at the place where the Good Samaritan looked after the chap who had been set upon by the robbers, I wanted to be on my own and I very much wanted to be with the stillness, with the quietness. I went down, early in the morning, to the area by the Dead Sea where they found the Dead Sea Scrolls. I was able to stand about, before the heat of the day, and look around. I was mightily pleased at that moment; I was able to be in the same area where Jesus Christ had walked and lived and worked out his mental application to the world. That gave me a chance to work out my mental application to the world in exactly the same way as he did. I weighed up form as he might have weighed up form; and I came to certain decisions as he must have come to certain decisions. That was a particularly religious moment. It was rather like totting up the score of life. I tried to see whether I had gone right or whether I had gone wrong in specific instances.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               Generally, however, I felt I was facing in the right direction; at least I was not marching towards the forces of evil. I was wobbling in between the white lines a little bit, but coming back, as it were. I did not feel at all self-satisfied. It was just a moment of enquiry, a religious moment.”
              </em>

              It appears that at Qumran Savile finds some confirmation that he, in the same physical location as he imagines Jesus to have been, is “not marching towards the forces of evil.” Hmmm…maybe he should have glanced over his shoulder to check which side he thought he was leading in that case?

              Thanks for posting that. I was never aware that Savile put that book out. The sheer gall of Jimmy Savile releasing a book called God’ll Fix It is staggering.
