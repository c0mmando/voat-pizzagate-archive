<p>I was scrolling Disney+ one day for nostalgic purposes and happened upon &quot;Quints&quot;. The movie revolves around this girl whose mother suddenly becomes pregnant with, as the movie name implies -  a set of quintuplets. It should also be mentioned that Jamie wants to become an art major after high school or something like that. The usual hi-jinks that occur in a watered down Disney movie take place - the happy moments, the sad moments. But knowing all there is to know about Pizzagate, a few interesting scenes pop up.</p>
<p>Let\'s get right to the point.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/aVAemcM">Jamie\'s painting</a> - What was she even going for? Detailing the butt like that and the person who\'s apparently drawing the person, his or her face is a bunch of lines and dots. This scene stays focused like this from the camera for at least ten or so seconds making anyone who\'s watching this movie notice the drawing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right after, Jamie\'s art teacher and mentor comes over. Behind him on the wall, <a href="https://imgur.com/TcYjdnZ">half a painting</a> can be seen. Again we have the pleasure of seeing butts. Baby\'s butts near what looks to be a fire of all things. If anyone could find out the origin of this painting maybe we can figure out something more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talking about naked babies, a baby pees on the publicist that helps the family get famous and what do we have - <a href="https://imgur.com/UjJGWJy">another butt shot</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following are not so nefarious but just don\'t make sense in the context of the movie:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The mother and father leave for an event and right before he leaves, the father tells Jamie <a href="https://imgur.com/MRt6ZIc">to not let her male friend touch her stuff</a>. Nowhere in the movie does the male friend ever bother her, her stuff or anybody. He\'s a side character that doesn\'t even have an arc. A rather odd line to say about a character that doesn\'t do much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the movie, Jamie talks directly to the camera and <a href="https://imgur.com/o4ufSWM">says this</a> - &quot;Well, as happy as 14 year old girls ever get . . . but that\'s a different story.&quot; When the movie is basically about babies, what do the writers want the audience to think regarding what she means? Again, we have a painting of babies in the background.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you ask me, this feels like they were trying to program all the children and adults that watched this.</p>',

            I think it's a lot of the most vile hollywood creepers that are pushing this. Look at wizard of oz. The entire movie is dorothy being raped.. A song writer even sings about it.

            Does anyone else see that the person in the first drawing, sitting behind the screen or paper or whatever, has a rather large nose? I cant tell if im reading into it too much but I'll be damned if that doesn't look like a certain meme.
