            I have posted this information here because I personally think it rings true. What the source describes as 'militant, anti-White homosexual fascism' would be consistent with the abuse (or worse) of white babies. The source also uses the word 'genocide.' Could the aim be to eliminate as many white babies as possible? I'll revise my views if evidence comes to light of the abuse of black, Asian, or Latino babies, but I can see no evidence of that so far.
