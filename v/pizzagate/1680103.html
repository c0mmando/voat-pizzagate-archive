             Understood, and apologies. I’m just more than bit jaded from the incessant Catholic-bashing that goes on here (and everywhere). Though I guess it is to be expected within such a delicate area of research. I would like to preface with a couple comments - mainly regarding how I am disappointed that more people aren't seeking to befriend the Catholic Church, as the enemy of our enemy should be our friend. There is a reason why Satanists desecrate consecrated Catholic hosts. It is the same reason why their black mass is a mockery of the Catholic traditional Latin Mass.

            seeking to befriend Catholics because apart from anything else, you're light years ahead of most when it comes to things like exorcism, historical scientific advances and the preservation of ancient documents.

             I don’t blame you for misunderstanding infallibility, because it took me a long time to properly understand it. Simply put - the Pope, like us, is still human and subject to human errors and oversights. He is only speaking infallibly, or ex cathedra, when addressing issues of faith and morals. Even then, the infallibility is only when intended. Official invocation of papal infallibility is actually very rare, having happened only several times throughout history.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I will have to bow to your superior understanding on this one. I just have a nasty suspicion that both the current Pope and the previous one are caught up in all this. If that's true and it comes to light, it will be impossible to defend and will do the church great harm.

             It doesn’t matter if no documents survive, as the majority of Biblical scholars agree that He spoke in Aramaic. It was the language that most Jews spoke in their daily lives before, during, and after the time of Jesus. The sayings of Jesus were spoken in Aramaic, therefore the best way to understand them is to read them in Aramaic.

           <p>
            If only we could - sigh. I'm a fan of the theory that says Matthew first in Aramaic, then Mark based on Matthew and then Matthew in Greek. I do think the 'you are kepha and on this kepha' is a strong argument though.

             Stick to the reformers, w/ the Roman 'church' the proof is in the pudding. If the 'holy see' is not "sitting in the temple of God" then maybe you (Roman) Catholics (you guys hijacked the term catholic, and "saint" also btw) should admonish him to cease and desist from allowing people to bow to him (this is reserved only for Christ, it is idolatry to do this w/ a fallible sinful human being who is no different than you or me) and grovel on their knees and kiss his ring. Stick w/ the reformers, they are not "drunk w/ the blood of the saints" etc. Case Closed :)

            It doesn't matter how articulated I am, just whether what I say is true or not and how Christ would have been understood by the disciples at that time.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             First off, your argument regarding papal infallibility has no basis, as you misunderstand the term and confuse it with impeccability. Popes can make mistakes, and can also be rebuked. The only time a pope speaks infallibly is during an official teaching - which is what the Church considers to be doctrine. Popes are our equals in matters of opinion, but superiors in matters of explicit teaching.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I'm well aware of the difference between impeccability and infallibility. And the only person who qualifies is Christ. If a Pope can make mistakes, be rebuked and is my equal in matters on opinion then I fail to see how he suddenly becomes infallible when doing official teaching. I believe Martin Luther also had a problem with that,  among other things.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Your Petros/petra question stems from a grammatical issue that results from translating Christ's words to Greek. Kepha can be used in both places in Aramaic, but Greek nouns must take different gender endings - which is why feminine petra cannot be used as Peter's name in the Greek translation. What Jesus is saying here is, "You are Kepha, and on this kepha I will build my Church." Jesus was equating Simon and the rock, not contrasting them.

            We don't know exactly what Christ spoke in Aramaic - no documents survive. So your conjecture is just that: conjecture. Besides, this passage is not about Peter but about Jesus. There are a couple of places where Jesus is referred to as a 'petra', including in Peter's own letter:
           </p>
           <p>
            "4 As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, 5 you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 6 For it stands in Scripture:
“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone,  a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” 7 So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, “The stone that the builders rejected  has become the cornerstone,”[a] 8 and “A stone of stumbling, and a rock [Note: petra] of offense.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Only God is referred to as a rock in Scripture, never of man.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no one holy like the Lord; Indeed, there is no one besides Thee, Nor is there any rock like our God. —1 Samuel 2:2
           </p>
           <p>
            For who is God, but the Lord? And who is a rock, except our God? —Psalm 18:31
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there any God besides Me, Or is there any other Rock? I know of none. —Isaiah 44:8
           </p>
           <p>
            Matthew's Jewish readers would have been well aware of this imagery and not even entertained the idea that Jesus was talking about Peter himself as a petra.

            Have you ever noticed how much of the media, including conservative outlets, are Catholic?  It makes me wonder about them now. They always shut down any talk of PG or all the other pedophilia or priest preying on the kids.

             I honestly think the ones that claim are catholic are using that as a front for satanism. All the major media outlets are owned and controlled by the deep state cabal. The have to use a religion that's common to align themselves or pretend they have a value system. This works in their favor when trying to gain religious viewers. Ironically most of the producers and higher ups are Jewish. But again I think if they are associated with or are monarchs or handlers they are satanists as well.

            My dear Catholic brother (or sister), I happen to be a protestant and yet believe that there are many christians in the Catholic church. But I don't believe in Peter's infallibility post Pentecost because the NT quite clearly records a MAJOR error of his in Galatians 2:
           </p>
           <p>
            11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. 12 For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.[a] 13 And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. 14 But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”
           </p>
           <p>
            The original greek from Matthew says 'you are Petros and on this petra I will build my church.' Petra is a feminine noun - it cannot be referring to Peter himself. I think it refers to his faith. Contrary to Lapide's assertion, there is quite a wide range of disagreement from the church fathers on this topic.

            So they do their own investigations, trials and punishment?? Then, the Pope can overrule that punishment? This religion is so different than what I had thought all my life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Inzoli was found guilty of abusing young boys by a 2012 Vatican investigation and was ordered to be defrocked.
He appealed his punishment and, in 2014, Pope Francis overruled the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and granted clemency, reducing the priest’s penalty to a lifetime of prayer. 🤔 What?!

             The Vatican is an affront to God, how is a massive estate in His name so bloody wealthy? Jesus didn't preach protecting pedophilia and materialism, The Vatican is just a business, true piety would be selling all of the gold and assets to help the poor, instead they kiss each other's rings and protect child rapists. FUCK THE VATICAN

              I also like "the message" translation of Matthew 18:6
 "But if you give them a hard time, bullying or taking advantage of their simple trust, you’ll soon wish you hadn’t. You’d be better off dropped in the middle of the lake with a millstone around your neck. Doom to the world for giving these God-believing children a hard time! Hard times are inevitable, but you don’t have to make it worse—and it’s doomsday to you if you do."
