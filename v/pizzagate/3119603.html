<p>Eric Eoin Marques, 33, arrived in the United States on March 23, and had his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Timothy J. Sullivan in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland.  An amended criminal complaint was filed on Aug. 8, 2013, and unsealed today at Marques’ initial appearance.  Marques is charged with conspiracy to advertise child pornography, conspiracy to distribute child pornography, aiding and abetting the advertising of child pornography, and aiding and abetting the distribution of child pornography.  At the hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Sullivan ordered that Marques be detained pending trial or a detention hearing scheduled for March 27, 2019 at 11:30 a.m.</p>
<p>“Child exploitation sites on the dark web present a grave danger to children and unprecedented challenges to the world’s law enforcement agencies,” said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.  “The complaint unsealed today demonstrates the Department’s commitment to pursuing those accused of serious child pornography offenses wherever they may hide on the web and in the world, and to seeking justice for the countless children that are victimized by those who facilitate this horrendous conduct.”</p>
<p>“Criminals cannot hide on the dark web or in foreign countries,” said U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur.  “We will find them and bring them to justice.  We are grateful to Irish authorities for their assistance to bring Eric Marques to the United States to face these charges.”</p>',

              That is most likely the source for the last name and the ancestor. See here Marques (surname) - Wikipedia, and note the large numbers of Brazilians represented. Possible family member is Binho. This site is also useful. MARQUES - marques meaning - Jewish Genealogy

              Marques has been in custody [in Ireland] since his arrest in August 2013 after being refused bail over concerns including that he represented a flight risk and may interfere with evidence. His Attorneys have fought for several years to prevent his extradition to the United States on the grounds that he had Asperger syndrome and would not receive the appropriate care in a US prison, if extradited.
