             Occult Groups Vampirism - An ideal that was meant to be brought to a reality
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In a classic inversion technique society has done exactly what the old folk stories were meant to warn you against. Medieval stories were told as a warning to children, perhaps, to stay away from certain castles, per say.
           </p>
           <p>
            Society has done exactly what Dracula does, tricks you into openly inviting him into your homes, through pedantic admiration and idolatry with movies like Twilight, Underworld, True Blood, Dracula on and on etc etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are being conditioned to accept the reality that there are those among you that harvest you as if you were an industrial farm animal.

            <strong>
             Here's the real kicker:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Renfield served Count Dracula by bringing him blood and flesh victims by light of day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jimmy Savile did the same thing for Prince Charles, Princess Alexandra and the British DRAGON Bloodlines, he brought them dozens of  blood and flesh victims by light of day through radio and television, the British Broadcasting Company, the BBC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Savile (Mason Knight) Served the DRAGON BLOODLINES AS A ROYAL GOON. He was the Ogilvy House covert royal apprentice- executioner that serve the SECRETS of the DRAGON BLOODLINES of the British Royal House- human sacrifices to the DEVIL, pedophilic blood rites, cannibalism, and blood drinking, etc.,
           </p>
           <p>
            Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy, Order of the Garter, and Royal Victorian Order, a dynastic order of knighthood established in 1896 by Queen Victoria, is the youngest granddaughter of King George V and Queen Mary. She is a powerful Masonic, and also a military leader- Royal Colonel, and Colonel-in- Chief of military units and divisions across the globe.[35] I mentioned her not because Alexandria, VA is named after her British Satanic ILLUMINATI bloodline, but because of her hushed up secret relationships that she had with Jimmy Savile.
           </p>
           <p>
            Queen Elizabeth II in her Maltese robe. She is the Sovereign Head of the Order of Knights of Malta. Prince Charles is the Great MASTER of the Order.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prince Charles’ also had a very close personal relationship with Jimmy Savile, England’s most prolific Satanic homicidal pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prince Charles couldn’t have chosen a better history lesson on the British Royal Family and Dragon Bloodlines than Vlad the Impaler, because if it had come from my mouth it would have been no more than a flight of fantasy, and a conspiracy theory. But, the Order of the DRAGON, Vlad and Royal Family Bloodlines come directly from the Prince of Wales. He told you. He warned you, and most people still don’t get the “F**K” of what’s going on.

            You are a very smart person. I am going to work on this. Obviously I'm thinking of the "blood doping" that the elite do- this was also profiled recently in Wired as well as on Silicone Valley because people are using the blood of younger people to give them a 'youth boost'.

            Having been fascinated and appalled at this subject for some time, none of the common sense questions add up. Yes we are using the blood of children, but there is nothing to worry about. The most sought after commodity in the world could be the blood of kids as young as new born. According to the journal nature.  Human Umbilical Cord Plasma Proteins Revitalize Hippocampal Function in Aged Mice   Journal Nature  Yet nothing to see here. Oh, our name just happens to be an occult Alchemic substance sought after for thousands of years by the elite. Hey just a coincidence. Everything is hunky dory. Where are we getting the blood from? Don't worry about it. Anyone can see this is not good from any angle. Even the President of Alkahest says only half million Alzheimer's patients, out of 15 million, could be treated if all the blood plasma supply were used. That won't be you or me receiving these treatments. Yet if you read the main stream articles. It's the best thing since sliced bread. What's the hell going on here?

            children have different growth hormones then adults.  They are still developing, different rates for different systems.  For instance kidneys in a healthy child are developing until at about 2 years old, these can be proteins/peptides on the order of 150-400 amino acid, these are huge and complicated.  They are valuable for grafting, stem cell research and treatments.  The extent of the BioPharmacological exploits are vast and under regulated.  The 'raw' materials used to make 'synthetic' peptides is the biggest concern of mine.   Here are 2 papers worth review:

            <p>
             The most often detected illegal peptides were potential dopingagents, including the growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRP-2, GHRP-6, CJC1295, sermorelin, Ipamorelin), AOD9604 and the wound healing peptide Thymosin β4. Furthermore also the skin tanning agent Melanotan II and the potential geroprotective and anti-cancer peptide Epitalon were detected.

             Recent advances in genomics, proteomics, recombinant expression technologies and peptide synthesis have led to an increased development of protein and peptide therapeutics. Unfortunately the uprising of these kinds of active pharmaceutical ingredients also goes hand in hand with an increase in the number of incidents with SFFC pharmaceuticals, including

              stolen
             </strong>
             and substandard proteins and peptides.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Falsified biopharmaceutical injectables are frequently seized as unlabelled glass vials for injection with coloured caps shipped in small, unmarked boxes (Figure 1). Characteristically, these vials contain a white to yellowish lyophilized sugar with a peptide or a protein. Most peptides appear to be doping agents but some are used for skin tanning or libido enhancement. Users dissolve and inject the vial contents without proper instructions and without knowing what they are injecting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Three countries reported biopharmaceutical injectables. Laboratory assessments were reported for 4 of the 5 included shipments. In each case, one or two vials had been analyzed. The analyzed vials contained human growth hormone (HGH), sermorelin, and melanotan II. One lot did not contain any active ingredient. All included shipments came without any labelling or documentation. Since sterility tests were not conducted by the seizing laboratories, the microbiological quality of these products is unknown. HGH and sermorelin – a growth hormone releasing hormone analogue – are both used as doping agents. Melanotan II is known to stimulate the melanocytes and is used for sun-free skin tanning. Medical literature and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) report several serious cases of health damage caused by melanotan II in the UK.

            As I am reading this I noted this research is partially funded by the Dental Branch of the Office of Naval Research.  There has been a great deal of supposition as to why dental chairs are being found in nefarious situations.  Someone had mentioned implanting of chips, stem cell capture or just plain torture.  Now it really peaks my interest as to why this Dental Branch is funding this research.  I will look further into all of this.
