<p>&quot;Within the past few weeks I wrote how the island owner and his supposedly former friend/attorney (Epstein/Doucheowitz) were hanging out again. Apparently it all has to do with what the foreign born convicted child molester told the feds before he fled the country. That child molester (George Nader)was a supplier to the island owner (Epstein) and frequent visitor to the island. The island owner also would sometimes pass along teens to NXIVM when he was finished with them. It was a way to keep track of those that knew big secrets. Others that knew big secrets would end up as a wife to friends of the foreign born convicted child molester where they still remain.&quot;</p>

            : I am sorry, but I will have to flair this 'Unverified' - this is based on the highly speculative CDAN blind, which doesn't even name names; also, there aren't any hints that Nader ever talked about Epstein or NXIVM.

            This could very well be the smoking gun we've been looking for.

            Direct physical ties linking NXIVM to Mueller, Epstein and through him sex trafficking of children to elite pedophiles such as the Clintons.

            I am fully convinced now that CDAN is a white hat site. Enty and Himmmm being Hollywood White Hats. Himmmm is supposed to be four people: A music guy, a brit, a producer, and an actor (rumored to be Robert Downey Jr.).

             I have dinner, walk the dog, put the kids to be d and there's more news on this guy.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The princes, the president and the fortune seekers
             </p>
             <p>
              Broidy and his business partner, Lebanese-American George Nader, pitched themselves to the crown princes as a backchannel to the White House, passing the princes’ praise — and messaging — straight to the president’s ears.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, in December 2017, Broidy was ready to be rewarded for all his hard work.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was time to cash in.....
             </p>
             <p>
              The AP has previously reported that Broidy and Nader sought to get an anti-Qatar bill through Congress while obscuring the source of the money behind their influence campaign. A new cache of emails obtained by the AP reveals an ambitious, secretive lobbying effort to isolate Qatar and undermine the Pentagon’s longstanding relationship with the Gulf country.
             </p>
             <p>
              Neither Broidy nor Nader registered with the U.S. government under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law intended to make lobbyists working for foreign governments disclose their ties and certain political activities. The law requires people to register even if they are not paid but merely directed by foreign interests with political tasks in mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              Violating the federal law carries a maximum $10,000 fine or up to five years in prison
             </p>
             <p>
              Broidy's a crook too.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In 2009, Broidy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of rewarding official misconduct.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Andrew Cuomo, then-New York attorney general, called it “an old-fashioned payoff.”
             </p>
             <p>
              “This is effectively bribery of state officials, and not just one,” said Cuomo, who is now New York’s governor.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nader’s problem was pedophilia.
             </p>
             <p>
              But in May 2003, Nader was convicted in the Czech Republic of 10 counts of sexually abusing minors and sentenced to a one-year prison term, the AP revealed in March.
             </p>
             <p>
              He served his time in Prague, according to Czech authorities, then was expelled from the country.

              Probably distracting, but I have to include my thoughts on the Packards. Who built the factories ect. Kahn. Kahn is Cohen. Who drove down the business that profited X + many zeros in today's fiat? Packard put the AC in cars, modern steering wheel, and made a better automatic transmission than Cadillac. In WW2 they shifted 100% to war efforts and came out with huge returns while the competition dwindled. They went out of business due to poor management decisions. Most people don't know that there were hundreds of car companys competing for a better product prior to that war. Patents and patent holders.

              The Rehoboth Beach home was torn down months after Brock sold it, amid much community opposition, so the buyer could divide the parcel and build two homes. It remains a vacant lot.

            UpVoat!!!    OOH Good!  You found the CDaN too.  Amazing comments.    Especially this one:

           <p>
            Within the past few weeks I wrote how the island owner [EPSTEIN] and his supposedly former friend/attorney [DERKSHOWITZ] were hanging out again. Apparently it all has to do with what the foreign born convicted child molester [GEORGE NADER] told the feds before he fled the country. That child molester [GEORGE NADER] was a supplier to the island owner [EPSTEIN] and frequent visitor to the island. The island owner [EPSTEIN[ also would sometimes pass along teens to NXIVM when he was finished with them. It was a way to keep track of those that knew big secrets. Others that knew big secrets would end up as a wife [MELANIA TRUMP] to friends [TRUMP] of the foreign born convicted child molester [GEORGE NADER] where they still remain.
           </p>

            Remember also Mueller is not pronounced as Muller.  It is pronounced with a Long U.  That is the German Way.  Someone on here brought that up a while back.  She is German.  Why does he hide the real way?  He possibly has a hidden past.
           </p>

            I totally agree this will create it's own ripples.

             Cheney is pronounced Chee-knee, when asked why he doesn't correct people, he quipped are they talking about me? As if you don't pronounce his name right, he is free of all guilt. They love playing games with the slaves.

              I heard that years ago and it has bugged me  ever since.  I can't stand people that love to trick you with their name.   Instead of Ashley they spell it Ashleigh  WhoTH does he think he is?  You know what? He is English and so is his wife.  She is someone not to reckon with.  She is just as evil.  Don't let her fool you, because she has been in the background.

             But Mueller is a very common German name. Like Smith in the US. There are maybe hundredsofthousands persons with the name.

              Right.  Smith is pronounced Smith and not Smythe as in Smithe a long I.  Also as in Grey we pronounce it as Gray  long A.  Just because we already familiar with it being pronounced that way.  The reason the first e is put in Mueller is to make it a Long U.   I am German also and am glad she brought this up.

             Anyone can post on blind,. That does not make it true, just interesting to those with time on their hands. I look at the facts presented, Nader is a super wierdo pedo and he is cooperating with Mueller, who has spent an enormous amount of fiat that the poor sap at starbucks/other has to pay back on his tax return, trying to take down Trump. Mueller was appointed by President George W. Bush; President Barack Obama gave his original ten-year term a two-year extension, making him the longest-serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. Those are included as the years in question, and Obama is PG central. That leads me to the conclusion that the only ammunition the sickos have is compromised individuals in their own group or coven.

              I did not mean to imply that I truly believed the comment I posted, just that it is possible, just as many other scenarios that are mentioned in the blind.  The blind is extremely interesting and I believe like others, it can push us to do more research.  Sometimes there are some comments that hit and hint at the truth.  Yes, I too read between the lines and do not consider them Gospel.

               I did not think you did. I do think that since this broke out a long time ago now, that we are being fed false information on a regular basis from any source available to the opposition. Wasting our time gets them time to recoup. Did you know that you can easily electrify you window screens if they are aluminum? Find a broken appliance on the side of the road... utility blade to cut extension cord ... then ZAP.

                Sorry, evidently I dd not.  I never take these things as solid truth they are just hints towards the truth and implications.  But many times there is already information out there and that is why so many arrive many times at the same conclusion.  But again I never take it as Gospel until it actually happens.

              I am not saying any of this IS true, but think about it.  It is a possible scenario.  He passes the girls off now possibly because he can't just have them all disappear because he has been convicted.  So he sends them to Raniere and they are mind controlled and kept under wraps so to speak and then they are passed off to others for them to marry and keep them quiet.  I don't remember the name but Melania was involved with some Big Kahuna while she was modeling and they had a business.  Wish I could remember his name.  He is married and has a son.  So there is already some funny business.  But again, this is just a possibility.

            Most of these news agencies fail to report that this guy has been being busted for sex crimes as early as
            <strong>
             1985... in DC
            </strong>
            , a VERY CAREER PEDOPHILE:
           </p>
           <p>
            Nader was convicted by Prague's Municipal Court of 10 cases of sexually abusing minors and sentenced to a one-year prison term in May 2003, said Marketa Puci, the court spokeswoman. She said the crimes occurred between 1999 and 2002.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nader was separately accused in Washington, D.C., of child pornography infractions in 1985, but those charges were later dropped. A criminal docket sheet obtained by the AP shows the same birthdate for Nader.
           </p>
           <p>
            Puci, the court spokeswoman, said Nader was convicted of 'moral corruption of minors, sexual abuse and impairing morals,' after abusing underage boys.
           </p>
           <p>
            In one case, Nader requested oral sex from a 14-year-old in a room at the Hilton Hotel in Prague, Puci said.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the boy refused, Nader masturbated in front of the boy and paid him 2,000 koruna - worth about $100 today, she said.

             The charges in 1985 were dropped due a technicality, not because he was found innocent.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              ...it was known that Nader faced a....charge in federal court in Washington in 1985 involving allegations of importing from the Netherlands magazines depicting nude boys. A judge dismissed those charges after ruling that the search warrant issued for Nader’s home was invalid.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And he was convicted in 1991, for possessing child pornography:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Nader received a six-month sentence from a federal court in Northern Virginia in 1991 on a felony charge of transporting sexually explicit materials in foreign commerce, according to the newly released records and to prison records POLITICO obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
             </p>
             <p>
              U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton also imposed a $2,000 fine on Nader, the records show.

            The first took place in Trump Tower in New York in December 2016 and brought together Nader, Kushner, Bannon - whom Trump fired last August - and Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second occurred a month later in the Indian Ocean archipelago of Seychelles and involved Nader, bin Zayed, former Blackwater boss Erik Prince and Kirill Dmitriev, a Russian banker close to President Vladimir Putin.
           </p>
           <p>
            For Nader, it was the latest brush with the law in an eventful, globe-trotting career.

             There's a meeting with Nader, Erik Prince and Don Jr in August.
That Trump Tower meeting is the one that caused the unmasking.  MBZ slipped into the country without notifying the State Department which is a breach of protocol.  This is when Susan Rice asked that the Americans he met with be unmasked that's how the Trump Team was discovered.  This is a legitimate use of unmasking and the Senate Intel Committee said she did nothing wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's a new Nader meeting that just came out from August.  That news just broke.

             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              on Saturday, the New York Times broke a major story that finally helps clarify a months-long mystery: why Mueller’s Russian interference investigation has taken such an interest in certain other countries, most notably the United Arab Emirates.
             </p>
             <p>
              We recently learned that George Nader, an adviser to the crown prince of the UAE, was cooperating with Mueller’s probe and testifying to the grand jury. We’ve also heard of Mueller’s interest in private security company CEO and Trump donor Erik Prince, who had a secret meeting in Seychelles in January 2017. He’s also asked about Joel Zamel, an Israeli social media specialist. What was all this about?
             </p>
             <p>
              Now the Times’s Mark Mazzetti, Ronen Bergman, and David Kirkpatrick have revealed at least part of the reason: Nader, Prince, and Zamel all had a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in August 2016.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the meeting, per the Times, Nader said the crown princes of the UAE and Saudi Arabia wanted to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. Zamel made some sort of pitch involving social media help for Trump. After the election, Nader made a large payment to Zamel.
             </p>
             <p>
              The revelation of this meeting sheds new light on some other questionable meetings we’ve long known about. In December 2016, the month after Trump won, the crown prince of the UAE secretly flew to the US and met with Trump officials, without informing the Obama administration he was coming, as major foreign leaders usually do. The following month, Nader helped organize a meeting in Seychelles between Erik Prince, the UAE’s crown prince, and a Russian fund manager.
             </p>
             <p>
              So there are several mysterious meetings, money changing hands, an offer involving social media help for the election, and a tie to Russia. There’s obviously much we still don’t know about what exactly happened. But if Trump’s team did get foreign help winning the election, that would be illegal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mueller clearly thinks something is up — something big. His investigators separately stopped both Nader and Zamel at airports earlier this year and searched their electronics. Per the Times, they even worked with Israeli police to get computers from one of Zamel’s companies. Nader is reportedly cooperating with Mueller’s team and has testified extensively to a grand jury.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And that December meeting was when MBZ secretly entered the US and didn't tell the State Department.  A major breach of protocol.  This is why the Senate Intel Committee said it was proper for Susan Rice to find out who he was meeting with.
            </p>
            <p>
             This story broke just before Trump had a fit and demanded a DOJ investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             So this Nader guy's been busy.   I don't think he fits the blind as I don't think he fled the country.  He's cooperating with Mueller and so far, no charges against him have been announced.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nader is also connected to Eliot Broidy, the Republican fundraiser who was found to be one of Michael Cohen's client.  Remember that?  He used Cohen for a 1.6 million dollar Stormy Danieils -type NDA hushup agreement to a Playboy model who had an abortion.  In fact Cohen used the same names he used in the Stormy Daniels NDA.
            </p>
            <p>
             So Nader got Broidy a $200 million dollar security contract with the UAE.  And he was apperenly lobbing politicians against Qatar.  Qatar didn't seem to like that.   Broidy later accused Qatar of hacking and releasing he and his wife's emails and is suing the government of Qatar.

             There's a meeting with Nader, Erik Prince and Don Jr in August.
That Trump Tower meeting is the one that caused the unmasking.  MBZ slipped into the country without notifying the State Department which is a breach of protocol.  This is when Susan Rice asked that the Americans he met with be unmasked that's how the Trump Team was discovered.  This is a legitimate use of unmasking and the Senate Intel Committee said she did nothing wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's a new Nader meeting that just came out from August.  That news just broke.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              on Saturday, the New York Times broke a major story that finally helps clarify a months-long mystery: why Mueller’s Russian interference investigation has taken such an interest in certain other countries, most notably the United Arab Emirates.
             </p>
             <p>
              We recently learned that George Nader, an adviser to the crown prince of the UAE, was cooperating with Mueller’s probe and testifying to the grand jury. We’ve also heard of Mueller’s interest in private security company CEO and Trump donor Erik Prince, who had a secret meeting in Seychelles in January 2017. He’s also asked about Joel Zamel, an Israeli social media specialist. What was all this about?
             </p>
             <p>
              Now the Times’s Mark Mazzetti, Ronen Bergman, and David Kirkpatrick have revealed at least part of the reason: Nader, Prince, and Zamel all had a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in August 2016.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the meeting, per the Times, Nader said the crown princes of the UAE and Saudi Arabia wanted to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. Zamel made some sort of pitch involving social media help for Trump. After the election, Nader made a large payment to Zamel.
             </p>
             <p>
              The revelation of this meeting sheds new light on some other questionable meetings we’ve long known about. In December 2016, the month after Trump won, the crown prince of the UAE secretly flew to the US and met with Trump officials, without informing the Obama administration he was coming, as major foreign leaders usually do. The following month, Nader helped organize a meeting in Seychelles between Erik Prince, the UAE’s crown prince, and a Russian fund manager.
             </p>
             <p>
              So there are several mysterious meetings, money changing hands, an offer involving social media help for the election, and a tie to Russia. There’s obviously much we still don’t know about what exactly happened. But if Trump’s team did get foreign help winning the election, that would be illegal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mueller clearly thinks something is up — something big. His investigators separately stopped both Nader and Zamel at airports earlier this year and searched their electronics. Per the Times, they even worked with Israeli police to get computers from one of Zamel’s companies. Nader is reportedly cooperating with Mueller’s team and has testified extensively to a grand jury.
             </p>

             And that December meeting was when MBZ secretly entered the US and didn't tell the State Department.  A major breach of protocol.  This is why the Senate Intel Committee said it was proper for Susan Rice to find out who he was meeting with.
            </p>
            <p>
             This story broke just before Trump had a fit and demanded a DOJ investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             So this Nader guy's been busy.   I don't think he fits the blind as I don't think he fled the country.  He's cooperating with Mueller and so far, no charges against him have been announced.
