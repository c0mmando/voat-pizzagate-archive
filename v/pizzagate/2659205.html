<p>“The Coalition has since obtained documents from the sentencing hearing and we were disheartened to see several additional professionals joined these two counselors in their support of a child sexual offender.</p>
<p>In some cases these professionals submitted letters of support that contained views we consider to be even more alarming than those expressed by the two counselors who spoke at the sentencing hearing. </p>
<p>For instance, <strong>a sex offender treatment provider wrote to the court:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>“Kristie takes full responsibility for her actions with her ‘victim.’ I put this in parentheses because I am aware that her ‘victim’ was truly the pursuer in this case.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>A pediatrician in Concord who worked with Kristie at a children’s camp</strong>, but was not involved in this case and therefore did not ever evaluate or interview the child, wrote: </p>
<p>“<strong>She is not a threat to others or to society.</strong>” </p>
<p>And <strong>a friend of Kristie’s who is an attorney who worked with her at the same children’s camp</strong> writes:</p>
<p>“Although I know it is now impossible, <strong>I would not hesitate for a moment to welcome her back to camp in her capacity as a cabin counselor; she was a treasure.</strong>” “</p>

            They're trying to find the right age. Let's see she's 39, the kid's 14. If this doesn't go, then it'll be 23 and 16. Or how about 17?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's faction pushing it's every kid's fantasy so she was doing the minor who can't give consent a favor in molesting him.
           </p>
           <p>
            There can be no backing down on these points. The minute we blink, there it is ... a precedence to push further and eradicate the whole concept of establishing an age of consent.

             Exactly, and extremely well put.  I'm surprised they haven't yet made the argument that it's just hands-on sex ed by a caring educator.

            The angle no one will look into among these cases is this one............

            All judges are masonic.
Was the perp a member of a masonic lodge?
Were her friends, other lodge members?
           </p>
           <p>
            All lodges file a 501(c)3.
Under the FOIA, someone can seek donor lists from the states grand lodge.
All lodge members are required to pay dues. I.E. they will be donors on a FOIA request.
           </p>
           <p>
            You put a huge target on yourself, if you try making this FOIA request, though.
(They may be filing 501(c)4 now and no names will show up on a request.)

            Not difficult to imagine how this 'treatment' probably looks like.... 'Joe, you're right, it's disgusting how these little bitches have offered themselves to you....
