            This poor dummy got duped. He was foolish to engage further once he found out she was 15 but it's a huge difference between a sadistic pedophile and a dude with poor judgment/morals looking for a hooker.

            Yeah, but the only thing is that he was busted on soliciting a minor, which is much more of an individual thing than being a part of a ring. It's possible that he was also involved in a ring a temporarily didn't have access to it, I guess.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the situation was not done well by the cops. He was looking for the a prostitute basically luring him in as a 19 year-old, and then when he contacted her she said she was a 15 year-old and asked if that was okay. He said, "Sure." That doesn't make it okay, but I think this is a far cry form someone who goes out looking for children is involved in a pedophile ring among the elites, potentially even a satanic cult. My guess it that he will be able to get a reduced sentence because of how he was lured in by someone pretending to be of legal age.

             yeah, i hear you, but at this point, any Facebook Employee headlined in the same sentence as child-prostitution, pedophile, or any of that, will harm their policy of credibility when it comes to censoring. this headline should be taken to the limit by FBers upset with rumors of new censorship policies. like maybe plastering FB's FB page and beyond. In the PR war, this headline is silver if not gold. If somebody can hack this guy's computer, we might find out how much of a "lone wolf" he really is. Anyway, I'll take what little satisfaction I can take right now, thank you very much. :)

              Good point, but I wouldn't suggest devoting too much time to this one; I've seen two YT videos (one was RitchiefromBoston) saying this was just to distract us with more pedo stuff to dig into, since this guy works for the group trying to do that.  I'm not sure, just mentioning it.  (He does think most of PG has always been a Psyop to distract us, but just this weekend has admitted that PG is a real problem).
