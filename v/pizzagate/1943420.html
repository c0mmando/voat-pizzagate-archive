            Hasn't anyone noticed the connections - DC, Chicago, Hollywood and the last name in common in those three places? How did Emanuels, Podestas, Weiner, and Clintons rise to such great power? How did Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, John McCain and Ashton Kutcher?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Podestas, and likely the Emanuels, are all part of the inner circle of the Pilgrims Society, while Schumer, Weiner, Byrd and others are part of the Knights of Pythias, with both groups linking back to the agenda of Global Sustainability, Community Policing, social surveillance, mass incarceration, vaccines and viruses, education reform, racketeering, blackmail, and related corrupt agendas fostered by the Bushes and Clintons in Racine, Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both the RNC (Bushes, Paul Ryan, John McCain, Reince Priebus, Mike Pence, Jeff Flake, etc.) and the DNC (Clinton, Weiner, Schumer, Pelosi, etc.) are all linked through Racine, Wisconsin. They are using Racine as a new front for Human Trafficking linked with the corrupt churches, foundations, PACs, NGOs, mafia and gangs, businesses, politicians, and authorities (see the corrupt mayor, DA, and others). Racine is a main root to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption run by secret societies brazenly out in the open.

            Yup, the Cuba connection. Let's talk about that. And remember, our friend JA was in Cuba with his buddy Obama.

              I was referring to Jack Posobiec.

             <p>
              Why would anyone believe him?

             <p>
              As for the poster, it's quite easy to question.  He lays out a series of links on cuba, in the usual conspiratorial fashion.   I guess we are supposed to get suspicious about coffee.
             </p>
             <p>
              The last two links seems to claim something more.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Podesta also seems to have knowledge of the Cuban governments assassination of human rights activist Oswaldo Payá.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Paya was killed in 2012.  The letter was from 2015.  Tons of information was publicly available about this case.
              <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/oswaldo-payas-death-in-cuba-two-years-ago-still-awaits-a-proper-investigation/2014/07/21/b0ac9612-0bb8-11e4-8c9a-923ecc0c7d23_story.html">
               This is from 2014

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The car spun out of control
               <strong>
                after being rammed from behind by a vehicle bearing state license plates
               </strong>
               , according to Mr. Carromero. While he and the associate from Sweden survived, Mr. Payá and Mr. Cepero were killed. Mr. Carromero says he was then coerced to confess and subjected to
               <strong>
                a rigged trial in order to cover up what really happened
               </strong>
               . Mr. Carromero’s videotaped “confession,” broadcast on television, was forced upon him; he was told to read from cards written by the state security officers. He was sentenced to four years in prison for vehicular homicide and later released to return to Spain to serve out his term.

              Then he gets the big charge

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Five months ago, u/SecondAmendment detailed the crime that will soon lead to the arrest of John Podesta... smuggling "coffee" through the Center for Democracy in the Americas, an arm of the human trafficking pedophile crime syndicate.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Ooooh Coffee again.    Must be scary.  He claims without evidence the Center for Democracy in the Americas in a criminal organization, knowing that you won't ask for you won't ask for any proof.  He links to a post an idiot who did not know who Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was.  Didn't understand that he was a giant of German literature and science and there is absolutely nothing wrong in quoting him.
             </p>
             <p>
              He also seems to that the email that to Podesta was a person email.  It was not.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was a blog entry

             </p>
             <p>
              so the evidence of crime in this case is a bunch of ramblings from a guy who doesn't know anything.
