Be warned, for anyone who was born during the mid 80’s or earlier, this can be a very emotionally painful lead to look into. 1/1/2018 was the day Pizzagate became PERSONAL.</p>

<p>This chapter looks into some disturbing gematria regarding Judith Barsi’s murder and names the gunman. Normally I don’t buy into such crap, but as I will show, so much of it lines up with what my digs have uncovered that I can’t ignore this. There are no coincidences.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Uka9YdmmaZs">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Uka9YdmmaZs</a> Although I question the sanity of the author, the gematria analysis regarding Judith Barsi (starting at 9:45) is alarming given earlier threads on this case.</p>

<p>The four links above show that there is some serious occult fuckery (remember “they” are motivated by it) going on with gematria. Given the pics below, I have further reason to believe Judith’s murder was a ritual homicide.</p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/erk9ym.jpeg">https://files.catbox.moe/erk9ym.jpeg</a></p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/98jssi.jpeg">https://files.catbox.moe/98jssi.jpeg</a></p>
<p>I got screen caps that summarize the findings just in case the video gets censored. Judith Barsi in gematria (english) is 121, along with “blood sacrifice”. She was murdered at the age of 121 months, which coincides with the dates of Grand Climax, with the alleged date of death matching 121 again (the preparation for the murder starts here).</p>
<p>Homicide by gunshot (82) matches “sex trafficking”, which is pretty much what happened given how Enty’s Blind Item mentioned how she got passed around.</p>
<p>Now, I name Judith’s true killer. Some of Steven Spielberg’s past victims have come forward. I haven’t heard back in quite a long time, so I’m starting to suspect that the worst has come to pass. If so, the information comes out now as a big fuck you to Pedowood and the Deep State. </p>
<p>I have reason to believe the account given how much of it corresponds to things I have already discovered in the past and goes into additional detail. Be warned, Spielberg is MUCH worse than previously believed</p>
<p>Steven Spielberg is into filming CP and SRA.</p>
<p>Steven Spielberg is part of “The Red Shoe Club”. I have a hunch regarding the victim used for the shoes. Heather O’Rourke. The drugging on rides I believe is done via a drugged mist from the ride’s cooling systems. Given Spielberg’s known ties to Cedars Sinai, having a psychiatrist aiding his crimes is highly plausible. </p>
<p>Hollywood is a major financing arm of the cabal. It is an open secret in Hollywood that Spielberg was involved in Judith’s death. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sephardicstudies.org/b-names.html">http://www.sephardicstudies.org/b-names.html</a></p>
<p>The information I was given in accounts pointed to a man of Israeli birth who is deeply connected to Pedowood and the Deep State as a hitman/trafficker. His DOB and current city location (I have him fully tracked down, but it can’t be linked here legally due to doxxing rules) combined with the above links give me the identity of the true culprit in Judith Barsi’s murder. Danny Kapon (also spelled Capon). Kapon is a Sephardic surname.</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith\'s mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.</p>
<p>-The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans), Danny Kapon. Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).</p>
<p>Accomplices: LAPD, the media, Ruth Hansen?, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, setting them on fire as part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Basically, it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source being programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course the fire destroys the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>

           This chapter looks into some disturbing gematria regarding Judith Barsi’s murder and names the gunman. Normally I don’t buy into such crap, but as I will show, so much of it lines up with what my digs have uncovered that I can’t ignore this. There are no coincidences.

           Although I question the sanity of the author, the gematria analysis regarding Judith Barsi (starting at 9:45) is alarming given earlier threads on this case.

           Kaballah was first translated to english by some very nasty pieces of work.
          </p>
          <p>
           The four links above show that there is some serious occult fuckery (remember “they” are motivated by it) going on with gematria. Given the pics below, I have further reason to believe Judith’s murder was a ritual homicide.

          <p>
           I got screen caps that summarize the findings just in case the video gets censored. Judith Barsi in gematria (english) is 121, along with “blood sacrifice”. She was murdered at the age of 121 months, which coincides with the dates of Grand Climax, with the alleged date of death matching 121 again (the preparation for the murder starts here).
          </p>
          <p>
           Homicide by gunshot (82) matches “sex trafficking”, which is pretty much what happened given how Enty’s Blind Item mentioned how she got passed around.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, I name Judith’s true killer. Some of Steven Spielberg’s past victims have come forward. I haven’t heard back in quite a long time, so I’m starting to suspect that the worst has come to pass. If so, the information comes out now as a big fuck you to Pedowood and the Deep State.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have reason to believe the account given how much of it corresponds to things I have already discovered in the past and goes into additional detail. Be warned, Spielberg is MUCH worse than previously believed
          </p>
          <p>
           Steven Spielberg is into filming CP and SRA.
          </p>
          <p>
           Steven Spielberg is part of “The Red Shoe Club”. I have a hunch regarding the victim used for the shoes. Heather O’Rourke. The drugging on rides I believe is done via a drugged mist from the ride’s cooling systems. Given Spielberg’s known ties to Cedars Sinai, having a psychiatrist aiding his crimes is highly plausible.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hollywood is a major financing arm of the cabal. It is an open secret in Hollywood that Spielberg was involved in Judith’s death.

           The information I was given in accounts pointed to a man of Israeli birth who is deeply connected to Pedowood and the Deep State as a hitman/trafficker. His DOB and current city location (I have him fully tracked down, but it can’t be linked here legally due to doxxing rules) combined with the above links give me the identity of the true culprit in Judith Barsi’s murder. Danny Kapon (also spelled Capon). Kapon is a Sephardic surname.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith's mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans), Danny Kapon. Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LAPD, the media, Ruth Hansen?, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, setting them on fire as part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Basically, it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source being programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course the fire destroys the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.

              The whole thing is very sick. The timing too is shameful. They all know. And they’re taunting us.

            The numbers mean EVERYTHING. The J’s are heavy into it, Kab-alah S8tanists Luclferian etc. Doesn’t matter if you and I don’t believe in the numbers-they do and that’s what matters. Always, always look to the numbers, dates, etc. Yes, this guy sounds fcked up but he speaks the truth. It’s worse than we think...

             Yeah I understand the power of numbers and symbols, but let’s just say, for example, that we’re going with the gematria value of 10 and ALL the time words that fall under that number... does it make all the words that have a gematria value of 10 related to each other, like on an esthetic level, or is it simply letting the “seeker” know the gematria value, nothing more/nothing less?

            I’m well-versed in so many areas of Pizzagate, MK, SRA, etc... but the one thing that I still don’t understand is gematria. I’ve been to several gematria sites and I understand
            <em>
             how
            </em>
            it works.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s say that I gematria my name and the numeric value is 56 and in the list of other words that have a total of 56 are things like bacon, Petri dish, The Amazon.  Well does it mean that all things with the same gematria value are on the same vibration... or exactly what?
