<p>Dr. Pong is a restaurant/ping pong joint at least tangentially related to Alefantis, as they were both involved in transforming the Dupont tunnels into an &quot;art space&quot;, according to this archived document:  <a href="http://archive.is/JoY0a">http://archive.is/JoY0a</a>   (Scroll to the very bottom.)  I seem to remember another connection along the way, but can\'t remember, so if someone could point that out (if it exists), that would be just swell.</p>
<p>I went to the Dr. Pong <a href="http://www.drpong.net/index.php">website</a> (archive found <a href="https://archive.is/i8RKk">here</a>) and clicked around.  Their pages have illustrations, the first two of which seem innocuous enough.  It\'s a Lucha Libre fighter and a gentleman smoking a pipe with a three (?) leaf clover on his hat.  The others, however, are pretty odd. Individually on each:  
</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/eZNMy">An infant</a>, a <a href="https://archive.is/NJ7GT">boy</a>, a <a href="https://archive.is/OKLXW">goat</a>, and a <a href="https://archive.is/37YND">hotdog</a>.</p>
<p>That\'s two pages with children, a code for CP, and a goat, which is featured heavily in Satanic rituals.  
</p>
<p>Rather bizarre for a restaurant/ping pong place which, by the way, does not look very hospitable, as shown on their home page I linked <a href="http://archive.is/i8RKk">earlier</a>.</p>
<p>Under the Linken tab, one of the related websites is GoodandPlenty.de, archive link <a href="https://archive.is/ih15m">here</a>.  If you visit there, you\'ll see an animated gif of a busty young lady dancing in front of photography lights (flashing on and off), with another gif of a hotdog and burger alternating behind her.  There is also a link that says &quot;Click HERE for more super hot shit,&quot; which takes you to this youtube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SchweinpegResearch">https://www.youtube.com/user/SchweinpegResearch</a>, which talks about data compression.  The second video (which is NSFW as it contains a pornographic image) is titled [&quot;The Use of Advanced Data Compression...&quot;] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-fpmy_wJPw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-fpmy_wJPw)</a>) is pretty weird, as it shows an (ironically) poorly compressed video of two guys -- one in sunglasses -- livestreaming while explaining how to compress files.  At a a few points a pornographic woman shows up, as well as a picture of what appears to be a hotdog in a bottle.</p>
<p>This is as far as I\'ve gotten.  If anyone else has advanced this line of investigation, it\'d be appreciated if you linked to it.</p>
<p>There are quite a few links on the Linken page, so have it at it lads.  
</p>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> I would just ask that if you DO find anything, please archive via <a href="https://archive.is">https://archive.is</a> (it\'s fast and efficient) and also provide links in your replies.  We want proof or something close to it.  If you say you found something, <em>show</em> us what you found! Please don\'t be lazy, as otherwise you\'re just giving us the chore of chasing down your supposed lead.  And finally, if you don\'t have proof of it, don\'t claim it as fact.  I\'ve noticed a lot of outlandish (i.e. bizarre and unfounded) claims around here recently that I fear are discrediting the investigation.  Beware the slide.</p>',

            reminds me of the hawaii connection, and that big parties make it easy to make a lot of noise. ravs have been known to go on for 2-3 days sometimes. with that amount of time, you can build a lot.

            Goodandplenty.de is such a creepy website. There's a short conversation in German that plays in the background, a woman laughing and a man saying something like "Ich bin nicht so veil..." I can't get it all. Going through the links on the right hand side, under Mehr Info (more info) you can sign up for news and the "captcha" they have is BIG CHEESE

             Female voice: 'Hey ich hab solche Mützen na.. gesteigt'  -&gt; doesn't make any sense, but I'm absolutely not sure this is correct. It's very hard to really hear what she says. Translation would be something like: 'Hey I have such hats... risen'

            <p>
             Male voice: 'Ich bin nicht soviel schlechtes Deutsch'  -&gt; I could hear this pretty clear it translates to: 'I am not so much bad german (language)'

           <p>
            German language thrives on double meaning and entedre and I believe the below is a code:
           </p>
           <p>
            [1]
Conversation/Intercourse
Participation/Groups
Lesser-mitigated happiness/little death (orgasm)
           </p>
           <p>
            The rest is possibly alluding to sexual styles and themes:
           </p>
           <p>
            [2]
Potentially simulated or dry humping style writhing and touching, some people in the BDSM community get off on not getting off.
           </p>
           <p>
            [3]
Healthy addiction - unsure could use some help?? Maybe relates to normal sex?
           </p>
           <p>
            [4]
Losing definition.. could use help here could be to do with water sports and scat..
           </p>
           <p>
            But heres where I wanted to specifically focus
[5]
Gaining control/losing control - this is heavy in slave/master relationships, and this exact wording is often used in power play between dom and sub..
[6]
Pre-apocalyptic refers specifically to satanic rituals. Heeding sacrifices to stave off certain events or gain some kind of leverage or power.
[7]
Hand eye - dont know could use help
[8]
Feedback play... 
That term play is also heavily used in BDSM circles, its important and feedback is definitely a term but Im not sure what. Potentially fluid swapping, feltching, snowballing, etc
           </p>
           <p>
            [9]
Other games - relates to optional extras like equipement ××
This gamespace paragraph refers to the fact they can move in certain equipment as needed, A frames, pulleys etc for suspension play.
           </p>
           <p>
            [10]
Low resolution alludes to not being able to see the picture properly/make shit fuzzy ××
The next paragraph alludes to the fact they are a front, they are subtley saying they work no holds barred and will accomodate your requests but you better keep your moith shut because we dont want people snopping around capice!
           </p>
           <p>
            Full text provided below for reference (numbered)
Please read through, let me know what you think you can contribute. 
Dont get too distracted by this but the language here is definitely constructed like an ad for something other than whats being said.
           </p>
           <p>
            ============×××××××=============
           </p>
           <p>
            TABLE TENNIS AS A MODEL:
[1]
For conversation, participation, and lesser-mitigated happiness. Interests and themes that motivate our starting are:
[2]
- Un-virtuality (physicality) / real variability.
[3]
- Healthy addiction.
[4]
- Losing defintion between game/sport and �partying�.
[5]
- Gaining control / losing control.
[6]
- Pre-apocalyptic activity.
[7]
- Improvement of eye-hand coordination.
[8]
- �feedback play�.
[9]
OTHER GAMES:
It is intended that the game space has the possibility to itself be played, through the use of mobilized furniture, perpetually changing d�cor, installations, exhibitions, etc. It is thought that there is an appeal to walking in to a room in which one expects to be surprised. For example, the room may be rearranged as necessary in order to suit momentarily changing needs, as in a gymnasium in which sports equipment is moved and exchanged depending upon the activity at hand.
[10]
LOW RESOLUTION:
The organization of the organization, as well as its space, are therefore intended to be less than comprehensively organized. It should be clear what makes up the association and its activities, but less definable in what it produces in the way of a specific atmospheric quality or public image. We, like the public at large, might at times wonder what exactly we�re dealing with here, and never know.

            Tontransfer is just bizarre.  It links to graffiti of a guy holding a mug of beer with the website header saying "YOUTH CAN KISS MY ASS", which it also says on the brick wall by the graffiti.  The site appears to be advertisement for an album release.
