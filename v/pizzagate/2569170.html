<p>After Vatican officials were called to Geneva in May 2014 to respond to tough questions like why the pope believed his responsibility for protecting children against torture only applied on Vatican property, the committee issued its report.</p>
<p>The members “ordered the Vatican to hand over files containing details of clerical sexual abuse allegations to police forces around the world, … to use its authority over the Roman Catholic Church worldwide to ensure all allegations of clerical abuse are passed on to the secular authorities and to impose ‘meaningful sanctions’ on any Church officials who fail to do so.” With the exception of a couple of staged PR events, the pope has refused to take any of these measures.</p>
<p>The Vatican had issued an “Initial Report” preparatory to the hearing. “Nowhere in the Holy See’s [the name of the Church’s global government] Initial Report under the Convention does it make any mention of the widespread and systemic rape and sexual violence committed by Catholic clergy against hundreds of thousands of children and vulnerable adults around the world. There is no mention of acts that have resulted in an astonishing and incalculable amount of harm around the world – profound and lasting physical and mental suffering – with little to no accountability and access to redress …</p>
<p>[T]he Vatican has consistently minimized the harm caused by the actions of the clergy, through both the direct acts of sexual violence and Church officials’ actions which follow, such as cover-ups and victim-blaming. … The Holy See’s Initial Report to this Committee is itself evidence of the minimization of these offenses and the resulting harm.”</p>
<p>The Committee against Torture report came “after senior officials sought to distance the Vatican legally from the wider Church … saying priests were not legally tied to the Vatican but fell under national jurisdictions. But the committee insisted that officials of the Holy See – including the pope’s representatives around the world and their aides – have a responsibility to monitor the behavior of all under their ‘effective control.’”</p>
<p>The committee also urged a “prompt and impartial” investigation in the case of Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, the pope’s nuncio (ambassador) to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Wesolowski solicited sex for money from Santo Domingo’s poorest boys. “We learned from the children that Wesolowski took pictures of them while they were masturbating. Oral sex was performed,” Nuria Piera, an investigative journalist in the Dominican Republic, said. “He abused that poverty and used that mechanism to approach children and take advantage of them for years,” according to Yeni Berenice Reynoso, National District prosecutor.</p>
<p>A dossier accusing Wesolowski of sex abuse of minors was sent to Pope Francis “sometime in July” 2013 by Santo Domingo Cardinal Nicolás de Jesús López Rodríguez. The pope found the information credible enough to dismiss Wesolowski on August 21 via confidential letter. But the pope never reported Wesolowski to civil authorities nor made the information public.</p>
<p>Wesolowski left the country before a local TV program broadcast an exposé on August 31. It was reported in January 2014 that Wesolowski “is now thought to be living in Rome and is protected from extradition by diplomatic immunity.” “For me it was a surprise to see Wesolowski walking along Via della Scrofa in Rome,” Santo Domingo Auxiliary Bishop Víctor Masalles tweeted on June 24, 2014.</p>
<p>Embarrassed, the Vatican announced on June 27 that Wesolowski had been laicized (defrocked) “in the past few days … Measures will be taken so he is in a precise restricted location, without any freedom of movement,” said Vatican spokesman, Fr. Federico Lombardi, without specifying how this would be accomplished. The press reported this as proof of the pope’s “zero tolerance” for child sex abuse.</p>
<p>On September 25, Lombardi said Wesolowski had been put under house arrest inside the Vatican City State “because the Polish prelate represented a flight risk and because Vatican prosecutors feared he might tamper with evidence.”</p>
<p>The next day, the Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Serra reported that Wesolowski was arrested by order of the pope because “there was a serious risk that the nuncio would be arrested on Italian territory at the request of the Dominican authorities and then extradited.” Wesolowski had more than 100,000 computer files of pornography. “Some were downloaded from the internet and others the victims themselves were forced to take. The prelate stored part of this chamber of horrors on his own laptop. The material, which is classified by type, shows dozens of young girls engaged in sexual activities but the preference is for males. Images show youngsters aged between 13 and 17 being humiliated for the camera, filmed naked and forced to have sexual relations with each other or with adults. … Wesolowski is suspected of belonging to an international network that extends well beyond what has emerged so far.”</p>
<p>Pope Francis allowed his prelate 15 months freedom to commit crimes involving child pornography which sometimes involves their tortuous death – something to think about the next time the pope speaks out against the sex trafficking of children.</p>
<p>November 22, 2014: Wesolowski was seen “walking quietly inside the Vatican City…in apparent freedom” and is presumed to still live there under house arrest.</p>
<p>After almost two years, Wesolowski’s trial has not yet begun.</p>

<p>Former nuncio dies in Vatican residence while awaiting sex-abuse trial </p>
<p>Initial results of the autopsy on the body of former archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, who was awaiting trial in the Vatican on charges of child sexual abuse and possession of child pornography, indicate he died late Aug. 27 of a &quot;cardiac incident,&quot; the Vatican said.</p>
<p>Wesolowski was to be the first person to be tried by a Vatican criminal court on sex abuse charges. The first session of the trial had been scheduled for July 11, but was postponed when he was taken to the hospital the day before after suffering &quot;a collapse,&quot; Father Benedettini said. He remained in the hospital until July 17.</p>
<p>Vatican prosecutors listed five charges against Wesolowski, which included having &quot;corrupted, by means of lewd acts, adolescents presumably between the ages of 13 and 16,&quot; in the Dominican Republic, where Wesolowski had served as a Vatican nuncio from 2008 to 2013, when he was accused of abusing adolescent boys.</p>
<p>According to Vatican prosecutors, Wesolowski\'s crimes continued once he was brought back to the Vatican. While being investigated, the court said, he procured and possessed on Vatican City State property &quot;and elsewhere,&quot; a &quot;large amount&quot; of &quot;material from Internet sites&quot; depicting minors under the age of 18 in sexually explicit acts or poses.</p>
<p>He also was charged with causing &quot;serious injury to adolescent victims of sexual abuse, consisting of mental distress&quot; and of &quot;conduct that offends religious principles or Christian morality&quot; by repeatedly logging on to pornographic sites while in the Dominican Republic, Rome, Vatican City State and elsewhere.</p>

           Former nuncio dies in Vatican residence while awaiting sex-abuse trial
          </p>
          <p>
           Initial results of the autopsy on the body of former archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, who was awaiting trial in the Vatican on charges of child sexual abuse and possession of child pornography, indicate he died late Aug. 27 of a "cardiac incident," the Vatican said.
          </p>
          <p>
           Wesolowski was to be the first person to be tried by a Vatican criminal court on sex abuse charges. The first session of the trial had been scheduled for July 11, but was postponed when he was taken to the hospital the day before after suffering "a collapse," Father Benedettini said. He remained in the hospital until July 17.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           According to Vatican prosecutors, Wesolowski's crimes continued once he was brought back to the Vatican. While being investigated, the court said, he procured and possessed on Vatican City State property "and elsewhere," a "large amount" of "material from Internet sites" depicting minors under the age of 18 in sexually explicit acts or poses.

           He also was charged with causing "serious injury to adolescent victims of sexual abuse, consisting of mental distress" and of "conduct that offends religious principles or Christian morality" by repeatedly logging on to pornographic sites while in the Dominican Republic, Rome, Vatican City State and elsewhere.

            Above all the Pope is a Jesuit, the very worst at crimes against humanity. All their fake Catholic Charities and Orphanages where they prey on kids, is becoming so wide spread an unable to keep under wraps. What is astounding is there are grown adults, that are productive members of society and are good people, think this guy is HOLY and the only avenue to god. Amazing.

                 He was sitting in his chair in front of the TV.  A little poison in his tea or wine?  Or they now have perfected that gun.  It is even more efficient than before.  Amazing, just happens to be before the trial.  That jorge guy sure is lucky.

                   And that it was all perfectly arranged.  By the pope no less.  No one can touch him on Vatican Grounds.  The police have no power there.  There are Vatican Guards.  Benedict is under Guard in a Fortress as well. Hmm.  Wonder why they are so heavily guarded. Men of God?  having to protect themselves, seems odd. But when you are responsible or committing crimes against God's Wishes and the Children well, it makes sense.  The Court of Brussels has convicted pope francis and benedict.

             they were covering up for a huge CP Ring that was being run, imo.  The pope condoned CP while harboring and protecting a known Child Pornography Criminal.  He is an accessory to the crime.  jorgio bergoglio has been found guilty by the Brussels Court of Justice and he is guilty of being involved in crimes during the Dirty War.  What more does the world need to know that he should be put in handcuffs by the Italian Police/Interpol and Locked Up?

                The war with Britain appeared to be a relief valve to divert attention from the massive protests in Argentina. War over The Falklands which were literally a pile of crap no one wanted. A weather station and small farms. Still doesn't make sense

                     My friend sent me the oddest thing she saw on this news this morning.  She has not been believing me on much, but I think she hates to admit some of this true.  It is a painting or copy of the Capone Old Rat Lines of Chicago.  An actual MAP!  The problem is it is too small.  Don't know how to enlarge. She is my Chicago connection.  She sends me stuff now and then.
