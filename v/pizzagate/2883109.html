just look at her sketchbooks mainly, her other stuff is highly suspect but none quite like the sketches.

            The concept of artist-patron is very important to them. I remember archiving a lot of artists a few years ago but I lost some references. The Podestas have housed artists and have mentioned who their favorite artists are. That's the easiest way to map their network. I was hoping this would be the artists they housed who draws pictures of baby faces with a red hand holding. I am looking for her name.
           </p>
           <p>
            This artist's style is dark and ugly somewhat brutalist and very mid-century. It's the sort of feeling they like but it's not like the obvious shit other satanic/luciferian artists do. Thanks for keeping this part of the investigation alive.

            Hi AHB. Good to see someone is continuing to dig into this! The submission rules set up by the community to fight disinfo require all major claims in a piece be supported by linked evidence, and there doesn't appear to be any for the above claim. Which images? Why do you think they contain hidden data? I will give you our 24 Hour Grace flair to edit. Otherwise, you'll need to post this in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">

            OTHER GAMES: 
It is intended that the game space has the possibility to itself be played, through the use of mobilized furniture, perpetually changing d�cor, installations, exhibitions, etc. It is thought that there is an appeal to walking in to a room in which one expects to be surprised. For example, the room may be rearranged as necessary in order to suit momentarily changing needs, as in a gymnasium in which sports equipment is moved and exchanged depending upon the activity at hand.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOW RESOLUTION: 
The organization of the organization, as well as its space, are therefore intended to be less than comprehensively organized. It should be clear what makes up the association and its activities, but less definable in what it produces in the way of a specific atmospheric quality or public image. We, like the public at large, might at times wonder what exactly we�re dealing with here, and never know."
