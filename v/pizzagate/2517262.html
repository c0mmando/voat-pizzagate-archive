            I'm an atheist &amp; admit "liking" a lot of the points I THOUGHT the church of Satan was trying to make about the separation of church and state and the creeping religions indoctrination in public schools, but ever since the DNC leaks after over a year of earnest effort trying to work within the democrats (because I'm a naive well meaning idiot and fell for Bernie's fraud), I can't shake the sense that I was helping advance true evil (not supernatural) with every story about them I shared :( ugh.

            For your information it is possible to protect yourself against satanism. Here are some things:
1)use the Name of Jesus Christ (you have to be a Christian)
2)prayer and especially fasting
3)pleading the blood of Jesus Christ
4)if you are being attacked by an illnesses the prayer of agreement with someone else for healing helps
5)certain bible verses are very strong like Proverbs 19:23, especially use and claim Proverbs 19:23
6)put on the full armor of God
7)don’t be terrified by any demon
           </p>
           <p>
            You have authority over demons in the Name of Jesus Christ. They have to obey you if you use that Name. Don’t ever listen to a demon.

             I want to share something with you. You may find it interesesting, maybe not. It’s in terms of the spiritual protection you mentioned above. The resource. I link below is a tad creepy. I found it on accident, shen I was researching how various faiths deal with exorcism. Everything you need to know to get my point is in the title, and maybe the first few sentences. I am uncomfortable even having it on my computer, so I closed the window quick and prayed.

            <p>
             Notice how the satanists have a ritual to exorcise God from their lives... I’ve seen this in written in other places. It says to me very clearly that God’s name is important, whether it be Yahweh, or Jehovah or YHWH... whatever. I have my doubts about “Allah”, but that’s just my opinion. There is “Elohim” and such, but they are just tranlations of the word ‘father’. My belief is that at least making an effort to ‘now and use some form of the divine name, at least in personal prayer, shows a desire for a more personal connection. It shows an intention from the heart, if used in reverence and respect.

             In Genesis, Abraham is described as God’s friend. Also noteworthy, is the idea that Abraham used the divine name. An imperfect man, but he was protected and blessed as a friend of his creator. I want to have a close relationship with god like that. I have been praying and meditating with His name in mind and I feel quite protected.

             You can see the converse in the link I put. His enemies try to remove all trace of Him and His name. You and I both agree, that the enemy has infiltrated all religions. It was happening, even as the first Christian congregations were forming.

             Acts 20:29-30 “I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness, and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             2 Thessalonians 2:18 These men have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are subverting the faith of some.
            </p>

             It’s like Satan started erasing Jesus’ work as soon as it was done! Also, since Jesus’ time; YHWH has been removed from the Bible, a bunch of scriptures have also been added. Torquemada often  quoted some of the added scriptures (“let he who’s without sin throw the first stone...”, etc) to justify the Inquistion. Some of them are beautiful additions, but they are not likely supported by God, since he made a clear instruction to not add or remove anything.

             Anyway, friend, I just wanted to share the benefit of things I have found.

              Satanism is mostly a juvenile lashing out at Christian authority, usually well deserved. Has jack-all to do with the elites.

               Spend a year being recruited by Freemasons and you may be inclined to disagree (however, that is the ‘ Luciferian’ flavor). Read Dave McGowan “Laurel Canyon Days” or google Michael Aquino or Theosophy.

                Not finding anything by David McGowan with that title.  I am familiar with The Temple of Set and Theosophy.  Not quite getting the point you're trying to make.

                </p>
                <p>
                 It is a blog, later compiled into a book. I guess I got the title wrong... Oops. It shows a history of military/occult/elite connections between stars and crimes in the hollywood area, going back to black dahlia. I have found about 85-90% of it to be independently verifiable or corroborate-able. Some is anecdotal from interviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I apologize for my flippant tone; my point is that elites are involved in all of the things I mentioned, and none of it is just "juvenile lashing out". There are real victims and big, wealthy institutions involved.

                  I'll give it a read, thanks for the update.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My real point I've been working to formulate is that Satanism and Luciferianism are tossed around by the pizzagate community without context, and my concern is that this is a deep oversimplification.  Are some the elites invoved in Lovecraft-style occult practices dealing with very real and malevolent forces? I have no doubt in my mind of that.   Are all occultists involved in malevolent practices? Absolutely not.  Then you have the Spirit Cooking crowd who just want something fucked up to partipate in so they can feel edgy; if Spirit Cooking contains any actual occult element, which I highly doubt, then it is lost on the likes of participants such as Podesta and Hillary who would be too stupid to even grasp the concepts involved.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I understand that from a literalist Christian perspective, all of the above would fall into the category of Satanism, but the complexities of the matter make the use of Satanism and Luciferianism as catch-all terms completely ineffective; and severely limit the quality of information that is being transmitted.  Every time I hear those terms tossed around I get angry, because they are disguising a complex matter in simplistic terms, and thus diluting the conversation with what might as well be pure disinformation (well intentioned, I agree)

                   I have been involved with wiccans, masons, metal headed satanists, ouija boards, tarot cards, ghost hunting... all kinds of weird stuff. Mostly, it’s just mumbo  jumbo and assuredly harmless curiosity. But, on more than one occasion, truly messed up and evil things were around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So, with my experience, I assert that the supernatural is real. That’s a shocking claim, I know. The ghost hunting...is fake. The tarot cards? I can’t explain how I got them to work. I AM a scientist. I need rational explanations and evidence. When the supernatural is involved, it is not possible to prove a negative. It always comes down to something the individual experiences, and no one else was around... of course, whenever spoken of hearers respond with “yeah.... right”. And so it goes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As to your astute assertion:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Low level rockers, teenage rebel satanists, Wiccan hippie girls.... appearing harmless and stupid is something that they use in their favor. They are not the focus of our investigation, but you will find in many cases that they have pedo groomers in their ranks. Their leadership may run a stable... and the hierarchy still hypnotizes the lower echelons with sensational promises of power and such.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The big names in our investigation are exactly as you described: a Luciferian cult. They consider the selves high priests, demigods and more. Crazy. I was considering joining Masonry. I had a couple of sponsors. It looked like a great path to success, better than 3 more years of college. I am SOOO glad I took the time to check it out thoroughly.

                    All of your points are appreciated.  I am 100% certain of the existence of the supernatural, and mostly subscribe to the vague yet ominous determinations made by John Keel in his works.  I just never met anyone calling themselves a Luciferian who considered their philosophy much more than a spiritualized version of Libertarianism, and though i don't use the phrase, I would consider myself a Luciferian in that context.  I do need to read more on the subject, granted.

             One could infer that there are many  reading here. Why wouldthey be interested in a public led investigation into elite pedophiles? Weird.Satainist are the epitome of the blinded and hypnotized, IMO.

            Light v Darkness. Who would evil over good? I guess many would if it meant they were "in the club" and would gain riches untold. Maybe this is why people are attracted to Satanism. No church makes a person good or evil. It is what is in the heart that matters.

            Maybe it's nothing ... maybe it's something. - Was a at a bar playing pool with a few buddies a few nights ago. This group of guys came in and were talking for a little while. After a few turns I was just watching my buddies take their turns, and I overheard one of the guys say "Hail Satan" and they all touched glasses. - Couldn't tell if it was a serious or joking comment. - But then I thought that,...if they are young, immature, and impressionable, - this might not mean much. - Was disturbed to say the least. Even if it was a joke.

             There was a time in my youth when my buddies and I would do and say dumb stuff like that. A comment like that doesn’t necessarily reveal what is in someone’s heart. I guarantee that those guys will rub elbows with evil, though, because their comments DO show that they do not monitor their associations. When people do not take any actions to defend themselves, evil moves in. After floating a long like I mentioned above, in a short time, I found myself totally surrounded by satanists. My neighbors and roommates an coworkers. Like this thread, I couldn’t even talk about God or Jesus with being shamed and called stupid. Just like this platform...

            I think if the satanists are pushed back into a corner or we corner them bad enough, they will do a false flag.

                To chime in, I knew back when I was a kid that this was going on because of news reports and having lived in Manhattan Beach during the McMartin case and knowing people whose children were victims.

                Pre internet it seems most people had to either live around it or know someone who did. Now it's possible for everyone to know if they just pay attention.

                  I was just a kid, about the same age as the victims and went to school with some of them. I think I was too young at the time to know what was going on with the parents or why they were doing. There was one neighbor whos kid went to McMartin and was molested. She would cry to my mom a lot. Parents suddenly began watching kids like hawks so no more fun.

            I’m saying all the churches are satanic. The Catholics, Baptists, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians (This is what Trump is), Mennonites, Assembly of God, and so on. Everyone that attends them is possessed. It is not just the Catholic Church with the priests that rape children, there is demonic action in all denominations. You hear about the Catholic Church a lot on Youtube but nothing is said about the Protestant Churches. They are just as bad. The 12 Baptists taking children out of Haiti were no better than the Catholic priests.

             Also True. The True Church of Christ has always been the pre Roman Catholic Orthodox Church. Almost no one in the west even knows it exists.

             You clearly sperging, You entire concept of satan comes from Christianity without it you don't get the antithesis corruption and external pyramid inversion and infiltration which clearly has occurred is a thing, blanket statements are not rational. Also "Baptists" they weren't Baptists that was just a cover, also ignoring freemasonic influences is bad for your eyesight dudddee

             There are some like myself who believe the Abrahamic god is actually the devil. When you look at the Bible and see the amount of people he's murdered, it really makes you think. Personally I think religion and government are two edges of the same sword; follow their rules and you will be okay, break their rules and you go to hell/jail. All a tool to keep people in line. Judging by how the most devout of the three Abrahamic religions act, I don't think this is too far off base. And any time you try to ask rational questions, you're told to have faith. Replacing knowledge with faith is dangerous. Plus you've got rampant pedophilia in Jews (the Ashkenazi, for example), Christianity (the Vatican and all the priests/preachers arrested for pedophilia thus far), and Islam. If there ever was a "good" god, it's been twisted so many times that current religions wouldn't know god if it smacked them in the face.

             I don't think all the churches are satanic. I think they've been infiltrated by Satan and Satanists dressed up to look religious.  This is the MO of the Freemasons--to poison from within. They don't operate transparently and out in the open; they are hidden.

             I was raised Pentecostal (A/G), and I have found so much value in the spiritual perspective it has given me, personally. Fortunately, my church was in a pretty small community with maybe 100 max in attendance each week. I eventually attended an A/G affiliated college, AKA essentially set thousands and thousands of dollars on actual fire. Ha..? While I was there, I saw SO many kids who must have absolutely been abused/diddled growing up in the church. It was like attending university on another planet - everyone was so odd. I actually didn't even realize until a few years after leaving school that the weird kids were just def victims of abuse (and probably never given any way to really cope w abuse later in life.) So yeah, I can say from experience that unfortunately some of the allegations of seen online likely hold some water.
            </p>
            <p>
             Although, I did want to maybe encourage you (if you're a believer) to reconsider any hard stances you may hold towards Pentecostal doctrine generally. Even speaking in tongues, I can tell you that it is unmistakably of God when experienced within the proper understanding and context. Anyway, just wanted to offer you that, not really sure why haha. The end

             I agree as far as the leadership of those organizations. I have personally witnessed corrupt and amoral leadership in Methodist, Mormon and Catholic congregations. I bumbled along through each of those, so I know where your coming from. I do differ from you in respect to the rank and file. I believe there are honest, sincere, kind and peaceful people in any faith. I know it’s true, because I have met many. There is a strategy, a mandate of spiritual evil to corrupt the good and debase the innocent and unknowing, and to trap people in guilt and corruption. So it stands to reason that truly, spiritually evil ones would take delight in worming themselves into the top of a spiritual group, to sabotage their spirituality. That’s just my opinion, tho. We had a talk about this before on voat. Sorry if I made you self conscious by pinging you!

            I don’t know why you are all so
Interested in me? Our churches are all satanic. I know they are. If the churches are satanic, there has got to be evidence of that. People just aren’t looking at the details. Like someone else said on here. The devil is in the details. Like someone else said nothing is a coincidence.

             You can't really state with any truth that ALL churches are satanic if you haven't been to all churches! I understand the general point you are making, but again, the absolute certainties in which you speak undermine your argument and lead me to question your processing skills.

             I was trying to find a resource about demons/abuse in Protestant churches to respond to you question... that’s when I stumbled onto this satanic stuff. I have been sorta cognitively dissonant about the blatant satanism in the US and UK. This search result reminded me that these people are inescapably real. Anyway, I only pinged you because I thought it might spark your interest. I still agree with your post, I am just having a challenge in finding a focused or concise listing of non-catholic corruption in religions. I know there is plenty. Wasn’t Crowley Presbyterian or such?idunno. I’m getting some shut eye. I will try again tomorrow.

               No...I think his bio purports that he rebelled against a strict (Presbyterian?) Christian upbringing. I am not prepared to suggest a connection to evil for Presbyterians or accuse them. My bad... I do want to show that the blanket religion doesn’t offer true protection. It’s an axiom, but a good one: “It’s what’s on the inside that counts”. If someone is aware of their spiritual requirements, and the love and appreciate God and life... it’s not about which flag they wave or what symbolism they bow down to. Crowley shows that evil can pop up anywhere, even in a faithful family.

                Oh I get you I was mroe trying to correct the tone of the original shit stirrer who apparently thinks subversion and hijacking hasn't occurred which it clearly has and is historically documented. WCC, NCC, and masonic/political orgs musling in. Think Alinksy in Lavay clothes.

              It wouldn't surprise me Crowley was Presbyterian. He would have been possessed while he was in the Presbyterian Church. Once they leave the church they really go off the deep end. Trump is Presbyterian. Hillary was Methodist.

              I know. That is the problem I’ve had too over the years. We need to look and dig about the Non-catholic churches because it is there. Just do a search for Mennonite/crimes, Baptist/crimes, Presbyterian/crimes, and so on. Sometimes the crimes are right in front of our faces but we refuse to believe it, like the Baptist missionaries stealing children out of Haiti. There is only so much I can do cause this is the strong delusion. Talking to people will not get people to see the delusion.
