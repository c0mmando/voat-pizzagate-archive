           Film in question is Blame It On Rio, a vile film that promotes statutory rape. Pervy director is Stanley Donen. "Big Cheese is likely Larry Gelbart. "Lisa" is Michelle Johnson (16 at the time of these incidents). A list television actress is Demi Moore (she may very well be yet another pedowood victim). Michael Caine has a history of sex acts with underage girls. Plausibility of involvement in "2nd incident" is likely. His past statements are likely to cover his own ass.

            Michael Caine did a movie in 1978, filmed in 77?, called California Suite
           </p>
           <p>
            Hannah Warren (Jane Fonda) is a Manhattan workaholic who flies to Los Angeles to retrieve her teenaged daughter Jenny (played by Dana Plato) after she leaves home to live with her successful screenwriter father Bill (Alan Alda). The bickering divorced couple is forced to decide what living arrangements are best for the girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dana had to be 13 or 14 yrs old

            (film)
           </p>
           <p>
            Dana also did Diff'rent Strokes 1978–1986
           </p>
           <p>
            During her years on Diff'rent Strokes, Plato struggled with drug and alcohol problems. She admitted to drinking alcohol, and using cannabis and cocaine, and she suffered an overdose of diazepam when she was 14

            Michael Caine   is involved with a charity that connects to Richard House Children's Hospice.  Somehow this makes me uneasy.
           </p>
           <p>
            'Since I became a patron of The Foresters’ Fund for Children, I have seen many changes, not least the increase in the number of children helped by the Fund. I am proud that the Foresters’ Fund for Children concentrates most of its efforts on the small, primarily local charities throughout the UK that do important work with abused, vulnerable and disabled babies and children'.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of their Events was at Richard House Children's Hospice House

            Children’s palliative care seeks to provide a child with the best quality of life possible from the time that they are diagnosed with a palliative care need until the point where specialist palliative services are no longer required, or until the end of their life. Palliative care isn’t just about physical care such as pain relief, but also emotional, social and spiritual support.

           <p>
            McNall claimed to have made his initial fortune as a coin collector, though Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving claimed he smuggled art antiquities
           </p>
           <p>
            On December 14, he pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiracy and fraud, and admitted to bilking six banks out of $236 million over a ten-year period.[3] He was sentenced to 70 months in prison. Immediately after his conviction, it emerged that his free-spending ways had put the Kings in serious financial jeopardy. They were ultimately forced into bankruptcy in 1995.[7] The financial problems from the McNall era plagued the Kings for several years afterward

            Michael Caine

           <p>
            He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1992 Queen's Birthday Honours,[51] and in the 2000 Birthday Honours he was knighted as Sir Maurice Micklewhite CBE by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.[52][53] In a tribute to his background, he stated: "I was named after my father and I was knighted in his name because I love my father. I always kept my real name—I'm a very private and family-orientated person."[54] In 2000 he received a BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award.[55]
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is he trying to hide that he is Jewish?  I am not positive that he is, but his father sent him to a Jewish school when he was 11 and he speaks Yiddish.  I have nothing personal against Jews really, but when he is trying to hide something I must wonder why.

             I have never liked him.  He always gave me the creeps but I never knew why.  Ever I have learned of pizzagate, I just know he must be a sick pervert.  Yes, many of them use playing opposite as a ruse.  That is the oldest trick in the book.  He has learned this from acting rolls in the movies.  Remember these actors know how to convince, it is just like grooming.
