            The law is there to placate the public.  They had no intention of putting it to good use.  Can you imagine anyone in Tinsel Town wanting to go through this?  They should actually include Producers and Directors.  How would that turn out for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Anyone working with Children should have to pass this.  Possibly might have saved the lives of many including J Barsi and Heather O. Another Child Protection Act that does nothing for Our Children but protects their Abusers.  Shameful.

              Yeah, that's weird. The correct verbiage is 'grace period'.
             </p>

              'Honeymoon period' is used in relationships, after you first start dating someone.

               What a sick term to use.  These people are demented beyond repair.  And grace?  They have none and I venture to say they have never said it before a meal.  This is so shameful.
