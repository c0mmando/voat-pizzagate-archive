<p>First of all, each section of the website is in it\'s own PHP file, which is weird considering PHP is used to make sites websites more dynamic and responsive, with many moving parts that can be called upon separately. Whereas a traditional web element is (more or less) read line by line and presented in that order, and this may be oversimplifying, PHP calls for data from other locations and responds to that data accordingly, giving it &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;memory&quot; so to speak, almost like it\'s software. </p>
<p>So what\'s the big deal? Well, the Dr. Pong website <em>isn\'t dynamic at all</em>. In fact, it doesn\'t really do anything outside of linking to other places.</p>
<p>In particular, under the Bilder (Images) section, none of the links on that page do anything at all other than change the url to a different PHP file, also notice how Galerie 1 starts off with &quot;005&quot; and ends with Galerie 4 &quot;008&quot;</p>
<p>Gallery 1: <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=005_Galerie_1">http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=005_Galerie_1</a></p>
<p>Gallery 2: <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=006_Galerie_2">http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=006_Galerie_2</a></p>
<p>Gallery 3: <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=007_Galerie_3">http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=007_Galerie_3</a></p>
<p>Gallery 4: <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=008_Galerie_4">http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=008_Galerie_4</a></p>
<p>When you click on the pictures, essentially the same thing happens. There\'s no pop up, and the website doesn\'t respond at all outside of changing the URL. This time, however, they all change to the same place, Galerie 5 (009) and have a &quot;zoom number&quot; amended to them. Each picture has a unique zoom number. </p>
<p>Clicking the guy in headphones in Gallery 1 gives you <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=009_Galerie_5&amp;zoom=2">http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=009_Galerie_5&amp;zoom=2</a></p>
<p>Clicking the guy in headphones in Gallery 2 gives you <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=009_Galerie_5&amp;zoom=2">http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=009_Galerie_5&amp;zoom=2</a></p>
<p>Clicking the woman making kissy lips in Gallery 3 gives you <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=009_Galerie_5&amp;zoom=7">http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=009_Galerie_5&amp;zoom=7</a></p>
<p>Clicking the woman making kissy lips in Gallery 4 gives you <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=009_Galerie_5&amp;zoom=7">http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php?gallery=009_Galerie_5&amp;zoom=7</a></p>
<p>At first I thought there was just an error in the code, and it very well might be just that, but the more I looked at it, the more I got the feeling it was designed like that intentionally.</p>
<p>People have already pointed out that some of the videos on the other sites may use steganography or similar methods to encode things into videos. There are also <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Wy6z5">weird discrepancies</a> with the background images.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://archive.is/iW54E">this strange page</a> which is <em>not</em> a php file, but instead a subfolder, and doesn\'t appear to be linked to anywhere on the site.</p>
<p>My guess would be that the &quot;Bilder&quot; page--or less likely the entire site--works as a login screen and a particular order of clicks is the code to get past it. Once past that, you\'re directed to a landing page (admin) where you\'re prompted for a second, traditionally typed password. I would imagine there are gigs and gigs of child pornography inside, and probably a fairly large community. Operating out of Germany is probably their safest course at the moment.</p>
<p>It makes sense that Alefantis would dip his toes in to pornography, the market for it is significantly bigger than prostitution clients.</p>',

          </p>
          <p>
           So what's the big deal? Well, the Dr. Pong website
           <em>
            isn't dynamic at all

           People have already pointed out that some of the videos on the other sites may use steganography or similar methods to encode things into videos. There are also
           <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Wy6z5">
            weird discrepancies
           </a>
           with the background images.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is also
           <a href="https://archive.is/iW54E">
            this strange page
           </a>
           which is
           <em>
            not
           </em>
           a php file, but instead a subfolder, and doesn't appear to be linked to anywhere on the site.
          </p>

           My guess would be that the "Bilder" page--or less likely the entire site--works as a login screen and a particular order of clicks is the code to get past it. Once past that, you're directed to a landing page (admin) where you're prompted for a second, traditionally typed password. I would imagine there are gigs and gigs of child pornography inside, and probably a fairly large community. Operating out of Germany is probably their safest course at the moment.

                   Thanks. Also corresponds to numbers of 3, 13, 16, 18, 22, and 24. Doesn't mean anything to me at the moment, but will take a closer look. Peteczar may be right in that it's just for portraits.

                   But it's a weird page. Either the programmer behind it isn't very good, or is pretending to not be very good. Would run some analysis on the server, but with the heat this case has on it, and all the eyes around, I'm sure even that might find me with Feds at the door.

                     Yeah, it's odd. Steganalysis isn't coming up with anything, though it's possible they're using a different method than what I can detect. None of the images seem to have embedded files through rar/zip extraction.

                     I'll have to let others do it, if they are so inclined. I seem to have attracted some attention, perhaps from certain comments on prominent sites. Two weeks ago I was getting doorbell rings at 11P-1A. Could be neighborhood kids, but I doubt it - pretty sure I've made the naughty list.

            you can see my submissionhistory to get an idea that im no shill, but I will suggest you that you probably keep a low profile for now with this so we can go cracking the login before they take that shit down
           </p>
           <p>
            maybe you can delay your post for a day and we go to work?

            that means removing it for now by edit.

            I know nothing about any of this, but the Dr. Pong website has long be concerning to me. I hope we get to the bottom of it. I don't know why it would even be up at this point still if it were as bad as it seems however.
