1. Wikileaks, where this all broke. Gathering the most incriminating emails. I suggest focusing only on the ping pong story as that\'s what were here fore.

            I'm not here for "the ping pong story".  They are, at most, just one element of the far larger situation.  I'm here for all of it.
