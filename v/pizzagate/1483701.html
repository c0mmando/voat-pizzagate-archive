<p>With that line of thinking there would be three best places to start digging again
1. Wikileaks, where this all broke. Gathering the most incriminating emails. I suggest focusing only on the ping pong story as that\'s what were here fore.

3. History, the elites past of pedophilia around the world. </p>

            I'm not here for "the ping pong story".  They are, at most, just one element of the far larger situation.  I'm here for all of it.
