            A guy I follow did a live stream periscope video at Comet, he had not said anything offensive whatsoever. He didnt even title the stream anything negative except "Dinner at comet", after about 8 minutes inside the creepy dude brought in two police offficers and made him leave. There were back rooms sheilded off with curtains and definitely kids, around 9 pm at night.

            I think it's going too far. I understand the rationale, but remember that Jimmy Comet/James Alefantis got onto the radar through: (1) the Podesta emails; (2) his status as one of the most influential people in DC; (3) his creepy posts and pics (all public); (4) his weird exchanges (all public)l (5) the use of bizarre art in a family friendly eatery; (6) the strange videos, alliances, tunnels and holes, coffins, and locked underground bunkers that were captioned with hashtag #murder. Oh, and then there are the eating children for dinner posts. The employees? So far, there's nothing to prove any of them did anything other than show up to work for what they think is a cool place. IMHO, stick with the bigger players. If any of the workers are involved, and this ever does pan out into an investigation, IF a server knows something, they can be used to prosecute. They might be seeing things that are strange, but never had a context to put it. Better to curry favor and try to get them to speak, and if you put them on the side of Alefantis, it's not going to happen. It's also very unfair. Let's reverse the situation. Would you like your real name exposed and printed on the web as participating in this? I don't think many of us would like it. I'm for leaving them alone, but I do understand your logic.

            Here is the problem. If I wanted to be a total nutcase, you just handed me about everything I need to start finding them and cyber stalking them. Or maybe just looking at their public info. Perhaps I find a false positive on the sex registry. Same name but different person. Then I post that I found a pedophile working at Comet Pizza as a waitress named Silly Sue. Now you have a real life victim, with real life damages, with legitimate grudge against not just you, but the entire community.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it is a bridge too far and leads to nothing good. What? You think some waitress that doesn't even make minimum wage is in on a child trafficking ring? That is all after hours shit. She probably thinks he sells a little blow on the side or something if she suspects anything. You don't let people making minimum wage privy to illegal things. That isn't how trafficking anything works... for long. The whole risk/reward for them is wrong. Turnover is wrong. Just wrong wrong. Wrong.

             I couldn't agree more. I'm fully behind this pizza investigation, but this is too far IMHO. Working in a place like this, especially under these circumstances, I doubt the workers would know ANYTHING of value. They may have suspicions, but putting them out here like this will only encourage people to harass these people. Think about how much attention pizzagate is getting and how much traffic Voat is getting now. This likely will not be "good for business."

            I haven't even added much to the discussion, and I've already been accused of being a shill. So, one shill manouver is to call users shills too. I think the best thing to do is ignore and move on, and perhaps report them when the trolling is obvious.

            I do think you should put the names of Comet staff out there for investigation (not harassment)  but not in text that will be indexed by search engines to their names (at least not until there's hard proof). Put it all on an image file and link to the image file in your post.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's quite possible a good number of the staff are ignorant to what's going on after hours and they shouldn't be needlessly associated to the crimes that take place here unless there's very good reason to suspect that.

             The problem is once the names are out you don't get to decide if it's used for investigation or harassment. It's up to each person what they do with the info. And plenty will use it for harassment. This is exactly what got the pizzagate subreddit closed.

            I've been posting on this topic since Spirit Cooking broke on Reddit.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's actually a reasonable discussion for the group to decide if there are 'doxxing' dangers in naming folks on this site because they are related to the players or business in some respect.  Does everyone working there warrant for that reason alone the sharing of their personal info?   A discussion worth having IMHO.
           </p>
           <p>
            Certainly public figures such as Jimmy Comet who have posted publicly sick photos, comments, and can't sue absent a showing of actual malice can be discussed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does that go for the dish cook at Comet Pizza?
           </p>
           <p>
            Worth discussing.

             My opinion tldr: anyone who publicizes his life is a public person. There is absolutely no justification of not being able to talk about public information. If people don't want their secrets out, keep them secret. Before the ban I was willing to be careful, not putting the names in full text so it didn't get indexed, etc. Not because I had to, but because I felt like behaving like a gentleman. NOT ANY LONGER. This is motherfucking war.

              For legal issues, a public figure (Jimmy Comet) can't easily sue over personal info and accusations as long as done without a specific showing of malice (knowing something is a lie and doing it to harm that person).   these other folks though aren't public figures (having facebook alone doesn't make you public figure) and could sue those sharing the info or moderating the site.   I think that's your problem with the war.

            I guess it was to be expected. It's a campaign they're leading - 1) Propaganda campaign in all the mainstream media, 2) national security letter &amp; gag order sent to u/spez to force him to close the sub (which made him sabotage his company like the lavabit or truecrypt founders did)  3) suspected fake "interview" of someone "harassing" alefantis (poor alefantis, give me a fucking break!). 4) now this. it makes sense, I would have done it in their place too. But we need to be absolutely sure before we call anyone a shill, might be demoralizing for a good-intended researcher (that's also part of the plan, divide and conquer). Actually best thing is to discuss their tactics so we're made stronger, but refrain from pointing fingers, just know they're there and ignore them. This if confirmed can (should) actually make us stronger, more resilient, grow the solidarity between us

             Your intentions are good, but I would suggest editing your "side note" and include an intro stating that these people should be considered innocent until we find suspicious shit on them. Unfortunately it reads like a call to arms which is why you have people trying to protect the "subverse". Shills are here but we shouldnt be quick to fight against each other. They want us to implode. Divide and we are conquered.
