<p>With fingers crossed, the old rabbit\'s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .</p>
<p>So, I figured what the hell lets research some stuff on Moloch. Here is what I found. Yes, I know its wikipedia, but the info is consistent with other websites.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch</a></p>
<p>Moloch (Masoretic מֹלֶךְ mōlek, Greek Μολόχ) is the Biblical name relating to a Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice.</p>
<p>Who are the Canaanites?
List of their Deities: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Canaanite_religion#Beliefs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Canaanite_religion#Beliefs</a>
Canaanites come from a region called Canaan and is the equivalent of modern day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. Canaan was the region described as the Promised Land to the Hebrew people. In the Bible, the Canaanites were one of ten civilizations marked for extermination by the Hebrew God for their crimes against humanity. Their practices included rape, homosexuality, incest, beastiality, cannibalism and human sacrifice, including the worst of all kinds, child sacrifice (reference Moloch). The english word \'cannibal\' comes from the combination of two words: Canaan and one of their Gods, Ba\'al. The Hebrew culture as a result became intertwined with the Canaanites, and from my research I\'ve concluded that Canaanites were forced underground by the Hebrews because of punishments for their behavior.
<a href="http://www.whale.to/c/curse_of_canaan.html">http://www.whale.to/c/curse_of_canaan.html</a></p>
<p>Then I got to thinking about their practices we are currently looking into regarding the podesta emails. We know podesta had cannibal art hanging in his office. The very foundation of this investigation is about Child abuse, molestation, rape and maybe even murder or sacrifice. Alefantis had instagram posts with a trio of people kneeling with strange masks on, leading us to believe it was apart of some strange ceremony or ritual. We have seen the strange behavior with this luzzato individual with her very own kids. The canaanites were open to sacrificing their first born children for demented benefits from the deities they worship.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sacrifice">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sacrifice</a></p>
<p>Why is a Canaanite deity for fire and child sacrifice appearing in the Clinton emails?</p>
<p>For the record, when I started researching this I wasn\'t forcing my research in any which direction. This was the conclusion my research led me down, and the facts known in this investigation thus far is consistent with Canaanite beliefs. I\'ve also noticed a lot of shills attempting to point this investigation towards the Jewish culture. By my research, Its easy to conclude that the Canaanites did not much appreciate the Hebrews for imposing themselves on their lands and claiming it as their Promised Land.</p>
<p>This is my best theory I\'ve come across since the beginning of this mess. Everything known in the investigation points me in this direction. I\'ve told my older brother of what I\'ve come across. He is the one who turned me on to alternative media like zerohedge and has been ushering me towards the truth. My brother is skeptical of the same global establishment I am and frequently reads many articles and told me he is aware of the canaanites based on various articles he has bookmarked and will link to me. He also referred me to begin looking into the phoenicians, so I will follow up with more on this chain of research.</p>
<p>I\'m sure I may have accidentally left out some things, so I will edit the post with any updates that I recall.</p>',

            Hey, you don't have to yell at me. I'm saying that John officially stated it, but yes it is written that it's Jesus's words, as are most of the rest of Bible, yet it does not say anywhere, "Jesus said" in reference to the Synagogue of Satan.

            I would have  to  disagree with that; the Ibiru  or  Hebrews had common language and cultural  traits with their neighbors, the Hebrews themselves  practised many of the customs and practises associated with Satanism  today  at various  times  in  their  history, including the worship of Moloch with  child sacrifices, as recorded even in their OT, 
 however at  least by Biblical  times they  had clearly established their  concept  of a monotheistic God, and the  use of "Elohim" in its context   suggests the  meaning of "God of gods"

            Yes  the  Canaanites  lived  along the  coast of what  is  now  Israel, to  my  recollection; the  Hebrews, who  were  know as the "Hibiru" or "cut throats," were a tribe(s) of land pirates, they were brutal, untrustworthy,
and the  scourge of the traders and  travelers moving along this corridor; they were known as a tribe that invented very little, but rather  adopted the  customs and stories of their neighbors, and were known to take such things and perhaps make them work even better, hence  their religion and writings are a  compendium of the  many  cultures they  came  into  contact with, all the  major myths in the  OT derive from  much earlier  cultures and religions, Egypt, Greece, etc.
  The  Zionist  Jews,  or  Ashkenazim, who are  not  Semitic at all, but a Russian/Eastern European tribe that  adopted  Judaism in 5th Cent AD are the  leading political/religious sect  of the  Jews  today that control the  World, and its checkpoints  of power, Federal  Reserve, State  Dept, etc.
   I  have seen research that  claims the  inner circle  of this secret  society (Zionists) are Canaanites, but I have not reached the  threshold of belief on  this, sorry no references,  just off top  of my  head,  long time since I was  in  Seminary:)

            Your research is accurate. A few additional notes: Of the twelve tribes of Jews, two of the tribes were noted for unorthodox beliefs and pagan practices, Dan and Benjamin. These two tribes ended up at war with the other ten and migrated out of the Near East to Europe and elsewhere. They revere ancestral blood and try to keep their bloodlines pure (see Rockefellers, Bushes, etc.). Frequently, their firstborn will die unexpectedly (e.g., Robin Bush), but they are actually sacrificed in the manner of the patriarch Abraham, ready to sacrifice his firstborn to the Old Testament gods. Moloch is the god of sacrifice. They think their family will be blessed by it. These are often Masonic Jews and members of B'nai B'rith, who keep their true religion secret and pretend to be Christian. See Skull &amp; Bones initiation ritual of enforced sodomy, etc. These were the practices of ancient Sodom and Gomorrah that caused the leveling of those cities because of their evil practices.

            It's a reasonable theory, the curse of Canaan was due to sexual immorality. Not paedophilia though, but homosexual rape.

             I agree with you. I refuse to believe the Rothschilds, if they were actual Jews, would let 6 million Jews get massacred with all that money and power that they have always had.

            "During the incident of the golden calf, after Moses had just received the commandments, Moses called for those who were on the Lord’s side to come stand with him (Exodus 32:26). The Levites stood with him and were commanded to go through the camp and kill anyone who persisted in the idolatry. Three thousand men were killed that day."
           </p>
           <p>
            "People may argue and say, 'But the Bible says ‘Thou shalt not kill,'' and I will argue back and say that Moses slaughtered the worshippers of the golden calf after bringing down the Law which said, “Thou shalt not murder.”
           </p>
           <p>
            "In a Christian war, the cause must be just, and never for the sake of killing or tyranny. It must be a war in which believers are fighting against evil men, bent on persecuting and slaughtering the Church in the advancement of an evil ideology."
           </p>
           <p>
            "When a young man informed St. Paul that Jewish bandits were determined to kill him, did he say, “I will stay put and let them kill me, since we do not fight against flesh and blood”? No, he had the story reported to the chief captain, who in turn had organized 470 Roman warriors to protect Paul"
           </p>
           <p>
            "If any one of the Jewish bandits arrived to try to kill Paul, the soldiers protecting him would have not hesitated in slaying the attacker. And Paul would not have had a problem with this."
           </p>
           <p>
            "If Paul can use an army to protect himself against persecutors, the Church, then, is justified in using armies to protect itself against any pagan or heretical group which seeks the blood of Christians."
           </p>
           <p>
            "That Christians, as early as the 4th century, were executing wars against pagans, shows in fact how militaristic the spirit of Christianity truly is. "
           </p>
           <p>
            "The knight of Christ, I say, may strike with confidence and succumb more confidently. When he strikes, he does service to Christ, and to himself when he succumbs. Nor does he bear the sword in vain. He is God’s minister in the punishment of evil doers and the praise of well doers. Surely, if he kills an evil doer, he is not a man-killer, but, if I may put it, an evil-killer. Clearly he is reckoned the avenger of Christ against evildoers, and the defender of Christians."
           </p>
           <p>
            "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."

            I don't think it's correct to say they are Canaanites, since the Canaanites were an ancient group of people not a religion. A person that has lived in American for many generations but had grandparents that came from France is an "American" not "French". The religion that these people practice is Luciferianism, which is the worship of Lucifer and other fallen angels. A "devil" is a fallen angel, and Satan is their leader, but there is more than one devil.

            I've done a lot of research into Luciferianism and the occult, long before pizzagate. I could write a book on the topic, but I feel that getting too far into the religions aspect would be a distraction. It doesn't matter if they eat babies because "God" tells them to, or because they like the taste of baby. What's important is stopping them from doing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, reading the comments I'm seeing some recurring points of confusion and I wanted to clear a few things up.
           </p>

            <li>
             <p>
              These are Luciferians, which I call "Lucies" for short. (They have a lot of 'splainin to do.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              In Genesis, there are two brothers, Jacob and Esau. Esau gets renamed Edom and Jacob gets renamed Israel. (Genesis 36:1 "NOW these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom"). 
The phrase "Children of Israel" literally means the descendants of Jacob, not the people from a country. Israel is a person, not a place.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Edom's children are called "Edomites" and Jacob's/Israel's children are "Israelites". The Israelites are God's chosen people. The Edomites hated God (they choose to consort with devils), so God hates them. The Israelites were the ones who escaped Egypt in exodus, and made a covenant with God at the foot of Mount Sinai. Decedents of the Israelites that keep God's law (Torah) are Jews. Later on, the Edomites intermingled with the Israelites, and adopted (or pretended to adopt) Judaism. The Edomites call themselves Jews but are not Jews.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            See Revelation 2:9 - "I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan."
           </p>
           <p>
            Also Malachi 1:1-3 - "The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi. I have loved you, saith the LORD . Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the LORD : yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness."
           </p>
           <p>
            IMPROTANT: Jews are not the enemy. Jews are the good guys. It's a group of devil worshiping people who are not Jews but claim to be Jews that are the problem.

             The Catholic Church is not New Babylon/Mystery Babylon or the Beast(s) from revelation. This is waaaay too long and complicated to get into here, but if you want to get into it, get an Authorized King James bible and start with Revelation 17. Here's an excerpt, "And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Know that "lie upon many waters" means made up of many diverse groups of people, and "fornication" means unethical business dealings with other nations, rather than sexual acts. Mystery Babylon is a country, that, like Ancient Babylon, is made up of many diverse people from all over the world, has many natural resources, has many rich merchants, and people who do business with this country also become rich. It is also a land that will be overrun with evil and eventually destroyed. Know any countries like that?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Whore of Babylon is not Mystery Babylon, but an icon that represents the wickedness of Babylon. Someone pointed out that Clinton wore Purple during her concession speech. She also had a custom-made scarlet pants suit in the first debate. The Lucies know their Bible better than many Christians. This was not an accident.

             OK, this last part isn't for everyone. I think God created cognitive dissonance to protect people who aren't supposed to know things from knowing them. Knowledge is a heavy burden. He that hath ears, let him hear.

           </ol>

            Moloch is the devil, a fallen angel. The phrase "sons of God" means angels in the Old Testament. According to Genesis and the Book of Enoch, the fallen angels had sex with human women, and that's where the giants (also called Nephelim) came from.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gen 6:2 "That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose."
           </p>
           <p>
            Gen 6:4 "There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown".
           </p>
           <p>
            God sent the flood to destroy the bodies of the Nephelim, but their souls were preserved, and trapped behind a barrier called "the veil" or "the fire". What we call "demons" are  actually the souls of the Nephelim, and they are a soul that is part human and part devil. They are literally the devils children, but also part human.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bible uses the phrase "pass through the fire to Molech". eg:
           </p>
           <p>
            Leviticus 18:21 "And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech".
           </p>
           <p>
            2 Kings 23:10 "...that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech."
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people think this means to burn children as an offering. It does not. The word "fire" in this context is capitalized in the Koran. "The Fire" is a phrase used to refer to The Veil or The Rubicon- what today we would call a dimensional barrier that separates parallel worlds. They didn't have quantum physics back then. Basically, you have demons that are here on this earth (3d dimension) now (4th dimension) but can't interact with us because of the wall (fire/veil, 5th dimension) that God put in place to keep the demon realm separate from the human realm.
           </p>
           <p>
            When humans engage in sexual acts, spiritual "doorways" are opened to create a new soul for the child being conceived. But, through a very nasty occult ritual, it is possible to force these doorways open in children through ritual sexual abuse, which allows a demon to come through the veil and take the place of the child's soul. You then have a demon in a corporal human body, and most people cannot tell the difference, because it walks like you and talks like you, but it's actually someone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            These Nephelim in human bodies then become agents for the devil and gain places of power (politics, celebrities, the media) to help accomplish the devils goals on earth. I suspect that the "success rate" is low, and the kids that they can't posses get used as blackmail sex toys or are ritually murdered.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also believe that the original soul remains attached to the body, so possessed people appear to have multiple-personality disorder. This is why many celebs have MPD, and sometimes speak out and then are rushed to a hospital with a fake illness. Because the real person is talking because the demon temporarily lost control

             Lots of truth in this post. This is the best explanation for "why" ritual sexual abuse of children occurs in these circles, that I've seen. I see you've been doing your homework.
"Knowledge is a heavy burden". Truth.

            Initiates into the 'mysteries' believe that YHVH is the god of evil, and Lucifer the god of good. Therefore, from their own perspective - they are doing their Lords work.
           </p>
           <p>
            To quote initiate Elphias Levi:
"What is more absurd and more impious than to attribute the name of Lucifer to the devil, that is, to personified evil. The intellectual Lucifer is the spirit of intelligence and love; it is the paraclete [an advocate]; it is the Holy Spirit, where the physical Lucifer is the great angel of universal magnetism"
           </p>
           <p>
            This ties back into the Cain/Abel story where Cain felt betrayed by YHVH and Lucifer presented himself to Cain as a benevolent deity who could give him his hearts desire, thru the killing of Abel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lucifer was originally a being of beauty and light. This is the great deception.

            I have very similar interests. The thing we gotta remember about the Revelation story, is that, in the end, the good guys win!...and we are WAAAAY past the level of depravity that led YHVH to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, so yes. It's time.

             Throwing out the baby with the bathwater, eh? 
"It is widely agreed" - with all due respect: Wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             From "The Two Babylons" by Hisplop:
The word Cahna is the emphatic form of Cahn. Cahn is "a priest," Cahna is "the priest". Priests of Nimrod or Baal were required to eat of the human sacrifices; and thus it has come to pass that "Cahna-Bal," * the "Priest of Baal," is the established word in our own tongue for a devourer of human flesh."
            </p>
            <p>
             This is just one example of many such stipulations. It is not 'widely agreed'. With respect, I submit that you look further than wikipedia before making such declarations. I further request that you remove this flair, as the crux of this post is not etymology but rather history - the flair will have a detrimental effect upon the other fantastic information which has been presented here. Thank you.

               Indeed. I simply dispute that it is "widely agreed" and further state that since the crux of this post is not etymology that your flair will have the misleading effect of bringing the other (historically accurate) information presented here into question. People need to see this post, flairing it in such a way will deter potential visitors.

                I think agreement of every singly dictionary source is a fairly wide agreement.  You still haven't provided even a single link to back up the etymology you claim.

                 With respect, I'm not the OP. That said, I did provide a source (in the form of a book) in my response to your post.  I'm unsure if the book is available online but within this page some quotes from said book are discussed, regarding said etymology:
                 <a href="http://www.piney.com/Hisl71.html">
                  http://www.piney.com/Hisl71.html
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is also another book called "Curse of Caanan" which talks about this etymology, which is the source for OP's claim. Here are direct excepts from that book which are pertinent to this debate:
                 <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/curse_of_canaan.html">
                  http://www.whale.to/c/curse_of_canaan.html
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Caribs came from somewhere - their words came from somewhere - and had their own etymology ((from somewhere)). They didn't just magically come up with the word, and we are talking about civilizations here (Phoenicians/Caananite) which existed LONG before the Caribs. The words Cahn and Baal are Phoenician/Hebrew. I stipulate, along with many others, that while Caribs may be one of the first on record in modern history to use this word - the word did not originate with them. Recognizing that Priests of Baal ate the flesh of their sacrifices only reinforces this assertion.

            Excellent job. I'm still on the fence with this but won't deny that the correlations are pretty intense. Even the widespread push for abortion rather than other ways of handling accidental pregnancies, fits into child sacrifice themes when you think about it. Definitely something to ponder.

            Had a similar experience with a handful of friends. They thought it was implausible. I asked them how they know what's plausable and what's not, and they shrug, "we just do". Okayyyy great

             That type of reaction / response has been exactly the goal of the elite for many, many years. They've brainwashed and programmed everyone to be ignorantly blind enough to think that nothing "crazy" like that could ever possibly be

              It's true. I felt like I was debating a hardcore republican from 2003 about Iraq and WMDs. They just barked back so much you couldn't even get a sentence out, now it's the Dem's doing it, and my republican friends are more open to conversation. The mind is so vulnerable to influence. Scary to confirm we are being used on a mind control level. Lies and repetition are very powerful.

            Something else I noticed was that in one of the videos of Amanda Kleinman of Heavy Breathing at CPP, an audience member shouts what sounds like "Poseidon!" Have you seen any references to this in your research?
           </p>
           <p>
            Kleinman also mentions getting "perks" from Sasha (of Sasha Lord, I believe). Could these be the benefits you mentioned?

            It's possible there was an overlap in the gods early on, but the whole concept of being a jew is that jews worship only one god. We pray and talk to the same god as Christians do. Maybe some jews were originally canaanites and that is why there are several words for the same SINGULAR God: Elohim, Yahweh and Adonai (lord).

            They are Phoenicians. Ashkenazis. Jews who are not jews mentioned in the bible. 99.9% of jews are good and will go to heaven. These bankers(fed and cia) are devil worshiping Phoenicians.

            Wow religion truly is the disease of mankind. I know many of you are christians and (perhaps since that is my background) I can stomach christians very well. But all truly evil deeds originates from belief in some made up person or animal (sometimes owl's or pigs or frog gods)
           </p>
           <p>
            Please denounce religion for the sake of humanity. There is no good vs evil here. Just evil, delirious dementia and utter sickness. I've heard people becoming religious due to all of this, please do not. It is not because people believe and worship satan that the struggle between god and satan must be real.

            If this story teaches anything is how efficient child indoctrination can be. For god's sake children are raped nd done the most atrocious things to them and they grow up loving it and doing it to the next generation. If you can do that you can make them belief whatever crazy story you want.

            Came upon this Jan Irwin Show today someone put up elsewhere -- a review of some of the photos that are so objectionable as pedophile material, without doubt -- but also at about 40 on the tape there's a discussion of MOLOCK -- a Hebrew divinity, they say.
Also gets into the interesting area of underground areas of Washington, DC created by a Charles Alefantis according to the Host of the show.  (I haven't actually looked into that.)

            I dont necessarily want to shit on your thesis (and ive upvoated your post), but while fascinating topic I dont think we should ascribe too much importance to this or any other occult historical connection.
Look, these fuckers are at their heart narcisstic sociopaths/psychopaths. What they do, they do from that place - and any 'spirituality/religeon/theosophy they ascribe to it is a SECONDARY FUNCTION.  It is a vanity of the psychopathic ego to attribute their motives to some ancient higher truth/power/god/order - to pretend to themselves that they are 'servants' of something other than their own gratuity
           </p>
           <p>
            So they will take a shine to Moloch, to Satan, to Pan, Caligula, whatever - to anything that they can twist the shrivelled remains of their consciences into accepting. Canaanites? Ok, but get the horse in front of the cart: they dont do what they do because they are Cananites; they have some level of identification with the Canaanites -amongst other depravities in history - because of what they do.

             Well, if they believe in Moloch they could easily believe in astrology, horoscopse, auras, elementa and colours and that type of stuff. Its all connected. Some people claim that colours and what you wear is really important. But i dont know, its not science. I remember how in the 80' early 90' was populare for women to have colorparties where you invited some kind of medium to tell you what to wear to match your soul...

            Bill Cooper Mystery Babylon - he talks a great deal about the lineage of the mystery religion and how it has been passed thru the ages and how it influences the world today. There's about 40 hours of audio in total, if you do check it out it's important to listen to them sequentially (They are labeled Hour 1, Hour 2, etc...). I'd start there!

            Until pizzagate, I struggled with understanding why God ordered the Molech worshippers to be put to death in the Old Testament. Now I understand completely.

            Rarely do I upvote given my limited resources to upvoat but this post is
            <em>
             gold
            </em>
            .  I had previously contemplated the amalgamation that is #Thelema with its Talmudic influences.  "Spirit cooking" is what tweaked my radar in the WikiLeaks.  No doubt I
            <em>
             never
            </em>
            thought such a reference would come up.  Regarding the "owl" at Bohemian Grove.  I remember the original video releases where Jones was using a hidden camera.  Given his apparent connections, I assume he had state of the art, i.e. military grade at the time.  So I believe he could have concealed a camera but could not have pretended to be an actual follower of the syncretism he was wandering around in the middle of...ratherly blithely if the original video was to be believed.

            In syncretism I believe it is possible for many symbols to combine.  The point is the individual "Thelema" or use of Will.

            I think most of their beliefs and rituals come from the Kabbalah, mixed in with ancient pagan beliefs. The history of the Illuminati actually goes all the way back to the garden of Eden. The serpent told Adam and Eve if they ate from the fruit of the tree, that they would see good and evil as God sees it, they could be the same as God, and they would be
            <strong>
             illuminated

            I think that aliens are entirely possible, but I have found "proof" gets thrown around like a rag-doll. Too elusive to confirm or deny in my experience. The question will be quickly answered when we overthrow our current owners.

            LISTEN PEOPLE PLEASE. Not sure if its being buried by shills or what. Perhaps I haven't explained myself as of yet. There is almost too much revealed in the videos I uploaded this morning, 11 of them. Listen: what if I told you that I could show you that DiVinci's Last Supper revealed a black mass of cannibalism and that the symbol for pizza is directly related to the rosicruceans symbol of the rose ??? That pizzagate is actually the tip of an iceberg, which is actually the largest story in the history of man ??? Listen, I'm not the best film maker, but follow the argument, it is all there.  You have no idea who it truly is that you are dealing with. 
You are here reading which means that you are either an ethicist or a shill. I am not wasting your time. You may not get it at first. 
Listen, I reveal a whole crap load of stuff. Its all new. New evidence, new way of looking at things. Everything is connected. You don't understand at all. Its all there. Its in our history. Its in our art. You won't believe it. Not at first. But the evidence is overwhelming. And truly strangly, it was the pizza itself which has come to reveal the rose, and yet it is the rose which again reveals the pizza. They reveal each other. The story is being revealed in art. Follow the link, deal with me a little, trust me... I have written 5 books by the name Khepri Rising. I was studying pizzagate long before they called it pizzagate and long before I knew that that was what I was studying. 
Years ago, I broke Star Wars down... a gnostic interpretation. Essentially, Star Wars, I believe can be used by either white hat witches and black hatters alike. There is a benevolent tree of life and an evil tree called a qlippoth. How do I convey this information to you ? I made 11 videos so far, if I were found dead at this point because of these videos you really should be able to make most of the lines yourself to finish the picture. I know, you don't get it right? Listen: what if I could show you pizzagate within the works of Picasso and Chagall and Gertrude Stein and Sam Mendes and Allan Ginsberg ??? Among many many others. Fact is, this new evidence from culture itself seems to imply that this has been going on since the brothers of the rosy cross in the 1400s. Right now as we speak, we are living in a purge, it is the purge of saturnalia that exists every year between Dec 17 and Dec 25. I think that everyone in the pizzagate subverse is potentially a target for elimination in roman legalized purge, legal killings. I am leaving the first link, there are 11 videos under the title "the Rosetta Files" on youtube. Everything is revealed in movies and art. Everything has been there. We weren't paying attention and we didn't have the right paradigm to decode the works until now. 
Listen you want proof right? I'll give it too you. The gold statue in Tony Podesta's house. Its a rainbow. Its gold because it is the end of the rainbow. The rainbow represents our covenant with God, and his promise never to flood us again.  The rainbow is revered by occultists because it leaves in both world, parallel universes. The parallel universes have to do with a covenant to God and a covenant to god "satan". The rainbow shows that magic can live side by side with man. This is the duality of Picasso's cubist movement. He went from blue period to "rose period". The rose of yesteryear has been cracked by me through pizzagate, and yet it will reveal to our generation the true nature of pizzagate. James Joyce had Poldy Bloom eating different organs in every chapter of Ulysses.  Cannibalism. I am going to leave two links. 
This is the video series, "the rosetta files" :

            This is how I cracked Kubrick a couple of weeks ago, there is a special cut, in a slower version of Eyes Wide Shut that happens at exactly 1:30:00 on slower version. I have slower version on Kubricks Kube youtube channel, so I know it exists. Kubrick hid a code, many codes in fact, in the Shining and in Eyes Wide Shut especially. One of the links have been broken, but the slower version of Eyes Wide Shut is out there. Not link you need it to see the movie, but Kubrick was actually telling us to cut the movie half way through at a precise point and to play the movie twice, once starting at 0:00 and the other at 1:30:00 in the slower version which is 3 hours and 15 minutes and change. 
Ginsberg was talking about Pizzagate in Howl. Chagall, the murders are in Chagall and Picasso and Dali and Blake and others. YB Yeats. "To the Rose upon the Rood of Time". The father time is Saturn or SATAN. The rose was always on Christ, is was his crown of thorns. They are killing people are a rite of passage into a covenant with SATAN. The rainbow. Here is the first of 5 pieces I put out on Kubrick couple of weeks ago.

            This is not a divergence of your energy, you need to understand this to understand what is going on and why. Its a fertility cult associated with bees, Diana and Melissa, stemming from Knossos and the minoan civilization and even before in Sumerian times, stemming itself from the need to relate to sacrificial killings as related to the domestication and animal husbandry of animals which began perhaps 8000 to 10000 years ago. Its a black mass. The are practicing Christianity by killing Christ again and again and again. The rose was a symbol associated with those who had worn the "rosy cross". Pizza is complex, but at its most fundamental symbolic level, it is the pepperoni which symbolizes "the rose", and yet even with no pepperoni, it is made with flour "flower" from "florence". Biljana's fleur de lis is florentine Di Medici. Kubrick identified DiMedici renaissance with this cannibalism. That's why Tom Cruise plays the doctor. Del Medico = the doctor. Everything goes back to Di Medici, and before that the Templars. Rosy Cross in its earliest incantation can be seen on the shields in the crusades, the red cross, that is the origin of pizza. Trust me, I know my shit. Follow along, you'll get it.

             This is not a divergence of your energy, you need to understand this to understand what is going on and why. Its a fertility cult associated with bees, Diana and Melissa, stemming from Knossos and the minoan civilization and even before in Sumerian times, stemming itself from the need to relate to sacrificial killings as related to the domestication and animal husbandry of animals which began perhaps 8000 to 10000 years ago. Its a black mass. The are practicing Christianity by killing Christ again and again and again.

             The rose was a symbol associated with those who had worn the "rosy cross". Pizza is complex, but at its most fundamental symbolic level, it is the pepperoni which symbolizes "the rose", and yet even with no pepperoni, it is made with flour "flower" from "florence". Biljana's fleur de lis is florentine Di Medici. Kubrick identified DiMedici renaissance with this cannibalism. That's why Tom Cruise plays the doctor. Del Medico = the doctor. Everything goes back to Di Medici, and before that the Templars. Rosy Cross in its earliest incantation can be seen on the shields in the crusades, the red cross, that is the origin of pizza.

             Wow. That literally just blew my mind completely open. I was going to church in the womb and was raised as a good Christian girl. I've changed my views as the modern practice of Christianity certainly feels heavily perverted. I never understood why we focused on his death so much other than the self-sacrifice part. Some people just get...so excited talking about his death, and I don't understand it. It's starting to make more sense. I'm going to give your videos a chance. This has thoroughly interested me, though it was hard to read as it was a block of text. I appreciate you tying in the symbols of the bees, Diana, etc. The rose is a big symbol as well. I had a feeling you were onto something. I may not understand it fully as you do seeing as gnostic concepts tend to be a personal journey, but I will try. Much love.

             A black mass isn't practicing Christianity, its a mockery of the Roman Catholic Mass performed in Worship of Satan. It's the dictionary definition, look it up. Look up "Oklahoma Civic Center Black Mass". How many civic centers are in Washington D.C.? A lot of things are hidden in plain sight.

              There is to TL;DR in gnostic concepts. You must take it upon yourself to make a deep personal introspective journey, and it should all be obvious. Throughout all of time the only warnings we can receive are ones which are cryptic enough to be displayed in plain sight. Anything more explicit is usually either too crazy to TL;DR or points out hidden knowledge which then means it is suppressed.
             </p>
             <p>
              I guess the TL;DR is that the Roman Catholic Church is the synagogue of Satan.

               That's the conclusion that I'm coming to.... Hillary Clinton might be the whore of Babylon of Revelations and the Roman Catholic Church (I'm not 100% sure) could be the seat of Satan when he takes the crown and sits on the temple mount and does the abomination of desolation but this is conclusion I'm coming to with all the rapes of the young boys how can we view them any differently? There is no massive scandal in any other major sect of Christianity on this scale... It's only the extremely secretive Catholic church that has its secret ways and has blood from their saints stored in vats for thousands of years... who does this sort of weird sh1t? Occultists do.

            Here's the low-down of this cult...
           </p>
           <p>
            First, I would direct you to this picture:
            <a href="http://www.kimnoble.com/CIMG0751.JPG">
             http://www.kimnoble.com/CIMG0751.JPG
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            For reference, this was the ritually abused woman who has multiple personalities, and paints things like this:
            <a href="http://www.kimnoble.com/WhatTedSaw.jpg">
             http://www.kimnoble.com/WhatTedSaw.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            What is that image on the top of the box in the first picture? It's either the Sephirot, or the Qliphoth, the trees of life and death in Kabbalah and Thelema.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sephirot:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephirot">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephirot
            </a>
            Qliphoth:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qliphoth">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qliphoth
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now take a look at the tree of death - the Qliphoth. You'll find a name, Thamiel - sometimes referred to as Thaumiel. There are two demons that make up this entity - Satan and Moloch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who the wife of this creature is? It's Lilith. Lilith is Hebrew for screech owl, and she is presented as such. What does she like to do? Seduce men and drink the blood of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aleister Crowley ripped off Kabbalah for his faith, Thelema. That's what this is. These people are Ordo Templi Orientis, or some darker sub-cult. They pay homage to Moloch and Lilith.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, sorry to say, the roots of this are in Judaism - from around the 8th Century BC, when they were expelled into Babylon by the Assyrians. Before then, Moloch was worshiped by a number of Hebrew tribes - the Moabites, the Ammonites (under the name Chemesh), and even the tribe of Judah. Lilith was a Babylonian goddess - that's where they picked her up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both Kabbalah and Thelema are Satanism. Kabbalah basically says "I am God', where Thelema says "Do as thou will".

             Thelema was twisted by Aleister Crowley, but the original version has its roots in Gnostic Christianity which was suppressed by the Catholic Church. Original Thelema says:
"whatever you wish, this is the only 
Law, but think that you will have to 
answer for all your deeds. Take note of 
this, that whatever 
emanates from this 
Law, springs from these five sources: Light, Love, Life, Liberty, Triumph."
this was twisted into "Do as thou will, this is the whole of the law" by Satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gnostic Christianty is essentially the "good path" to using the same spiritual powers, which TBH I never believed until now but hey if someone spends billions to rape and kill little kids then there's gotta be something to it, and particularly a good side to fight against it.

               It's been suppressed by the Catholic church through history, which basically shits on any actual version of Christianity or what Jesus really said (he implied aliens are

                EXTRA-dimensional beings, not extra-TERRESTRIAL
               </a>
               , and that we have a higher-dimensional sense we could use), read about how Orthodox Christianity was hunted to realize why they used limited amounts of tiered structures. If you went around praising this stuff &amp; sort of knowledge early on, you would literally be killed for being a witch or wizard by implying there is a higher-dimensional sense available to people. Psychedelics are a very easy way to get access to this kind of experience, just imagine having the good parts of it without the bad ALL THE TIME if you followed these paths? They want to spread knowledge but can't do it because of this persecution. If the Catholic Church falls, they wouldn't be secret anymore. They get beat back so easily because they don't believe in direct conflict, so they tend to lose to people who are willing to do evil shit.

                Thanks for clarifying the topic of dimensional/terrestrial. I concur that it is more likely the beings in question are from another 'plane' than another 'planet'.

            Alex is either controlled opposition or a useful idiot to the elite. Controlled opposition is most likely, in my opinion. He would not have been allowed to rise to the levels he is at if they had any actual concern over what he says. His name dropping of Molloch completely out of the blue (without knowing anything about the occult...which we know he doesn't) says to me that it is a purposeful misdirection on behalf of the people in control of him. I also believe he was let onto the Grove for this exact purpose. Why the misdirect away from what they truly worship is the question.
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth is that the "Satanists" and "Luciferians" are all just misnomers and misdirects. If you truly want to know what is going on, what these people worship, and what they practice, dig into Crowley, the OTO, and Thelema. Be warned: Some of it is quite stomach churning. For example, in one passage of Crowley's works, he speaks about "eating children." While the world of that day took it at literal meaning, it was in fact a metaphor for consumption of semen (Did someone say "spirit cooking"?). However, who is to say that these people didn't take it literally? There is a lot to dig into with Crowley's practices which correlate to what we suspect people are up to today. And Crowleyism is EVERYWHERE.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those are just the practices, though. For the true base beliefs, I think what we are looking at is pre-Christian gnosticism and an "education" in what would probably have been thought of as ancient Egyptian "mystery schools". Whether or not any of it is real is irrelevant as long as they believe it is. I feel like these people actively worship Archons, the demon like manipulators of reality. They want the world to be as negative and full of dark energy as possible to continue to feed their masters (again, whether real or not). Study that stuff and you may just learn how they view the world.

            You should also do research into the Amalekite's, as Jay Parker (Multi-generational Satanic Ritual Abuse victim) has reported that his mother, multi-generational Occultist/Satanist/Pedophile traced her genetics back to this people, who purportedly were the original satanist occultists.
If you haven't already, I STRONGLY recommend you to listen to Jay Parkers speeches or interviews as he goes into extreme detail as to how these sick, perverted pedophile cultists think and work.

            What I find strange is that a lot of these gods, practices and traditions are combined in one book that's believed to be the highest law of it's religion. Many of the people uncovered in the Pizzagate scandal belong to this partly occult religion.

            It's very likely that what we consider 'extra-terrestrials' are fallen angels - and that they are, in-fact, interacting with humanity on a semi-regular basis as they have since the days of Cain. They were banished to the earthly realm until the end-times... They weren't just cast into hell after the war as some might believe. This seems like the most reasonable explanation for 'aliens'.

            The source of the Wikileaks quote "With fingers crossed, the old rabbit's foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . ." is W. Lewis Amselem, former US Foreign Service Officer. He discusses his comments in his conservative blog. This might be overblown...

            I had read an article somewhere that he believed Clintons wore purple to get the spin off royalty.  The take was she was wanting to start a new party neither Dems or Repubs.  The article said watch the theme being carried out over time.  This is very interesting.

            <em>
             The Source

            .  If you can overlook the praise of how wonderful Israel is (was...1965) it's enjoyable read.

            Also, The promised land = The land of Milk and Honey = Canaan 
""Abraham was born in the Sumerian city of Ur. After Abraham's father died, Yahweh visited Abraham and instructed him to smash the idols of his father's gods, to worship the one and only true god, Yahweh, and to move his family to Canaan. Yahweh promised Abraham that if he followed these laws, he would found a great nation that would live in a land flowing with milk and honey.""

            Also, the color purple was discovered by the Phoenician's and was very labor intensive to produce and extremely valuable and thus reserved for Elite's.

            ""According to the historian B. Caseau, "10,000 shellfish would produce 1 gram of dyestuff, and that would only dye the hem of a garment in a deep colour" (Bagnall, 5673). These numbers are supported by the quantity of discarded shells which, at Sidon for example, created a mountain 40 metres high. Such figures also explain why the dye was worth more than its weight in gold. In a 301 CE price edict from the reign of Roman emperor Diocletian, we learn that one pound of purple dye cost 150,000 denarii or around three pounds of gold (equal to around $19,000  at the time of writing). A pound of pre-dyed wool would set you back one pound of gold.""

             So with the original post and your post, I see my only option is to start with myself.  If I am red pilled, then through the wisdom of these posts and how I interpret them, through thought and action, it is ultimately up to me to change as I am unable to change another.

               So what you're saying is basically that Phoenicians were the ones that subverted the Jewish religion/community?
              </p>
              <p>
               Because today these people call themselves Jews, or Luciferian Jews.

            Ba'al is also known by another name:
            <strong>
             Beelzebub, Prince of Demons.
            </strong>
            Moloch and Ba'al were referenced a few times in the Old Testament. Beelzebub (Ba'al Zebub) was, however, mentioned in the New Testament.
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay, I'm gonna detour here for a second. If our enemies are worshipping ancient beings/demons/Gods, then you would think that followers of God would be, by their very nature, opposed to all this behavior. And yet we see constant depravity in the Christian and Catholic faiths, how does that make sense?
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, in the book of Matthew the Parisees accuse Jesus of
            <em>
             being
            </em>
            Beelzebub. They saw him cast out demons, and they claimed that it was due to the power of Beelzebub. Obviously they were wrong...
            <strong>
             ?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Alright, slight detour again. If you really look into these "beings" you start to see how closely related they are. Moloch is very closely related to Ba'al, and in fact some believe they are different aspects of the same being. This extends to Satan, whom even the Greeks recognized as another version of Hades. In the Testament of Solomon, Beelzebub says that he alone is the Prince of Demons because he was an angel, in fact he explicitly says he was the "Highest ranking angel in heaven." So... Lucifer. So Moloch = Ba'al = Beelzebub = Lucifer = Satan. They represent "evil" obviously.
           </p>
           <p>
            So. What if he changed his name again? Specifically, what if he decided to answer to "Jesus?" Imagine if a large group of people were tricked into performing a ritualized satanic execution. Or rather,
            <em>
             sacrifice.
            </em>
            Imagine if this group of people was also tricked into believing that the "only way to God" is through worshipping Jesus (Ba'al.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again... I'm crazy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Forgot this from the Testament of Solomon:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             “I said to him, ‘What are your activities?’ He replied, ‘I bring destruction by means of tyrants; I cause the demons to be worshiped alongside men; and I arouse desire in holy men and select priests. I bring about jealousies and murders in a country, and I instigate wars.”
            </em>
            – TSol 6:1-4

             Roman Catholic Church is very clearly Mystery Babylon, the Whore of Babylon, mentioned in the Bible. They pervert it on purpose and Jesus warned everyone of this. They promote following the Church and not the Scripture, and through the Jesuit order have also invented Islam and collaborated with the leaders of the Jewish faith (also in bible, "the Jews who are not Jews", Ashkenazi jews are Khazarian and not the same lineage as the true Sephardic jews of the bible).

             Just trust in Love, don't worry. The "real deal" God will transcend time to empower you with the grace of god to achieve great things if you clear your mind of thoughts which are not logical and are not respecting your fellow man. The Demiurge is creating a literal matrix that traps us in errors of our ways. You don't need to be religious, these were all ancient astronauts messing with our genealogy and all religion is symbolic and not to be taken literally. Just trust that there are good and bad aliens, and right now we are under the control of the bad aliens.

              Not so sure myself. I saw some convincing evidence it's actually islam (mecca).

              It's funny that Crowley wanted christianity to return ti beung a solar phalkic religion. Islam is the moon/vaginal religion... the clash of civs = sun vs moon, day vs night, etc. Its all there jn the baphomet inagery.  That has long been their plan to bring about the one/new world order.

               Islam was invented by the Catholic Church as a way to radicalize the Middle East perpetually and eventually give them a pawn which would take Jerusalem again which is really where Saint Peter is buried. In Israel, Netanhyu is a former special ops and not a true agent of the "powers that be" in the fake Jewish faith, and Trump wants to let him take Jerusalem back - this will cause a huge war with Islam, but I believe that's a pretext to work with Putin who is also not of TPTB to work together to stop Rome from taking it back. They lied about St. Peter's tomb being in Rome (it's from a bible quote saying he'd build his church on Peter's stone, which is a lie anyways, but they want Jerusalem. Anyways about Islam,
               <a href="http://www.fmh-child.org/Prophet.html">
                read this story "The Prophet"
               </a>
               by former Jesuit Father Alberto Rivera, may he rest in peace. It explains how the Catholics always need a fake enemy to fight to keep the blood flowing and conflict, fear, and control in place. Peace is the solution to this, particularly in terms of religion. Catholicism, Judaism, and Islam where the 3 religions the Khazars turned to. The Khazars were ancient mercenary kings that only cared of gold and worked with the Huns. Anyways though, Islam is controlled opposition and preached in a false way, just like the Bible by Catholics (ie. they don't preach scripture to avoid quoting how obviously well-meaning it is)....

              <p>
               But yeah it's all back to light/day, back to Nimrod &amp; Semiramis &amp; Tammuz, back to Egyptian Set, and how he worked to revive Osiris (Jesus) after he died... Gnosticism explains he came back, but in a spiritual form, not a physical form. "Set" (Romans/Baal) revive Jesus continually so to speak by claiming their wine is his blood, over and over, it's all just a weird distortion of religion... but clearly the "Gods" are just some form of ancient astronauts. And then you read about the Archons.... and the Demiurge... and how they keep us distorted and away from Love which Jesus equated with Light (ie. goes beyond bounds of time) and that the Archons fear this and eat off our fear. If we are all positive, they literally starve. I think geographic points on the earth where temples are located correspond with regions of resonance and that there is some weird concept of there being "points" of power over the earth. Wish I had a corresponding scientific definition for that one, but it mostly just makes sense considering how things like the pyramids were known to evoke spiritual feelings.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ugh I'm ranting now, but it's all about suppressing our pineal glands in the long run, Kundalini that Gnosticism speaks of, because if we really all opened that we would work as a group in unison, almost evolve in a way, and stop being antagonistic to each other almost completely.... we would understand the fractal nature of reality (
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/HoloFractal">
                /r/HoloFractal
               </a>
               ) and how even time and space is a form of vibration, further how every point in space contains wormholes to every point in existence (time &amp; space), our brains (particularly hypothalamus &amp; pineal gland) are tuned with a "sixth sense" to this information that is literally psychic in some ways. We have a body, soul, and spirit (3, 6, 9) also what Tesla was speaking about, who claimed to be able to "tap into an infinite store of knowledge, energy, and faith"...
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyways I'm rambling but this is insane because what it leads straight to spirituality &amp; science being CONNECTED? Like WTF?

                I think the pyramids and other structures are far older, and also on other planet(s).  The measurements and location of giza prove it was from a time that was more advanced than us (antediluvian, at least).

              This investigation has shown me two very important things. The first is that powers are at work here, powers that only months ago I would have laughed at and even now I find absurd. But it's true.
             </p>
             <p>
              The second thing I learned is that, despite what appears to be an ever-evolving pattern of complexity as we delve down the rabbit hole, it's actually very simple. It's black and white, right or wrong, goodness or evil kind of simplicity. The human race needs to actively choose goodness, for
              <em>
               once
              </em>
              in it's entire existence. That's it. Everyone thinks someone is gonna save us, but they're not. Not Trump, not God, not aliens. This isn't all doom and gloom either; we could stop this and we could do it in one fell swoop while maintaining an anti-violence stance if people were just willing to act.
             </p>
             <p>
              They aren't harnessing power through Moloch or evil aliens... they're harnessing
              <strong>
               our
              </strong>
              power and they're succeeding because
              <em>
               we're complicit
              </em>
              in it. Every man, woman and child who has fallen victim to this evil... their blood is on
              <strong>
               each and every one of us.
              </strong>
              We allowed it, and every day we allow it to continue is another untold number of our human brothers and sisters that we failed.

              I have no faith. I have no trust. But hope is alive.

               YES, this is how BASIC this is! Reach through history and realize how Jesus was a guy here in with absolutely perfect meaning, sent from the ACTUAL god, here to correct what was being twisted, and said basically "JUST DON'T KILL EACH OTHER, DON'T STEAL SHIT, DON'T FUCK OTHER DUDES WIFES, HOW HARD IS THIS OH MY GOD" and then further left Gnostic teachings about how purely embracing this love will open you up to secrets that will be hidden by fear, hatred, ignorance, and lack of ability to think independently. You basically can become a minor version of Neo in the matrix if you truly embrace this path of Truth, Light, Love (honestly it sounds dorky but its literally THAT BASIC) which means that if you are judged as a good person, in thought, action, and intent then they give let you tap into your true nature more! Whatever religion you wanna believe it is, that guy was some kind of astronaut or time traveller that came back saying HOLY SHIT STOP THIS NOW GUYS YOU ARE FUCKING IT UP BAD, we just need to be open, aware, not sheep. We are wolves, but wolves aren't filled with hatred, gluttony, lust, they just know their place in the food chain, and stick together as a pack. If we want to keep barriers like race, religion, and nations between us, we need to have common ground realizing that the world is all of our issue and we need mutual respect between these barriers and a REQUIREMENT for peace and law to be applied equally. We wouldn't have conflict if we had open information, truth about why conflicts evolve and happen, and we didn't let psychopaths into positions of power. "Reptile people" or whatever might just be a metaphor for people with their reptilian brain dominating. They have no empathy for others, no concept of true right and wrong, and no way of tapping into that higher level of understanding. When they get there through dark means, they aren't actually getting that power from a source of good, they are getting it from a human who was good like a child. They STEAL it, and use it against us who are good natured.
              </p>
              <p>
               The further you go the more it seems like either a metaphor, or maybe like the real story which is the nuts part... Read about Archons, it totally makes sense...

              The book of revelations is coming into play because this has been a plan in the making since the New Testament was created. For reference, I don't believe in "God" per se. I just look at the devil as being representitive of our potential for evil, and God as our potential to be good.
             </p>
             <p>
              God spurrned Moloch and his followers for human sacrifice in the Old Testament. Then comes the New Testament and suddenly God wants to be complicit in human sacrifice. And he wants everyone to glorify it for ages to come.

               Whether you believe in God or not, I believe this is the struggle between good and evil. The book of Revelation and the books leading up to it are, at the very least, prophetic. Some of the things described are now true.
               <em>
                I.E.
               </em>
               Homosexuality, Abortion, the acceptance by out elected  officials of these beliefs and actions.
              </p>
              <p>
               It has been predicted in these 'end' books of the Bible thousands of years ago.

                Agreed. For all intents and purposes, we are up against the Devil himself. If I create an evil character who desires nothing more than murder, he only remains fictional if he doesn't actually

                 get
                </em>

                 I agree, I do, however, have a hard time understanding how and why our leaders (politicians and the like) seem to get in trouble with much more regularity then us normal folks. They get caught doing numerous infractions of the law that you and I would never even be involved in.
                </p>

                 There has got to be something more to this than meets the eye.

                  I think it's because most of them are pawns in a much bigger game. For example, I highly doubt that Hillary
                  <em>
                   really
                  </em>
                  knows what the full picture looks like. These are, in all likelihood, people who were broken a long time ago.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  By now pretty much everyone knows Bush Sr was a pedophile. I find it hard to believe Jr made it through his childhood without being subjected to horrors. Who or whatever is pulling the strings is working towards an end. As history (and current events) will show you,
                  <strong>
                   chaos
                  </strong>
                  is often a means to that end.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Even Icke talking about reptilians. That is something that is rooted in truth, although I honestly believe Icke exploits that fact in order to make money.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I would guess that any of the so called "elites" that are involved have in fact been subjected to these very same horrors. This type of abuse (and though I cringe, I'm directly referencing Icke here) destroys empathy, among other things. It essentially removes them from the "Human Collective." Empathy is proof that, in general, we are all connected. The human potential for evil is essentially governed by our ability to empathize with each other. Without it, our evil is ungoverned. Without it, we look at humans as if they are tools or commodities.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They get caught more often than the rest of us because
                  <em>
                   they
                  </em>
                  are not
                  <em>
                   us
                  </em>
                  . We would spot it a mile away if they hadn't built religious and political worlds in which, not that we plebians would ever be able to understand, operate whilst being completely devoid of morality. These people are no longer human, and occasionally the world gets a peek behind the veil.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In killing their empathy, the victims become
                  <strong>
                   addicted
                  </strong>
                  to depravity. And then they are given the means to rule over us.

                  This occurs because they all belong to the same Satanic groups with multiple names, Illuminati, OTO, masons etc. They are in literal communication with demons and Lucifer from the spirit realm. This is why their sin goes to levels most wouldn't even dream of. Add some power and lots of money into the mix and you have baby raping murderers in charge. It is also important to note that these organizations look for people at birth to compromise and groom. This is why many of the same bloodlines are always in power. Also, a lot of them were abused sexually by the people that came before them. It is a continual cycle of evil and it is a rite of passage for these people.

            A great deal of religious syncretism has happened since the Canaanite era, I'm sure, but it is peculiar and you are far from the only one to have made this connection early on as a result of that email, specifically.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the connection to Bohemian Grove and the temple of Little St James, it seems that Moloch may not be the only deity that is being worshipped. Minerva. Baal. Satan. Lucifer. Etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look at the Process Church of the Final Judgment, you will see that they mix all of these themes. Tavistock creates artificial cults that combines esoteric knowledge in such a way as to be able to convincingly co-opt other religions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest that the particulars of the religious beliefs are helpful to know, but ultimately are artificial and used to justify what goes on the circle of blackmail and bribery.

            Some codex's also say that YHWH = Ba'al = Moloch.  Original translation, me thinks.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of people say the old "God" of the testament is the very 'god' they worship.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the ancient language, the generic word for god was AL (could also be pronounced as "EL"). The A represents "Aleph" which is a symbol of a Ox's Head. This is the symbol of power, and it is also the number ONE (1). Ba'el means (Father of God[s]) and was a Bull God who had a son Yahweh (The Canaanite Bull God of War).Many people believe that ONE is the number of God, but it is rooted from the symbol of Aleph - The Ox Head of Power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yahweh hated his father Ba'el and this is why he did not want people to worship The Golden Bull which was a symbol of him. Yahweh also told people to see SATURNsday as The Holy Day. On the planet Saturn there seems to be a vortex of The Hexagram [1] and of The Eye [2]. Another symbol of Saturn is a cross-like symbol [3]. Saturn ate his own children and was called the god of the harvest. The bible talks about Yahweh/El (God of The Bible) and "The Harvest"! It also says that Jesus is a "Shepard" for the sheep, and you know what the shepard does, raise the sheep until they are big enough to be EATEN. Bethleham is of important and that means the house of bread. Another symbolism of harvesting crops/food. Saturn allows his children to be destroyed and look at this sacrifice of Jesus how it pleases Yahweh and is even used as a plea for people to be "forgiven" by him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The so-called devil sign with the horns [4] is actually the symbol of the BULL'S horns.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Egyptian God "Seth", was the god of darkness associated with the planet Saturn. Later called "Satan" by The Ancient Persians. The number 7 is The Number of Saturn. There are the 7 rings of Saturn. Saturn's Day is the 7th day of the week. 7 was considered the number of God / The Divine in many places for a long time. Knowing that Saturn / Kronos. Two animals that have been associated with Saturn is also The Owl and The Peacock (which makes even more of a connection with secret societies).
            </p>
            <p>
             All of this Paganism is connected with the god of The Bible alone, now some of the stories have even more influences but I won't get into that as this is about the god Yahweh.

            I did find something regarding that strange Instagram photo. He tagged it with #mybarbarian so googling it I found www.mybarbarian.com. The Instagram image was from one of this performance art group's shows. I will post the link when I find it.

            Caananites were called "Phoenicians" (Greek for 'purple') by the Greeks as the Phoenicians worked, primarily at the city of Tyre, in purple dye and so were called by the Greeks `purple people’). Caananite civilization was founded by the grandson of Noah, Caanan. His father was Ham. Hams mother Naamah (Noahs Wife on the ark) was not of the original "adam" bloodline (as in Adam/Eve), she was part of the bloodline that was split off from Adam when Cain killed Abel and when Cain fled to the west and created his own tribe. This tribe was heavily into what we would consider "dark occult". They were taught these dark arts by the fallen angels who were cast down to earth after the battle in heaven between Lucifer and YHVH. Literally, this pedo faith can be traced all the way back from today to this Cain tribe in the beginning days of the earth. Cain's tribe was the first Luciferian Cult. Ham and his son Caanan are are the reason these Cain bloodlines still exist after the flood and to this day. They still have the same goal as Lucifer had before the battle in heaven, to use the dark arts to attain godhood - immortality - infinite power, etc...
           </p>
           <p>
            I have so much more detail on this in some deleted threads, look for the walls of text in my comments. This is absolutely the right avenue to be looking at the occult angle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Check out the Forgotten books of Eden on sacred-texts dot com for the full Cain/Abel story and how he formed his own tribe and had dealings with fallen angels which was the beginning of 'occult science'. Also look into the book of Enoch (apocrypha) which talks about fallen angel/human interactions. Use you own judgment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I call this faith the "Mystery Religion". All secret societies have symbolism with the same themes that can be tied back to the mystery religion themes/symbolism. Many pagan gods are just rehashes of the original gods worshiped by the original Cain tribe (know them by their fruits). Perfect Example is the religion of Babylon was a trifecta (Nimrod, Tamuuz, Semiramis) which exactly matches the Egyptian trifecta of Osiris/Isis/Horus. The stories believed about these gods are nearly identical in both cultures) They both have the 14+fish symbolism/story. It goes deep, believe me.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been speculated that Eve "eating the fruit" in the garden was actually her being impregnated by Lucifer (begetting Cain). And that Abel was the son of Adam, and that they were fraternal twins who were bi-parental. This does make sense as to why Adam/Eve felt ashamed about their private parts, after the fact, if true. (I never knew eating fruit could make one ashamed of their sexuality?) This may be why many elites seem to be hopped up on the idea of preserving bloodlines and inter-family breeding.

             Purple was associated with royalty throughout the bible and was also used in jewish temple sevices. When Jesus was taken to the cross,the roman guards put a purple robe and crown on him to mock him for climing to be the son of God.

             If you reaearch the Khazars who convertee to "Judaism" in the 9th century its likely they adopted this dark religion.  This is the root for the Ashkenazi jews and there are some Israeli scholars who point out that most jews DNA connects them to the Khazar region of Europe rather than Israel.

             It's no mystery religion. It's called either Thelema or Kabbalah, which are virtually the same thing. Jesus referred to them as the "Synagogue of Satan".
            </p>
            <p>
             But, yes - "Mystery Religion" in terms of it inducting people into the mysteries is correct. It's where they seek to master control over others, and become as God to men.

               He doesn't. His "servant John" says it in Revelation 2: 8-10 (KJV):

              <blockquote>

               <p>

               <p>
                10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Also, Revelation 3: 8-10 (KJV):
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
               </p>

                9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
               </p>
               <p>
                10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

             The reason they were ashamed of their nakedness is b/c they ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Before God gave the command not to eat of the fruit, they didn't have shame of their nakedness b/c they walked with god and were sinless. After they disobeyed God's command they were aware of their nakedness b/c that is the point mankind fell.... it's both Adam and Eve's fault (not just Eve which is what many of the occultist try to obfuscate you with). Adam was supposed to make sure Eve didn't eat the fruit and he reneged on his duties and also ate of the fruit with Eve.
            </p>
            <p>
             At any rate, at that very moment mankind was forever changed and they were separated from God after sinning. This is the Original Sin and the deceiver, Satan, tempted them to do it. Regardless of your beliefs or ideology, it doesn't matter, but this is the background of why the occultist believe what they believe.... they believe that you can make yourself like God and equal to him by following in Satan's footsteps.... the occultists believe it is God who is the deceiver and that Satan is telling the truth... that's why there are so many references to double headed Janus or the double-headed eagles in their mythos and writings.

             Ever wonder why the never complete pyramid has the all seeing eye at the top especially in Freemasonry? B/c Freemasons are taught to do be honorable and do good all the way up to the 33rd degree which is the moment they attain "enlightenment" and in their ethos learn that morality is relative and anything goes. The lower level masons are actually mostly good people and know nothing of the dark roots of those at the top. The 33rd degree (or top of the pyramid where the Great Architect resides) are separated from the 32 degrees below them, they are untouchable so to say and can do whatever they desire b/c they have reached the level of the GA. 33rd degree is also the first degree Fahrenheit that is thawed from ice, the mind is now able to see according to Freemasons whereas everyone else is frozen in their thinking.

             Finally, the reason Canaanites exist at all is b/c Joshua was given the command to wipe out every man, woman, and child in the land of Canaan b/c they were practicing all sorts of abominations especially the gravest, sacrificing babies and children to Moloch.... Joshua didn't live up to his end of the bargain, he never wiped them out COMPLETELY, although he did a lot.

             And yes Phoenicians come from a tribe of Canaanites. If you guys know about Roman history, the largest defeat ever came at the hands of Phoenicians who ruled Carthage in the battle of Cannae, where 8 Roman legions were defeated by Hannibal. Hannibal was a Phoenician, not an African as many people wrongly believe. That Phoenician community in Carthage was later COMPLETELY destroyed by Rome in the 3rd Punic war by Scipio Africanus (minor).

               The whole story of Adam and Eve was twisted from the get-go
              </a>
              . Gnostic Christianity gives the real account of those close to Jesus, and how the "occult" or "gnostic" knowledge has been suppressed viciously and violently by the Roman Catholic Church (the real perpetrators here, Jesuit order created Illuminati, OTO, Knights Templar/Malta, Mafia, Islam, Rosicrucians, etc. all to have a variety of secret societies to hide behind).
             </p>
             <p>
              Gnostic Christianity is the path of pure love, white magic if you will. The "other" path is black magic. One must only accept Love to receive the grace of Christ, so it isn't about requiring hidden knowledge, but being open to how Love by itself transcends time due to being extra-dimensional and based in our souls (6th dimension) and spirit (9th dimension).

                If you're a christian I'd be careful of believing in a strictly "gnostic christian form" that believes god is both male and female. I don't know what your beliefs are but if that is the case you should take a critical look at it as it is itself influenced by gnostics before them from Egypt:

             A lot of folks may not be so keen to jump into this aspect of the investigation but let's be clear, pedophilia certainly is horrible but it's only one part of the whole of this story. Let's not forget that these folks don't just rape children, they also sacrifice and eat them, as part of their ritual,

              If their god demands it then their god must be one effed up POS who is unworthy of demanding one fucking thing. How can Moloch be called a god? It seems someone messed up the translation, as it more likely said gob (lin). Scary as shit. Can these people actually believe this?

               I'm glad you appeared on this post, I read your earlier post about this (the one you linked) and Immediately it struck a chord. I think there are a small group of us here with a similar line of thinking and I'm glad to see this angle is getting the attention it deserves. From my perspective, pizzagate is the conspiracy that ties all the other conspiracies together - I honestly believe this is the single most important issue of our lifetime, not just to save the kids, but to save our very selves.

            Clinton email 14333 has been tripping me out for weeks. Like, it's just so casual, as if everyone in the email chain would know exactly who Moloch is and what he's "all about." I mean, I don't know about you, but the only Moloch I had ever heard of prior to that was the retired ex-super villain Moloch from the comic/movie Watchmen.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then there's the fact that they were referring to sacrificing a "chicken" to him when he's the ancient Canaanite god of child sacrifice
            <em>
             AND
            </em>
            the fact that chicken is sometimes used as slang for an underage boy...

             like 15 or 20 years ago Alex Jones exposed, on film, Republican elites chanting and dancing to Moloch a statue at the Bohemian Grove. So it really shocks me this is anything new. They are using it mockingly here, but obviously in reference to their own occult ritual.

I thought about that weird Podesta picture and googled "caanan fish symbolism" and I found THIS.

              There indeed is a great significance to the number, it has to do with the stories of the Babylonian trinity of Gods (Semiramis, Tamuuz, Nimrod) and the Egyptian Trinity of Gods (Isis, Horus, Ra).
             </p>
             <p>
              In Babylon: Scholars teach that Nimrod (Ruler of Babylon) was executed by Noah’s righteous son, Shem, his body cut into 14 pieces and the pieces subsequently were distributed across the land to his followers as a warning. Semiramis, destitute at the loss of Nimrod and fearful that she would lose her status as 'deity' in the peoples eyes had all of the pieces collected. They were able to gather all the pieces together but could not find his penis. She then placed them near the stump of an evergreen tree and the tree subsequently sprung back to life. Shortly afterwords, she birthed Tamuuz, who she claimed was the immaculate re-incarnation of Nimrod.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Egypt: Scholars teach that Osiris (Deity of Egypt) was tricked by Set and his body was put into a box and dumped into the Nile. Destitute at this loss, Isis set out to find the box. She found it along the bank of the river where a cedar tree had grown up around it.  Set heard that Isis had found the box, tracked her down and took the body of Osiris from her.  To make sure Isis could do nothing to bring Osiris back to life Set had the body cut up into 14 pieces and ordered that the pieces be buried at different locations around Egypt – all except the penis which he threw into the Nile where it was immediately swallowed by a fish.  (I don’t know the name of the fish but to this day it is one the Egyptians do not eat). Isis set out once again to find the pieces of Osiris. They found all the pieces and put him back together – except for the penis.  Isis fashioned a penis from mud and through magic breathed life into the body of Osiris, simultaneously transforming herself into a bird which came down on the erect penis and this was the immaculate conception of Horus (re-incarnation of Osiris).
             </p>
             <p>
              These tales are why the phallic symbol and obelisks are important to the mystery religion.
As an added note, both stories involve evergreen trees and Nimrods birthday was Dec 25.
Christ was not born on Dec 25th.
             </p>

              Merry Christmas.

             One thing to consider about the chicken and Moloch message is Santeria has chicken sacrifice.  It could be a joke by a smart person mixing Santeria with Moloch on purpose.  That works in the context of the previous sentences.

             Not saying that is correct, just possible.

             Because they are ALL in on it, perhaps as much as 70% of DC and Washington. Whole families, multi-generational.  They are either members themselves, enable members, and/or cover for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             We aren't talking one or two people here and there.  A friend who grew up in such a family advised me that everything comes clearly into focus only when you realize that we don't live in a normal society with a few Satanist Luciferians. Rather, we live in a Satanist /Luciferian society with a few normals.  Initially, I thought that was ridiculous but the further I went down the rabbit hole, I have to say that I have come to believe it that it's true. Talk about mind-bending.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of the people involved in this are "normal" people standing in line behind us in the grocery store.  If James Alefantis had been standing behind me before any of this came out, I'd probably think he was a charming young man, too.

             If you haven't already seen this, it's worth the 4 minutes:

             Bang on. I have thought these questions myself. Like who the fuck would know about Moloch? The chicken connection to young boy just gave me a chill because I haven't heard that before pizzagate either.  Makes perfect sense now. Confirmation bias? Anyway/... Moloch

             Also, the Canaanite gods are mentioned in the Talmud. The Babylonian Talmud contains rituals, gods and traditions from Babylonian, Canaanite, Egyptian and many other cultures/practices. They have for example taken a lot of the symbology from Ancient Egypt with the eye of Horus, the pyramids and so on. They call themselves Jews but are not, they worship the synagogue of Satan.

              Hey, Canaanites may have called themselves jews but jews were specifically told not to marry canaanites. Some jews still believe it means jews can't marry gentiles, but Ivanka trump seems to prove that wrong with her conversion. Yes, touchy subject to all. However , just as you don't have several wives just because the bible allows it, normal jews don't follow creepy shit in the talmud. I haven't read the talmud and I'm a reform jew (we don't keep kosher, we drive cars on saturday, we live in the modern world) but I don't think you can say most jews are related to canaanites. Jews had canaanites neihbors. But that's not the same. Jews were told not to intermarry with those child killers.

              and of course, this leads us to imagine precisely WHAT was so bad in all those emails of Clintons that she 'bleach bit' deleted them while under subpoena.
The me of 6 weeks ago was so naive, i thought she was just covering financial and political corruption

               Probably wouldn't be all that difficult for someone to recover the "bleached" emails (assuming they had the access to do so) considering the fact that HRC's "IT guy" didn't seem to know what the hell he was doing since he had to go post on Reddit to ask how to "permanently delete emails". Id say it's fairly likely that someone who didn't even know how to do that in he first place probably didn't fully delete it "permanently".

               Read that "bleach bit" is actually accomplished by overwriting the material a number of times.   Would seem that could be undone if someone gave it some attention.  But, of course, NSA has all of the originals.

              The Bible mentions a "new Israel" which I think many Christians have mistakenly believe to be the actual land mass now called Israel. Seems it is symbolic of a chosen land that follows God's will instead.

             I interpreted the email message as a metaphor, akin to "crossing our fingers! Knock on wood!" But, that doesn't take away from the indication that Moloch is seemingly known as a character that readily receives sacrifices. These folks are all intellectuals, so they may have had fireside chats about ancient deities, and thus both are aware of Moloch.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Canaanism became influential again in the 1940's (where small groups of intellectuals practiced it and nobody else, giving it an inflated sense of influence), there were several folks that were highly critical of its quest to return Levant (area between Egypt and Mesopotamia) to ancient Hebrew traditions and culture. One of the critics said:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Since it itself neglects the historical continuity of its people, introduces obscure concepts into their political vision in its declarations of a 'Hebrew Land on the Euphrates', and relies on increasingly irrational argumentation, the movement is liable to find itself an escape into the realm of myth. The Young Hebrews are not the first to launch themselves into the task of mythic renewal. Their original contribution is rather stale. For over a hundred years, the world has pined for a return to the lap of myth. The escapes into various myths have hitherto inflicted disasters upon humanity. In the spirit of good faith, it is best to assume that the whole chapter of mythic renewal in European thought is unclear to them. For the moment, we shall content ourselves with this quotation from Huizinga: "Barbarization sets in when, in an old culture… the vapors of the magic and fantastic rise up again from the seething brew of passions to cloud the understanding: when the mythos supplants the logos."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I thought that the final bit about mythos replacing logos and leading to barbarism reminded me of radical Islam. Look at Egypt and Iran through the 1950's to 1980's for examples of cultures that threw logic to the wayside to clamp down on and radicalize their citizens. Who knows if there's a connection.

              Iran had a democratically elected government that the CIA helped overthrow and install a puppet dictator. The "islamic revolution" of 1979 was the iranian people overthrowing the puppet dictator.

              I thought they were mocking alex jones' interpretation of the Bohemian Grove ceremony and referring to a backysrd BBQ but I could be mistaken.

            remember that Phoenicians discovered Alphabet and I find it no coincidence that Google rechristened itself as Alphabet. as for purple revolution, Phoenicians were famous for purple dies, in fact Phoenician is Greek for purple... Just look at the extent of Phoenician civilization at its peak and follow the contours of Arab Spring (and Ukraine)...

             Very interesting insight about Google. Jeez, I didn't think about that. Bravo mate! And yes that is why I think Hillary wore purple, the obvious on the surface insight is that it's a coming together of repubs and dems but that is a very superficial view. The more deep insight is that she is giving a hat tip to who she really believes she works for and who she believes she derives her authority from..... Hillary could be the whore from Babylon in Revelations.

              Phoenicians are from Canaan my friend. They are Canaanites. There could be a connection to Egypt when some people of Phoenician origin were taken prisoner before Moses time. But they definitely FIRST originated in the Levant.

            It might be Canaanite mixed with other things.

             Nobody has really linked pizzagate/Clinton/CF to Bohemian Grove, even though BG has the giant Moloch statute and the (mock?) child sacrifice ritual that Alex Jones discovered. It is supposedly mock sacrifice, but you can hear screaming in the video. Bohemian Grove is traditionally associated with Republicans, not Democrats, so it would be helpful if we could bridge this gap. We DO know that Epstein has a giant owl/Moloch statute on his temple on his island.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            If you listen to Alex Jones, he explains how the ritual in Bohemian Grove is not pure Moloch/Canaanite, but actually a mix of several different occult religions/practices. I think this is what is ultimately the truth: basically a modern day quasi-Satanic cult that borrows from Egypt/Canaanite/Crowley in some kind of fucked up mix.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              These words have appeared in Clinton/DNC Wikileaks emails: Thelema, Moloch, Minerva. Thelema is basically Crowley Satanism. Moloch we know, and Minerva is another name/variation of Moloch. I'm guessing these are all mixed together.

            <li>
             <p>
              If FBIanon is right, then Soros is the kingpin, and so Soros could basically have mixed these different occult religions together in his own secret efforts at child trafficking, child sacrifice, and nation-toppling/exploiting.

             What if none of the elites actually believe in the religious aspect, but a Satan-worshipping child snuff orgy is simply the most blackmail-worthy scenario possible? If I was trying to blackmail someone, and was worried about them weaseling out of pedophilia ("I was weak, sex addict, going to treatment now"), I would make them do Satanic shit, so that no one will ever trust them again if the blackmail was released.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason I like this explanation is because it solves the Satanism problem without trying to prove all these incredible claims about ancient religions. Maybe it's just normal blackmail. Nothing magical.

              Well, I think you're mostly right.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I also think that huge asymmetries in power and money lead to corruption and decadence and insanity. We saw this in the French Revolution and other situations. If you're someone like Soros or Hillary Clinton, and you can do whatever you want, you find yourself getting involved in deeper and darker shit.

              Who knows what the real truth is. Hopefully we find out when Attorney General Sessions makes an announcement.

             Bill Cooper talked an awful lot about the Mystery Babylon religion.
            </p>
            <p>
             What
             <s>
              we
             </s>
             I know is that the religion grew out of ancient Mesopotamia.
Babylon, Phoenicia, Carthage, the major cities of antiquity, basically where everything was born (as far as we know, it may very well be even more ancient but
             <s>
              our records
             </s>
             my understanding get hazy pre-2k BC) and they all worship roughly the same god, Moloch, Ba'al, Cronus, Saturn. You'll see a ton of Saturn symbolism and worship in today's society; their religion never died out, it's just not obvious (or for) the regular person.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lots of child sacrifice stuff back then. I recall a story about a Greek king, Agathocles, who took over Carthage, a city-state that is well known for it's use of children in sacrifice to their god (pretty sure they didn't call him Moloch but it was him)... when Carthage fell to the Greeks, the people of the city lamented that their god gave up on them because they were using base-born children for their sacrifices instead of high born ones like they used to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, that's perhaps not exactly the topic at hand but I just wanted to elaborate on it a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
             IIRC Larry Nichols was the "whistleblower" who said Hillary liked to go out west for Witch Camp, basically implying that she went out to worship similar to Bohemian Grove. I don't have the vid/timestamp on that but I've been looking for it for a while... perhaps someone else has it?

             That's not Moloch. Jones knows nothing about the occult.

             An owl is meant to represent "the goddess" - who has had many names over the centuries. From

              Ishtar

              Minerva/Athena

             , the goddess has very often been depicted with an owl.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some speculate this may because of the gnostic goddess Sophia (who represents wisdom). No real way to know.

             Alex Jones is a disinfo shill. Do you know how big video-cameras was back when he filmed that? That proves that he was invited to the Bohemian Grove during which they didn't actually sacrifice children but perform a symbolic ritual. He did however tell people that there was a real child being sacrificed which made everyone really skeptical against accusations of child sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm pretty sure they stopped doing shit over there when they invited him.

             There is plenty of videos on Youtube showing you many examples of his shilling. He hasn't really pushed Pizzagate at all, he just said it was real but then he actually misquoted the emails and so on. There are so many examples of this.

             I'm thinking Soros (an admitted literal nazi) knew the methods of MK ultra mind control, which is really just blackmail, and joined forces with Lynn Rothchild. Also, as an aside, in 1960 I believe, one of the Rockefeller sons, Michael, went missing while studying human sacrifice practicing tribes in Guinea.
