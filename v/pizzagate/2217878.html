<hr />
<p>Today\'s surprise: <strong>We get to find out what HLI looks and sounds like!</strong> He has yet another phony identity, as YouTuber Tory Smith. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2rm3zZK_uA4aSzV2gHysGw">Let\'s check him out</a>, and then I\'ll explain what led me to him. (Folks who are handy with YouTube are encouraged to grab copies of his videos for future mirroring purposes. Screengrabs of the titles and thumbnails will also be helpful. Tory Smith is supposedly dead, but you never know; the angels might send him back in a hurry to take down his account.)</p>
<p>His account was set up in October 2013. Many of his original videos were apparently deleted at some point. This may have been because it took him time to perfect his schtick. In any case, while he makes reference to events as far as four years ago, the earliest surviving example is from November 2015.</p>
<p>Tory has a variety of spiritual gifts. He can &quot;read&quot; a person\'s DNA from a distance and learn all sorts of things about them. He can heal diseases. He can communicate with aliens and angels.</p>
<p>He uses these gifts to make a mind-boggling number of accusations. His core claim is that there are 41 secret trafficking centers around the world, created by the Bush family and run jointly by the CIA, FBI, DARPA, NSA, and various alien reptilians, insectoids, \'tall whites,\' non-physical spirits, dark entities, Nazi war criminals, and so on. In these centers, high-ranking people can pay to rape and murder children (he cites a price of $41,000 per child). These are abducted in the tens of thousands from all over the world, by the Chinese, Queen Elizabeth, the Air Force, NATO, the Rand Corporation, the Vatican, the Los Angeles city council, and countless others. Tory has named hundreds of people as guilty of child rape and murder, including the Bushes, the Clintons, Obama, Rahm Emanuel, James Comey, Dick Cheney, 70 U.S. Senators, and so on.</p>
<p>John Brennan (former head of the CIA) is a shape-shifting alien who has personally assassinated Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Whitney Houston\'s daughter, Paul Walker, Antonin Scalia, and Robin Williams, using a stun gun. He had to shoot Michael Jackson 42 times with the stun gun to give him a fatal heart attack.</p>
<p>Tory is also a martyr of the first order. First, there is the torment of him psychically viewing and relaying the details of countless thousands of child murders, often including the names, ages, and favorite foods of the kids. He is &quot;injected with weapons-grade anthrax daily&quot; by DARPA. He has been raped in 14 of the 41 centers, including three times by Rand Paul(!), but has somehow managed to survive. The government also continually interferes with his computer, supposedly making it hard to upload his videos on a regular schedule (although 202 videos in eight months seems pretty regular).</p>
<p>This is pretty exhausting and loopy stuff to watch, and I have not by any means viewed all 202 of his videos. But if you make the effort to scan through any random dozen or so of the videos, or even just read the titles, you will notice a not very subtle theme. </p>
<p>The Earth is caught up in a never-ending, cliffhanger struggle between darkness and light. Every video brings new drama. The Uxla reptilians will swoop down in their ships and eat thousands of human children, only to be chased away by \'the Galactics\' or forces from \'The Hall of Justice\'. Tory will organize his followers in a special directed prayer to the \'Blue Avians,\' and a few days later \'Mother God\' will inform Tory that 615,000 evildoers are being prosecuted as a result. Unfortunately, the bad guys are promptly reinforced and the battle goes on.</p>
<p><strong>There is just one constant in this bewildering struggle, and his name is Mike Pence.</strong> The Galactics may arrest the entire Bush family, only to see them replaced by reptilians; or all the female U.S. Senators may get spirited away and replaced by clones. But every couple of videos, like clockwork, Governor Mike Pence of Indiana rapes and murders another child. Or his attorney general, Greg Zoellner, rapes and murders a child. Or it may be Indiana state troopers, or state senators, or Pence\'s wife. Quite literally, both Satan and Lucifer get chased back to Sigma Draconis by the good guys, but nothing ever touches Mike Pence and his Indianapolis child-trafficking operation.</p>
<p>Don\'t take my word for this. Go look. Read the video titles.</p>
<p>This is a variation of the style of HLI and WIC. Once again we are bombarded by claims and accusations and general weirdness. Once again, if we pay attention, a consistent theme emerges. WIC attacks Paul Ryan; Tory attacks Mike Pence. It should also now seem very significant that the very first words from Senate Anon were: Paul Ryan and Mike Pence are traitors. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh4sno9WgsU">Tory\'s career came to an abrupt end on July 13, 2016</a>. He warned that he was at last succumbing to the constant attacks by the alien-Nazi-Mike Pence alliance. And that\'s very interesting, because High Level Insider\'s career started at almost that same moment. He first came onto /pol/ on July 10, 2016, and then made lengthy appearances on July 11 and July 12. My impression is that HLI wanted to make sure he had a willing audience over on /pol/ before committing to the final episode of the Tory Smith show.</p>
<p>The timing is interesting for two other reasons. This was the moment when the Podesta emails were released; and it was also the moment when Mike Pence agreed to run for VP with Trump. Let\'s be clear here. HLI has been filling the Internet with \'Mike Pence is a pedo\' videos since October 2013. No one could possibly have anticipated Trump choosing him for VP and getting the nomination that long ago. And doing disinfo in a YouTube video is far more risky than LARPing on /pol/. So HLI <em>really</em> has something against Mike Pence, and was willing to go to great lengths.</p>
<p>There\'s another interesting sidebar here, an avenue for investigation. Obviously Tory Smith could not send out his own death announcement. So he had an ally, Alexandra Meadors, who made the announcement for him. Here\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4kshqhE3VI">the two of them talking</a>. And here\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sAcFPdBopk">her making the announcement</a>.</p>
<p>How did I make this connection? Ironically, this started out as a minor piece of due diligence. I just wanted to know why the sockpuppets I had identified so far kept bringing up Mike Pence. Where did this \'Mike Pence is a pedo\' meme come from? Well, it comes from Tory Smith. The two versions of the story that you find on the Internet are \'I heard from a guy who heard from a guy that Mike Pence is a pedo,\' and \'Tory Smith says Mike Pence is a pedo.\'</p>
<p>Skeptics may be thinking that the connection between Tory and HLI is still kind of loose and circumstantial. But I\'ve got something much more tangible and specific to offer here. Remember that on Day 2, I called out <a href="https://voat.co/user/polwarrior1030">@polwarrior1030</a> as a sockpuppet account who was trying to slide my post? Take another look at the two deleted threads that I mentioned, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2209420">here </a>and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2209330">here</a>. How likely is it that we\'d suddenly be talking about Blue Avians and Galactics, at that precise moment? You screwed up there, HLI. Didn\'t think I\'d be talking about your gig as Tory Smith, did you?</p>
<p>So now I have given you my current overview of the disinfo operation. We know who is paying for it, who controls it, who is doing the day-to-day work, and the major channels through which the disinfo gets sent. We understand the method. Just one big question remains: <strong>Why? Why are David Brock and the Clinton gang so afraid of Paul Ryan and Mike Pence?</strong> Why these two men, out of all of Washington?</p>
<p>The reason is so simple and obvious (at least when it is pointed out) that when I tell you tomorrow, you are likely to slap your forehead and say, &quot;D\'oh!&quot; But for today, let\'s focus on Tory and his body of work.</p>',

            Wtf? Up until now I thought maybe you were onto something. Now I think YOU are the one that is disinfo. I just read the craziest theory and I can't believe that this was even upvoted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you really believe that Tory Smith had those abilities? Or that maybe he was a past victim who believed in his mind that what he thought was true? You seem to believe everything he said. Is this some sort of joke? He didn't have super powers.
           </p>
           <p>
            When it comes to Senate Anon, WIC and HLI being the same person, I don't know. But how the hell does that have to do with Tory Smith? He obviously suffered from mental illness, possibly caused by prior abuse.  But if you are believing he truly had all these powers then you have some serious issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because anyone of these people hate Paul Ryan or Mike Pence, it does not mean they are related! Is one of your theories that Tory Smith didn't really die and is now HLI? I kept falling asleep while reading this because it was bedtime. Am I just royally confused because this is blowing my mind?

             It's possible that I was a bit too sarcastic, and that gave you the impression that I believed him. But no, I'm saying he was acting. The whole thing, almost three years of it, was a con aimed at pulling in religious/spiritual people who believe in Satanic abuse, and making them suspicious of Mike Pence. And then spreading stories about Mike Pence being a pedo around the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             He didn't die. He made a final video where he wheezed and said his enemies were overpowering him, and then his colleague at Galactic Connections said he was dead.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the same scam they pulled back in the 1980s. There was a danger that their relatively small-scale Satanic abuse operation (for elites only) would be revealed, so they hyped it up into a gigantic panic, where every kindergarten and daycare was suddenly suspect. They made it sound like there was a Satanic coven on every block. Most of those cases were eventually dismissed or overturned, and it left the impression that the whole business was completely unfounded.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is an updated version of that campaign, really a continuation of it. It's a tool to discredit Mike Pence, because they are afraid that Mike Pence will reveal what he knows about their real, continuing operation. I'll be posting the final instalment of my report in a few hours. Get some sleep and see what you think of that before reaching a final judgment.

             <p>
              First of all, you don't know if he was an act, if he was mentally ill or if he was a victim of abuse. You say "it is an act" as if it's fact. So in my opinion, the first person you have slandered in this post is Tory Smith. DISINFO.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ok, so now that you say, you are being "sarcastic" in the next few paragraphs, let's go over some things.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               There is just one constant in this bewildering struggle, and his name is Mike Pence.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              How is that relevant? People talk crap about politicians ALL THE TIME. you can obviously tell that he's "special". Many times these people hyper-focus on certain people, groups, dates, etc excessively. My career was working with mentally disabled children, and then moving on to work with mentally disabled adults and mentally ill adults. My brother works with mentally ill children. I know how much they hyper-focus.
             </p>
             <p>
              When it comes to Tory Smith, in my opinion, it's safe to say that he doesn't have powers. So could be mentally ill. He could have always been that way, or it could have been caused trauma or mind control. Or, like you said, he could be acting. However, one can simply watch some of his videos and clearly see his health declining rapidly week by week. His face starts sinking in. His physical appearance changes drastically over time. His voice becomes weaker. That IS NOT AN ACT. You can't fake that. Therefore, he didn't live on and end up being HLI, WIC, Senate Anon or anyone else. That is false and is very disrespectful to Tory Smith's memory.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't know enough about the people you are accusing of being the same person, so I don't have an opinion on rather they are the same person or not. However, I also don't know you. From what I have seen so far, in my opinion, you are spreading disinfo and smearing peoples reputations based only on your opinion. Or possibly you are purposely doing it. How would you like that done to you? You could very well be the paid shill. What you are doing is something a paid shill would do. Maybe these people you are discrediting are revealing things you don't want revealed. Who knows.
             </p>
             <p>
              I find what you are doing is very suspicious. You hyper-focused on these people. You've checked dates as if you're some private investigator. You are building your case as if you're a prosecutor. You seem to be fishing for something you can use to back your theory up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ater reading your "series" so far, you are coming off cocky by acting as if you did strategic planning on these suspects that you zeroed in on and planned your moves up ahead of time, trying to get them to take the bait. Yeah, it's easy to say that later and come off like you are this brilliant investigator. But, why have you been putting so much time into them instead of Pizzagate? Why would you go thru all this time and work just to throw names under the bus? You keep adding new people to the list.

            is HLI. I went at it a little with WIC yesterday in an effort to pull some additional out of him.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can see why he is interested in Racine. The number of factories and wealthy businesses alone in that little tiny town is impressive, to say the least. Its history is interesting too.
           </p>
           <p>
            He can be irritating, condescending, and repetitive but I don't believe his opinions about Racine are impossible.
           </p>
           <p>
            His main point seems to be an effort to show people a small scale real world model of Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030. I don't have a problem with that.

             We do not have any motive beyond exposing the Truth. We don't care who exposes the Truth, and we are trying to explain what is at stake and how an unassuming city like Racine is hiding a much deeper darker secret that leads beyond Agenda 21 to something more nefarious.
            </p>
            <p>
             This poster may have the same intentions, although we question their motive, and we know.for certain their basic premise is extremely flawed. We are not HLI or any of the others he claims. Everyday he adds more alter egos to our list. Now we are also a YouTuber named Tory Smith, and ababcb, and fogdryer, and carmencita, etc. It is wild and ignorant speculation. At least speculate about something meaningful like Agenda 21 not that we are HLI and other anons.

             We can't help but be interested to see how he tries to justify this. We have a feeling we know the reason for this absurdity, but go ahead and keep digging

            One of the reasons I signed up hete was for the different opinions, more eyes, everyone bringing something different
           </p>
           <p>
            That we would join these puzzles to make sense and find proof to redpill everyone
           </p>
           <p>
            I dont expect everyone to agree, figure we are a think tank,  ALL WITH THE SAME GOAL
           </p>
           <p>
            Difference in opinions are a for sure here

            Will I agree with tomorrows post, cant say, but do admit the controversy it is causing peaks my interest
           </p>
           <p>
            My take on Feldman is different from a lot of people here, but I'm not going to confront someone who's opinion differs from mine unless you come after me
           </p>

            I may be right, I may be wrong..time will tell
           </p>

            If right, I wont look down on anyone for believing, as I hope when I am wrong it's not held against me

             Me too~trying to profit off of child abuse/by the time his 'movie' comes out (not holding breath on that one) it will be old news.  Plenty of ppl are coming forward giving names.  He could make a difference NOW but he needs to be paid first/oh right, living expenses, security blah blah.  He's a con, a scammer and who knows what all he lead Haim into.

            Another word of advise to all people on Voat: MSM is off course mostly paid disinfo, but YT channels are very often not better (Please subscribe like or become my patreon), one just has to see the utter neglect of all the big "players" in regard to the horrid frozen elsa content.

            should not try to monetize his PG stuff, the rest is worth to pay for, though :-) Titus Frost i could watch barely 5 minutes, and i am utterly flabbergasted how people can think he or the OP are doing anything worthwhile.

            The wealth distribution NOW is worse than in medieval times,

             http://fortune.com/2017/01/16/world-richest-men-income-equality/
            </a>
            let that drop: and soon it might look like 1% have 80% wealth, 24% have 15% (even feel priveledged maybe and get happily chipped, or at least buy the gadgets which are basically equivalent) and 75% well get "guidestoned" or are barely alive. So look for real solutions, and this rambling OP doesnt provide ANY for sure. No matter if WIC is the real deal or not !

             You will not find a youtube channel or patreon account for us. We.do not want money or credit, we only want the world to find out the Truth before it is too late. Racine and Wisconsin are a key path to that Truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             For.the record we provided Alex Jones, George Webb, Jason Goodman, Titus Frost, Defango, Lisa Haven, Outer Light Ed and other YouTubers information about Racine. Ed was the only one with a.seemingly genuine interest (George and Jason feigned interest after their fanbase was growing curious about Racine and then they broke up), yet even Ed never reported on it, and more suspiciously he was lurking in defango chats when we were exposing defango as a fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is the ultimate litmus test for any investigator or reporter, or President. We question anyone claiming to.be searching for the Truth who refuses to investigate what we have openly stated as the model for the real agenda of global corruption leading to eternal enslavement.

            Another word of advise to all people on Voat: MSM is off course mostly paid disinfo, but YT channels are very often not better (Please subscribe like or become my patreon), one just has to see the utter neglect of all the big "players" in regard to the horrid frozen elsa content.
           </p>

            The small ones are often as crappy (outerlight i find seriously interested at least, and his series on the papal audience hall is to be truly applauded ! The riddle people (lucky lucky i got the spear of destiny ... seriously ????????) are to be avoided as they are a distraction at best. Forgottenlanguages

            let that drop: and soon it might look like 1% have 80% wealth, 24% have 15% (even feel priveledged maybe and get happily chipped, or at least buy the gadgets which are basically equivalent) and 75% well get "guidestoned" or are barely alive. So look for real solutions, and this rambling OP doesnt provide ANY for sure. No matter if WIC is the real deal or not !

            Fascinating study, though connecting a YT producer to a voat account only leads to LARP, nothing more.  You infer much more than that.  How do you imagine that business transaction goes down?
            <br/>
            <em>
             "Uh Hi buddy.  How'd you like to come work for the guy that anyone with an Internet connection knows is doing all the stuff you hate MP for..."
            </em>
            I mean, you did say:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             So HLI really has something against Mike Pence, and was willing to go to great lengths.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So how can you put someone like t.smith in the roll of accepting an offer to terminate something he'd been doing since 2013(?) in order to hang out on voat-chan and LARP disinfo about someone he already had an ax to grind against, but for $$??  Like, maybe he was tired of the YT gig and wanted to try something new?
           </p>
           <p>
            Really?  This is
            <em>
             just a gig
            </em>
            ?
           </p>
           <p>
            That is a tremendous stretch - unless there are nuances to trying to monetize YT channels that I remain naive to.

             Ah, I see you picked up a slight flaw in how I worded things. Sorry, it's pretty complex stuff. To be clear: HLI has been working for David Brock since 2013, if not even longer. His salary in that role vastly exceeds the value of a YouTube channel with 6,000 subscribers. His job back then included running the phony Tory Smith account. When the Podesta emails hit, and Mike Pence became the VP nominee, he shifted to LARPing as HighLevelInsider and the Tory Smith project was shut down.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was at all times working for Brock, and was undoubtedly doing other stuff that we have yet to discover. But the time-consuming Tory Smith channel was shut down and HLI started up because of rapidly shifting priorities. The Podesta emails were a very big threat, and it was no longer any use trying to isolate Mike Pence, as Trump had openly allied with him.

              Sober, what would be really helpful is to make a timeline showing what all these people did on what date, and what else significant was happening. It would be much easier to follow your argument that way.

            Could be, anything could, but your logical leaps are the size of the grand canyon here. Good grief. Oh, he repeated a common topic or claim from the conspiracy mythosphere, oh wow. They must the same. They must all be the same. You're prolly Tory and HLI and WIC as well, right? Awww fuck, am I too?  I know since you and I put words on a page and say similar conspiracy stuff too.

               Oh, ha, that's good. I mean, it's stupid and counterproductive in a Jimmy Comet sort of way. I don't know if it's him, but it certainly doesn't help him.
              </p>
              <p>
               Side note: I'm only speculating here, but the likely reason Jimmy hasn't come back to refute me directly using the original account that he posted with, is that he has forgotten the password. Never post while high, it only leads to trouble later.

            Go figure FBIanon said Tavistock was the heart and three posters on this forum are eyewitnesses that have been saying Tavistock from the beginning and deleted, banned, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those witnesses shall not be named except Vindicator just banned one of them. The others are adult witnesses from the US and U.K. who have been on pizzagate since reddit. Research who has talked about Tavistock and linked it to locations here in the US. Who has been there and is an eyewitness who people would very much like to silence and issue death threats.

           <p>
            Those assaults and police reports are documented and being investigated as hit jobs

            So nice try giving your 7 part series proclaiming who is worthy and who isn't. You are silencing victims by doing it and the mods are allowing it.

             I'm not sure what your point is. I've never accused you of anything, and in fact I have never mentioned you. I haven't mentioned

            <p>
             I've never mentioned Tavistock, positively or negatively, in my time here. Jimmy Comet mentioned it when he was harassing me, and I quoted him
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2215476">
              in yesterday's post
             </a>
             . He said go research Tavistock and leave him alone. I don't conclude from that remark that Tavistock is fake. I'm sure Tavistock should be researched more. It just isn't relevant to the project I'm working on.

             has expressed some support for my arguments. I suppose since you are frequently fighting with her, you might think that means you are somehow fighting with me. But it doesn't.

            <p>
             The only thing that I can see us having any conflict about, is that you seem to support

             . I'm not 100 percent sure because

             </a>
             is actually a separate account with no activity on it. But okay, if that's your complaint about me, then I would appreciate it if you would wait for tomorrow's post before concluding anything. Thanks.

            Rambling bollocks. So the only problem is a few (alleged) sockpuppetaccounts ?. I am reassured. World saved, where can i subscribe like or become your patreon? I just checked your "body" of work: not impressed. WIC and HLI (which i would, although seemingly quite erudite, pack much easier in the cointelpro corner) would even disagree on some vital points, voila another proof of your astute theory ? That you say to spread the "work" over many posts to gain attention and create suspense, while children are in danger, doesnt need to be commented.
Your Titus Frost quote is another highlight. So maybe YOU are a SOCK of his ? It SMELLS bad either way ! WIC (if he/they are real) shouldnt waste time arguing with you. Alone that WIC would mention Wellerstone, who is (the good audio parts at least) almost scrubbed from Youtube and many points he/they mention(s) are far more coherent, no matter if one likes the religious wording, than your rambling.

             Thank you. We can be questioned all day, but all we are interested in is the Truth and stopping the agenda of eternal enslavement. We do not care what religions are involved, but we do care about the freedom of religion and the freedom to die.
            </p>

             We hope they keep digging and eventually learn the real Truth. At least Paul Wellstone knew part of the Truth about the Clintons' plan for Iraq, and the collusion between Cargill, DuPont, Monsanto, Dow, SC Johnson and many others involved. We did not agree on everything but Paul knew we spoke the Truth long ago.

               We have reported on many other connections outside of Racine, but Racine is the "root" and model of the real agenda.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look into SC Johnson's global locations and partnerships from their involvement in Haiti to their control of Ghana to their ties with Dutch and British Royalty theough the Pilgrims Society. In relation to Paul Manafort, look into their ties with the U.S. Ukraine Business Council. Look at their ties to Rotary, Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation. Or look at their ties to Jacksonville and the Mayo Clinic, or Epic Systems, Abbott, Solvay, Bayer, DuPont, Cargill and others. It is endless.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look into Poway, California and Tom DeLonge, Travis Barker, and ties to Evan McMullin, Mitt Romney and Warren Jeffs. DeLonge is closely tied to Podesta and Peter Lavenda which leads to the partnership between LDS, Jesuits, OTO, Scientology and Kabbalah.

                 The only solution is global enlightenment in the race between the Truth and AI. Kabbalah is absolutely involved, but it is part of a bigger coalition that also includes Jesuits, LDS, OTO, Scientology and other groups. It is part of the agenda for one world currency and one world religion. In Racine they created a model for collective control called the Racine Interfaith Coalition ran primarily by the Racine Dominicans.

                <p>
                 We know all about Ashton (Chris) Kutcher's involvement in the real agenda. He is one of many actors involved linked with Guy Oseary, Ron Burkle, Mark Cuban, Peter Thiel, the Emanuels, John McCain and others in the chain.

                 Racine means Root. It is the direct translation and origin. It is also built around the Root River that leads to the largedt fresh water sources in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Racine is also the hub and model for programs involved such as Sustainability, Community Policing, Vaccination, and Art in Embassies that all play a role in the new world order agenda.

                  Please provide your actual research (a link, not just another one of your undocumented assertions) that Racine is the model for the Art in Embassies program.

                 <p>
                  Are you confusing that program with the National Endowment for the Arts, which the Johnson Foundation claims to have "conceived?"

                    Thank you for the link.  I don’t know why you think SC Johnson “forged” the Art in Embassies program.  It participated in the program after it was formed by the State Dept., according to your link.  Nonetheless, I appreciate the link and it is an interesting connection.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Now please provide documentation of your claim that the Johnsons “control” the airport and harbor in Racine.  I find no people named Johnson on the Airport Committee or the Harbor Commission, but you might be aware of other controllers.  Please be specific and provide links.

                     For Art in Embassies, SC Johnson did not create the program they gave it real legitimacy which allowed it to expand.

                     <p>
                      "The Johnson collection, by contrast, was demonstrably 'not propaganda', and I thinks its impact will be immense."

                     The Johnsons control everything in Racine including the airport and harbor, and are the primary corporate user of the airport for international flights, with its own cuatoms office. The Johnsons also were the key donor to develop the harbor including millions for the festival site along the lake.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                     <p>
                      " Rooney was always trying to grow support for his big ideas. And then the late Sam Johnson came aboard, wanting to help spark a renaissance of Downtown, and he started the Downtown Racine Development Corp."
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      "DRC sponsored a gathering of county supervisors and city aldermen at SC Johnson’s Council House to talk about what could be done. Committees were formed and consultants were hired, and those consultants devised the idea for Festival Park. Rooney was then County Board chairman."

                     Look into the Yarber family for more ties to Batten airport trafficking to Wingsread and ties to the Nelsons drug trafficking out of the Dells who also have a private island by Epstein.

                      As you know, the purpose of Art in Embassies was to show the world that capitalists have an appreciation for more than just making money.  Murrow thought the Johnson collection would prove that.  Yes, it's a globalist agenda but not really nefarious at that point unless you have some other info.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I give up on you.  You still have not shown how "the Johnsons control everything in Racine, including the airport and the harbor, and are the primary corporate user of the airport for international flights..."  I'm sure this is true in a relatively small town where SC Johnson is a huge corporate presence.  HOW are they controlling the airport and port?  Donations for a festival site along the lake, if true, is not suspicious unless you can show that the festival site is being used for nefarious purposes.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If you're serious, YOU will look into the Yarber family, etc., etc., and provide some documentation.  I'm finished with you.

             I think it is really astounding how easy people are distracted. Maybe the repetition on WIC`s part (here i think

             had a valid point, although the complexity of the global "interaction" of people with nefarious intentions, is obviously not to be seen easily, so repetition might be seen by some as necessary) could be toned down for sure.

             On the other hand the sheer volume of information, most of it which can be confirmed by simple MSM searches, provided by WIC and the fact that his/her picture is certainly more realistic than that HRC is scared of Paul Ryan or Mike Pence and would order MediaMatter to start this convoluted sockpuppet "campaign", lets me conclude SHILL in regard to the OP.

              HLI, you must be running out of existing alts to draw upon, if you have to resort to a 1-day-old account to deliver your message. People see through that really fast, and it's hardly worth my arguing with you.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I am kind of interested still in whether Brock told you the full story. Your use of a disposable shill account, at this stage, reinforces my suspicion that you might not actually know. It smells like a stalling tactic. You're not going to try and counter this latest move of mine with WIC or

              until you see where I'm going.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I'm guessing the HLI account is just never coming back. Very tricky to condescend to someone who knows more than you do.
