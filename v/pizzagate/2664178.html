            I will be deeply saddened if parents and activists do not go into the streets.  This must be heavily protested. If not, they too have failed the children and their future.

            Technically, a judge would very likely be unable to do what you proposed, and (hopefully) this has never happened. It’s bad enough that an 11YO was considered able to consent.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don’t want to pick on you, but I have a low tolerance for hyperbole, especially when the facts are more than enough to plead a case.

             well, in defense of how I wrote it - and if you've learnt anything in your time on voat/pizzagate:  sure you can argue 'no judge would ever in good faith construe a 3 yr old to be 'mature'
            </p>
            <p>
             but that presumes good faith
            </p>
            <p>
             the point is that if you have a Judge who is part of the pedostocracy in a court case where the defendant is also an asset of the pedostocracy, the current law as it stand gives Agency to that corruption

               a Judge may be sticking their neck out to do that with a 3 yr old, sure, but it provides perfect cover for them with 11 yr olds or maybe 9 yr olds - or if the defendant is a muslim, 6 yr olds. Inshallah

              I am following you here, but again I don’t know of recent cases like this. I don’t know how the appeals process works in a French court. Yet the hyperbole doesn’t help; it only hurts by creating deeper division over would’ve/could’ve.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said: This certainly merits further digging.

                It's the same concept as when the cops here decide not to do something to a rapist / domestic abuser / whatever because they don't want to. All they have to do is find some legal "excuse' not to. Judges are the same. if you don't think so then you have zero experience dealing with courts or law enforcement and you're naive.

                Yes, we are on the same page. There is no need to bring whatif’s to this and extrapolate to a younger age. From what I’ve read, the rape you’re speaking of is what spurred the idea to change the legislation.
               </p>
               <p>
                What I’m saying is that the raw facts are fucked up. We do not need to head down the slippery slope argument.

                  You are correct in your trend prediction. I am saying that the cause is best served without resorting to slippery slope whenever possible, especially when the current reality is enough to illustrate the point: Remove argument. Remove hyperbole. State fact removed from editorialization.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As an aside, and I’ve been asking this question for years: Name a ‘right-wing’ news source who reports without editorialization. The best I’ve been recommended is mintpress. They still profess from on high and print disinfo, but less so. Yet I never see those links on Voat.

                   This is SO MUCH more effective in persuading people who aren't on board. But people have seen it so infrequently, they just don't understand how effective it can be compared to editorializing. Someone should do a thread showing the difference. Maybe we should have an award flair for posts presented editorial free?

                   On the other hand, it is also true that Voat is one of the last places people can come to say what they think about the appalling bullshit that has overtaken the world. I suppose the ideal would be: straight reporting in the post body, interpretation and editorializing in the Comments, even for the author.

                   Imagine how much more hard-hitting our stuff would be! The shills would lose their minds.

                    Obviously this would be not something to enforce at the mod level, but it would certainly make the place shine when mixed with the ‘let’s research x’ posts.

              You are correct. There is evident hyperbole in OP. In my mind this does not make you ‘a dick’.
