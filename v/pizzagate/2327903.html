            Scientology, like most cults, has CIA connections. L Ron Hubbards  and David Miscavige have CIA connections. Miscavige was even cited as being a CIA "source". Mind control is the first thing you notice the church uses. An informative article about Scientology and the CIA

            One of the FBI's jobs is to be the investigation gatekeeper for the cabal. They do however, allow scientology to be bashed. After all, they also have an agenda to demonize religion.

             I'd be more willing to believe that if Scientology hasn't historically done the exact opposite of what it needs to do in order to grow and gain new converts.  It's a fucking disaster zone, with almost every public-relations decision guaranteed to hurt the organization's reputation.  That wouldn't be happening if it was actually controlled by people who aren't LRH zealots.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's easy to accuse everything of being some shadow government conspiracy, but there's a certain level of chaos that's present in the world that isn't controlled by some central cabal.

              Disagree. The CIA was also behind the Jim Jones cult, and made sure it ended in mass murder and destruction. They want to use mind control and communism on those involved, and demonize it as religious nuts to outsiders. Which is exactly what they do. Scientology, according to the official story, backded down the IRS. That looks like a psyop now that CIA connections are made to Scientology. It explains why the IRS granted them all their wishes. The IRS is owned by the Crown corp consisting of Bank of England owned by Rothschild, elite bankers, Vatican and the Queen. They would crush scientology under their crooked subverted justice system if they wanted to. They chose to back down and give them tax exempt status. A show.

            I was contacted by a follower on Twitter who has a person who is allegedly a victim of child trafficking in Canada. They are looking for contacts to get help with the judicial system. Here is the original message I received. Because I am aware of the extensive research on this thread I thought I'd post to see if there were any suggestions. I am not posting the original link to make sure opposition cannot make contact directly:

            Hello! I hope you see my message. I need help or maybe you can point me in the right direction. I have become friends with someone on Twitter that had been trafficked. They live in Canada. They where sold at the age of 17. They were smuggled into Canada. A she sent me a bunch of info. Anyhow she entered in when Trudeau Sr. Was the prime minister. Said he was a pedo. The judge when she went to court covered this all up. Records had her pedo owner listed as her husband...any suggestions who she could talk to?

             It would depend who was doing the traficking. It it was some rogue opperation, the judicial system could help. If it was the CIA/ FBI traficking ring, going to them could be a big mistake. We would need to know more and connect dots.

             what is she trying to achieve? Legal justice is extremely unlikely.  the courts are hopelessly corrupt, probably in Canada too, and they will protect each other and their corrupt systems. no lawyer will commit career suicide to go after judges. they are very likely to go after her, burn her house down, find her guilty of some crime that they can lock her up for.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe she could file for divorce and get half of the pedoowners' shit...

              Canada is, believe it or not, THE WORST FUCKING PLACE for justice!! The 'nice' Canadians tagline is a sham. It is VERY corrupt. Children's Aid is nothing but a scam and trafficking center . The British send their pedos across to Canada when they have heat on them for pedophilia charges. I could go on and on. I was as well as my children, victims of this corruption and dickheads like Robert Lantos and Frank Giustra are allowed to walk around free.

               I am so sorry. I know first hand how corruption can destroy lives beyond repair. its truly horrible that we live in a world where violence and crimes are rewarded with so much destain for the vulnerable or unsuspecting. i wish peace and justice for you.
