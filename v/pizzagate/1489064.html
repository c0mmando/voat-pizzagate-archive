            The problem with asking about the satanist stuff is that it makes it easy for us to be written off in my opinion.
           </p>
           <p>
            We should be asking why Monica Peterson works for the same company as Laura Silsby etc. Pushing little details they haven't or can't explain.
           </p>
           <p>
            And like another anon here said it might be a good idea to make this into an image/meme to spread around on social media.

             good suggestion,
            </p>
            <p>
             About the meme thing - I think these questions are all legitimate questions I would like to see explained. Therefore I believe the power will be in just sending out one question at the time. I think it's harder to debunk 10 statements independently, as opposed to when we shout out lists, where one or two are questionable...
