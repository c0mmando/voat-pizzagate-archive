            "The focus should always be on the groups and individuals who play the long game to inveigle their way into organisations.
The strategy is always the same, whether the organisation is a charity, education, religious institution, care facility or cult."

            Hi there
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/allonthesameteam">
             @allonthesameteam
            </a>
            . Thanks for letting us know about the Data is Beautiful subreddit. That sounds like an excellent resource -- I'm giving this our "Pro Tip" flair.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could you maybe add a few linked examples of especially effective presentations of child abuse data? You can upload screenshots or image files to catbox.moe and paste the url in your submission. We've also got
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatememes">
             v/pizzagatememes
            </a>
            that could always use more "visualizations" of pizzagate. :-)  You might want to cross post this submission there.

            This is a very thoughtful post. Thank you!
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with many of the other responses below. Just keep talking about it. The weight of the problem seems too great at times and it’s hard to find real life solutions that can help. Really hard. One thing that has helped me a lot is now I stand out on street corners with signs a few times a week and I feel better knowing I’m putting that energy out there and spreading awareness.

            Start with the people around you.  As Mike Ruppert used to say to his audiences, "I'm not trying to save the world because the world doesn't want to be saved.  But if I can help you, that's enough.  Start with little things.  For instance, the next time some normies are talking about whatever show they've watched on Netflix, ask them with surprise, "Netflix?  Have the FBI not shut them down yet?"  Then tell them about the CP film they produced and distributed called
            <em>
             Desire
            </em>
            which features a 9 year old girl masturbating in its opening scene.  If you can get just one person to think twice before using Netflix, or more importantly, letting their child use it again, that's a good start.

             Yes!  Very helpful podge512!

             Astounded at the number of people who are paying Soros through their consent of netflux taking their money every month for absolute garbage.

             Yes!! Great example. And YouTube with elsagate... so many examples of organizations exploiting children and/ or protecting pedophiles.
