<p>There\'s a Link Between Disney and <em>Esptein</em> Island</p>

<p>Maybe this is a Mandela Effect (or like a magic trick we were misdirected by the Disney Cruise), but I notice nobody caught these misspellings. </p>
<p>ESP stands for extrasensory perception. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3108744">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3108744</a></p>
<p>So Epstein Island becomes &quot;ESP-Teen Island&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For a 30-year stretch beginning in the early 1980s, one of Los Angeles County’s great hosts was a man called Al Seckel. His parties were not lavish or wild. There was no skinny-dipping, no drugs. There were no ice sculptures, no celebrity caterers, no peacocks strutting about the grounds. There weren’t even grounds, really. </p>
<p>From the time he moved to L.A. in 1981 until he left for France about five years ago, Seckel held court in a series of apartments and rental homes, often in the hills of Pasadena and La Cañada Flintridge, save for a stint or two in Malibu. Sometimes his parties were arranged around a main event—Fourth of July fireworks, a magic show. Other times he issued instructions, like “Bring the most interesting person you’ve ever met,” or “Bring a copy of the book that you’ve most enjoyed.” Sometimes Seckel had a wife to co-host with him, other times not. One wife had been an It Girl in London during the 1980s; another, his current wife, had been a co-founder of the early web search engine Magellan.</p>
<p>As in wives, so in party guests: Seckel’s unique genius was his catholicity of taste. Milling around his parties were not only the B- and C-list celebrities requisite in L.A. but Nobel Prize-winning physicists, MacArthur “genius prize” winners, tech entrepreneurs, oddball futurists, and magicians. There were actors, musicians, and fringe entertainment types, plus academics associated with nearby Caltech and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Catherine Mohr, a noted innovator in surgical robotics and a longtime friend of Seckel’s, met the Nobel laureates Murray Gell-Mann and Francis Crick at Seckel’s parties. “He loves bringing together people of interesting backgrounds and seeing the chemistry of them,” Mohr told me.</p>
<p>John Edwards, a retired Air Force engineer who danced in two Michael Jackson videos and won $100,000 on a short-lived ABC show called Dance Machine, first met Seckel through a Southern California atheists’ group, and for a time the two were close friends. Edwards remembers meeting, at Seckel’s parties, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, drone pioneer Paul MacCready, magician and MacArthur Fellow James “Amazing” Randi, and Dudley Moore. “He would bring everyone together the way Hearst would bring people to his castle,” Edwards said.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Seckel first met Isabel Maxwell on a blind date. They married around 2007—“I don’t keep the dates in my head,” he told me—in Malibu. </p>
<p>She is also the sister of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein and the woman alleged to have procured girls for him (hence, it would seem, the connection between Seckel and Epstein’s island). </p>
<p>Lately Seckel has been trying to sell the papers of Robert Maxwell, his late father-in-law, but so far he hasn’t found a buyer.</p>

<p>In 1984, Seckel started the Southern California Skeptics (SCS), and became a spokesperson for science and its relationship to the paranormal.[5] SCS co-sponsored and produced a monthly series of lectures, primarily held at the California Institute of Technology, with other meetings occasionally held on the campus of Cal State Fullerton, that explained alleged paranormal phenomena such as extra-sensory perception</p>

            , since you have elected not to correct this submission as requested, I have to give this the "Possible Disinfo" flair and leave this up rather than removing per Rule 2 so that folks know there is questionable information being promulgated by Qmap.pub. If you want to call attention to their error, and edit this submission so that it is not spreading a bogus ESP claim, I will gladly remove the flair.

            , what's up with this submission? The first part about Epstein's first suicide attempt likely being false is okay (pg related), but everything after that...not so much.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your second point about misspelling Epstein as "Esptein" in the title of a Qpost is not a valid avenue for this board, because it is merely a typo created by the people who operate the Qmap board. Q does not post titles for his crumbs. Here's
            <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/eaah7u.png">
             a screencap of the same Q leak #3497 on QAnon.pub
            </a>
            , one of the aggregator boards that does
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            editorialize. And

             here is the archive of the original 8chan drop
            </a>
            . Neither of them have Epstein misspelled referencing ESP. That is either an error, or someone is pushing Disinfo. There is no evidence Q is hinting that Epstein was into ESP.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the info on Seckel and Mindshift is interesting, you have not explained any linkage between that material and the abuse of kids by the global elite.

               Minimally Invasive Surgery (altering them surgically)

              <p>
               Encryption and Decryption (securing the islands database)
              </p>
              <p>
               New Financial Systems and Methods ( setting up ways to funnel the ill gotten gains)

            In regards to Espteen &amp; Disney I have a nother lead and possible 🐰 hole;
           </p>
           <p>
            Espstein co owned a marina in St Thomas with Andrew Farkas , Farkas just leased property,  in St Thomas,to former Disney exec Dave Goodman .
           </p>
           <p>
            Dave Goodman's company is called Mindshare Network and you'll probably guess what his logo is....yep you got it, yet another spiral.
