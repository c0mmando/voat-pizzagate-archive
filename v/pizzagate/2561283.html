<p>The Miami Herald is seeking to unseal documents pertaining to a court case involving Epstein.  Julie Brown, an investigative journalist for the Herald, requested the court unseal all of the documents that have been filed under seal or redacted.

<p>A reddit posting about the files reads:
&quot;read through all of them.  3,877 pages were deleted outright.  197 pages were made available.  Just over half of this was news releases.  About a tenth of the pages are blank sheets.  Not one page pertaining to the case was left containing any kind of information that would be useful.  Nothing was left unredacted - addresses, dstes, etc.  All deletions were listed in the archive as a list of pages redacted in the format.</p>
<p>Most documents were redacted under 3, 6, 7(c) and 7(d) of the FOIA.  Exemption 3 allows the FBI to redact information provided &quot;in confidentialty&quot; with no other particular reason required.  Additionally, the documents that were deleted outright had to contain some information not under FOIA provisions 6, 7(c) and 7(d) - but they were deleted anyway.&quot;

            Well, the pages tell us nothing, but the fact that they were so heavily redacted, that tells us plenty.  There is nothing to even go on.  No way to decode anything.
