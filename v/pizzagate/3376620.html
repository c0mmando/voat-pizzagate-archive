             Tattoo is a 1981 erotic thriller film directed by Bob Brooks and starring Bruce Dern and Maud Adams. It depicts the relationship between a fashion model and an eccentric tattoo artist that quickly turns sinister.
            </p>
            <p>
             The film was written by Joyce Buñuel, the daughter-in-law of surrealist artist Luis Buñuel, based on a story by director Bob Brooks. It was featured in an April 13, 1980 New York Times article spotlighting films being shot on-location in New York City..
            </p>
            <p>
             In Episode 4 of Series 2 of the BBC sitcom The Royle Family, the film is discussed extensively. The character Denise calls it "absolutely brilliant," and explains the plot to Barbara and Cheryl, who are both fascinated and horrified. Meanwhile in the living room Dave is explaining the film to Jim, who questions why the protagonist would want to cover up his victim's breasts rather than look at them. Upon learning that the title of the film is Tattoo,
             <strong>
              Jim references the Fantasy Island character Tattoo and his catchphrase

               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ze_plane!_Ze_plane!
              </a>
              "Ze plane! Ze plane!", also quoted as "De plane! De plane!" or "The plane! The plane!", is a cultural reference to the typical opening of Fantasy Island, a television series which aired in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Each episode began with the diminutive Tattoo (played by Hervé Villechaize), one of the main characters, spotting the seaplane approaching the island and running up a tower and excitedly yelling, "Ze Plane! Ze Plane!" and ringing a bell.
             </p>
             <p>
              The actual aircraft used in the series was a SCAN Type 30, a license-built copy of a Grumman Widgeon seaplane,[7] U.S. registry N4453. ...The aircraft was later rented or sold to parties who later used it to smuggle drugs into the United States, and it crashed in a swamp on at least one occasion. It was confiscated by the DEA and sold by the U.S. Marshals Service at auction. It again fell into the hands of other drug smugglers and was eventually confiscated and sold again. It was involved in a gear collapse accident in the 1990s and repainted deep red, so it is not as recognizable as Ze Plane of the television series when it was painted white.[11] Ze Plane! Ze Plane! has at times been on display on the airshow circuit in the American Midwest,[12] and was previously owned by the Ozarks Auto Show, Inc.,[13] a regional antique dealer, of Hollister, Missouri, and was stored in a hangar at the M. Graham Clark Downtown Airport near Branson, Missouri along with several other special interest aircraft. The plane was sold at the 38th annual Branson Collector Car Auction on April 16, 2016 to an undisclosed buyer for $275,000.

            <p>
             Bob Brooks (26 December 1927 – September 2012[1]) was an American film director, photographer and advertising creative.[2] He created numerous advertising campaigns, directed several thousand[citation needed] TV commercials in the UK, US and Europe, and directed two feature films. Brooks was a founding partner of BFCS, an influential British film production company, and one of the founders of Design and Art Direction (D&amp;AD). He was acclaimed within his lifetime, with numerous international awards....
            </p>
            <p>
             After graduating Penn State University in 1950, Brooks arrived in New York in 1953 as an Efficiency Expert for the US Government. He soon realized that this was not his life’s work and he competed for and was awarded a scholarship at Cooper Union School of Art, one of the last bastions of the Bauhaus design tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1955 Brooks started
             <strong>
              Cooper Union night classes and at the same time he was hired by Ogilvy and Mather,
             </strong>
             as the low man in the art department… the matte boy. At that time David Ogilvy was still actively writing. "It was a very exciting place, with Ogilvy's style representing (along with Doyle Dane Bernbach) the very essence of fifties advertising." In that job, he said he learned all the principles of advertising photography, typography and layout.[4]
            </p>
            <p>
             ..In the late 1950s Brooks decided that he wanted to live and work in Europe and he was sent to the London office of Benton &amp; Bowles, as head of the art department. After a short while he was joined by Bob Gross, a copywriter Brooks had worked with at B&amp;B NY. Together they became Joint Creative Directors of the London agency.

               Herschend Family Entertainment (HFE) is a privately owned themed-entertainment company that operates several theme parks and tourist attractions within the United States
              </strong>
              . Founded by Jack and Pete Herschend of Branson, Missouri, in its early years HFE was simply known as Herschend Enterprises. In the 1980s the name was changed to Silver Dollar City Inc., and in 2003 the company gained the current name. HFE is currently headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.
             </p>

              HFE traces roots back to Hugo and Mary Herschend from Chicago, Illinois along with sons Jack and Pete. The family vacationed in Missouri’s Ozark Mountains region and fell in love with the nature the area offered. In 1951 Hugo obtained a 99-year lease on a Branson, Missouri area attraction called Marvel Cave.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Rockefeller Briefing Document. In comments upon a draft of this article, Don Berliner indicated that he “was particularly concerned with the limited time available for members of our target audience to spend on this report, and so there was no effort to make it a scientific document”. He also asked “How many times do I have to explain (not to you, but to the complainers) that the report was not written for the private UFO community, but for important people who know little of the subject and must be carefully fed relevant information?”
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Mannion also quotes Don Berliner as saying: “This report has gotten to a great many influential people, but we haven’t seen much of a result yet. However, we knew all along that the chances of anything happening quickly were very slim. The idea was to educate people in high places; people who, if they were sufficiently impressed, could make a difference. We have learned to be patient. It still may pay off big, but it hasn’t yet. The report had a different purpose from any other UFO book. It was aimed at people who knew very little about the subject – and who had very little time. They are busy people. You don’t give them a big book to read. We have gotten some very good comments from some impressive names but as yet, it has not turned the world on its ear. We stirred up a bit of a hornet’s nest with the report because UFO enthusiasts could not get copies. But that’s not what it was for. However, we are hoping to publish it commercially now”.
              </p>
              <p>
               The “woman who was handling UFO matters for Laurance Rockefeller” mentioned by Don Berliner was Marie “Bootsie” Galbraith. Mrs Galbraith was the wife of Evan Griffith Galbraith, an investment banker and the U.S. ambassador to France from 1981 to 1985. She was engaged by Laurance Rockefeller, and coordinated the writing and distribution of the Rockefeller Briefing Document. Grant Cameron has quoted Antonio Huneeus as stating that Mrs Galbraith “was the executive producer of this thing” and that she “did not really write a great deal in terms of actual writing, but she must have proofread and edited and digested it so many times. Every single page was approved by her up to the last comma. In the end, she decided that she wanted her name there as a co-author” (see Footnote 11.12).

                It's a lot of things. and it's kind of a pet theory that isn't finished, like a lot of em :s
               </p>
               <p>
                But since I took my voat break, I've done endless image searches trying to find various instances of triangular spirals, to determine when it became a pedo symbol.
               </p>
               <p>
                in doing so, I've found tangentially (or perhaps directly) related symbols that have been used by lgbt, Masonic, and occult groups.
               </p>
               <p>
                All in all, the Spiral as a symbol consistently recurs in a lot of different cultures. Most of the time it refers to a portal or energy. In South Americ, there are particular associations of spirals with incest and intergenerational sex.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wilhelm reich and his followers also hypothesized about sexual energy being manifested in blue spirals or "orgone energy"
               </p>
               <p>
                I personally think the particular little boy lover/ boylover logo goes way further back then the 90's (as put forth by the the wikileaked 2007 fbi memo), as it was showing up in Disney's flight of the Navigator (80's movie)
               </p>
               <p>
                We all know it appears on Disneys small world ride, well I traced it back further to the conceptual design art for the original UNESCO 1960's it's a small world ride in NY.
               </p>
               <p>
                Mary Blair used it heavily in her Disney Artwork, including artistic symbols and concepts from her trips to South America, which seem like a cover for psychedelic experimentation. Walt used her for ALICE IN WONDERLAND in which her con ept ar features tons of hearts w/in heart symbology as well as multiple blue circular spirals
               </p>
               <p>
                I then went back to lewis carrol, and discovered that he too employed meanders in his artwork and actual text. The rabbit hole is consistently portrayed as a blue spiral
               </p>
               <p>
                he would also write poems in literal spirals so you had to turn the page and rotate it as you read to the center.
               </p>

                 Articles from a girl lover magazine on archive.org that explain the life of Alice Liddell and Lewis Carrol connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Understanding this connections opens the eyes of Pizzagate researches as so many parts including the 5 of Spades Pedophile code, the mind of these pedophiles and how they reason and deflect guilt on to others and make these things acceptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Low hanging fruit maybe, but this includes the Girl lover heart within the smaller heart logo, a willingness to accept and rationalise Pedophiliac behaviour by making it seem all innocent and poetic.

                The magazines contain articles, poems, opinions, etc written by minor attracted persons, members of an online community of the same name as the magazine that has been online for many years, obviously the magazine does not contain any child porn as this not only would be illegal but it also goes against the spirit of the community.

                TLDR: The Meander is the pattern on  the borders of greek pottery....it looks like this:
               </p>
               <p>
                /\/\/\/\/\/\

               <p>
                its named after a windy river in Greece. When looking at symbology and art texts, they point to ancient greece as the earliest use of the symbol.
               </p>
               <p>
                Its known to imply confusion, or a maze-like quality, as well as a long history of hypnosis
               </p>
               <p>
                I use "meander symbology" as a loose descriptor of these possibly occult/mystery-school spirals.

                in particular epstein has spiralling shells inlaid in the concrete of LSJI, and it seems like an homage to Laurance Rockefellers caneel bay logo

Learn more, I know about the meander pattern because of my art training, so if there is no way to look at it, all of the sudden, I trust your judgement. I have had some freaky things happening with search engines and other. Obviously, we are over the target.
