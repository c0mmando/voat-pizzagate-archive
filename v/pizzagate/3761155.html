             On another note, James Alefantis's father has a building and decorating company in New York (close to Pier 90). They have worked in the past with a wallpaper company which supplied the pornographic wallpaper we've seen in the Soho House. That company has a Royal Warrant from the Queen of England and regularly works with royal families... just sayin...

              It is best known for its issue tracking application, Jira, and its team collaboration and wiki product, Confluence.[4][6] Atlassian serves over 135,000 customers.  Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002.[3][7] The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
             </p>
             <p>
              In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.
             </p>
             <p>
              In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million,[20] and Shona Brown was added to its board.[15] On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange,[21] under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.
