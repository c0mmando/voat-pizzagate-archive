<p>The Trump administration is considering a proposal that would use Google, Amazon and Apple to collect data on users who exhibit characteristics of mental illness that could lead to violent behavior, The Washington Post reported Thursday.</p>
<p>The proposal is part of an initiative to create a <strong>Health Advanced Research Projects Agency (HARPA)</strong>, which would be located inside the Health and Human Services Department, the report notes, citing sources inside the administration. The new agency would have a separate budget and the president would be responsible for appointing its director.</p>

             On another note, James Alefantis's father has a building and decorating company in New York (close to Pier 90). They have worked in the past with a wallpaper company which supplied the pornographic wallpaper we've seen in the Soho House. That company has a Royal Warrant from the Queen of England and regularly works with royal families... just sayin...

              It is best known for its issue tracking application, Jira, and its team collaboration and wiki product, Confluence.[4][6] Atlassian serves over 135,000 customers.  Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002.[3][7] The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
             </p>
             <p>
              In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.
             </p>
             <p>
              In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million,[20] and Shona Brown was added to its board.[15] On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange,[21] under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.

             Looking into company information of the UK company links Atlassian to BigFix Inc.  who work with the US Department of Defence
