            12/09/2014 –Medical examinations of both children confirm the allegations of sexual abuse and violence. Dr Hodes says that the scars in the rectum area were caused by the insertion of plastic objects. She confirms that many injuries had occurred at least half a year to a year before the examination.

           <p>
            I'm so very sorry about your daughter.  I've seen/read about parents giving up and some even taking their own lives.   Please accept my condolences.

            Just horrible... so so sorry. Putting Pizzagate aside, this is an absolute travesity what is happening within a GOVERNMENT agency! The scale of this is becoming abundantly clear. If its that easy to take children away, for what money? How easy would it be for higher ups to have access?
           </p>
           <p>
            Im sorry for your loss. Everyone should be burning inside like you probably are for justice. Never stop investigating

            I have a lawyer friend in PA. I asked her about this kind of "legal kidnapping" going on with CPS.
She said she has seen an increase over the past few years with clients needing help with harassment by CPS. She says as soon as CPS knows the family has a lawyer, they usually back off pretty quick. To be clear, this is happening not just with "poor" families, but also bigger traditional families (at least with her experience). She said her latest was a family who the mom was admitted into Williamsport Hospital with a severe problem, and the dad called her because there was a CPS worker who kept coming in the room and grilling him about his kids, who was taking care of them and why wasn't he working. All while his wife was lying there on a ventilator.  WTF. 
The guy was an engineer and also a veteran. He kept his cool and called my friend.

            This shit is getting scary, imo.

             You're right if they know the parents can afford a lawyer they sometimes back off. but some of these attorneys will charge well over 100k.  I've been reading about these cases for years and the reason they normally target the impoverished is twofold.   One being that the states currently receive funding is if the family's is within the Federal Poverty Guidelines which is a mandate however that will soon be changing.  In the year 2018 any child that is removed does not have to come from a family whose income is within the FPL.    The second reason they tend to target families who aren't well off is they are then appointed an atty. who works for the state.  These attorneys on avg. are give approximately $800 to handle the case and can handle up to 160 cases per yr.   They are employed by the state and the state has a financial interest to keep the children in the system so if that atty. wants to keep his/her income flowing he will not work at winning the case for the parents.  In fact time and time again these parents meet their atty for the first time 10-15 minutes before the hearing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's an atty. out of CA who has taken on the system more than once and has won several multi million dollar settlements.  In this case it was a class action suit and  Atty, McMillan sued the state for the wrongful removal of 5000 children.

             Keep spreading the word. I was actually quite bummed at how little exposure this is getting. Im seeing a pattern. Just google cps corruption and you'll find an article from just about every State. The fact they can come into your home without a warrent and take your kids away based on a rumor is absolutely scary. You cant even trust appoinyed lawyers because they're most likely in on it.

            We need to petition the Trump Administration to immediately stop the 'paying for children' nightmare going on in CPS across our country.  This is a really good interview with Sofie Smallstorm, investigator and journalist, regarding The Club.

            There are many cases where CPS/Social Services are involved look at the Franklin Scandal where they got the boys to "service" VIP's &amp; legislators in DC from Boys Town. Then there is the case in the UK where a ring comprised of 25000 pedophiles was operated by a priest. The priest was in contact with the Director of Social Services who provided children from several group homes to ''service" these perverts.

Senator Clark from Arkansas has been advocating for families in his state after he became involved with a case where seven children were removed from their home by a SWAT team. The Senator discovered after the children were out of the home for almost two years that there had been an email sent the day AFTER the children were taken that clearly stated there was no need for their removal. He then started to uncover more of the same just as Senator Nancy Schaeffer did (Sen. Schaeffer was murdered while trying to expose CPS trafficking of children.) Senator Clark is discovering that a large percentage of children are being removed unnecessarily from their homes just as Senator Schaeffer discovered.
I believe that there are several reasons we currently have 427000 children in the system one of them being to traffic children to these rings. There are hundreds of alt media publications publishing these stories but you'd be hard pressed to find many in mainstream media because they are just as complicit with hiding the truth from the public.

            CPS in her state were given cash bonuses ($5000 +) to relocate kids, so of course they were overzealous and would rip kids off their parents on the slightest pretext. Place them with families sometimes with known paedophiles. Nancy made a movie which was never released as she was assassinated 3 weeks before its release and the producer chickened out. She said CPS is 'beyond reform'

              The Adoption and the Safe Families Act, set in motion by President Bill Clinton, offered cash
“bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child. Employees work to keep the federal dollars flowing;

            One step closer to the state just taking children from everyone at a certain age. They are already trying to push that children belong to the society and not the parents. You think it's crazy they try to normalize pedophilia wait till they push that agenda harder.

             Just read some of the comments from people on that article. It's so fricken sad this is happening. All I can think of is these bastards coming and taking my daughter from me. Being a single parent im sure if they wanted they could probably find something to do it.

              Just remember NO WARRANT = NO WELCOME   First mistake parents make when they are innocent is allow them to cross the threshold.  NEVER let them in without a warrant, be polite, don't answer any questions and don't defend yourself and record the entire encounter..   Tell them politely to return with a warrant if they ever show up and then call a lawyer ASAP so that a lawyer will be there when they schedule a return visit.
