<p>This is a follow-up to my previous posts on MBS and Stephen Paddock, and the purge that is going on in Saudi Arabia. My guess was that everything seemed coordinated and that a deal of some kind was forged between MBS and Trump. There were doubters but  it rings true based on MBS forming a coalition to eradicate terrorism and Trump immediately following up with RTs highlighting acts of terrorism. Coincidental? I think not. Here\'s the proof:</p>
<p>MBS announces an Arab coalition: </p>

            Except last night the Dutch government made a statement saying the aggressor was a domestic born non-Muslim. They disavowed trumps tweet and so did Teresa may of England, say what you will about her. It’s still rings true to me however. Especially when we connect all the dots with Las Vegas etc.

            Curioser and curioser, Iran has been exploited decades before the new serial killer in chief Crown Prince Salman of Saudia Arabia arrived on the scene.

             Saudia Arabia and Israel are BFF's.

              For the first time, an alliance between Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States became possible with Iran as the designated enemy. The Israeli-Saudi relationship has evolved mostly in secret over the past couple of decades but has popped into view in recent years as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his inner circle have emphasized the common interests – especially animosity toward Iran – that they share with Saudi Arabia.

             Netanyahu has recently referred to this Israeli-Saudi alliance when he said that Iran was driving Israel into cooperative arrangements with what he called “the modern Sunni states.” He referred to “a new alliance between Israel and Islamic states. … The good news is that the other guys are getting together with Israel as never before. It is something that I would have never expected in my lifetime.”

              Contrary to common belief, Israel supported Iran’s Islamic Republic for more than a decade in the 1980s before shifting its favors to Saudi Arabia in the 1990s and making sure the U.S. followed suit

             At first, American officials couldn’t believe it. In 1993, the Israelis began pressuring the Clinton administration to view Iran as the greatest global threat. Only a short time earlier, in the 1980s, Israel had been cooperating with the Iranians militarily and selling them weapons to fight Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War.

             Back then, the Israelis were Iran’s best lobbyists in Washington, pushing the Reagan administration to talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran, and even to ignore Iran’s tough talk on Israel. In that process, Israel was aided by a group of staunchly pro-Israeli officials within the Reagan administration whom we now know as the neoconservatives.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1981, just months after Iran had held 52 American diplomatic personnel hostage for 444 days, senior State Department officials Robert McFarlane and Paul Wolfowitz were advocating on behalf of the Israeli desire to sell Iran weapons. That initiative, which was continued by McFarlane when he became President Reagan’s National Security Advisor, ultimately led to the Iran-Contra scandal of 1986 when Reagan’s secret approval of U.S. arms shipments to Iran became public.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Yet, even in the wake of that scandal and the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988, the neoconservatives who remained influential under Reagan’s successor, President George H.W. Bush, pressed ahead with the goal of getting the U.S. to warm its relations with Iran. Iraq’s defeat at the hands of the U.S. military and its allies in the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91 further reduced the Arab threat to Israel’s security and encouraged more thinking about a possible U.S.-Iranian détente.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Bush-I administration’s 1991 “National Security Strategy of the United States” said the U.S. was open to “an improved relationship with Iran,” a country that a 1991 National Intelligence Estimate said was “turning away from revolutionary excesses . . . toward more conventional behavior.”
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              However, in 1993, with the Clinton administration in power, the Israelis changed their tune, urging the U.S. government to find Iran lurking behind every terrorist attack, every conflict and every threat.

              There appear to have been several factors leading to this Israeli switch – from the fact that the Cold War was over and thus Arab states that had relied on Soviet weaponry were weakened; that Iran-backed Hezbollah was challenging Israel’s military occupation of southern Lebanon; and that Israel could no longer profit from Iran’s desperate need for weapons (with the war with Iraq over and Iran’s treasury depleted) while the Arab oil states offered a more lucrative opportunity for both geopolitical and financial gain.

              Israeli leadership had found the billions of dollars from arms sales to Iran useful in maintaining Israel’s large military/intelligence infrastructure as well as Israel’s development of Jewish settlements inside Palestinian territories on the West Bank.
             </strong>
             With that cash source gone, Israel began recalculating its longstanding Periphery Strategy, which had called for countering Arab pressure from close-in states by cultivating relations with non-Arab regional powers on the periphery, such as Iran and Turkey.

             There were also two other seismic events that altered the geopolitical landscape. The Cold War was over and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq had been humiliated in the Persian Gulf War. While the Israelis saw both events as positive, there were unintended consequences. The end of the Cold War meant the exit of the Soviet Union from the Middle East: that left Israel’s traditional Arab enemies even more enfeebled and the U.S. government less worried about losing influence in the oil-rich region. Iran also emerged as relatively stronger than Iraq due to Iraq’s failed invasion of Iran and its catastrophic defeat after its invasion of Kuwait.
            </p>
            <p>
             Israel’s 1992 elections also brought Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and the Labor Party to power, raising the possibility of finally reaching a peace accord with the Palestinians and thus the possibility of more normalized relations with the Arab world. In turn, that raised the potential for more lucrative arrangements with oil-rich sheikdoms by, in effect, renting out the Israel Lobby to the Sunni-ruled Gulf states so they could push their historic conflict with the Shiites whose power base was Iran.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             “There was a feeling in Israel that because of the end of the Cold War, relations with the U.S. were cooling and we needed some new glue for the alliance,” Efraim Inbar of the Begin-Sadat Center told Trita Parsi. “And the new glue was radical Islam.”
            </p>
            <p>
             But it was a very selective kind of radical Islam: not the kind Saudi Arabia was financing and exporting through Wahhabi fundamentalism and violent jihadists like those in Al Qaeda, but Iran’s radical Shiite Islam. Selling Iran as the number one global terror threat gave birth to a new Middle East enemy that replaced the Soviet Union and reinflated Israel’s value to the U.S. in the region. “Iran,” Inbar went on to explain, “was radical Islam.”

It is something that I would have never expected in my lifetime.”

             Both WTI and RBOB prices are tumbling this morning after OPEC member agree to limit oil output through the end of 2018. While this is bullishly longer-than-expected (6-9mo was expected), OPEC members now rely on Russia to agree to these terms, and it appears the market is questioning that. Furthermore, despite US shale output at record highs, Saudi officials are shrugging off any impact.

             As The Wall Street Journal reports, OPEC members agreed in principle Thursday to keep limiting their output through the end of 2018, according to people familiar with the matter, providing assurance for an oil industry still struggling through a fragile recovery.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The accord signals that the world’s biggest oil-producing countries believe that a global oversupply of oil is still weighing down oil prices, even a year after they struck their first agreement to cut crude production. Oil in storage—a proxy for the global glut—remains well above historical averages, national oil ministers said.

             Notably, as Reuters reports, Non-OPEC Russia, which this year reduced production significantly with OPEC for the first time, has been pushing for a clear message on how to exit the cuts so the market doesn’t flip into a deficit too soon, prices don’t rally too fast and rival U.S. shale firms don’t boost output further.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before the earlier, OPEC-only meeting started at the group’s headquarters in Vienna on Thursday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said it was premature to talk about exiting the cuts at least for a couple of quarters and added that the group would examine progress at its next meeting in June.

             “When we get to an exit, we are going to do it very gradually ... to make sure we don’t shock the market,” he said.

            Migratorypatterns the people of yemen were being persecuted LONG before Q showed up. Long before your mental mirage that the operations in the middle east have suddenly turned from a Zionist world domination plan to fighting child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Explain why the new serial killer does not stop persecuting Yemem since he is the "good Prince." He hasn't stopped because he is as depraved as all the other Prince's.

            The entire plan for 911 and the Middle East was to knock out the countries that did not have a Rothschild bank and take their resources.
           </p>
           <p>
            Iran is the pearl left in the play that was made. You do not understand what is happening.

           <p>
            These Saudia Arabia posts of your are 100% shill worthy. Explain to the subverse you are spamming why these Princes were not charged with pedophilia. Explain that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Explain why INSTEAD of being charged with child trafficking they were stripped of hundreds of billions of dollars. Now these same Princes still have millions of dollars left to live out their life in luxury and continue to do as they please.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason they were not charged with child trafficking is because THE WHOLE SAUD FAMILY are child traffickers including the new serial killer Prince Salman. Child trafficking would bring the whole family down including the new serial killer Crown Prince.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is about power, oil, and money. I try to be polite but you are perhaps the biggest idiot posting in this subverse and your posts are poisoning people's perspectives and stealing their reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are giving people the false conclusion that child trafficking is being handled and it is not. People are cheering for your Zionist tool, Saudia Arabia, instead of digging into clues and connections, and demanding answers from people like Jeff Sessions. You are stealing people's motivation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudia Arabia IS A ZIONIST TOOL AND IT IS NOTHING ELSE. Saudia Arabia does what it is told and if it does not it will get left holding the bag for 911 all alone while Mossad, U.S. and British intelligence go free.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know nothing of history to take the banks in the middle east and their goal. You are blind as a bat and qualify for a zionist shill.

            Those at the top of the NWO pyramid are involved in a social engineering program that includes turning our world into another Sodom and Gomorrah-- that's the Pizzagate connection. But they are also involved in gaining power by taking over the world's banking system, especially the central banks of every country; the Rothschild's are at the center of this takeover and are now in control of all but a few central banks. Iran has one of the central banks the Rothdchilods do not yet control. The deal you spoke about has happened-- between Israel-Mossad, U.S.-CIA and MBS. They help him become Saudi king and he helps them attack Iran, gaining their central bank and the assets of all the royal family members and rich dignitaries that MBS arrested in the process of him becoming king. Those arrested need to be released and the rightful heir-- Prince bin Nayef-- reinstated. King Mohammed has been controlled; he needs help to free himself from his controllers so he can reinstate bin Nayef..

             These two countries have had a long-standing conflict and deep division over religion. Putting this all down to the central bank is a little myopic, when the POTUS called out Iran in September for human trafficking violations.

              Iran is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Accurate information on human trafficking in Iran is difficult to obtain. Organized groups reportedly subject Iranian women, boys, and girls to sex trafficking in Iran and in Afghanistan, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, and Europe. Iranian girls between the ages of 13 and 17 are targeted by traffickers for sale abroad; younger girls may be forced into domestic service until their traffickers consider them old enough to be subjected to child sex trafficking. An increase in the transport of girls from and through Iran en route to other Gulf States for sexual exploitation has been reported from 2009-2015; during the reporting period, Iranian trafficking networks subjected Iranian girls to sex trafficking in brothels in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. The media reported Kurdistan Regional Government officials were among the clients of these brothels. In Tehran, Tabriz, and Astara, the number of teenage girls exploited in sex trafficking continues to increase. Organized criminal groups kidnap or purchase and force Iranian and immigrant children to work as beggars and street vendors in cities, including Tehran. These children, who may be as young as 3, are coerced through physical and sexual abuse and drug addiction; reportedly many are purchased for as little as $150.
             </p>
             <p>
              In January 2016, an international organization reported the Iranian government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) coerced male Afghans resident in Iran, including migrants and refugees, to fight in military brigades deployed to Syria by threatening them with arrest and deportation to Afghanistan. Afghan boys in Iran are vulnerable to sexual abuse by their employers and harassment or blackmailing by the Iranian security service and other government officials.

             <strong>
              Saudi prince freed from Ritz-Carlton 'prison' after $1bn settlement with authorities
             </strong>
             Published: November 29, 2017
            </p>
            <p>
             A senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah has been released in Riyadh after more than three weeks in detention. He was one of more than 200 princes, ministers and businessmen arrested in what the kingdom has called an “anti-corruption purge.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The former head of the National Guard who was once seen as a contender for the throne, Prince Miteb was freed on Tuesday after agreeing an "acceptable settlement" with authorities of more than $1 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 65-year old prince was the most politically influential royal detained under the orders of a newly formed anti-corruption committee headed by his 32-year-old cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to Reuters, Prince Miteb was accused of embezzlement, hiring ghost employees and awarding his own companies a $10 billion contract for walkie-talkies and bulletproof gear. His detention fueled speculation the purge was designed to tighten Prince Mohammed’s grip on power, a claim he has denied.
            </p>
            <p>
             Miteb’s release comes after Saudi authorities said the majority of those detained have agreed to pay back some of the money they had gained illegally, in exchange for their freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two weeks ago media reported Saudi officials offered the arrested royals a deal to pay up to 70 percent of their wealth to go free. The confiscation of cash and other assets of those detained could reportedly be worth at least $800 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Experts have called Riyadh’s crackdown on the wealthy a way to close the enormous budget hole caused by lower oil prices. The kingdom’s deficit reached $79 billion last year. To cut the deficit, Riyadh has tried to implement fiscal measures, including spending cuts, raising taxes, bond sales and a future public offering of part of the kingdom’s oil monopoly Saudi Aramco.

              I knew the Q thing would derail people and I was damn sure not wrong. Look what thread we are parked in. People are cheering for the number one weapon of Israel. I could not have designed a better psyop than this myself. That is what this whole damn thing was. A psyop. It went nowhere and gave people a false sense of security. I described it as a virus and that is what it is.

              What is that damn sticky thread still doing up in this forum?

             The new pope has not hung pedo priests upside down and tortured them to make his point that pedos will not be tolerated anymore, but I like the way you think. :)

            I think that Trump and SA made a deal to end terrorism eg ISIS. Trump is turning a blind eye to the genocide in Yemen because he's got SA on side re. iSIS and doesn't want to rock the boat. Unfortunately I don't think this has anything to do with stopping child trafficking.

             I heard reports of starvation in Yemen some weeks ago but haven't heard more recently.  War always hurts the Children the most.  And truth and war don't go hand in hand either.

             It's hard to imagine getting clear honest information out of that country into western journalists hands.   From what I've read, apx. 80% of the male population chews fresh Kat leaves daily, it's a special high. Conducting business is best done early before about 10.   This is a tripped out nation, with lots of crazy stuff.  Wild Men on camels with machine guns chewing Kat.

              Yeah, but the people dying are women and children. They're not crazy and tripped out and they're not chewing kat leaves or firing machine guns. They are just trying to live their lives peaceably, free from harm and hunger.

            I'm so grateful Trump retweeted Jayda Fransen's videos of muslims acting murderously in an extra-judicial capacity. Jayda is on hate-speech charges in England at the moment and this vidicates her massively. (she's also got the tits to turn 100 000 lefties Right wing, btw)  How long does a society last if it CRIMINALISES those wishing to defend that society? This has only become possible by the corrosive ideologies of post modernism, cultural marxism, intersectional feminism &amp; political correctness that elevate the subjective over the objective. This dispensation of the objective has enabled the Left to distort the definitions of words to suit their preferred political narrative; Thus a 'supremacist' is indistinguishable from a 'survivalist', and that's how those who seek only to defend their country are treated as if they were empirical conquerors.  Western civilisation only survives the next century to the extent that political correctness is repudiated

             Couldn't agree more. And a big thanks to Sarah Sanders for handling the questions so well. Unfortunately, I was subjected to "indoctrination". Had to go to the doctor and they had on ... yes, fake news CNN. CNN WAS GOING CRAZY NUTS OVER THIS!!!! Never heard such a complete twisting of the facts. And they kept up the new narrative which is "TRUMP IS INCOMPETENT". They tied the RTs in him being nuts and incompetent and said Theresa May was having a cow ... well, let her!!! The point is as Sanders stated, that this type of violence happens. The violence is real! I RT'd a couple of children being terrorized videos myself. Did I authentic them? Hell, no! But I feel that that's the point. When you see children in peril, RTing them sends that message that it this is real and we need to stop it. And it's weird because MBS is acknowledging terrorism by forming this military alliance. To me acknowledging terrorism, cuts out racism or whatever you want to call it. For instance, when Christian nutsos were murdering doctors, if the Christians hadn't said, "WE DON'T SUPPORT THIS!", it makes them look as if this is condoned and it's not. For Arab states to take a stand and call terrorism "terrorism" (something The Kenyan failed to do), it sends a message that the majority of Islam DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORISM. That is the single biggest thing they can do to build bridges and mend fences.

              Great points.  So long as the videos and anything being re-tweeted has been vetted and corroborated so it doesn’t make him come off as idiotic. I believe the Dutch government denounced it and said  at the aggressor was a domestic for non-Muslim. No?

               I think that's responsible, but we don't know it hasn't been vetted. Or maybe he trusts the source.

               As for him looking idiotic, it doesn't matter what he does. An attempted indoctrination occurred yesterday in my doctor's office. CNN was on and OMFG!!!! CNN is NOT fake news. Fake news are outlets like The National Enquirer and The Sun. CNN IS PROPAGANDA. It's a much more chilling description and more apt.
              </p>
              <p>
               I haven't watched CNN in over two years and could not believe the level of depravity they've sunk to. I will be more than happy when they close up shop and slither into the sunset with Tony and John Pedosta.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I learned the new narrative: it's that the POTUS is incompetent, irrational, and insane. They hope those preposterous allegations somehow snowball into getting him impeached. Good luck. Maybe they could finance a dossier?

             My prediction is that a very tangible piece of intel will come out of this. I know that intel regarding the Clintons, The Kenyan, DWS, and assorted criminals will not like being proven to be criminals, but it will happen. And I have been influenced by Q even though I don't necessarily believe or go along with his/her conjecture. But the part about Alice ... hmmmm .... I started to think that the White Rabbit's job is to find Alice for the Red Queen. So my ultimate prediction is that this game is being played. I mean, Killary &amp; The Cannibal Elite are nuts. So I'm thinking that a very high profile disappearance/mystery will be solved.

              vindicator why is this sub allowing zionist propaganda that has zero evidence to back up the poster's claims. This is 100% non pizzagate related except for the fantasies of people that believe Saudia Arabia is fighting pedophilia. I am seriously disappointed in what has happened to this sub since Q arrived.

            This is the craziest post of the week. Saudia Arabia is starving millions of innocent people in Yemen and has exposed them to cholera. They do this in continuance of the NWO plan to destabilize the Middle East to continue to strip it of it's resources.

             And yes, while I am all for the cleaning up of these criminal trafficking rings many and SA, what they are doing to Yemen is criminal, evil and until Trump definitively and clearly denounces them we are exchanging one evil for another. They are projecting half 1 million Yemenis will starve to death. It is a vile.

              A lot of people are ignoring the fact that Trump/Kushner are working for the Zionist NWO because Hope is a strong drug. It causes people to lose focus. Instead of believing that child trafficking is being eradicated people need to continue to demand that it be eradicated.

             <p>
              Until child traffickers named Soros, Clinton, etc...et:al are publicly named as child traffickers instead of people who commit financial fraud we are not getting anywhere. We are only helping one faction take pie from another.

             The first woman arrested for driving in Saudi Arabia was about forty years back.  I remember it happening, I knew some about it.  She was crushed in-spite of being a royal, three years house arrest and severe social isolation. I don't think this will be a new issue within SA.  Must have been a strong push for it internally for decades now.

             Another reason is that now everyone abroad cheers about how modern the Prince is. So they don't look closer at what his real intentions are and what he does behind the scenes. Even killing countless women and children in Yemen (as well as men) somehow doesn't alter this picture of him as being 'moderate'.

             It directly relates to pizzagate because SA was heavily involved in international sex trafficking, and it's my contention that this has changed with the new regime due to an alliance forged between MBS and our POTUS.

            But there isn't the slightest evidence (not even the slightest hint) that Prince Salman and his faction stopped elite child rape and trafficking. Or that Trump even discussed this issue with the Prince. It is merely hope and speculation, sorry.

              I agree too. As well as overlooking what they are doing in Yemen, we're also being invited to cheer on torture. This narrative of the 'good' Saudis is deeply unrealistic.

              Me too.  These people cannot be trusted.  What is going on in Yemen is a form of Genocide.  They can help these people, they have the power to do so, but not the will.  It is staring us right in the face.

             Thanks, but I disagree. If you look in I believe the second post (not sure, but think it's the second), you'll see that MBS announced that he's returning SA to a moderate country. That means arresting anyone that gets in way of this mandate, and he followed through on it with the arrests. It was a wake up call that he is serious.
            </p>
            <p>
             The proof is the coordination between events. He did visit the WH earlier this year so there was ample opportunity to discuss plan ... if there is a plan. I think there is ... you don't.
            </p>
            <p>
             We'll see.

               Me, too. Right now, it really seems the ducks are lining up in a row. Especially with MBS announcing an alliance to fight terrorism? WHAT?

              The plan is unfolding in front of our eyes. It is to starve the people in Yemen to death, expose them to disease, until they capitulate and give up what is left of their resources and dignity. You are contributing to that by cheering for Saudia Arabia, whether you realize it or not.
