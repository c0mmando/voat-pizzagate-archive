<p>A campaign to normalize pedophilia claims individuals who fantasize about raping children should be accepted as their own sexual orientation. In a disturbing attempt to normalize pedophilia as a mainstream “sexual orientation,” pedophiles are rebranding themselves as “Minor Attracted Persons,” with the hope that they will be accepted as part of the LGBT community. A website has been established called “The Prevention Project,” which sports the tagline “Everyone deserves support,” and attempts to push two disgusting ideas—that there are different classes of “pedophiles” for different ages of children that should be accepted by society, and that “non-offending pedophiles” should be praised for the fact that they have yet to molest a child. The Prevention Project defines a “pedophile” as an adult who is attracted to pre-pubescent children, and claims that there are different classes of “pedophiles,” based on the age of the child, which include infantophiles (pedophiles who are attracted only to infants), hebephiles (pedophiles who are attracted to pubescent children), and ephebophiles (pedophiles who are attracted to post-pubescent children).</p>',

            How could a real estate agent find a minor attracted person on the kitchen island in the rental property kitchen?  The context doesn't seem to match unless you consider that kitchen island and rental property are also being used as code. Any ideas what they could mean in this context? "Kitchen island" &amp; "rental property" used in conjunction with "minor attracted person" ? Anyone have any ideas?

             You refer to the handkerchief with a "pizza related map," yes? In the email, the realtor was on Martha's Vineyard, home to globalist heavyweights, including Rothschilds. It was originally theorized that satanic pedo ritual sessions would be held on available rental property, thereby leaving little trace of when, where, who. Realtor would be in on it.  A kitchen island is like a big table.....
Just my opinion. Not code words.

            Actually, it should read: MINOR ATTACKING PERSONS
           </p>
           <p>
            “The Prevention Project” is actually a front for a more insidious group called "National Prevention Science Coalition."
They are actively promoting this to Federal agencies. It is a FAKE science that they try to equate with mass vaccination as a means of "preventing" such social/sexual problems from progressing. Their "scientific" solution is to ultimately legalize pedophilia, and VOILA! the problem disappears.

            "The Prevention Project
The Prevention Project is a coalition of advocates promoting governmental adoption of a "prevention model" for improving a broad range of social outcomes, while also addressing government budget deficits by reducing the expenses associated with costly problems (e.g., incarceration, substance abuse) and improving economic success (e.g., promoting high school graduation, preventing teenage pregnancy). To date, the Prevention Project has written a white paper and coordinated two congressional briefings that have detailed the benefits of preventative programs and how to effectively scale up the implementation of evidence based practices.
           </p>
           <p>
            We invite community members supporting this mission to join in this effort. Members of the Prevention Project regularly receive email updates about the group's progress and ask for members' input on the direction of the group. Members are also invited to play a more active role by helping to develop resources (e.g., fact sheets), speaking at briefings, or contacting their legislators about upcoming briefings."

            "About The Prevention Project
           </p>
           <p>
            The Prevention Project was launched in March 2016 to help operationalize and sustain a “whole of society” approach to preventing the spread of violent extremism. Working with its partners, which include the Geneva Center on Security Policy, the Global Center on Cooperative Security, the International Civil Society Action Network (ICAN), the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), and the Women’s Alliance for Security Leadership (WASL), the Prevention Project is committed to promoting the role of civil society, local authorities, and, more broadly, communities in preventing a and countering violent extremism (P/CVE)."

           <p>
            WHAT IS VIOLENT EXTREMISM?
"Violent extremism’ is rarely defined: neither the United Nations nor the European Union has an official definition. USAID defines it as “advocating, engaging in, preparing, or otherwise supporting ideologically motivated or justified violence to further social, economic or political objectives”. However, this apparently simple and obvious statement conceals a great deal of controversy and uncertainty. Is violent extremism, by definition, something carried out by non-state actors? In conflict situations, how can we differentiate violent extremists from other, more legitimate conflict actors? Does violent extremism always have to be ideological – can it, for example, be criminal, or even purposeless? Is ‘violent extremism’ merely a synonym for ‘terrorism’? More fundamentally, are terms like ‘extremism’ relative – in which case does ‘violent extremism’ mean different things to different people? These are not merely academic questions: what we call a phenomenon helps determine how we see it and what we do in response to it."

            This will be used to describe those who consider rape/murder of children a punishable crime--even the death penalty.
THIS IS THE PEDO NORMALIZATION STRATEGY. They will fail.

            <p>
             The corrupt WHO (also in charge of global vaccines) HAS JUST DECLARED "COMPULSIVE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR" A MENTAL DISORDER!  More importantly, this has been listed "in the latest update of its catalogue of diseases and injuries around the world" known as the  International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
            </p>
            <p>
             "Reed said it was important that the ICD register, which is widely used as a benchmark for diagnosis and health insurers, includes a concise definition of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder to ensure those affected can get help."
YOU CAN BET PEDOS WILL QUALIFY. 
WHO recognises 'compulsive sexual behaviour' as mental disorder

            They aren't rebranding as Minor Attracted Persons. They've always represented themselves as such, and to be spreading this now so far after the Podesta emails is diluting the fact that he used the term MAP.

            </em>

             The other angle they push is the idea that the molestation doesn't hurt the victim... unless adults tell the victim to be upset. On that basis when parents approach authorities they take the child victim away from the parent, and either into care, or place the child in the hands of the abuser.

             In Dungeons and Dragons, your bullets would have the "MAP Bane" property. Note that magic projectile weapons confer said property to any ammunition that gets fired from them.
