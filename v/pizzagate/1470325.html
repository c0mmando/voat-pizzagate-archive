I don\'t know how a group of people killed in front of a public place by a man with a hunting rifle can logically be assumed to be random, but I guess I\'m a fake news kinda guy. <strong>Nowhere does the article confirm that the reporters were investigating child sex trafficking or that the meeting was about it.</strong></p>

<p>I don\'t know this site, nor does it look particularly professional or serious to me. However, it does claim that the journalists were looking into a child sex trafficking ring and were meeting the third woman to interview her about it. Its apparent citation goes to some sputniknews website, and while I do reject the &quot;fake news&quot; bullshit, I also know that Russia pumps out propaganda better than they pump out murdered journalists themselves. There are plenty more links in there but the ones I\'m looking at merely back up his contextual history of child trafficking investigations, and none of it directly backs up the assertion that these journalists were looking into it. Nonetheless, if there\'s any possibility that these journalists WERE looking into child trafficking, the timing is extremely significant and it needs to be looked into.</p>

            Hi, that site is a notorious bullshit site.  Fake news doesn't even do it justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a common tactic on bullshit fake news sites.   One something is already trending and gaining clicks, it tends takes a little truth and mixes in a little bullshit to get more clicks.  So yes, it's true two Finnish reporters were killed.  The bullshit is that it has anything to do with pizzagate.  Also notice that there source is FSB in Moscow, which is the new name for the KGB the notorious Soviet intelligence agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has a regular news links it picks up from other places so it can bring such special reports as this one
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Obama Dissolves Constitution After US Civil War Death Toll Reaches 4 Million

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What?  You don't remember the US Civil War?  Millions killed?  According to that website it happened in 2011.
