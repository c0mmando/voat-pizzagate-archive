            I am proud of Corey Feldman it takes a lot of courage to do what he is doin g. I think he has been intimidated and terrorized in ways none of us can imagine. I am thrilled to see so much public support over night. The pizzagate movement has broad public support, wow, just wow, 100,000 in 24 hours this scandal is a hot button! I am thrilled that this scandal is getting exposed.

            Reminder that one of the first techniques used by shills Is questioning motives and insinuating ego and profiteering. Attacking the messenger is a low trick employed by shills.   it was used against David seaman and another activist named ryan who was threatened by alefantis.

           <p>
            I don't know why he would believe a movie would do anything. To document it? Why would people talk on screen when they don't in public? Onscreen is public? Corey, Corey, Corey, what is this about?
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Now that I've thought about this, OPEN SECRET was highly touted and lauded for putting this on film. So maybe he's thinking along those lines. And he might have direct ties through private conversations and intel who is willing to talk about major players. This might be a great thing. Imagine someone on camera accusing a pedo that's been above the law because of their sterling reputation.

             Yep. I might weigh in on this more later because I've been sitting and ruminating about this Feldman situation for some time now. I believe somethings up, behind my constantly shaking "omg corey wtf" head.
            </p>
            <p>
             His Indiegogo page describes a movie similar to what we got with an open secret, however his YouTube video link says something completely different...
            </p>
            <p>
             "Corey is attempting to make his life story into a Major Motion Picture"
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8yhyvOGFRc">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8yhyvOGFRc
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             So, which is is you flaming narcissist? Expose' or biography on how many you let abuse you for fame and fortune, that you never really got, flying off the crusty horribly garish coattails of your costume designer from movies made 31 years ago or will you just name names and HAVE IT DONE WITH.
            </p>
            <p>
             In short I believe Feldman is a slap in the face to ALL victims, by trying to reconnoiter monies from the public for such a heinous and sensitive subject minimizes and detracts from the difficulty and trauma endured by those coming out of their own free will without asking for anything. Sure, yeah, some of them plan on suing to hopefully gain enough cash for their 'safety' but we all know Corey if 'they' wanted to get to you they certainly will, regardless of your bank account and how many steroid freaks are looking out for you and your 'family' (What family? You look and act like a cult leader. (

             </a>
             )
            </p>
            <p>
             There is so many things wrong with this Corey thing I don't have any idea  where to start or whether to chalk it up to his own conditioning within Hollywood, but this dude certainly doesn't have the same fuel gauges as the rest of us.

              Yeah, but it's his life story we want to see. Who was it that first molested him? How did it happen? What did he do?
             </p>
             <p>
              No one would think anything about someone speaking about, or writing a book about, what happened. Take the Franklin Coverup. Do we really not want those victims to talk? And what about the documentary made. Would you love that finally released?
             </p>
             <p>
              So his life is that. He's an actor ... maybe he had aspirations to direct that all went away because he went to the police. There's also Corey Haim's story he wants to get out there. They were best friends.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nope, not prejudging this one. It is logical now that I think about it. The thing is it's so off the mark from what most of us would probably do, but it's not for him. But ... we'll all find out together.

              A bit of compassion is in order, don't you think? Corey Feldman has earned the right to contribute to the cause however he sees fit. Empowering victims mean they find their voice and want to be heard. Some do it through research, some through the judicial system, and some through the creative process.

            Wtf.. Why does he need money to make a movie about it? Fucking say the names...its free. He has any child abused by the sick fucks blood on his hands now. The window of opportunity to call them out is here, specifically, by name. Everyone is already listening.. He doesn't need 10mm to make a movie about it.

             Naming names might endanger his family. Nancy Schaefer, Monica Peterson, Andrew breitbart, max spiers, Corey haim, were all assasinated fighting to expose the elite pedo ring. Sometimes it's better to take a tactical approach and live to fight another day.

              So 10 million and a movie will prevent that? I agree that it is highly dangerous, but how is adding to the Hollywood machine going to prevent that? Makes no sense.

               compassion is in order. Understand that Victims need to heal and survive, creative expression is therapeutic for some. I apologize but I don't understand what you expect a victim to do? It is on us to advocate for the victims not bully or demand our wounded fight along the front lines. The day of reckoning will come, and that anger/disgust should be focused on the criminal abusers.

            I’m bummed that he didn’t just come out with it in a video or tweet.  He’s trying to profit from it.  His profiting from it doesn’t make his story less true, but it’s just not cool being able to stop something so horrible from continuing but putting the breaks on so you can make a movie about it first.  Also, the movie doesn’t sound like a good idea.  He made it sound like it would be a movie literally depicted/acting out what happened to him and Haim.  No one wants to see that except pedophiles.  Gross!  We just want names so they can be stopped.
           </p>
           <p>
            I’m guessing he raised the funds for protection, which I understand.  But he wouldn’t need protection if he would have just spewed the names in that video a few days ago.  It would be over and done with/no reason to kill him to silence him after he’d already talked.
           </p>
           <p>
            I still believe him and understand he and his fam need protection.  But I’m disappointed in his wanting to profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            But then again, Maybe he needs the money?  I don’t really know about his finances. I guess since his childhood was stolen from him, all he knows is show business.  I guess he doesn’t want to go to school to become an Accountant etc at this point, so show business is his trade.  Is his tour not going well, though?  Does he “need” the money from a movie?

            I’m not sure this is such a good thing. I’d been routing for him but this seems like a misstep or ... maybe he’s being misled by either his heart or ego... or... I don’t like this. If he has the info the time is now.
