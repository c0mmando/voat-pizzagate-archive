            I'm going to delete this below standard submission per rule 1 relevance. Your total lack of respect for this research subverse is stunning.

             It is impossible to post the evidence of what is in his two posts since I'm not going to click on it but there is a thumbnail of a photo of two girls in underwear as it is against the rules to post CP to the forum and I believe it's possible he's posting CP to that forum. The titles to me look like he's posting CP and he refuses to clarify calling me an SJW. Since nobody can prove this not to be the case I am left with reporting the subverse to law enforcement. Delete my post if you want, ban me if you want, I don't care. You guys can have your little Q party here if you want without critics and people who have actually been doing stuff to report pedophiles. You make nice posts, I make nice posts, look for more evidence to get probable cause and then report it to law enforcement. You however think that being sent death threats is a sign that you're a larper. Have a nice time in your uncle's basement Eric.

             I give your comment a 24 hour flair for repeated disregard for subverse rules for moderators.

             <p>
              This means an actual link, not only a screenshot.

               You guys have been attacking me on posts that I never anticipated and I've tried to follow all the rules but it seems like you flair all my posts, as I already explained, I'm happy to edit but it's this one that I do not think there is an actual way to edit. I already explained I didn't want to link to what I considered possible CP. Since nobody here could explain if it's true what he was saying and I have no way to independently verify this myself I just sent the link to the FBI to have them find out whether those pedos he is reporting on are posting actual CP to the forum. I don't know how you're able to verify this as a mod without getting in hot water legally but I know in my life I plan on making no clicks on any links that appear to be CP. I personally don't even ever want to see "normal" porn. TTYL

                You have a formal ban warning now. I suggest to take some time, actually a
                <em>
                 good amount of time
                </em>
                to study the rules carefullly.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will take one for the team and ban you, if you should submit more posts that don't adhere to the rules.
               </p>
               <p>
                Friendly reminder: The rules were made by the community. Each time you choose to ignore the rules, you show the
                <em>
                 communtiy

                  Why didn't you take your happy ass to somewhere else if you're having such issues?  Hmmm... could it be that you're setting the stage for some drama?

                  Don't worry, if you're a shill, your name is in employment records, and you'll be hunted down like those that pay you.  If you're not a shill, your life expectancy is low anyway, because you're too stupid to follow directions, and some gloriously dangerous product you try to use will kill you.

                   I've been posting the same stuff here for 2 years, occasionally you guys have flaired a post, until recently when Eric attacked me for following ES. It's in your head that I'm a shill, so you flair every post of mine, almost every single one, for the past month. For that reason alone I'm not posting again as a submission to avoid a ban. You're all behaving incredibly abusively. You can think what you want about me. I no longer really care. I've posted proof of what I said yesterday about my network going out during the re-check of my cop trafficking kiddo post to my twitter. I never said your mods did it. You guys have a clique and I'm not in it. This will be the last response to any of your stupid responses. I understand none of you like me any more because you think I'm a shill because of Jenny Moore who is someone I never knew. And I don't really care.

                The 24 Hour Grace flair is not a rule binding moderators. It's a policy change -- a way of administering the submission rules -- that

                 @think-

                and I willingly instituted despite the fact that it takes MUCH more time and effort from mods, to help people learn to make better posts with the help of the community. It was never intended to be a license to post whatever you want for 24 hours and "see what sticks". In fact,

                and

                both were skeptical it was a good idea and predicted it would be abused to wear down mods and allow forum sliding.

               there's a difference between being an idiot and being smart, I prefer smart to idiot... avoiding looking at illegal &amp; immoral &amp; gross content is not idiotic. retarded comment

               not to mention, I don't feel like looking at porn bc I'm a woman, not an incel dude like apparently half of Voat, 4chan and reddit. Women usually do not look at porn.

                It's actually not. I was being sarcastic. If you weren't living in such a perpetual state of fear you would see that it's actually a sub dedicated to exposing pedos who are on voat, but carry on frightful child. These are adult matters anyway.

            Its the job of the police to go after the pedos...its not our job...
The police are compromised and are not doing their job ...and that is why we find ourselves in this predicament of doing the work of the traitor police force..
The system is rigged ..get out of it..and then chase the pedos...dont chase them.inside a debt prison they own and control..and rig to their game plan
