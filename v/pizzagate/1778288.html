<p>The sketch is well drawn so you can\'t assume that it was a mistake that one eye of the child is rolled upwards and inwards while the other eye is pretty much starting straight ahead. This is a death face. The mouth is open after death with suffocation victims because it\'s a motor function for the person or animal to try to draw in as much oxygen as it can. </p>
<p>&quot;Amanda Kleinman&quot; is a pseudonym and not the &quot;artist\'s&quot; real name. It\'s also the pseudonym used by Majestic Ape, the singer/talker of the band Heavy Breathing. </p>
<p>The title of the work is &quot;Very Special Baggies&quot; and it refers to the model of bag used. It is &quot;special&quot; because it has a sliding zip lock that can cinch against the back of the child\'s neck making the bag airtight. &quot;Airtight&quot; is also the name of a Heavy Breathing album.</p>
<p>My theory is that this piece came before the conception of the &quot;<a href="http://www.nikolasschiller.com/blog/index.php/archives/2008/08/09/1460/">Quart Bag</a>&quot; art exhibit and the exhibit was created for the purpose of allowing this psycho trophy to be presented and seen at an art exhibit for the amusement of the psychopath. Having the piece hanging alongside other art works in baggies takes the shock away and you might not even give the baggie much thought when viewing the piece. They also used a tactic of puitting it right next to a juvenile piece of eye poison called &quot;parts of a whole&quot; that would instantly disgust you and you can\'t feel disgust for two things at once. The tactic helps normalize the less flashy piece that hangs next to it. </p>
<p>Obviously the psycho would have to be well connected in the art scene to pull this off. It\'s a certainty that he would be at the exhibit watching people looking at his trophy.</p>
<p>These works were supposed to sell for one hundred dollars or less after the exhibit but for certain the psycho bought his trophy back. There is probably a list of who purchased which work for tax purposes. He wasn\'t gonna let his trophy with possible DNA evidence on it get sold for a hundred bucks.. </p>
<p>I have a suspect in mind but it\'s a serious charge and I\'ll need proof before I publicly make the charge. The person will have come up with the entire concept for this &quot;Quart Bag&quot; art exhibit if my theory holds.</p>',

            I'm a fine artist, and I can't believe she teaches at the Corcoran. She's not a very skilled artist, that looks like a novice drawing, she doesn't even shade or proportion well. Her music sucks too. Must be nice going through life half-ass because of who you know. Jesus. If she taught my child I'd demand the tuition back.

            I think the face could look like a normal child's face and not necessarily like a dead child, but when you place a baby's head in a ziplock bag then it becomes pretty fucking sick. And "special baggies" - "special friend" is how pedos speak about their victims.

            Here's what I found when I looked a little closer at the exhibits.
           </p>
           <p>
            Found this jewel by artist: Kristina Bilonick.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I saw the note in the exhibit that mentions color coding from KB Industries. I also noticed that the two puzzle sides shown are grainy photos of children's faces.
           </p>
           <p>
            About the artist:
Kristina Bilonick. She has married since this exhibit. (Wedding on 11-21-15)
Guess where she met her spouse:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             John and I met shortly after John had moved to the area to work at NIST. We had a mutual friend who was an artist so he'd been at some art events I'd attended. The night that we actually met and started chatting was at the Transformer art gala held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art.
            </p>

           <p>
            Why a PIE chart?  Writer offers no explanation to substantiate that comment. That sentence has no relevance to the balance  of the article, yet prominently gets placed at the beginning of the article &amp; has its own paragraph.

             She has been, in no particular order: a gallerista (at Govinda, the longstanding Georgetown gallery); an artist (she recently had work in a show at Honfleur Gallery); an outside-the-box party planner (she helped put synchronized swimmers in the Capitol Skyline pool for the Washington Project for the Arts).

            I think every quart art exhibit artist should be looked at closely thru the lens of the exhibit being a representation of fetishes and/or victims of the "artist".  This is a public communication about what the artist has done, or wants to do. A sick inside joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             What can be done?
            </strong>
            Look for imbedded photos in the exhibit. Compare these to missing children. Connect these dots.

            If someone wants to pick up from here, please feel free.  The next step here would be checking on Kristina's new husband. After all, they met at Transformers (JA's place).

Dynamics of Shaped Colloids:
Though there has been significant progress understanding colloidal suspensions of isotropic, spherical particles, relatively little is known about how particle shape or directional interactions influence the suspension dynamics. We use a novel synthesis technique first described in Rossi et al, Soft Matter 2010
(link is external)
to create bulk quantities of mono-disperse cubes, ellipsoids and peanut-shaped particles.

             In collaboration with Dan Blair
(link is external)
at Georgetown University, we use 3D confocal-rheology to characterize the dynamics of these shaped particles under shear. Using depletion we can induce attractive interactions between the cube faces, allowing us to examine how anisotropic, directional interactions influence the shear-induced diffusion and shear-induced aggregation of these particles. This work is part of a larger effort within the Polymers and Complex Fluids group to address the rheology and stability of protein solutions, and is part of the NIST Bio-manufacturing initiative.

            Nothing suspicious about an exhibit featuring little girls performing oral sex, Hello Kitty double headed dildos, and an artistic dismembered body next to a baby's head in a plastic bag.  Nope.  We must always ascribe innocent explanations to these coincidences which pile up by the dozens whenever this group of people does anything.  Anyone remember JA's art for the French 'punk techno' band posted here on Voat?  Totes innocent.

              I can't find the entry.  JA did the art for a satanic - overtly so - French punk techno band.  They're naked in the woods, eating something ceremonially, strange baby totems, horned masks.  Total weirdness, pretty much what you'd expect.

             The way I see it, we believe crimes have been committed. We have some evidence, certainly enough to put an ordinary citizen away for a long time, but these aren't ordinary criminals. Through this forum and elsewhere, we hope to learn more truths, which will either strengthen or weaken our case.
            </p>
            <p>
             This post helps us learn more about some of the players,  what they are into and how they think. Even if this information doesn't directly prove anything, it might help us know where to look and what to look for... where the weak links are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Speculation is a part of solving any mystery, but of course it's important to keep straight what we know and what we are only guessing at.

             I don't see any evidence in any of that proving that the Amanda Kleinman of Majestic Ape and Very Special Baggies is not a pseudonym that someone or multiple people are using.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not sure why you think a blog or page that calls itself Amanda Kleinman is proof of her existence. There are 100 million pseudonym blogs and pages out there. The person doesn't suddenly become real if you make a pseudonym page.
            </p>
            <p>
             That doesn't mean there aren't real Amanda Kleinmans out there. I'm sure there are thousands.

               There are lots of Amanda Kleinmans. The one used by Heavy Breathing and the art work in question is a pseudonym. Highly unlikely that it's a Jewish person using her name as the pseudonym. No Jews on my suspect list yet. More than a few Greeks though for some reason.

              Hmm, even the band's name could infer suffocation. Somehow that got by me. Album Airtight by band Heavy Breathing and the band leader does an art work sketch of a suffocated child inside the murder weapon that was used to suffocate him. I guess I'm conspiratorial for inferring anything from that.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the cops in the pedo mecca vicinity have any cold cases of suffocated children, they might want to go sniffing around CPP for clues. Someone there has a preferred method.

            Same with the Podesta art collection.  Their divorce paperwork nearly revolved around their collection and that seemed odd.
           </p>
           <p>
            If these groups revolve around blackmail and the Podesta method is photo/videos of drugged/sober politicians with children then they need to hide the proof SOMEWHERE.  What better place than a 500k painting that masks the crimes of take any name.  Plus it is not ART, send in the feds XRAY them all, cut open the ones with an anomaly if nothing is found toss it in a fire.  These perverts rake in big money for their greedy bosses

            I think you are spot on with this artistic assessment. I do not understand some of the naysayers, there has been a TON of superfluous and outrageous speculation in a number of different areas on this forum least of all this one. This scenario is more than just plausible. Upvoat.

             That's a titillating distraction. The Kleinman piece can red pill Megyn Kelly and Jake Tapper. The girls with ice cream cones is just some pervert art.

             It might be worth the effort to try to link that sketch to a missing child. Many of the Russian adoption kids brought here probably never achieved a public identity so we'd hit a dead end if it was an adoption.

             You see it. Dumb play is a weak tactic. The smarter shills created diversions by talking about other art works at the exhibition and transferring the discussion onto those things. Soros is gonna fire your ass from the shill team.

              I'm a  nurse  myself, and while the other artwork in this "artist'" may  no  doubt  be  more  clear  the analysis of the  picture  is  flawed, it  looks  like  a haggard child, to make such assumptions based on this  visual  doesn't  hold  water

               With all due respect, sunajAeon,  I'm interested to know how you can make an assessment of a child's health based on the drawing in question. This may come off cocky but please make note that there are health professionals here reading your posts and may object to your title drop.

               Sure, you can state the same for the comment you are responding to, but given the other pieces of artwork and everything we've learned up to this point, it is more than fair to conclude the artist's intention is sexual and morbid.

                Fair  enough-a  nurse  is  trained  to "read"  the  body (to  put  it in simple terms), I simply  added  my opinion that while the pic looks  like a  child that is stressed (it is a pic of art btw)  you  are reading way  too  much  into it- just  my opinion-and this is the  last response I am  going to  waste  on  this subject-

                 You are repeating yourself. We do not agree and you think art with girls licking ice cream that looks like a cock is no biggy and is not related. Interesting take. In an Amanda Kleinman exibit to boot.

                   I love how reason turns to anger. For someone who claims to be a nurse, which can cover a broad spectrum (From a 2-year associate -&gt; graduate level degree), you decide to become hostile, rather than substantiate your answers. Very questionable.

            Of course Amanda is well connected in the art scene.  She was permitted to have pieces in Basel which is quite a big deal.  So these are the top art critics, in very well connected circles.

            Amanda is her name, it's laid out on her family record.  She has Ashkenazi roots unfortunately, as so do I.  She doesn't have a family on her family record.

            It reminds me of this photo of Madeleine, which people are debating sadly whether she is still alive

            Why the f would you put makeup on a little girl?  Blue eyeshadow?   Who took the photo?

            In The Quart Bag Exhibition, there is a piece which is equally disgusting to the one you have shared and it is a bag of dolls, filled with what looks like bodily fluids and fat.  Sorry I just see you mentioning that in your post...  It's repulsive.
