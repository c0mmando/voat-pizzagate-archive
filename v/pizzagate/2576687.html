            Sam Vaknin refers to the Woody Allen movie where the characters come alive and take over the movie. He uses it as a metaphor to explain how Pathological Narcissist live their lives as though they were an audience or at best characters in a movie.

            I find the evidence against Allen quite weak. Two investigations found no abuse. Even the 'damning' custody report did not positively find he had abused the child.
           </p>
           <p>

           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              No other claims of pedophilia against Allen. Which is unusual for pedophiles as they are normally recidivists. The relationship with Soon-yi was not a pedophile relationship as she was post puberty at least.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The mother had previously provided an affidavit as to what a great father he was.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Suddenly in the middle of a nasty divorce and custody dispute this allegation arises. As a friend for worked for a divorce court told me, these sorts of allegations are unfortunately straight out of the nasty divorce playbook.

            "it's called the "high incident project". they want to make the american public think that places with extremely high security aren't safe. they are trying to create more regulations. you will see laws proposed within the next few years to put up more metal detectors and other security devices. media and politicians will be saying places with lots of police need even more police. i can't guarantee anything will happen tomorrow but las vegas is on their minds. -john"

            Stephen Paddock could've at least been like Whitey Bulger. Like a second Whitey Bulger. Strange a couple of days right after the Vegas shooting there was some shootings with full auto weapons in the Phoenix and Henderson and Tucson area and like 2 weeks - months later some one went up on the storage facility in Vegas Paddock owned and started shooting at people. Clearly CP comped sushi cheese pizza is involved in all this. I think Las Vegas shooting is connected to the sex pedo camp site in Tucson. McCain visit to middle east to Muslim brotherhood is interesting and i think he traded them guns and money for "Maddie" aka Madeline and had his way with her in that camp site sex pedo site. He used the McCain Institute for moving and laundering? Stephen's hard drive has video and photos of Madeline McCann. She was picked up by Muslim terrorists and the rest is history and no wonder the FBI/LVMPD are covering something up. Stephen was like an asset like Whitey Bulger a dirty one at that and so many people with guns went up to the Mandalay Bay because of who was on his hard drive.

            “What bothers me is that I get linked in with them. People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse and abuse and abuse– and I, who was only accused by one woman in a child custody case which was looked at and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people,” he continued.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, he WAS accused by one woman in a child custody case.  But he was also accused of child sex abuse by a 7 year old girl.  These are two separate cases and should not be lumped together.  Remember his is a Pedophile so he is an Expert Groomer.

             There was also his earlier behaviour with Farrow's other adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn to take into context. He began a sexual relationship with her in her final year of high school. Luckily for him, it was unclear exactly how old Soon-Yi was, as she was given a presumptive birth date when adopted. A childhood bone scan showed that she was in fact 1-3 years younger that her legal age.

             That Yale-New Haven report is also sketchy as fuck. They were only asked to report on whether Dylan would make a reliable witness. Instead they declare Allen innocent, destroy all their notes and refuse to be cross-examined. Was Dr. Leventhal protecting one of his own tribe?

              I wish I could remember where I read it, it could be in a Maureen Orth article, but someone that knew Soon Yi very well, close to the family, said that she really was not up to par or able to know what you would think, since she has a College Degree.  She said that Soon Yi could not understand certain things or evaluate them when you spoke to her, in other words her understandings were immature and so she was easy to manipulate.  I figured this out from the beginning.  He also took those horrid pictures of her that Mia found while visiting his apt. that were so graphic.  She was lying down with her legs spread open and naked.  Can you even get that through your head?  What would that be like, for a Mother to find that of her daughter?  I can't even imagine.  That is why I think that anyone that gives him a pass after knowing of the photos, they are demented and sick.  He is grooming his present adopted daughters in the same way, imo.  History repeated and a bunch of pedo protectors are making it all possible.  All this is making me so sick just discussing it.  Barf Worthy.

              Soon-Yi is also quoted as having a learning disability in this vanity fair story:
              <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1992/11/farrow199211">
               https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1992/11/farrow199211
              </a>
              where she is described as having "slightly below avergae IQ...very deprived early language development, which carried on throughout the years...She’s a very typical L.D. kid, very socially inappropriate, very, very naïve...She has trouble processing information, trouble understanding language on an inferential level. She’s very, very literal and flat in how she interprets what she sees and how she interprets things socially. She misinterprets situations."
This perfectly describes people with a mild learning difficulty who typically present as being younger than their years and often stay 'child-like' and vulnerable in adult life.

            The judge was not ruling on the question if any abuse occurred.   The Yale-New Haven team's responsibility was to law enforcement in CT, not a custody judge in New Haven and they didn't want to do more than submit their report.  The judge's main issue was they couldn't be cross-examined.
           </p>
           <p>
            The judge in the custody cases says we may never know what happened on that date.   The custody case is not really the best venue to figure out the abuse claim, because that's not what it was about.  But it's the only time the abuse claim was discussed in court with testimony because there was no criminal case.
           </p>
           <p>
            CT found no abuse occurred.
           </p>
           <p>
            NY found no abuse occurred.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every doctor/therapist involved in the case believed no abuse occurred.

            My Blood Is Boiling.  Dylan was this Dylan was that.  For God's Sake, she was 7 years. old.  Why was she worried about whether her father would take her from her Mother?  Because he is a Bleeping Abusing Pedophile and she did not want to live with him.  I imagine she probably laid in bed at night scared to death for that day.  Was she scared because she was rehearsing her lies?  No she was afraid because she had to talk about what her father did to her.  Those nasty unspeakable things. The Yale-New Haven review was just like all the other reports I have read about any woman that has been raped.  They expect her to perfectly answer questions about her father putting his fingers in her vagina at the age of 7?  Give me a break.
