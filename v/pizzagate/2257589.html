<p>Relevancy: Laura Loomer is a self-described independent journalist who is pushed herself into the center of #pizzagate. She\'s involved herself in the LV shooting and Paddock, issuing forth statements that it wasn\'t only Paddock involved and sometimes seeming to doubt that he was the shooter. Paddock was being investigated for human trafficking so in advancing theories, she\'s giving a pass to someone who was pretty damn scummy and diverting attention elsewhere. </p>

<p>I had a conversation with someone a few months back. It was with someone in the media. I brought up Laura Loomer, and their response was &quot;no one gets that lucky all the time.&quot; I was like, &quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot; They answered, &quot;The evidence that falls into her lap. That doesn\'t happen without someone feeding those things to her.&quot; I asked, &quot;Like who?&quot; The response? &quot;The CIA.&quot; </p>
<p>Ever since that conversation, I\'ve been following her and noticing she does get a of things handed to her. Even finds trajectory sites. Really? Then there\'s Campos not being licensed and having a shared SSN number, a receipt for valet parking, a receipt for lunch showing two people ordered, videos of dead men in the lobby. You name it and she has it. And now she gets her hands on a Joe Barton video? That she passes onto shill AJ for immediate posting? And covers her ass with a breezy tweet: </p>

<p>Don\'t actual journalists take the extra step of verifying whether a relationship was consensual before passing on what could be revenge porn? But she didn\'t do that. And she has absolutely no fear of reprisals. Why? Why is that? She has no fear in confronting Killary or shouting in press conferences and she passes on the video knowing it will be posted and covers her ass with this disingenuous note? It\'s all of the above that makes what the media person said echo in my head and I start to believe what was said. </p>
<p>Nothing else makes sense. I mean, why would a &quot;journalist&quot; do that? She more than proves Barton was set up, targeted, wouldn\'t play ball by going along with an agenda. That made him &quot;expendable&quot; and an embarrassment for the GOP. In using the blackmail in this way, it brushes the GOP with the same tar uncovered about Killary and is an effective tool in CNN and Joe Scarborough calling out the GOP as the party of pedophiles even though there was no pedophilia involved. Yes, the pic and video are already being equated with what Weiner did? Weiner was guilty of sending pics and sexting A MINOR! She was fifteen-years-old. He texted things like: </p>

<p>he\'d &quot;bust that tight pussy so hard and so often.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joe Barton had a consensual sexual relationship with an adult. What consensual adults do is their business and has nothing whatever to do with a grown man grooming a child by sexting and sending disturbing imagery, but that doesn\'t matter. What matters is that a member of the GOP is shamed, Loomer gets the notoriety and positions herself as someone willing to take down members of both parties, and AJ? AJ gets to disseminate &quot;revenge porn&quot; and get even more followers who love salacious material.  
</p>
<p>So I\'m thinking think Loomer is not to be trusted. As I said I do follow her. I didn\'t quite believe what the inside source said, but now? That dead man in the lobby of the LV hotel was so amateurish. It was so blurry as to be unrecognizable, and plus there was no time stamp. None! How is anyone can to verify when it was taken? Plus it was so shaky that it seemed purposeful. Nobody is that bad of a video taker. Not with self-adjusting settings. And the attention off Paddock, shouldn\'t she have delved into his girlfriend and what was going on in the Philippines? </p>

            They all work for somebody, and they all follow the script that is given to them. And they all make stumbling, bumbling, childish mistakes often that makes that abundantly clear.  Here is Laura Loomer interviewing one of the crisis actor
            <em>
             witnesses
            </em>
            of the LV shooting:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep6R6j6kkA8">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep6R6j6kkA8
            </a>
            .  The
            <em>
             witness
            </em>
            tells Loomer that her shirt from the night before is still in her hamper covered in blood.  Loomer goes off script and asks her to get it for the interview.  The
            <em>
             witness
            </em>
            gets an uncomfortable look and gets up and fumbles around a while and comes back with a top, saying
            <em>
             now
            </em>
            that it's small......really tiny, fumbling around pretending to look for a blood spot that isn't there.  Loomer catches on quickly and changes the subject.
Another of my all time favorites is Millie Weaver interviewing a human trafficking
            <em>
             expert
            </em>
            that is wearing a
            <em>
             girl love little heart inside a big heart
            </em>
            pendant.  Apparently she never notices.

            .  I read and listen to ridiculous liars for 2 reasons.  One is that liars tell as much truth as possible so it is harder to prove that they are lying.  Two is
            <strong>
             they all are
            </strong>
            .  They all work for somebody. and they all have protection.  If they didn't, they'd be dead.  Sift the wheat from the chaff.

               intelligence
              </em>
              agencies are good at one thing.  They know how to murder, and they know how to get away with it.  Anything beyond that, they are childish bumbling nitwits.  They always miss the obvious, and they always leave big muddy footprint mistakes everywhere. Maybe it's bravado, or maybe they feel so powerful they don't care.  Or maybe too stupid to notice.  Whatever it is, it doesn't take a super sleuth to see the pattern.

            When I put my views on Corey Feldman up, a lot of people didnt like it, still don't
           </p>
           <p>
            I had more then a feeling, and put up links
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know how these people feel now, but I stand firm on this

            You don't like what a poster is saying , you have 2 choices
           </p>
           <p>
            1.. debunk with proof
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Ignore and move on
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Personally will watch this story line, it's getting interesting
           </p>
           <p>
            Didn't think of looking into her, but might just do that
           </p>
           <p>
            She has theories with some proof behind some of it
           </p>
           <p>
            Is she any different then we Are?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yea, she has herself a you tube channel
           </p>
           <p>
            Bold yes, is she protected?  Interesting thought to play around with
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally need a break every now and again from the crimes against children
           </p>
           <p>
            That stuff breaks me hard, but will keep at it until it's non stop in the news and high level arrests are made, and even then wont stop :)
           </p>
           <p>
            We should all be suspicious of stuff
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a suppression of truth out there
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought that's why we here?
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't like what I say, that's fine, Dont want everyone agreeing with me, I'm not all knowing and maybe I missed some stuff, but if it's my opinion you have trouble with, tough shit

             My opinion on Feldman did a 180. Used to defend him, but no more. He's part of the problem. All people had to do is show me that he denied there was a pizzagate? WHAT?!!!! To top if off posted about Corey's Angels. The two combined were enough. I feel it's important to speak out. Like this media person did with. I wasn't particularly receptive to what was said, but

            And I received notifications for about 8. That means the shills are out in force for this one, too. You guys know the drill. If someone gets this much pushback, the topic is important and something they want shut down. It means I'll talk about it more.

            Have you heard of journalists that have connections? Since she's been fricken bomb lately, we should assume there's something to it? What she's been saying about the LV shooting makes sense and is going against what "they" want us to believe. What if she's one of the few REAL journalists that we have right now?
           </p>
           <p>
            What I think is that anyone who seems to be breaking stories and has good connections that have anything at all to do with Alex Jones, are going to be labeled as CIA or limited hangout. People who are on our side and agreeing with us about many things, including PIZZAGATE, are continuously pushed into a negative light here and I think WE should keep an eye on that.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for you Miss Quantokitty, I don't remember you being such a wench when you were using that other profile. With this one, you cry and tell everyone you are blocking them if they disagree with you. So the fact that Laura Loomer can become unhinged when she's accused of things shouldn't come as a surprise to you. YOU always become unhinged.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's hard to know who to fricken trust anymore. But just because someone has great leads, good connections, is fearless and has appeared on Alex Jones doesn't qualify as CIA. I need way more proof than this before I smear someone that seems to be working on OUR SIDE!
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. Are you gonna block me know QK?!

             100% agree with you! The shill OP fails to acknowledge the very real possibility that regular people can actually be feeding her info because they know she isn't controlled MSM and she actually will get it out there for the public to see.

            <p>
             I can think of two journalist, CIA, right off the back
            </p>
            <p>
             Anderson Cooper and Gayle Smith
            </p>
            <p>
             She could be CIA,  she could be getting this stuff from a fed up cop who's not happy with cover up, Same goes FBI
            </p>
            <p>
             And maybe she watches and reads alot on the shooting and plays hot or cold with someone
            </p>
            <p>
             Could be Old Fashion reporting, like the old days, but she would have to have some kind of safeguards in place
            </p>
            <p>
             Mob Connections?
            </p>
            <p>
             I probaly could come up with a few more lol
            </p>
            <p>
             We have all been looking up Las Vegas, maybe her stuff jibes with us because, as I said, she watches and reads same stuff?
            </p>
            <p>
             I have 3 piles for info
            </p>
            <p>
             1...stuff that can be confirmed
            </p>
            <p>
             2...stuff that can be debunked
            </p>
            <p>
             3..the biggest pile, stuff that makes me go hmmm, and waiting to go into pile 1 or 2
            </p>
            <p>
             Why, if she CIA, would that smear her info?
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember, there are still good people in the initial organizations
            </p>
            <p>
             Q is high intelligence and should be written off in that case, and many believe Q should be ignored, but you have to admit, a lot of Q's stuff is good stuff and sends us off to expand our thinking
            </p>
            <p>
             Migratory isn't saying anything I haven't thought of,  but I like to take a looker see from as many angles as I can
            </p>
            <p>
             As with a lot of stuff, Time will tell
            </p>
            <p>
             Take the info and put it whatever pile you want...then move on
            </p>
            <p>
             A lot of stuff going down

               Think the CIA makes more sense since she's involved in more than just LV. Plus she's so certain this evidence she finds is right. Usually it takes time to authenticate, but she just gets it and publishes it ... no time to really do an in-depth check. It probably means somebody already has and when she gets her hands on it, it's just hit "PUBLISH".

            My instincts are uncanny - I knew it the moment she came on the scene. It was the way she carried herself - without a care in the world. I have Jesse Ventura ex Navy Seal  tred with far more caution. You just know where someone is coming from through the way they carry themselves. Is she a disinfo agent whose task is to muddy the warters??

             I noticed the bravado, but thought she was just one of those people who were naturally confident. Then when I saw her becoming unhinged on numerous occasions, the self-confidence didn't ft. Self confident people don't go fly into rages trying to dominant and out swear competition like with the rape allegation. She was actually calling this woman the "C" word. You don't do that if you're a journalist. You just don't. Yes, you defend yourself, but the name calling? It was off putting.

             The swagger comes from protection and knowing she's covered.

              STFU. What's relevant here is that Loomer &amp; Cernovich &amp; Milo are Jewish controlled opposition by attempting to split the alt-right and covering for Jews on InfoWars.  You are the target audience.  Their sole job is to distract white people from the racial problems of our country while our numbers drop.

               Don't mix Milo (who I can't stand) into the same category as Mike Cernovich and Laura Loomer. You don't like 99% of the population so I don't expect you to agree with me.

             You raise an EXCELLENT point.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was really that history with James O'Keefe that gave her validity. It's why I didn't even question when she broke away and came on the scene. I knew of Project Veritas' work and admired it. If she was part of that, it made her fly right under my radar. It's why when this media person proposed what they did, I was like, "WTF?" I didn't believe it, but I never dismiss something entirely and when the cracks in the armor started appearing ... I revisited the conversation. And when she someone was handed this video that was never even mentioned initially, the words came back and finally punched me in the mouth until I had to listen.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure she's muddying the waters. There's that dangerous combination of a little truth, but a whole lot of fiction going on.

             Yes, the initial bug in my ear is anecdotal. But I did supply all those instances of her "getting lucky" that should make anyone suspicious.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wasn't for the above reason which is her previous association with James O'Keefe and Project Veritas, but come on. Read the list of things this "indie" journalist had dropped into her lap. Cernovich came up with a couple of good scoops, but Loomer? It's ridiculous that "her sources" found that parking valet receipt, etc.
