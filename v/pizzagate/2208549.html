Many times the medical establishment is involved with doctors making the initial contact to CPS.</p>
<p>Parents must be made aware of what is happening throughout the US.  This would be an excellent starting point in order to prepare them for additional information pertaining to pizzagate and the entire gamut of crimes against our children.</p>
<p>The video specifically addresses special needs children.  The statistics are confusing, as some reports only address children receiving special educational services and not clarifying if they are under a special needs clause.  Other reports mention those with disabilities and fail to clarify what that really covers.</p>
<p>The most common statistic I could find was that in 2016, there were 2.8 million children between the ages of 5-15 diagnosed with &quot;disabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>For the purpose of this post, the video concentrates on disabilities that require medical intervention, and the numbers are staggering.  Autism rates alone were shocking.  Between 1977-2018, autism diagnoses increased 289.5%.  In 2013,  1 in 50 children was diagnosed with autism. Other &quot;medical&quot; disabilities can include a child who.is HIV positive, who has full-blown AIDS, prematurity-related issues, developmental delays, seizure disorders, physical handicaps, and those born with drug-addiction, to name a few.  There are also those children whose parents do not choose to vaccinate their children and the doctors who report them to CPS.</p>
<p>Parents are being accused of &quot;medical child abuse.&quot;  This is as serious as it gets.  It is not uncommon for parents frequently seeing multiple doctors/specialists for their special needs child.   It is not uncommon for these &quot;several&quot; doctors/specialists to disagree with one another about prescribed care.  It is extremely common for these &quot;several&quot; doctors never to communicate with one another about their &quot;disagreements.&quot;  The result - Parents become rightfully confused.  The doctors become frustrated, blame the parents, and call social services or CPS.  Frequently, social services involvement leads directly to CPS involvement.</p>
<p>The bottom-line is that parents place their trust in doctors, but in doing so, often wind-up being caught in a quagmire and wind-up being accused of medical child abuse. Trying to defend that allegation is a courtroom nightmare.  First of alI, it is a costly process.  Important witnesses for parents and child are never interviewed.  The doctors and the state work together, so whose testimony do you think is normally believed?  
</p>
<p>The above frightful scenario can occur if ONE doctor believes that a parent is not following his/her orders and makes that call to CPS.  For instance in Oregon, if a parent does not obtain a vaccination for their child, that parent is immediately reported to CPS.  In California it is a law that you must vaccinate.  Currently, the CDC recommends 49 doses of 14 vaccines before the age of 6, and this total reaches 69 doses by the age of 18.  This is 3 times as many that were recommended in 1953.</p>
<p>The pattern is present.  The trend is real.  Parents are being blamed  and being held accountable for medical child abuse while there is zero accountability held to government and doctors.  This is a blatant abuse of power.  
</p>
<p>There is a planned CPS process in place to kidnap as many children as they can.  We all know about the horrific outcomes.  It is time to get every parent red-pilled with this information.</p>

            A good way to make it personal: their taxes fund this CPS criminal operation and also government funding for big pharma immunizations that cause the mercury poisoning responsible for autism.

            : There is one thing you need to add to this thread ASAP: add the stats on the rates of sexual abuse of children remanded to CPS/Foster Care. Get that in at the top -- in the first few lines, so this can plausibly satisfy Rule 1. You also might want to raise a few questions about why Congress and the Dept of Justice (in charge of investigating civil rights violations) seem so blithely unconcerned with this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to leave it up so you can do this; MF will probably take it down.

             Can you answer me this?  What are the reasons so many other posts that are either not related to pizzagate nor state anything to comply with Rule 1 allowed to remain?  I believe I already know the answer.  MF for some unknown, unsubstantiated, and bizarre reason, does not want me to post on this sub.  I am not threatened by MF and actually feel sorry for him/her/it.  Something is radically wrong with MF.

            Thank you for your post.  This is one of my pet peeves and it needs to be Shouted From the Roof Tops!  Nancy Schaeffer was a hero!  We need someone like her to take place since her murder.  So very sad.  They also do operations on these children in hospitals after the child is removed.  See

             , thank you.  I went to read your provided link.  It cannot be accessed.  Hmmm.  Once again, something is amiss.  Check out comment from Vindicator and my responses giving me pointers to add to this post to avoid MF from deleting it.  I abided, albeit at 2:30 in the f'ing morning.  Also, I know that 12 upvoats is not a huge number which does not bother me at all, but even with 12, it was pushed far down on "New," never making it to "Hot" at all.  Again, so be it, but my suspicion level has been high for quite awhile on the pizzagate sub.

              Oops Sorry.  I fixed it and found the Nancy Schaefer article but there are many more.  Unfortunately too many.  We have all been suspicious for quite a while too.  Who really knows what is going on here.  But onward we go. Many of us are up til the wee hours of the morning.  Thanks for all you do and I love your posts.
