<p>Sometimes a public figure is involved. When asked how this baby part soup tasted: &quot;Jean was reportedly asked what she thought of the foreskin soup, to which she responded, “<strong>You know, it’s kinda like chicken, but more tender</strong>.”

<p>Apparently, if you have a platform, you will say just about anything if you have the right backing. &quot;Professional atheist Richard Dawkins continues to push the envelope against a God-deluded world, proposing that cultivating and eating human “meat” might help society overcome its “taboo” against cannibalism.&quot;

<p>Conan\'s audience laughs when a costumed actor representing Krampus talks about eating a baby, even with a real baby next to him. In a similar skit, <strong>he asks about &quot;free range children&quot; in a day care center in Malibu and refers to them as &quot;take out&quot;</strong>. </p>

            Conan's audience laughs when a costumed actor representing Krampus talks about eating a baby, even with a real baby next to him. In a similar skit, he asks about "free range children" in a day care center in Malibu and refers to them as "take out".

            I am SO sick of people (mostly millennials) that go to these shows, Conan, Kimmel, Fallon, and Colbert and laugh at stupid, and filthy and also sick humor.  Actually disgussing free range and take out is vile and disgusting.  Comedians and Artists are getting away with anything now.  People are so afraid to not laugh, thinking someone will see them not laughing.  What a world.  Bathroom humor, let me bring that up.  Since pedophiles and the normalization movement are trying to push their poop emojis now,

            That comment of Richard Dawkins really shows how that man turned from a brave criticaster of oppressive dangerous religions to a complete wacko saying the most absurd things.

             I agree. Used to love the guy. He could put the right words on my thoughts. I don't have thoughts about eating humans though.

             Loved his books too. I honestly made a huge effort to avoid this throughout my life because I've always thought there was something fishy about pop stars and such, but Dawkins was a boring old man. I didn't suspect him to be a puppet at all.

             Though this isn't deffinitve proof, these comments come at a very inopportune moment for him. Just when everyone else are desperately trying to normalize depravity he coincidentally has a brain fart about cannibalism. I won't go as far as saying this breaks my heart, but it's not easy to have all your idols destroyed. Especially when you have made an effort to avoid puppets.

It's sad that some great PDFs and other sources I wanted to post have been wiped out.
