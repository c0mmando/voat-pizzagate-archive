<p>The <a href="http://www.ahomeinhaiti.org/">http://www.ahomeinhaiti.org/</a> site doesn\'t stay up much longer -- does goe through some weird changes, but imo nothing so far except a site that tries to sell you supplements (Garcinia Cambogia) and convince you to buy shit from <a href="https://www.flexpetz.com/">https://www.flexpetz.com/</a> </p>
<p>Courageous Church? Doesn\'t exist anymore as far as I can tell. Correct me if I\'m wrong, but you can at least see the original site is no longer online ( Remember The New Life Children’s Refuge (NLCR) was founded in November 2009 by Laura Silsby (now Silsby-Gayler) and Charisa Coulter, who are both members of the Central Valley Baptist Church.

<p>Here\'s some of the shit they\'re doing, judge for yourself: <a href="https://nwhaititrips.wordpress.com/">https://nwhaititrips.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>Kind of seems bizarre they have a problem &quot;shipping the volume of food&quot;, but someone more educated than me should comment on that front. I almost wonder if the Silsby thing happened intentionally, to distract from the actual atrocities being committed, and to make it look like HRC was sweeping in to make things right, but that\'s just my speculations.</p>
<p>I really think there\'s something here. I\'ve suspected Shaun King was a fraud for some time, and when I saw he had Haiti charities, you know I had to follow the money.</p>
