            This is exactly how Hillary Clinton ran her campaign, along with her propagandist-in-chief, David Brock. They infiltrated comments sections across liberal and social media, with trolls aka "hillbots". These trolls denounced and demeaned anyone who supported Sanders or told the truth about their vile candidate. It was gaslighting in the extreme, and they have since continued it with all of their fear-mongering about "fake news" and the Russians, as a way to deflect from their glaring deficits.They seized upon Pizzagate as the epitome of so-called "fake news" in a massive effort to denounce and delegitimize any concerns that the masses might have about pedophilia among the elite. Therefore, pedophilia must be rampant, because they doth protest - way - too much!

             I posted a few days ago that our family cardiologist attended a medical convention last year in France.  The convention brought up the incredible amounts of human and organ trafficking that was rampant world-wide.  Our doctor is very much a legal transplant doctor, but the conference wanted the doctors of the world to know that this is very much taking place.  The money is about drugs, human/child trafficking, money laundering and ultimately, feeding the pedophilia clients with their "commodity" of choice-----
children.  When our friend came back to America, he was very much spooked.  He said their is a whole world out there that we do not know about.  Very much a cover-up and so many things going on below the surface.  He did say that the world will know about this soon-because it is too big a problem to keep hidden.  So, guys, keep up the good work.  Do not falter on your way.  The children need to be saved.  The left took down the PP objections (which just sickens me) but, these children need an advocate/crusader to bring these sick, demented, evil people to justice.  So, the medical community knows about this-I guess the conference wanted to have the doctors and their staff to know that yes, organs are being sold in other countries to wealthy elite (don't ask too many questions) and that our whole medical industry could be tainted with illegal and morally wrong procedures.

              Late reply: There's long been not much morality in the medical industry as it is. It's already the leading cause of death via drugs and lousy nutrition advice etc.

            I already know exactly when the media is lying. Its fail proof. All I have to do is watch their lips. If they are moving, then they are lying. Its that simple.

             Same. But with many other people, they trust everything the news reports. Those are the people who we need to insight critical thinking in, maybe even sway to our side. If we jump right to, "everything the news says is a lie," they will be less likely to believe us, since we aren't the news. However, get a person who worked for the news who has organized a nice presentation on a trustworthy platform (TED Talks), and this might open a few eyes.

            This is a great talk. Especially this pointer to help identify when the MSM is actually the source of "fake news" - in essence: Beware when they (the media/TPTB) attack those exposing wrongdoing rather than the wrongdoing [which is real] itself. Remind anyone of what we see happen over and over again when efforts are made to shine a light on pedophilia among the elite?
