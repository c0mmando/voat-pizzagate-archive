            Next big move is Trump is served an impeachment, antifa pretending to be trump supporters riot in five cities. The false flags will allow for marshall law and fifa and obama in charge. I'm guessing 9/23 the shit goes down and the bank freeze everyone's money.

              Everybody on YT is talking about 9/23. Not just about martial law, but about planet X or something. Big change, rebirth, et al, not without some heavy shaking and stuff. I think something big is coming on that date. I just don't know what exactly.

            <p>
             That assumes there are enough Generals inside the Pentagon to go along with Martial Law and I highly doubt that group is big enough to pull something like that off. We're so close to the end the handwriting's on the wall. The Deep State is coming down and any general knows they need to get on the right side of History.
            </p>
            <p>
             Assuming Trump wants to drain the swamp the only option is Robert Mueller must make Trump fire him. That's the only thing egregious enough to justify the military stepping in over Trump who is their commander in chief.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's possible Trump has been bought off but I highly doubt it. He wants to get on the right side of History too.

              I keep hearing they're using the UN military. People see a lot of european military tanks and trucks getting moved around the country. I hope you are right that our military would resist it.

              <p>
               I've seen those stories before and researched it a little bit. A lot of U.N. equipment is bought from U.S. manufacturers and a lot of times it's sent back to the factory for upgrades etc. America is the home of the Military Industrial Complex after all.
              </p>
              <p>
               Besides if there was martial law and an American general in charge of a Division of mechanized infantry saw a contingent of U.N. soldiers from Trinidad &amp; Tobago try an forcefully occupy Atlanta Georgia do you think he'd let that happen? Of course not.

             It has been calculated that Silverstein was out about $1.5B after all was said an Done (building the freedom tower).

             Trump immediately knew the jets didn't cause the crash of the buildings and said so in interviews.  Their were reports of Muslims dancing in D.C.  Trump knows 9/11 was an inside job, but he is currently battling the same people that are carrying out Pizzagate.

               You have a comprehension problem. That does not mean stop investigating. He is a history graduate and thinks that war is coming because of similar scenarios that started wars in the past. He's feeling dred.

                Investigations have a beginning and an end, he says games over, which i guess explains why he himself offers no research.  And he draws tje wrong historical conclusions. Wars started in the past largely due to jewish influence, which the impending civil war will eradicate if idiots like him dont fuck it up and betray us

                     You lack intellectual rigor and a learning spirit.  You are self centered and only care about your ego on this board.  You are wrong and insist you are right through crass belligerence.  This board is not about you and would be much better off if you did not post.

                       Your approach to this subject lacks rational or compassion. You are ego centric and communicate based on unresolved internal conflict.  You would do well to understand yourself better before communicating in public.

                          I used to tear down 911 truther flyers on campus.  Sadly i must now acknowledge mass sacrifices might be a real thing.

                          Why you wont consider JEWISH conspiracies, even tho they're who control the money supply, is because youre a naive woman who thinks being labelled "hateful" or "bigot" means anything.

                           Again,  you are an idiot.  A waste of time and energy.  This board would be so much better off without you...btw: they aren't Jewish conspiracies...Rothschilds activities with the monarchies of Europe, Saudi royal family, the Vatican, Wall Street, etc.  are fact.  You're just idiotically focusing on 'muh Jews'...pathetic

                            I have many times. Shills have successfully discredited me it seems.  More likely, given the WEBB FIASCO YOU AVOID ADDRESSING, youre all dummies.

                            Women always tell me i was right, but the TONE i used wasnt, and thus, they explain as if giving ME the advice, they ignored it
  Thats women in a nutshell, irrational 25 days of the month and absolutely unbearable the other five.

                             Has it occurred to you that you're so insignificant that a shill wouldn't waste time farting at one of your posts?  Your 'work' on this board is worth less than empty space between your ears....But, I am sorry to hear about your problems with women.  Maybe it's a function of your bigotry?  Perhaps your self centered egotism?  Maybe your slovenly appearance?  Acne?  Halitosis?  Obesity?  Maybe they're just turned off by the condition of your room 
(I mean mothers basement)...

                              I was being magnanimous, as a gentleman does, but i am afraid i can no longer tolerate your impudence so heres the definition of stupid:

                              I am not saying Webb is right in his conclusions...but at the very least he raises a lot of questions for further investigation...and that is what he is after (open source crowd based public investigation). If you don't agree with his theories, fine focus elsewhere, but i take great umbrage with folks calling into question his motives as they post anonymously.

                              HIS RAISING UNRELATED UNNECESSARY QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE IS WHAT MADE ME IDENTIFY HIM AS A SHILL. YOU DREW THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION BECAUSE WOMEN ARE NAIVE.

                               Getting a little angry eh dumboy?  Yes you are the definition of magnanimous and gentlemanly...in a racist, egocentric, low, low IQ kind of way.  It's no wonder your mom lets you live in her basement (she appreciates how magnanimous and gentlemanly you are---all the other girls just don't understand, but mommy does).  Don't worry about your body odor, the food in between your teeth or lack of gainful employment...your chivalry will land you the girl of your dreams!

                    I dont like people whose reaction to seeing all the jews in PG is to say NOT ALL JEWS THO. Nobody needs you to defend their rights, certainly not jews who have thousands of interest groups. Shall we invite some SJWs or would they be a hindrance like webb.  I like how libs here are throwing their hopes to GOPers like gowdy and sessions, 7 months ago they probably despised them HAH

                     You are a racist bigot.  You fail to point out high level institutionalize pedophelia within other non Jewish groups.  It's reaction to your ilk that empowers sjw's and has brought Europe to its knees with unfettered imigration because of its PC culture post WWII.  Your vitriol comes from an evil heart...

                       You lack the ability to compose coherent responses.  Your own words indict you as an untrained blustering know nothing charading as a bigoted know it all.  I am beginning to have pity for you but will continue to call you out for the sake of others in this board.

                         I have no problem calling out Jewish (Franken/Sabatean/Talmudic) pedosatanism.  Your inaccurate Pedantic focus on Jewish pedophelia, your bombastic unintelligent communication, and your self centered egotism reveal a truly pitiful human.  As I said many many times, you are a disgrace.  May God have mercy on you.

                            A believer in the JQ is by definition smarter than a normie, as it requires historical frames of reference and much reading.  Like everything in reality, your perception of racists as ignorant hillbillies is a JEWISH HOLLYWOOD LIE

                              Racist is probably a term invented by them, lacking any basis in reality.  Jews are master manipulators and israel is the most racist place at the official level

                      LOL.  Your theory is racists, out of nowhere, started hating on people, thus forcing people to vote for immigration? I can tell you're a chick.  Ignorant as all hell AND naive, hence, in the future, you shall not even approach a voting booth.

                       You have no understanding of political ideaology and it's consequences.  You fail to view modern day phenomenon through an historical/cyclical lens.  You are a danger to yourself and society.

                He also means it's over for the pedo elite because he thinks we're getting somewhere with investigating. That is the opposite of what you think he's saying. Calm down.

               This movie is not all fiction. It was not only Dr. Mengele that lived in Argentina but many other top Nazi's. This included a very high likelihood Hitler himself was brought to safety there as well along with Eva Braun. The Americans facilitated this and took all the top scientists into the US in Operation Paperclip. They were given new identities and positions in government, research, hospitals, academia. I am sure you know this. As far as Hitler's potential children pay careful attention to the mention of blue eyes in the movie.

               Note: Two days ago Aregentine police discovered the largest collection of Nazi artifacts in history inside a secret room behind a false bookcase. Many of the items are believed to have belonged personally to Hitler since there were photographs found of Him with some of these items at the location.

             It's his son. I'm convinced of it.  Born on 8/7/44 and his middle name is 'Swan'   SWAN???  Heinrich was involved in an affair at the time.  He was absolutely the TOP NAZI that the OSS would covet.  An expert on Commies and subversive tactics.

              That is a great possible connection. You ever wonder about George H.W. Bush? I have a name,info, &amp; family picture he might not really be a Bush. There might be more Operation Paperclip identities than everyone realizes.

               HW was a Navy dive bomber pilot and was shot down under dubious circumstances. That would have made it difficult to be a Nazi.  Read Russ Baker's book on the Bush Family 'Family of Secrets'.  HW Bush is lifetime CIA and is not only the most corrupt politician ever, he ( and his cabal ) is largely responsible for everything wrong in the world today.  That is not an understatement.

              Thanks for sharing your post.
Yes! Just like Justin Trudeau, Obama and Merkel - Mueller looks to be bred and placed in position to work for the deep state.

               Robert Mueller's bio is EXTREMELY VAGUE for someone with so much power and who has consistently been at history's crossroads, including now.

              <p>
               I love how they make it a major point to pronounce his name ' MULL - ER ', in fact, he is never called by the correct and traditional ' MULE - ER '

                Just like Obama's past - mostly faked up and scrubbed. Wondering why Trump is so quiet on Mueller's documented involvement with Hillary Clinton and Frank Giustra's Uranium being flown, per her instructions, to Russia.

                 The number one priority for Trump is removing all leakers FIRST.  Many are wondering what is taking so long, but with a core of leakers and backstabbers in his inner circle, it would be foolish to move against Clinton, the Deep State, and Israel at this time.

            While helping my husband with his Government homework assignment I read something about Mossad and 9/11 on Breitbart. Since I'm skeptical of George Webb but lean towards not calling every person ever a shill, when I saw that, I connected the two. What is a Mossad agent doing getting into Pizzagate?

             I'm not sure George Webb is Mossad. But why would Mossad be getting into Pizzagate? Easy. Israel would benefit greatly by turning state's evidence against Hillary &amp; Co. It would immediately absolve Mossad of any guilt and take out the mother fuckers who thought giving Iran nuclear weapons was a good idea.

                  You are going to have to do your own.  Not wanting to come up to periscope depth to look for it.  Keywords: Anonymous video Wexner Mossad Epstein
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don't recall exactly, but "clothing shop network" was the Wexner/Epstein invention of collecting blackmail material on visitors to Orgy Island, recorded to video, for later advantage (blackmail). Mossad caught whiff of this (supposedly) and figured out a way to steal the video tapes/hard drives/whatever.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  DuckDuckGo sucks, so I am not conviniced that it has been scrubbed or not.  AnonHQ doesn't have the video listed.  It's out there somewhere.  Maybe someone here has a good link.  I know what I saw 5 or 6 times.

                 Hey thanks for those links. I hadn't seen voltairenet before and it looks like a great resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Regarding your point about improving relations between Washington and Moscow. I view what's happening now down in DC as a Velvet Civil War. Remember the Russian Velvet Revolution in the early 1990s? This is just like that but it's a Civil War.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Velvet Civil War
                </p>
                <p>
                 It doesn't flow off the tongue as easily as Velvet Revolution but it's close. Anyway I don't think anyone really knows who's on what side down in DC. As the Deep State house of cards falls apart allegiances change. The closest explanation I can think of is based on Game Theory and
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">
                  Nash Equilibrium
                 </a>
                 .
                </p>
                <p>
                 After each step the players state has to be recalculated based on everyone else's state. The result is no one knows what will happen unless they can calculate the Nash Equilibrium for each step which is impossible given that human beings are the unit of measure down in DC. In other words it's impossible to predict with any accuracy what will happen towards the end because even the human actors don't know what they'll do.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Make sense? It's a bit of a stretch I'll admit but it kind of fits everything I've seen the past 9 months. And it explains what I strongly suspect and that's utter surprise at the speed at which the collapse happens. As soon as the first high level perp is arrested the entire Deep State will collapse at

                 For example say they finally arrest Hillary Clinton for selling classified information to the highest bidder. The second the hand cuffs go on she'll start spilling the beans on everyone. I imagine Hillary Clinton riding in the back of a police car enumerating a list of 100 names all the way to the court house where she'll be arraigned. Then the next step in the game begins and all the people she ratted out enumerate their list of people and so on to infinity. It'll be like

             Actually we know both of these are not crimes.  In the case of Rice and Power, the Senate looked at the unmasking and found nothing out of the ordinary.

            <p>
             In the case of Comey, there's no crime at all, private citizens can tell people about their nonclassified discussions with the President.

              . this looks desperate. Do you really believe your own bullshit. Of course you don't your paid to say it. Not paid enough. We know about the "hammer" we know about the videotaped declaration with C.Cameron and why he is seemingly in protective custody now. We know about the immunity given to the NSA whistleblower by Comey 2 years ago. We know the unmasking is so much deeper and so is the spying.

                If you have no idea about the hammer, the 47 hard drives and millions of documents given to Comey with whistleblower immunity that was  taped as dying declaration invloving a NSA whisltblower to Carl Cameron ( who is in protective custody) then you are very misinformed. It is in the possession of House Intel chief Devin Nunes. Two additional NSA whistleblowers have also come forward.

              Comey admitted that he didn't write the memo that he earlier admitted to leaking. The funny thing about psychopaths is that they can't remember their lies and assume everyone else forgets also. After all, they are the smartest people in the room, everyone else are fools that need to be ruled over, right?

                 Because the louder racists are, the more people will believe others are racist too...

                <p>
                 It's a very effective way to create a false division among people.

                <p>
                 Think about pre-election rumbling for Trump? It was almost NOTHING aside from race-baiting and racial fear mongering. The "Alt Right = White Supremacy" movement, the anti-Hispanic dialogue, the hate crimes across the country (with literally every single one being proven fake/staged and linked back to someone from the same group that claimed to be victimized)...
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm not saying racism doesn't exist. Obviously it does. But, it is being exploited in my opinion. The fear and perception of racism can cause a nearly instant rift between people. This was perpetuated by CNN leading up to the election... and now? It's Islamophobia paired with these online trolls that are obviously shilling to perpetuate this social divide.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In this day and age, only idiots perpetuate actual racism, and only idiots take them seriously. The shills fill in the rest.
