            When I was five or six my mother brought my younger brother and I to her new boyfriends house during one of her and my dads "breakups." I remember him taking me into the bathroom and being far too friendly. I got away unscathed, but I still to this day worry about my younger brother and wonder if he suffered something worse than I did. These people need to fucking burn.

            OP: For victims, my personal feeling is that you should report this, but you should do what makes you feel whole and healthy. If you want to demand to know who the creepy guy is/was, then do it. If you don't want to confront him then don't do it just because others tell you to. I've been through some horrid things in my life but nothing like pizzagate.  What I mean is go confront these sick fucks if it will help you heal. Get a sib to go with you if it will help. If you think it will help others to turn people in, then you should. If you can find a good psychologist to talk to that might be the way to work through it. I think you just went through a major shock with this memory. Do what you think will be best for yourself. I would ask a pediatrician who is a good shrink for this. And if the shrink gives off any kind of creepy vibes, get another psychologist or psychiatrist to talk to. There may be a victim's group in your area. Take care of yourself. Big hugs from all of us. Ps. Hope this is legible.  I'm typing on a phone with one thumb and it's difficult.

            Thank you for sharing this.  I hope you can find some closure to it. Pizzagate or not, I fear this happened a hell of a lot to kids. Still happening, but there's thankfully more awareness about it.

            You are far from the first to not put all of this together until years later. Stay strong and under no circumstances doubt yourself. This could get seriously difficult for you but speaking up will help you and others.
I am so sorry for what was done to you and your family.

            Doesn't that make ya want to go to each one of these child funding agency  ''foundations"  and demand reparation, damage and  counselling financial payment for negligence?

            What are they doing with all their child funding assistance?
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you considered going to a counsellor for memory assistance?   I know some things are forgotten because they can't be dealt with,  but a good counsellor can provide help without putting any suggestions in place.  That's important if it goes to court they can't charge the counsellor for interfering in ways that  hinder  court hearings.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I were in that situation I'd consider finding a lawyer who might do pro bono or payment upon case settlement to  charge them for reparation.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the best to you.

            Or place pretty young men  in the company of pervy old men.   They're  equal opportunity pedo's.  With all the child help funding agencies and nobodies taking down investigation of  all the shit  that can be found online alone.

            Now we're  really seeing the propaganda effort in all its  filthy manipulation.

              It's really addictive.   I have no idea how they digitally package that thing,  but for those who are interested in period shows  it's mesmerizing.

            All across America child welfare reform activist are pushing to get the “First Family Preservation Act of 2016” (HR-5456/S-3065) passed through the Senate.

           <p>
            The clock is ticking… session is getting short and we have 3 Senators holding it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Boxer (D-CA) 202-224-3553
Senator Enzi (R-WY) 202-224-3424
Senator Cornyn (RINO-TX) 202-224-2934
From my understanding the main hold out is Cornyn."
           </p>
           <p>
            Note: Cornyn is an "expert" for the Federalist Society. I've met him - I also remember reading a post on pizzagate linking pizzagate to Fed Soc. No idea if that is legit.

            Mother targeted by Michigan after CPS removed her daughter for "medical neglect" when mom took her off antipsychotic drugs. Daughter then RAPED or MOLESTED in the psych ward where they forcibly drugged her. Contracts STD. Mom charged with shooting a weapon. The original order to remove child was never signed by a judge. Michigan is STILL going after her 10 years later appealing the cases against her and she apparently now is not competent to stand trial on remand because of a recent aneurysm.

            Wow that's incredible. Someone linked a while back to a psychiatrist who's decoded how to unravel someone under mind control. I wonder if some of those methods would help unlock some more memories. (Not saying you were mind controlled, just that the Dr had a deep understanding of suppressed memories.

            Heart-wrenching story. I have become convinced CPS plays a huge part in child abuse/sex trafficking becoming endemic in the US and indeed the Western world.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a monetary aspect where adoptive parents hoard children - researching pizzagate I found many instances - and people with this motivation rarely take good care of their adoptees.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there is the legal aspect. I found many examples too of CPS as well as other child law institutions where the path to adoption routinely becomes corrupted because the people in charge think the law doesn't apply to them - and they're usually right.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there is the sexual abuse aspect which probably overlaps both. There is no serious monitoring system for the sexual integrity of adopted children who are entirely dependent on their stepparents and even if there were it would probably be corrupted by pedos who ALWAYS circle like vultures around vulnerable children.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire system not just for adopting kids but also helping underprivileged children, caring for 'special needs kids', foreign aid as well as the legal underpinnings have ALL become severely compromised.
           </p>
           <p>
            Merely erecting guillotines for the Podestas, Silsby's, Sandalows and Clintons of this world will not change that situation. But, it's a start.

             There were a lot of threads early on this investigation about CPS and family court abuses. There is a book about the Connecticut legal system called "in the worst interests of the child" that probably applies to every state.

            Thank you for sharing your story. I think molestation is a lot more common than people think. My brothers best friend was their soccer coach at school. I'm 5 years younger but I think he was in junior high. So my brother went and stayed the night at his friends house and when he was sleeping, the coach climbed in bed with my brother and molested him. My brother tried to commit suicide when he was 15. He was in a coma and not expected to survive. But now he speaks at churches all over giving testimony about our childhood and his overcoming so much.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well the coach ended up later on going to prison for killing a woman. My brother was believed then! We always believed. It just makes me sick that so many perverts find jobs where they can be around children. It can just ruin lives. Then they look like great people because they are "good with kids" so then it's hard to convince people that the person is really bad. That's what all these charities do. They look like heros when all along their true agenda was hidden. Anyways, I hope nothing else happened to you and you're suppressing it.

             Wow what stories.  My heart goes out to all of the abused.  It is sad that it took a murder in order for a child to be believed.  People believe someone can kill but not abuse of a child.  This country needs to open up.  It is a creepy subject but the more we talk about it in a healthy way, the more people will stop closing their ears.  It is a horrible subject that people do not want to face. Peace to You All.

              I agree. The sad part is that a lot of people will falsely accuse people so they ruin it for the true victims. I had a friend in school that accused the teacher of molesting her because she didn't like the school she was going to and wanted to switch to mine. So the teacher was put on leave to be investigated and then she admitted she had lied. That's why it's so tough. You never know.

               I believe that both should be punished to the full sens of the law.  Either way.  People get wiped out when they see the word pedo and child. When a child makes a false claim like that the parents should be punished or go to jail. I don't know if that is the perfect answer either but there should be a harsh punishment.There should be some severe threat.  That is the only way we will conquer this.  Make tough laws and enforce them.

                   I think it takes therapy to keep them from repeating what has been done to them if they have been abused.  But if they fabricate such a story there is also something seriously wrong.  Very wrong.

                    Therapy doesn't work with a true sociopath. Not all abusers are stone cold psychopaths or sociopaths, but perpetrators who have that specific defective brain pattern will never be helped with therapy. True sociopaths just learn how to lie better and beat the system when in counselling.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Edit: I just realized you meant therapy for the victim. Absolutely. The hard part is finding a good therapist.

                     I guess that is why some abuse victims just get better working out their own problems (which takes a lifetime sometimes) and turn out alright.  Others are completely adverse to help and believe they have a right to keep doing what they are doing.  They actually believe that the children want them and are seeking sex with them.  There are some sick people out there, but we need to help those that are victims of abuse.  I believe we should offer free abuse help now.  Right away we should help get these people off the streets before they start doing what was done to them.

            He was very high up in the childhood education world and served as a court-appointed child advocate. He was convicted of some really sick stuff and still lives within 1000 feet of a school.

             The CASA program really concerns me! There are a lot of wonderful, retired people who become CASA's, but it is a volunteer position that allows people from the community A LOT of private and direct contact with vulnerable children. CASAs are background checked and go through a long training program, and then they are assigned cases and spend hours with the children. They take kids in their private cars and can basically go wherever they want with them. It's ripe for abuses and problems like what you point out with your brother. I'm very sorry for you and him.

             Victims need to confront their victimizers and also get acknowledged for what they survived. It's a crying shame that the judicial system hides underage victims and prevents them from confronting and healing from the trauma. Expose all the pedos and bring them to justice!

              I understand this sentiment and support the feeling behind it, but a big part of why those of us who have been abused never file charges against our abusers is because we don't want to face them or their defenders ever again. When you face your abuser and tell them off, all they do is tell you how it was your fault and how they had a worse deal than you did.

              There needs to be something in place that protects victims more but still allows them to put their abusers away. That may be changing society to view sexual abuse (and domestic abuse) the same as a random violence. People should not get lighter sentences for hurting people in their own families.

               I could not agree more. We have legal protection for the accused: the legal system must view them as innocent until proven guilty. But our most vulnerable? Nothing. If you are a woman and a victim you have less resources to navigate the legal system, a child has even less recourse and no voice! It makes me so angry and I wish I knew what needed to be done to change it! Meanwhile the criminals have a free lawyer and the presumption of innocence. What do victims get?

                Just being able to tell someone requires courage, because when you are victimized you become terrified of even shadows. To voice it is step one but our society, punishes, silences and doubts the victims!

              God has a plan. He gave us free will and this is what has come of it. This earthly life is a blip on the screen compared to eternity. Hell will become very real to these perverts who are abusing kids. Jesus spoke a parable that I think you may find helpful as I did:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way. But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared. So the servants of the owner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?’ He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants said to him, ‘Do you want us then to go and gather them up?’ But he said, ‘No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.” 
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭13:24-30‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
               <a href="http://bible.com/114/mat.13.24-30.nkjv">
                http://bible.com/114/mat.13.24-30.nkjv
               </a>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              It is in God's plan to let the evil live among the good. Rest assured, all will be brought to justice at the end.

                There are four types of prayer (davening): praise (tehillah), thanksgiving (todah), petitionary prayer (tefillah), and supplication (selichah). You say yourself that only God is real, so then people must be God without knowing it, so God must want to create an experience for Himself that's not nightmarish, so it makes sense for Him to be able to submit support tickets to Himself and let His servants/messengers handle the support queue, so He's not trapped in the Matrix with no deliverer. Not only that, but if G-d primarily wants praise, then the best way to get that is to goad people into praying and then reward them with something He wanted to give them anyway, but since they asked for it now they appreciate it more (and give thanks for something they would have taken for granted).

            Very brave to share. I think part of the obsession of pizzagate for a good part of us is exactly these sort of memories that sort of seem like dreams or, rather, nightmares.

            Wow. Thanks for sharing. I am terrified for my little one as I look back throughout my life and how many times inappropriate things were done to me by family members, older schoolmates and some people in positions of authority. I wonder what the percentage of molestation really is if we were all honest about it.

             I was also afraid for my two girls as they grew up.  I never had true memory of the abuse my childhood best friend and I were subjected to by our Associate Pastor until I was in my late 20's.  When I remembered, and I don't  know what sparked them, the memories were as clear as a bell.  I asked my friend about it (we had never spoken of it) and she confirmed it had happened but was not too concerned about the incidents.  This occurred when we were both 10 or 11 years old.  I still have a memory I can't recall.  My parents allowed me to go with him to North Carolina to visit my grandparents while he visited someone else.  I don't have any memory of the trip except I am sure it happened.  When I told my mother about the abuse a few years later, when I was in my 30's, she didn't believe that it could have happened.  My husband and I married when I was 28 and began having a family.  We ended up having 2 girls.  They are grown now but I worried so much about them going places, even with friends.  Pedophilia, even in a Baptist church, has been around for a long time.

             &amp; I think we've all been groomed sexually by the media to some extent. Hollywood has "molested" a lot of young minds through movies, cartoons, and ads.

              Mainstream Hollywood movies and TV shows are hideous, but I'm not sure anything compares to the debauchery of rock/rap lyrics and videos. Lyrics go into your brain emotionally like a meme. They bypass your thought process and sink deep into a child's mind. Rappers should be thrown into shark infested waters.
