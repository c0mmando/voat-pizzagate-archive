            He cannot make these enforcement efforts and not know of the internal government corruption that protects the illegal operations. Considering that his campaign premise was “drain the swamp”.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is reasonable to consider that Mr. Trump is facing tremendous opposition, ridicule and constant attacks. Nobody here in Mexico, nor in any other country appreciates him. He is a racist devil, painted with the liberal propaganda of the MSM. they don’t see his results. The battle against trafficking and Trump are two unconnect things in the eyes of most people. Despite the statistics and survivors, human trafficking is just some kind of bogeyman conspiracy theory. Despite the lack of evidence, Trump’s image as a racist Russian bot-puppet hasn’t changed in 18 months. From here in Mexico, he might as well be hitler. Kids in middle school do plays about him and burn him in effigy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite being totally exposed, spirit-cooking, pizzagate, and the corruption of all of the players in the Podesta emails is ignored internationally. The SNL jokes and pranks from people like Kathy Griffin get a megaphone. Practically every journalistic platform outside of the US is owned by billionaires like Carlo Slim. The headlines of all newspapers blame him for everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the opposition of the whole world, I feel kinda sorry for Trump. I’m impressed that it seems like he keeps on trucking. Maybe he’s just doin this for show. Maybe he’s lost his marbles. Maybe he knows something we don’t. Time will tell.

            So many people want instant gratification.
           </p>
           <p>
            The US has been slowly taken over since it's inception. Undoing this mess (without destroying the economy / society in the process) could take some time. Over 100 years worth of plotting to take over the US and building up this sick network and people expect everything to be solved within a year or 2? It appears many of these "instant gratificationers" are mostly emotional and aren't using logic and/or the facts as much.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its like people don't follow anything else but Hillary Clinton and Obama. Trump already blocked the NWO's TPP and Paris Agreement. But who cares right? Lets ignore how he's fighting the NWO to blame him for not taking Hillary and Obama down fast enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if Hillary / Obama have kill switches? Maybe they have bombs planted inside of buildings? I would if I was them. I would have a whole lot more. I'm making assumptions here, but these players had decades to get to where they are and Trump is magically suppose to fix it all in a year or 2?

             Good point. We are talking about an ancient cabal of evil. The only reason we know what we do and are even talking about them is because of their hubris... NOT because they are weak or stupid.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s because a kingmaker, Podesta, kept the world ruler’s satanic child sacrifice and sex secrets in his email messages. He didn’t worry about deleting them. He never imagined that anyone would cross him.
            </p>
            <p>
             His email address was his
             <em>
              name
             </em>
             . His password was
             <em>
              password
             </em>
             that’s how he kept his master’s secrets. And his mater’s pyramid of power had grown so big that they didn’t screen out this idiot, Podesta. The height of hubris.

             Really? Trump blocked the NWO's TPP and Paris Agreements. Maybe you missed it.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Trump was a true dictator he wouldn't give a shit about the damn 4/8 chan boards and Q.

             I think you need to wake up - I already considered what you believe before Trump was elected.

            Today was a deciding factor.

            Haspel is publicly associated with brutal torture during her tenure working as a part of the CIA’s clandestine service. Most poignantly her overseeing of the brutal torture of Al Qaeda operatives at a CIA black site prison in Thailand. Abu Zubaydah was exposed to the “enhanced interrogation” program. According to declassified CIA documents, Zubaydah was subjected to sleep deprivation, walling, and waterboarding techniques. The New York Times reported that Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times in a one-month period. Video footage of the torture sessions were destroyed by the CIA in 2005.

            CIA is what Trump wanted to end.  Now we are over a year after the election and not a word is uttered.  CIA is a Rogue Global Org.  Trump did not mention one word during today's announcement against the CIA.  All is forgiven All is forgotten

             , giving the government authority to regulate and "protect" our rights to free speech?  Uhh...does anybody remember the Patriot act getting passed to protect our constitutional rights and freedoms?  How did that one work out?

              Well, people are so stupid they think they have rights.  All they have to do is step out of line one inch, and they will find out their rights.  The internet is a wonderful tool and the govt. likes to hold it over our heads.  It's all about the Fear Factor again.  Yes, I am afraid what may lie ahead.

             It's my view that the CIA has been totally neutered and she would be the perfect choice as Director, especially if major moves against the Agency are forthcoming.

             The CIA is not going to be cleaned up...  it's going to be scattered to the winds in 1000 pieces.

              Yeah, Caesar is going to do what he wants with these things. The only thing we can do is be patient. We haven’t all gathered together here to expose this evil, only to disintegrate because Trump is slow or fake, or because Q is trolling us. 18 months ago, Q was nothing. I didn’t even vote. I think politics are fake. But  I have often speculated that the system would come down when someone sneaks inside and pulls back the curtain. That’s happening. I don’t attribute this to Trump, but he is a tool in the process.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don’t worry about it. Be patient. Stay focused on what you know to be true and do t give up.

               I have been personally affected and I find it impossible to believe that what has happened to me ( for my activism ) is a LARP.

               13 incidents and counting of gang stalking and harassment at my home and workplace because I have been over the target since the beginning.

                Wow. Be safe, friend. Is there anything you can do: video cameras, etc? I myself have received a few weird phone calls. Pizzagate aside, anyone that takes a stand on the right side IN LIFE takes flak and becomes a target for the spiritual enemy, IMO.

                Well, we can hope this is going somewhere.  I am in limbo right now.  Kind of numb and tired from all the back and forth.  This is a good start.

             Perhaps she is whistleblowing against those who gave her the orders...also, this has the media calling out the torture instead of protecting the guilty.

            No he is not. He is one of them. He was selected like all Potus are and he is delivering the goods. The media's job is to pretend they don't like what he is doing, and we are supposed to think the elites plans are being foiled, not carried out. Wake up.

             I imagine that he had to be one of them to get in the game. It’s always been that way. I don’t think he was one of those pre-chosen to win candidates. My gut says that was Hillary. The Rothchilds, master of this system, selected Hillary and made their support known publicly during the election when Trump ceased to be a cartoon and showed himself rising above their editorial erasures in the MSM.
            </p>

             That said, I respect your skepticism. I am all about avoiding hero worship. Lowered expectations keep me sane and functioning. It seems like Trump has been more effective than Obama so far, which is notable, given the tremendous backlash he receives. Either way, more time is needed. Wars are a test of patience, if anything. Especially a spiritual war, which I think this is.

             Hey you're back! (formerly DeathTwoMasons, right?) I was an idiot 4 months ago and insulted you for something you said about Ryan from pizzagategear. I owe you an apology! I went back and read your comment history this weekend and was thoroughly blackpilled. Now this faggot is thoroughly woke thanks to you. Sorry for being such a twat back then. Thank you for having the courage to say unpopular things and continuing even when people are dicks!

              What did he say about Ryan? I'm interested because I was previously suss on him (something never sat right with me) but then I concluded to myself that he's probably legit. What's the consensus?

            This could be legit, or they could just be throwing us a bone to keep us at bay. I've been thinking the same about the Qanon stuff. What if Q is a creation that Trump is in on but it's designed to get us all thinking something is in the works but we need to be patient for as long as it takes yada yada.. It's the perfect idea to pacify the "redpilled" community.

             What exactly do you mean "keep us at bay?" What exactly are you guys going to do if Q wasn't around to pacify? Probably nothing, but keep posting on message boards. Thats why I think Trump / Q isn't just their to pacify , distract , its a waste of time to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've already considered Trump could be against the US before he was elected. But since Trump physically blocked the NWO's TPP and Paris Agreement's, thats evidence he is on our side.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've also considered Trump could be blocking the NWO's TPP and Paris Agreement's to trick us, but again, it doesn't make much sense. A real dictator would continue with his mission not caring about a pacifying bunch of nobodys on a forum.

              You took the words out of my mouth. I’m struck with echoes of speeches that JFK and Reagan gave about secret societies and government corruption. Then they got shot.
             </p>
             <p>
              They were talking about the same deep state that we are fighting now. If those heavy hitters were cowed, how can we be mad that Trump is being too slow? Is he supposed to be Superman or something?
             </p>
             <p>
              And I agree. The worst thing our enemy has done was ignore us. If they continued doing that, we could do nothing about it. If anything, Q’s comments reach out and keep this forum alive; even if we spend days arguing about whether he is legit. At least we are still here, United on the cause, trying to effect change and waiting for an opportunity to save some kids.

              <p>
               It's always seemed to me that those agreements favored multinationals at the expense of the american worker. How do the multinationals benefit from being denied slave labor? How does Trump benefit?
              </p>
              <p>
               I agree with IVIVI - so far Trumps actions don't add up to a narrative that he's a shill for the cabal.

              The insane amount of censorship and propaganda virtually everywhere should speak volumes.  The deep state is getting extremely nervous.  They never expected there mind control over the masses could fall apart this quickly.

            I will give him another year then see. Things are so far out of hand that it is doubtful that anything can be done. Snuff film industry alone rakes in 150 billion.

             The satanic elite has disposable income. Netflix is a construct that the make for our consumption. They are apparently into other things. I wouldn’t be surprised if your stats were an understimation.

             $150B?  How come they're not all over liveleak then?  I mean, Liveleak already has a bunch of snuff films, but they're usually accidents, not purposefully produced.
