<p>Judicial Watch has now received 756 pages of newly uncovered emails that were among the materials Clinton tried to delete or destroy, several of which were classified and were transmitted over her unsecure, non-“state.gov” email system.</p>

<p>Judicial Watch obtained these emails in response to our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit they filed on May 6, 2015, after the State Department failed to respond to our March 4, 2015, FOIA request (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00687)) seeking:</p>
<p>All emails sent and received by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her official capacity as Secretary of State, as well as all emails by other State Department employees to Secretary Clinton regarding her non-“state.gov” email address.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>An October 20, 2012, email exchange between top State Department and Clinton Foundation officials discussed arrangements for Bill and Hillary’s trip to Haiti. That trip focused on the opening of the Caracol Industrial Park, funded by a $300 million+ grant from USAID. The Caracol Park came to be seen as a hugely wasteful disaster that was supposed to create 65,000 jobs for Haitians but as of January 2015 only produced 4,500.</p>
