            . The relative lack of shilling in the Daily Mail comments is just more evidence that the shills we face here every day are domestic. That one escaped their radar.

            USMC murdered one of it's own in January 22,. 1991.

            Makes you wonder how many normal people are in the know.  I mean, Voat is niche and alienates a lot of people who aren't used to unfiltered free speech.  Reddit is so manipulated and controlled that it is funny, so it is hard to gage there as well.  Google doesn't even have the "try not to be evil" motto now because well who are they even kidding anymore.  You can't trust their results to give you a remotely realistic picture of what people are searching.  If the veil was removed it would probably be far larger than anyone ever thought.  Sort of like how the media lied about Trump's polls the entire 2016 election.

            Good post,

            , thank you.  It's good to zoom out, from time to time, and focus on the positive.  I was thinking about all the negative comments on his Twitter last night, in response to his recent tweets.  So your post just underscores what I was thinking:  it's awesome that people call Podesta out, now, for his alleged involvement in this stuff.  Curiously,  despite the tens of thousands of people calling him an alleged satanic pedophile online, he has not sued a single one for defamation.   My guess is that's because  "TRUTH" is a defense to defamation.....  have a good weekend.

             The 30,000' view is important.  For example, there is no logical reason why someone would spend their time day in, and day out, attempting to disrupt legitimate research - i.e. shills.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Because Pizzagate is stupid and it needs to be shouted down" isn't a valid excuse.  No normal person(s) devotes this much time to countering an argument, unless they are trying to save their own skin or are being paid to do it or both.

           <p>
            I've seen the same thing. I always try to read the comments if they're there. Last Winter no one had heard of Pizzagate and if they had it was to dump scorn on anyone believing in conspiracy theories. Today I'm blown away by how many comments show people are aware of what's going on.

             It's a comin'.  And it isn't going to be pretty.  I think the administration has a nice firm grip on the chain to the drain.  What we've been seeing the last few months has been that little bit which leaked down the drain.
            </p>
            <p>
             As other anons said, it can't be done all at once.  If they arrested everyone in once fell swoop, this country would descend into civil war.  At least in the inner cities and gun free states/cities.
            </p>
            <p>
             The mass redpilling process will be akin to bringing a frog to a boil.  At some point, they will wake up and freak the hell out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Imagine if everything you believed in was about to be turned inside out and "you" were essentially a supporter of the pedofile elite?

              I can't wait.  Rip off the ole Band-Aid, I say.  I want all the evidence released at once, names named, and perps indicted!  I'm sick to death of the "civil war" worries.   Let's just man the fuck up and expose this shit so the healing, to whatever extent is possible,  can please begin.

                Excellent point. I exercise my second amendment right every single day but most people will be sitting ducks, and most of those sitting ducks will be innocent children (and adults).

                 I too am a supporter of the second amendment.  I think it is the only thing that has kept this country from being overrun by the Deep/Pedo State.  That's why they have been relentless over the last 3 decades when it comes to restricting firearms ownership.

                <p>
                 Other than the Pedo Protectors (certain local LE agencies) I think the bulk of LE and MIL would never have risen against the American public.  The libs know this too,

                 Some of the funniest videos on YT are of lefties trying to train on firearms.  BLM videos are equally as funny.  They will die quickly in an armed conflict.

                  If the country dissolves into an internal war of any kind I believe it'll be mass chaos and bullets will fly everywhere. People need to remember that bullets can't differentiate between good guys and bad guys. And, it'll be everyone for themselves when food and water runs out. Fatal diseases like cholera will begin wiping more people out as soon as the water and food supplies are contaminated which can happen within weeks once the infrastructure breaks down.

                  My theory on why the majority of liberals don't like guns is that it's part of their culture to not have them. By not having them, they're not familiar with them. Unfamiliarity with something can breed fear. Over the years, I've made it a point to teach as many children and adults how to safely have fun shooting guns. Many of the adults I've taught are liberals. And they get hooked on target shooting just as quickly as the kids once they understand how a gun works and how to be safe while using it. Even my anti-gun liberal mom loves having a rifle in her arms now, lol.

                  But we need to avoid an internal war/conflict if possible. I'm impatient with Trump, but if it turns out that we've made far more progress than I'm aware of, and he actually IS draining the swamp, with HRC's and Podesta's and other's prisoner numbers and shirts being prepped right now, then get out of my way because I want to be the first person to shake Trump's hand.

              I went from a Tea Party normie to belief in the Pedo Elite Satanist in a two week period last November and December.  It was a hell of a bumpy ride.....I know if most people start believing the truth.....then the world will be different.  There will be no place for them to hide....except maybe their bunkers that WE paid for.  The Sabbeteans and they chosen Goyim puppet families already have bug out places planned.  We will have to dig into the earth and eliminate them all.  While they threaten us with EMP devices and unleashing their plagues that they developed with  OUR tax money to KILL us if this ever happens.  But I refuse to live in a world run by these kid killing jackasses....so bring it on.  Death before Dishonor!

                Yeah....wild ride it was.  First I grew to believe that Podesta and company were Pedophiles.  Then I saw the Conspiracy of Silence stuff and realized it was both parties.  Then I realized that if the Democrats were not also corrupt they would of used Boystown and George Bush the Elders ties with underage prostitues in the white house to destroy the Republicans in the early 90's.  The fact they did not....and the fact the Press all came together to cover it up allowed me to understand the Media and both Parties were involved.  Then seeing the British Pedophile issues....that go back forty years it made me realize it was Global......Wondering how the hell this could be the case lead to Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove, Club of Rome, Council of 300, the Rothschilds, the Vatican and the 'Black Pope.....Then all the modern music with mind numbing Occult shit....then realizing it is at least as old as the Beatles.....
               </p>
               <p>
                Then I had a favorite female Sci fi author.....I had named my Daughter after one of her main characters.  I had read her stuff THAT much.  I realized after reading the Greenbaum Paper and reading how they had moved into the arts in the 1950's I had an eureka moment.....she was describing MKULTRA sex abuse mind control world domination and more.  It was unbelievably similar.  I had been writing her as a fan for the last 14 years off and on.  Well I was in a rage in December and wrote her an accusing letter that she was apart of a CIA mind fuck and no way in hell she wrote that story on her own.  I also asked her very snarkly that she probably had been abused and was put up to writing this story by the CIA....at first she denied it.   Then she wrote back very cryptically but pretty clearly admitting to everything....the abuse she had suffered.  I asked her if she thought we would throw off the Slave masters or go down......she said she was optimistic....
               </p>
               <p>
                Optimistic of the freedom of humanity or optimistic her slave masters would prevail once and for all I am not sure....
               </p>
               <p>
                That was enough for me....my favorite and very famous author coming clean....I knew it was all real.  I have been on a crash course in Conspiracy and MKULTRA and Rothschild shit ever since.....frankly they have their hands in every corner of our world....every corner....
               </p>
               <p>
                They have committed crimes for which we can never forgive them...crimes of which they have forefitted their right to live among us any longer.....crimes for which they will reap the whirlwind.  I am ready...and if the mob ever develops....I will be ready to do my part in freeing us......if we ever take the gloves off......we wont have enough lamp post to hang them all.

              There was a time that I dreamed of Hillary becoming the first woman president. That was a long time ago, and now it feels like a hundred years ago, but if I could get red pilled then I know almost anyone else can too. My hope has been that when people who know me see ME posting Pizzagate info and anti-MSM and anti-HRC comments that might make them stop and think a little more. And when they freak out after the truth emerges, they'll know they can talk to me about it because I already had my freak out.

               Thank you for this post. This, ultimately, isn't about Trump or whether we agree with all of his policies. He is far from perfect. But what we are going against is something so evil, that what we need are people who are willing to fight it. Trump might be an egomaniac as he is portrayed. Maybe that is true. But if he is willing to stand up against a power structure that is run by trafficking children, I don't care about the political differences I have with him.

               I've watched this play out for a long time.  The Clintons have been in the public spotlight for decades.  I'm glad you have had a change o heart, but I am curious: What made you a HRC supporter?  Were you just unaware of her/their history and received no information inside your media bubble?

               I don't mean that in a denigrating way.  I'm trying to understand the psychology and what helped you change.

                Excellent question. It's been important for me to understand the answer to it because it helps reduce my frustration with those who still support her. (And I'll pause right here to say that Pizzagate affects ALL political parties/politicians, etc.) Just because I woke up sooner than them doesn't make them bad people. And some may never wake up. My mother will probably live in denial until her final moments.

                I was naive to think of it as Us (Democrats) versus Them (Republicans). I've since learned that The Powers That Be want people to be divided as much as possible. That way we don't outnumber them and are less likely to demand justice. They encourage division between genders, sports teams, races, countries, sexual orientation, and political parties. In realizing this, it formed one of the first cracks in my mind of good/bad political parties.

                When a friend told me that HRC was a pedo and Satanic worshipper I wrote him off as a paranoid right-wing conspiracy nut. Every time he posted something, I researched it just to see for myself and offer a different perspective. But I have an open mind and the more I researched, the more I saw that he was right. I also thought back to when I had met HRC for an event at my workplace. This was before she became a senator. Bill was president. Hillary had more secret service agents than her husband. She came across as nothing less than a cold bitch who despised the little people around her and resented this "dog and pony show." But a child killer? I wasn't ready for that yet.

                You spoke of the media bubble. That was a huge part of it. I vaguely knew that America's media were biased, and had been informed by a few friends that even mainstream European news sources such as the BBC were less biased than CNN, FOX, etc. But now I began to test that. And I continue to do that. And consistently I find that not only do our MSM sources present biased stories, more importantly, they often don't report at all. Those are lies by omission. And that pisses me off.
               </p>
               <p>
                When I pulled up to the polling station in November to cast my vote, I had tears in my eyes because here was the moment I'd dreamed of so many years before-- I had the opportunity to vote for Hillary as our country's first woman president. And there was no fucking way I was going to do that. At that point, I'd done enough research to know that the Clinton Foundation was corrupt as hell. Was on the fence about HRC and her part in Pizzagate. But then, in the months following the election, as I researched more and more and more... Let's just say that if videos surfaced of her, Bill, any of the Bushes, and/or so many others engaged in raping a child, killing the child, and eating their organs, it would. not. surprise. me. one. bit.

                In fact, I expect it.

                 Wow.  I thank you for your honest response.  It is a very difficult process for many.  I think when the investigations (which seem to be opening up left and right) hit critical mass it is going to be a brutal pill for people to swallow.  I have relatives who will not be able to get their heads around what is going on.  I'm not sure what will happen,  There are going to be a lot of "mental illness" related events.

                  I truly believe that each of us will receive at least one brutal pill to swallow-- even those who are way more awake than myself. The reason for my thinking is that the more I research, the more I'm led to believe that humanity has been utterly deceived from the very beginning. And so any "reality" we've clung to as individuals will be yanked from beneath us. But after we move through that awakening, we'll be free at last.
