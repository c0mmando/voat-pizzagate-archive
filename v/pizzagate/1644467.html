            This was leaked by FBI or NSA as a warning. Or it could be the penalty Podesta gets for missing a blackmail payment he might be tapped out low on funds. It also sounds like Anthony Weiner. Definite a New York accent there. Whoever the audio is now knows they are in real trouble. It's all good.

             yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  What is the history of the Skippy alter ego?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, under strain, voices will change.  I have to admit the more I hear comparisons, the more I think it does sound like him.  there is a flatness in the higher pitches that sounds very similar.  And also, in his normal speaking voice, Podesta doesn't really sould like a Chicagoan to me.   He sounds like an east coaster - how long has he lived on the E coast?  years?  decades?
            </p>
            <p>
             If this is a psy-op to link Podesta to terrifying shady material, it's working.  If it is a law enforcement leak, it's also working.

            This is an interesting find by a Voater from a while back.
           </p>
           <p>
            The encrypted files in the hidden area on the Comet Ping Pong computer (blackmail stash?) have dates on them.  Proof is shown.   In the Podesta emails, the dates on two of the files match up with two times Podesta was going to spend time with Alefantis.  Proof provided.
No joke.

            EDIT:  I have been informed that this claim and the screenshot of files has been questioned and considered debunked by mods here.

            I can say that whenever we get into these files at the CPP computer, things get controversial.

             The time/date stamp of screenshoted files is intricately debunked

            <li>
             The CPP computer harddrive reportedly has a bullet put through it during the shooter incident.

            <li>
             The "Father" audio files are reportedly a leak from this computer
            </li>
            <li>
             The Reddit group investigating pizzagate was banned as they reportedly closed in on these files as well.
            </li>
            <li>
             Yesterday TitusFrost reported that there was CP on this computer which was in the possession of hackers and the DC police, who had not yet moved forward in their investigation, so he went public with it.

            My theory:   I think the Screaming Child video for lack of a better title implicates SOMEONE who is going to hear that this video is online and people are listening to it all over the place and talking and writing and wondering about it.   It may be J. Podesta, it may be another person in the pedo cartel.   It is a warning.   Now the perp "Perpesta" knows that this evidence is out there, there is probably a whole lot more and someone Perpesta doesn't know and doesn't trust has it.  I think this is a leak that was designed to instill fear in Perpesta and others connected to them that the gig is up - but when?   I don't know, but it is supposed to work every last nerve they have left, make them jumpy, fearful and make it hard to know what to do, so that they will make moves and make mistakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think this was leaked for no reason all over our forums and boards and I'm not just talking Voat.  There was a reason, and I think law enforcement did it.  We are the audience, but no the target.   The target is the perp and his cohorts.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what we do is keep passing it around and talking about it, and do what we can to trace it.  What we do is not let it be a five second thing that dies because of 24 hours what's next mentality.  This should be passed and shared to everyone and anyone with warnings.  Not everybody even needs to listen to it, but everyone should know about it and where to find it.  This was most likely a sanitized leak, the real file has actual video, and shows Perpesta's face, as well as deeds, and Perpesta knows it.  These deeds are getting exposed to the world, and this is just the first shot across the bow.

             The Reddit guy #2 from We The Pizza USB hack, said he had a video among all they took on the USB or cloud hack of Podesta raping a young child.  I never saw that one and I don't think it was posted on Reddit, however guy #2 said it looked and sounded like him.  Not torture but CP.

              I would not be a very surprised person at all if it turned out that was absolutely true.  I hope the hackers that are going to be involved with this take every step to protect themselves and their families.  I am so grateful to them and for their mothers and fathers too for raising them to be honest and to be heroes for the powerless and voiceless.  We have to keep in mind that aside from villians, this whole thing has revealed a lot of heroic people too, men and women.

             I get what you are saying.  I was skeptical about it being pushed at first.  But I'm starting to think that law enforcement may be behind these leaks, showing the perps a taste of what they have on them.  It may be a softening exercise to instill fear and panic as arrests go down and people with knowledge start to be pressured to confess and give evidence for plea bargains.

             Or maybe I have an active imagination!  lol

            The "father" video looks like it's happening at either Comet after-hours in the stage area or in a basement, and the kid sounds like she's in a cage, this is also undeniably Podesta's voice. The kid is screaming "John", not "Darren". The "John" is stretched out because of the kid's accent and how hysterically terrified she is, accentuated more by uncontrollable crying. This is exactly how kids scream people's name when they're hysterical. This video is a smoking gun and has been leaked for a reason. Wake the fuck up people

            This and everything else is being released in a concerted effort by the fbi.  They are doing it for a reason.  So the public is aware and puts pressure on those at the top.  It is the lower tier fbi leaking in disgust.

             You could be right. Do you think the arrest of Sandusky could be them sending a message for those at the top.

              Absolutely. A complete investigation was never done on the charity and many accusations were never looked into.
             </p>
             <p>
              Arresting him is national news. Everyone knows and believes what happened there. It is a damn good way to get a message across.

             <p>
              If it turns out info was ignored and not imvestigated, it forces their hand to act.

             It has been reported according to online comments, but so what, let's report it in droves.  An avalanche of reporting it.

              Thanks, I was attacked on twitter for saying the same.  It's good to feel one is not alone in their opinion.  And complacency is evil.  I think I was attacked for advocating the FBI reporting.

               attacked for wanting to report?   ridiculous.   If you look at my new comment here, you'll see my rational.  This is meant to be out and be talked about.  I think it it meant to drive the person in the video, who KNOWS who they are, nuts that it is all over the place online.
