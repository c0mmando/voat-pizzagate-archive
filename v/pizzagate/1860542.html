            And thus you have exhausted all your proof texts concerning any scripture teaching SEEMINGLY favoring celibacy. I could counter but I wont't.
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay just a bit ... "it is better to marry than to burn." "Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Of COURSE it is priests that aren't allowed to marry, which has led to a multitude of sin and corruption within the whore church of Babylon. This is by design.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Jesus did not marry." Because he was deity, you should know that. Western civilization is founded on marriage and family. The overwhelming amount of admonitions and instructions and teachings strewn throughout both Old and NT show this.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             You should really read your Bible instead of repeating libelous nonsense about the Church founded by Christ.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You have no idea who you're talking to, I'm a reformed armchair theologian and apologist. I could run circles around you, esp concerning the Roman apostate church.
           </p>
           <p>
            It should be glaringly obvious who and what they are, the proof is in the pudding. Ditto for Joel Osteen and all the other false prophets out there, who make merchandise of men's souls.

            But the whole RC system is a perversion of Christianity (esp not allowing men to marry which only tends to no good to put it mildly).

            The heterodox were even invented by Jews for their own purposes. Orthodox Christianity is the only original Christian faith.

            John Calvin (real name: Cohen) was kicked out of France because he was a sadistic homosexual pedophile, not because of his "religious doctrines". Melancthon was a Jew. Luther was financed by the Medicis (the Rothschilds of their day).

            There have at least 150 Jewish Popes, many of whom were not even priests. All of them were warlords. since when does a church need a central bank, BTW?

            Ratzinger, back when he was a cardinal,  was the author of an RC canon silencing victims of clergy abuse:

            I didn't realise he had said this, thanks for posting.  Although not surprising, it can be regarded as nothing other than significant and further confirmation that he's a total fraud and agent of the Illuminati.

            He is correct. Don't get me wrong, the Church should know better, but concern about child abuse, including child sexual abuse, is a fairly recent phenomenon.  Russ Cheit goes into a bit of detail about this in his Witch Hunt Narrative, as does Philip Jenkins in his Decade of Nightmares.

             Jesus was always concerned about child abuse. Anyone who (blasphemously) calls himself the 'holy father' should uphold that, regardless of "the times."

            From what I have read the Catholic Church has been compromised.  If so this is BAD because religion is one of the greatest weapons against this satanic bullshit.

             It's always funny when I see right-wing Christians bickering and making all these distinctions between Catholics, Protestants and even Eastern Orthodox.

             To liberals/leftists and even many centrists, they see all these denominations as simply different flavors of the same turd sandwich lmfao!

             They already assume that the average priest/pastor is a molester.
