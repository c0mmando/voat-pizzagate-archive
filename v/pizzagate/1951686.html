<pre><code>  What and who is the IRC? 
</code></pre>

<p>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is a global (NGO)nongovernmental organization consisting of first responders, humanitarian relief workers, international development experts, health care providers, and educators.The International Rescue Committee responds to the world\'s worst humanitarian crises, helping to restore health, safety, education, economic wellbeing and power to people devastated by conflict and disaster.
The President of the International Rescue Committee is former British Foreign Secretary David Miliband who was one of the first refugee advocates to say the U.S. needed to take 65,000 Syrians, then upped his demands to 100,000 over two years.   IRC is building “communities within communities” in 26 places in the US.

<p>According to a report on the IRC from Root Cause, a non-profit research and consulting firm, published in the Independent, only 14 percent of its funding came from private sources. Government grants and contracts, in contrast, accounted for 44 percent, foreign government grants and contracts 27 percent and 11 percent from UN agency grants and contracts</p>

<p>‘The IRC has annual revenue of more than $562 million and $378 million of that came from government grants, according to its most recent Form 990 filed with the IRS.
That means IRC gets 67 percent of its budget funded by taxpayers in the U.S. and U.K.
In November 2013, Miliband’s organization gave billionaire George Soros its highest award, the Freedom Award, and Soros responded by donating $1 million to the IRC.</p>

<pre><code> Summary
</code></pre>

<p>The International Rescue Committee is an international elite and fraudulent organization, with many ties to the Clintons, (who incidentally have strong ties to a domestic transport company), that relocates refugees, many women and children,  from chaotic regions in the world to various places in the United States at taxpayer’s expense.  As many others have said, they are doing it right under our noses and we are footing the bill.</p>

          <pre><code> Summary
</code></pre>
          <p>
           The International Rescue Committee is an international elite and fraudulent organization, with many ties to the Clintons, (who incidentally have strong ties to a domestic transport company), that relocates refugees, many women and children,  from chaotic regions in the world to various places in the United States at taxpayer’s expense.  As many others have said, they are doing it right under our noses and we are footing the bill.

            Thank you for this post.
I read about Chris Cornell's  untimely death.
Did a little research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saw him on one of his last interviews.
           </p>
           <p>
            The interviewer asked a question.
(About his song The Promise)
           </p>
           <p>
            "Yes, I am donating the proceeds that I receive from this song
to The International Rescue Committee."
Chris answered.

            Some history on the IRC:

             In 1942, the Emergency Rescue Committee and the American branch of the European-based International Relief Association joined forces under the name the International Relief and Rescue Committee, which was later shortened to the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The IRC is a leading nonsectarian, nongovernmental international relief and development organization that still operates today.

             </a>
             In July 1933, a committee of 51 prominent American intellectuals, artists, clergy, and political leaders formed a branch of the International Relief Association in New York, at the request of its chief, German-born physicist Albert Einstein. Among them were the philosopher John Dewey, the writer John Dos Passos, and the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Other prominent citizens, even including Eleanor Roosevelt, soon joined the effort.

            IRC mentioned in regards to helping the Lost Boys of Sudan
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 2001, as part of a program established by the United States Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), approximately 3800 Lost Boys were allowed to resettle in the United States.[8] They are now scattered over at least 38 cities.[1] Halted after 9/11 for security reasons, the program restarted in 2004. As of 2006, the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States is in Omaha, Nebraska, which hosts about 7,000 people.[10] Numerous resettlement agencies, such as Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services, the IRC (International Rescue Committee), World Relief and others assisted in the resettlement process. A variety of programs have been initiated to help these displaced people, in areas of education, medical assistance, reconnecting with families in South Sudan and in rebuilding efforts and providing humanitarian aid in Southern Sudan.

             Abramowitz played a leading role in the foundation of the International Crisis Group, and has been a board member since its inception in 1995.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1991, Morton Abramowitz was named the seventh president of the Endowment. Abramowitz, previously a State Department official, focused the Endowment's attention on Russia in the post-Soviet era.[7] In this spirit, the Carnegie Endowment opened the Carnegie Moscow Center in 1994 as a home of Russian scholar-commentators.[13]

            </p>
            <p>
             The International Crisis Group was founded after a chance meeting in January 1993 between former US diplomat and then-President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Morton I. Abramowitz and then future World Bank Vice-President Mark Malloch Brown on a flight to Sarajevo.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             The international community's difficulty in responding to the Bosnian War provided the catalyst for "an independent organisation that would serve as the world’s eyes and ears on the ground in countries in conflict while pressing for immediate action."[2] George Soros was involved in discussions early on and provided seed money.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             Disaster relief specialist Fred Cuny made significant contributions to disaster relief in Bosnia, and was brought on board later that year, though participation was cut short by his death in 1995.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             In November 1994, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace announced plans for Crisis Group, while former Congressman Stephen J. Solarz toured foreign capitals to promote the new organisation and raise funds, gaining early support from Martti Ahtisaari (President of Finland), Gareth Evans (Foreign Minister of Australia) and Bernard Kouchner (founder of Médecins Sans Frontières and future French Foreign Minister).[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             A January 1995 meeting in London brought many international figures together, and approved a proposal for an annual budget of $8m and 75 full-time staff. In mid-1995 it was formally registered in the US as a tax-exempt non-profit organisation.[2] From 1996 to 1999, Crisis Group had an annual budget of around $2m and around 20 full-time staff; by 2008 its budget was $15m.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             Following the death of its first president, Nicholas Hinton, in January 1997 and his replacement by Alain Destexhe, Crisis Group moved its headquarters from London to Brussels.[2] Destexhe resigned in October 1999 and was replaced by Gareth Evans, with Martti Ahtisaari becoming Chairman both from the beginning of 2000.[2][page needed] Louise Arbour became president in July 2009,[2] succeeded in September 2014 by Jean-Marie Guéhenno.[3]

            I have more on Morton I. Abramowitz that includes, which deserves it's own submission I think, so as not to drift too far off the topic of this thread.

Seems like he is trying to straighten this Country out, but after all the facts you researchers have found...just hoping and praying that there are a few good men and women in Government.

             I feel your pain but trump doesn't give a flying f.  He doesn't appear to be into SRA (so far) but he's shown some real issues with Ivanka.  Search trump ivanka disturbing pictures/like ivanaka basically doing a lap dance on dear ol'dad.  Very disturbing pictures of the two of them while she was still a child.  Research his connection to various mafia's and his whore of babylon wife whose official WH portrait sports a 25K blood diamond courtesy of one of his mafia connections.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wanted to believe too...hoping against hope that at his age he had some kind of epiphany and decided to do some good to make up for all the bad/but nope.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is responsible for many civilian deaths in the ME...many/not just Syria/and many of those deaths are children.  He's corrupt thru and thru...sadly.

              While I agree that Trump may not have our interests at heart, I completely disagree about the photos being disturbing. A loving father daughter relationship can look like that. The photo of her "lap dancing" was at a concert and she's sort of leaning as if she's swaying to the music. Lap dance is so much of an exaggeration. It appears as if there wasn't much seating available and she's sitting on his right leg, not even his entire lap. 
However, I say that and then say that him arranging for Michael Jackson to see her dance in a play is disturbing. But maybe that was before so much came out about him.

               I don't think they have a master plan.  I don't think any of them are intelligent enough to have one.  They are bought and paid for and do as they are told.  They follow the plan laid out for them, not make one.  They are all reaping financial windfalls from this presidency.  They hob nob with leaders of slave mentality countries, send US troops to fight Israel's wars, waste money on bombs while ppl here suffer and that's just for starters.  The game plan has not changed, just a little behind what Killary would have done sooner.  He would not have been allowed to become prez if the deep state did not think he could be controlled.  He's a  B grade actor who is playing his part.  Family dynamics are twisted at best.  The trump family is about money and power, that's it.
              </p>
              <p>
               This from someone who gave them every benefit of the doubt and at one time thought trump was sincere.  This from someone who made excuses when his cabinet started filling up with globalist neocons.  Even if he did not have an epiphany (which was my hope) I, along with some friends, thought he is such a megalomaniac narcissist he would do the 'right' thing bc he craves praise and adoration and wants his children to inherit the trump name in a positive light as his legacy .  Boy was I naive.
              </p>
              <p>
               But dwelling on the past never accomplishes anything.  Looking for the positive in all of this...if trump had done the right thing it would only have empowered the radical throat cutting right   This way ppl get to suffer more, see more clearly that it's all propaganda and perhaps in their misery they will be more open to the truth of the matrix.  When ppl struggle for basic survival they are less inclined to hold on to sacred cows.  They become open to new information in a way they were not before.
              </p>
              <p>
               As it stands the radical neocon right and radical neocon left are in a tailspin (the left being in the lead but the right will catch up) and from that chaos and misery new understandings can emerge.  It just might be why more ppl are becoming open to the likes of pg and more.  It will take awhile before the full brunt of misery flowers but it will.  Everything I read on policy agenda spells an ever increasing austerity and sacrifice of the average maxed out person with subjugation under a police state.  That's the good news.  When ppl are fat and satisfied they tend to stay status quo.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other positive about trump is he is a wild hair and blurts out whatever idiodic thought rumbles thru the empty halls called his mind.  Killary was more seasoned politician...you know the public vs private persona.  Trump what you see is what you get lol.  Bragging about eating the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake while killing innocent ppl at the very same moment.  He's a sociopath for sure/not sure if he's to the level of psychopathy of Killary...time will tell on that one.
              </p>
              <p>
               I still can't see him into SRA but honestly at this point nothing would surprise me.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another promising sign is the Balkan states have told the EU to shove it and not taking any more migrants.  They say these are not refugees/they are migrants and they come to destroy our countries and guess what, we aren't going to let that happen.  They are putting up boarders of razor wire and electric fence with signs in Arabic no less.  The EU is furious...but...but...you have to do as we say, it's the law.  Their reply...maybe it's time to leave the EU and join the other team.  This would have the NWO in a scramble.  Push ppl far enough where they have nothing left to lose and amazing things start to happen.  The only other time the US had this astrological config was the Ame Revolution and the Civil War.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's not going to be the same boring dutifully trudging along into hell that has been the norm.  Hold on for the ride, thrills, chills and surprises.  It's the Matrix Reality Show, bad crisis actors and all.

Thank you for sending this. We had some across this organization awhile back, but taking a fresh look at the Board, we are seeing more connections than before. This is absolutely a cover organization with many overlapping players in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. The World Bank is a primary hub involved at many levels in particular. Also in recent news Conrad Hilton donated millions to this and other groups including Save the Children.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are doing the same thing in Racine. They started The Fight to End Exploitation. Everyone involved is part of the circle of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It is linked to both the Clinton and MCain Foundations as well as Ashton Kutcher. They are using these groups to control the investigations.

            This is great research. These cards are the EID's better known as RFID's they changed a letter to throw off everyone's research. These are also better known as chips and are placed in vehicles, products, wallets, ID, cards, &amp; yes implants under the skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            A persons entire ID, medical history, genome, can be placed on a chip computerized then marketed if so desired.

            You don't believe it? George Soros,HRC, Podesta's, &amp; their friends the Rothschilds were all in charge and pushing all of this. Do you think these characters care about the poor refugees? They actually gave George Soros the Medal of Freedom Award....

              I am here.  This is amazing research.  Pretty scary stuff, imo.  All you have to do is look at the names involved and it is a dead give away as to how corrupt this is.  More Laundering. That is the key.  The Laundering.  They are doing that in many different ways.

            The fact that we are paying for the abuse is known.

            They hijacked govt positions, re directed the money to pay their way and put judges in positions to protect everything by way of the judicial branch.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know when it started as I'm not an expert on that but Bill Clinton's regime made a lot of progress in that direction.
           </p>

            Hillary would have put this country over the edge.
