             How realistic do you think that video is? I hadn't seen it until after election night, but if I had seen it before the Podesta emails and everything, it would have got me to thinking an awful lot about what you could do with that sort of technique and where it might be in operation... I sure never would have thought of it on my own.

            This is from 2014? They preemptively knew to mock us, in 2014? Impossible. They must have thought it would be so absurd to us that we would laugh. You sure this is from 2014?

            Trevor Moore is a confusing character in terms of who's side he's on.
           </p>
           <p>
            He'll make something like this:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/OOCdIY_HKM4">
             https://youtu.be/OOCdIY_HKM4
            </a>
            where he's basically telling children how to get high
           </p>
           <p>
            And then something like this:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/exnaY0l4XsM">
             https://youtu.be/exnaY0l4XsM
            </a>
            where he's a)calling for an uprising against the elite and b) has a child specifically call for the murder of the president (who I believe was Obama when this came out)
           </p>
           <p>
            also, if you can deal with the cringe this song induces, it's pretty redpilled:

            Forgot about this one, aimed at the pope:

            That this is official CC material from 2014 shows they were trying to desensitize the masses to the truth so there wouldn't be backlash when it finally wakes up in the conciousness of the majority of people. They use humor so you do nothing.

            Could be double/triple disinfo to distract. Let us all remember, continually, how much cash these freaks have on hand. That being said, the Saudi Royal family was started by a Pharisee from Baghdad, Iraq. He stole the bedouins land in what is now known as Saudi Arabia, with a plan. He had help in that plan from the others,and it still plays out in the middle east. The royal family is not muslim. Beheadings are increasing every year even though they are on the council of humanities.

             Trevor Moore is redpilled as shit. I'm too lazy to link videos right now but he's got others. He knows. Look up WKUK Illuminati.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is rumored to have gotten an "offer" from higher ups and refused, causing the cancellation and discontinuation of WKUK. But that's just hearsay. The illuminati video supposedly came out of that, but then again, difficult to know how it got aired if that's the case.

            Catchy tune.  Amazing, so before it’s time.  Almost prophetic.
I also like his tune “kitty history.”  Full of teachable moments for the homeschool child. 💕

            So what page are we on here? Like, is trevor in on it and mocking us or is he trying to warn everyone through comedy?

            The coincidences in those lyrics are too many.

            I want to lean on the side of him trying to warn everyone because I can't honestly believe that he would be in on it but then again you never know.
