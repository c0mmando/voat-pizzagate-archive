The World of Wonder channel on June 28, premiered the perverse cartoon series using the world\'s most recognized drag queen, RuPaul, as a voiceover for one of the characters.</p>
<p>The first one,&quot;Drag Tots,&quot; features the cast of RuPaul\'s &quot;Drag Race.&quot;  The trailer aired in May featuring a voiceover claiming:
&quot;In a world on the brink of chaos, where fear is the rule of the land, the voices of a generation have banded together to give our planet what it needs...baby drag queens!&quot;

<p>And, just a few days ago, July 12, RuPaul\'s &quot;Drag Race&quot; scored 12 Emmy nominations.  It already received 4 Emmy wins in the past.  Drag Race is an American reality competition TV series which documents RuPaul in the search for &quot;America\'s next drag superstar.&quot;

<p>Next, there is Desmond Napoles (AKA Desmond Is Amazing), from Brooklyn,who turned 11-years old last month.  His website states that he is a performer, drag kid, awarded LGBTQ advocate, outspoken gay youth, editorial model, public speaker,  founder of his own drag house, fashion designer, muse, and icon.

He has already been profiled in &quot;Vogue,&quot; has 65,000 Instagram followers, and has appeared on talk shows and alongside his idol, RuPaul.  His parents just want their son &quot;to be happy.&quot;</p>
<p>Desmond set-up the first ever drag club for children called, &quot;Haus of Amazing&quot; that was officially announced on Instagram last October.

<p>An interesting article appeared today in &quot;WND Politics&quot; concerning the LGBTQ+/Pedophile Revolution that focuses on academia perspectives.  Some highlights:
The underlying assumption that has led to the the increasing legitimization of same-sex marriage is now fueling a growing effort in academic circles to mainstream pedophilia.  Once considered taboo, psychologists are beginning to walk down the same path.  LGBT activists established and insisted more than 50 years ago that pedophilia is an inborn &quot;sexual orientation,&quot; and not a learned behavior.  If people are born with a sexual attraction to minors, the argument goes, their &quot;orientation&quot; should be accepted as normative and not stigmatized.</p>
<p>James Cantor, Ph.D, a clinical psychologist in the Law and Mental Health Program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Canada and an assistant professor  in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of  Toronto, is regarded internationally as a leading &quot;sexologist&quot; studying pedophilia.  He says his research concludes that pedophiles share distinct characteristics of &quot;brain wiring.&quot;  He contends some 1-5% of all men are predisposed to be primarily attracted to children.</p>
<p>In a NYT report on Cantor\'s work in December 2017, reporter Laura Kane noted pedophilia &quot;has been widely viewed as a psychological disorder triggered by early childhood trauma.&quot; However, she wrote, many experts now &quot;see it as a biologically rooted condition that does not change - like a sexual orientation - thanks largely to a decade of research by Dr. James Cantor.&quot;</p>
<p>Last fall, the American Psychological Association caused an uproar when the latest edition of the DSM-5 called pedophilia a &quot;sexual orientation.&quot;  After inquiries from news organizations, the APA issued a &quot;correction&quot; stating &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is not a term &quot;used in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorders.&quot;</p>
<p>In a speech at a meeting of the Association for the Treatment of Sex Abusers, Cantor traced the idea that pedophilia is a characteristic of the brain, to the work of Richard von Krafft-Ebing, an Austro-German psychiatrist.  Krafft-Ebing\'s book, &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis,&quot; first published in 1886, defined various sexual practices, including homosexuality, bisexuality, amd pedophilia as pathologies determined by a mental state that ultimately traced to a brain disorder.</p>
<p>Cantor rejects Krafft-Ebing\'s moral judgment and defines various &quot;paraphilia&quot; behaviors as sexual inclinations caused by observable differences in brain structures and functioning, which he calls &quot;brain wiring.&quot;</p>
<p>Cantor\'s research team conducts experiments with convicted sex offenders.  The men are shown nude images of children and adults of various sexes while a device (a much disputed device) measures blood flow to their penises.  This method, called phallometry, was invented by  Kurt Freund (a Czech-Canadian physician and sexologist) in the 1950\'s.  Cantor said it accurately measures sexual interests in 90% of men.
He continues in the article to promote more of his junk-science and opinions.</p>
<p>Judith Reisman an American conservative author (best known for her criticism and condemnation of Alfred Kinsey), wrote in her 2010 book, &quot;Sexual Sabotage:&quot;
Our laws are no longer based on Judeo-Christian morality, but on Kinsey\'s immoral &quot;morality: an alduterous, fornicating, aborting, pornography-addicted, masturbating, impotent, sadistic, masochistic, bisexual, homosexual, exhibitionist, voyeuristic, and child-sexual-abusive world.&quot;            WOW!</p>
<p>Reisman continues:
&quot;These truths are difficult to accept, yet crucial.  Americnas must come to understand what has gone wrong and how we changed from a family-oriented and flawed, but honorable country, to a sex-obsessed and violent one.&quot;</p>
<p>WND Managing Editor, David Kupelian, in his 2005 bestseller, &quot;The Marketing of Evil,&quot; warned that pedophilia was the next sexual behavior the political left would try to normalize.</p>
<p>In October of last year, WND columnist, Matt Barger, wrote about efforts by progressives to roll back laws against pedophilia.  Barber recalled that 2 years earlier, he attended a conference by the pedophile group B4U-ACT.  Dr. Fred Berlin of Johns Hopkins gave the keynote address, opening with: &quot;I want to completely support the goal of B4U-ACT.&quot;  Among the assertions made at the conference were that pedophiles are &quot;unfairly stigmatized and demonized&quot; by society; children &quot;are not inherently unable to consent&quot; to sex with an adult; and an adult\'s desire to have sex with children is &quot;normative.&quot;</p>
<p>Barger said a consensus belief by 2 speakers and pedophiles in attendance, was that because it villifies &quot;minor-attracted persons,&quot; pedophilia should be removed as a mental disorder from the APA\'s DSM-5 in the same manner homosexuality was removed in 1973.

            The main weapon used by our managed media and government to force this degradation on our society has been the politically expedient lie of "Born that way." If you want to know what causes homosexuality and by extension pedophilia (according to "science") then this is a very good summary of the secular research:

            There is a very good best selling Aussie history book on the founding of Australia, describing the prison colonies using letters sent home by inmates and officials. The early penal colonies were eventually shut down as they became an embarrassment to Britain, being seen as a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah, with 60% of inmates (both men and womens camps) involved in that terrible practice. Obviously there is no genetic link between homosexuality (or pedophilia) and criminality. It was circumstance and an unnatural environment that lead to that situation. When the colonies were shut down, the "homosexuals" stopped doing it.

            Romans 1:18 onwards describes a downward moral spiral linking homosexuality to many things that modern social research has shown are indeed closely statistically related. (including murder and recruitment). It rings true to conscience.

            If the political fiction of "born that way" is explained to the public, then all the arguments for homosexuality, pedophilia, bestiality, incest etc that are emerging now politically and in the media are wiped away. The government and media paint homosexuality and now pedophilia as an exclusive thing. But in fact 95% of homosexuals are not heterosexual virgins. Any sex can provide a thrill, and any bad habit, especially a sexual one, can become an obsession. For those caught up in it, its more a case of what sex is easiest to get.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people promoting homosexuality / pedophilia and other things besides now, believe in evolution. If these practices really were in the genes, and really were exclusive, not just going after any sex they can get, then these behaviours would disappear in one generation. Such behaviour is learned, and those behind the agenda know that, hence the massive recruitment drive to get the young involved in it.

            These perverts are biological outliers, they are "biofreaks" . We cannot kill them off , of course , like animals do when they produce a defective offspring but they must be contained. No one has the right to his or her sexual inborn traits  that pose a threat to our children.

            You won't stop it but you can limit it so your own kids won't be raped. The parents of kids like Desmond will be happy to let him go to adult gay sex parties probably starting next year when he's 12 same with other parents of trans kids they will feel compelled to let their kids "be happy" and that will be that. You can only keep your own kids from being exposed to the garbage that Netflix and Ru Paul are making a lot of money from showing.

            It just occurred to me the other day -- a subcurrent of this...while this is bad on its own, TPTB are using it to work up to babies, toddler girls, and young girls being in full makeup and sketchy clothes.   Off of the beauty pageant stage, and in everyday life, I mean.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Huffington Post blogger was already cheerleading for young girls to wear full adult makeup, in 2017.
