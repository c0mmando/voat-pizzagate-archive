            I totally like your thinking on this and this thinking outside the box direction. What if WE  simply take over the tired old tried and true war cry of the Left:
           </p>
           <h1>
            SaveTheChildren
           </h1>
           <p>
            Nothing would infuriate them more and it's very accurate. If we say "War on Children" then our opponents will quickly turn it into "Damn Right Wing War On Children". No, simply steal Save The Children from the left and have the most accurate meme and rub it in their fucking faces on the left.

            Totally agree. I would take it a step further. This is a Global Crusade for which there is no defense from our political and combat enemies.
           </p>

            Whether or not this is a Left-Right issue, and it's not. It's also not an exclusively gay thing. If we're not operating in facts and truth then it backfires. Any true researcher and subject matter expert knows that heteros are also involved. Fathers molest their children. Mothers, siblings, relatives also molest children. Its becomes criminal when an adult is involved as opposed to children playing. But we're most concerned with the elites. Those of power, wealth and influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plenty of RINOs are evil fucks to include
            <em>
             some
            </em>
            Bible Thumpers. Not all but they are out there and there was a horrific pedo church case in Louisiana.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that pedophiles lean more to the Democrat-Leftist side because the entertainment industry-government-media complex is the core culture and pipeline.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, let the chips fall on any Republicans that went down this road, as they will.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the "step further" This is OUR Social Justice Warrior cause that trumps all others. And call ourselves that, the NEW Social Justice Warriors to rub it in their faces. Because this IS a catagory of "Social" (society) Justice. And there's no defense to it. We can use it as a political vehicle to drive nearly every other issue and beat the opposition like a Red Headed Step Child. Ugg...bad metaphore! Strike that from our vernacular from now on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, this is the ultimate Moral High Ground. It Infuriates the Entertainment Industry types that WE have "Captured The Mountain" of moral smugness, certitude, Devine Righteousness, etc. And we should wear it as a badge of TRUE honor. This makes them so jealous and out of their minds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite our chortling triumph and already winning victories, the true issue is an unmitigated horror to the innocent, defenseless victims and could bring down major govenments and end in wars and public mass executions of the worst of the elite. The "Soros types" comes to mind...

            Just use multiple different hashtags. Rebranding is known divide and conquer tactic, people need to stop advocating it.

             I can see how rebranding might be a detriment in some cases but I don't think so here. It's not accurate and I think it does more harm than good when trying to educate people about it but I suppose at this point it might be out of our control anyway. I'm sure the last thing the MSM will do is focus on the children.
