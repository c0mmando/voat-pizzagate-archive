<p>Desmond is Amazing alleged abuse deemed &quot;unfounded&quot; by CPS. YouTuber filed a report against famous child drag star\'s parents.</p>
<p>Young drag artist Desmond is Amazing (Desmond Napoles), 11, was the subject of a New York Administration of Children\'s Services (ACS) investigation reveals his official page. The pint-sized entertainer and his family were recently under the eye of conservative YouTuber AnnaMae Renee who uploaded a video called &quot;Desmond is in Danger&quot; in January in which she accused his mother Wendy of perpetuating his career for &quot;sick reasons.&quot; Renee\'s damning charge against Wendy is that she is a stage mother who forces her son into LGBT advocacy by making him do drag entertainment purely for her own monetary gain and vicariousness.</p>
<p>The allegations get worse as the video wears on, including personal assertions against his mother by Renee of drug abuse, cavorting with a convicted killer and bad parenting. Renee took her attack on the family even further by admitting in a follow-up video saying she called the ACS on the Napoles\', which subsequently sparked an investigation. But Desmond fired back at his accuser on Saturday in a series of social media updates. The posts, using Desmond\'s name in the third person (and the pronouns &quot;he&quot; and &quot;we&quot;), conveyed that investigators made both announced and unannounced visits to his home and school. The investigation even made its way up to the Governor\'s office.</p>
<p>That\'s not all. The family was examined by the &quot;NYPD, the Child Advocacy Center, the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Department of Labor, and the District Attorney\'s office.&quot; The post adds: &quot;No abuse or maltreatment was found.&quot; And there were &quot;No violations as a child performer.&quot; Screenshots of the &quot;Child Abuse and Maltreatment Register&quot; were posted in which they say reports of abuse were &quot;unfounded.&quot;

<p>“ACS has investigated us thoroughly,” the mother continued. “Because of the number of reports they received, our case went all the way to the Governor\'s office. We had announced visits &amp; unannounced visits to our home nearly daily &amp; at all hours &amp; Desmond\'s school. Our family was probed more intensely than any other case before. All allegations were ‘unfounded’. … On the plus side, ACS has been offering us many support services.”</p>

<p>Nothing was found to support abuse. How many of you wanna bet this is a cover up?</p>
<p>There\'s literal photos and the family openly having the kid stripping in a gay bar for money. There is no fucking way that isn\'t breaking some CP laws. Who are these people, i.e. beyond random degenerates, and who the fuck are they connected to? Or is simply that the big LGBTQP normalisation push is so close to happening now that CPS won\'t get involved in something so public?</p>

<p>This is hell.</p>
<p>Here is the person that called the police on them. I saw the video a few days ago and the IG post attacking the CPS caller.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/JxdvOLdG_34?t=88">Here is a video of this 11 year old talking about drugs - watch carefully.</a></p>
<p>This kid was &quot;hanging out&quot; with Michael Alig. This fucking guy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Alig">Read about the murder</a> </p>
<p>Speaking of Alig, shit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Kids">&quot;Club Kids&quot;</a> existed. There\'s a movie/doco on this called &quot;Party Monster&quot; with Mcaulay Caulkin in it. If i recall correctly, Desmond is Amazing did a webcam interview with one of the club kids and he appeared to be drugged.</p>
<p><a href="https://streamable.com/5juzp">100% this guy molests his son.</a> He has the quintessential pedophile starter pack.</p>
<p>You don\'t think the CPS is in on this shit? Do you know who Nancy Schaefer is? Let me preface this all with her story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout her career as an activist and politician, she was a champion of Christian conservative causes, opposing the department of Child Protective Services (a.k.a. Department of Children and Families). After four years of investigation, on November 16, 2007 she published a report entitled &quot;The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services&quot;. After publishing the report, in a press conference she exclaimed that the report caused her to lose her position as a Georgia State Senator. In addition, she stood firmly in her support of the Pro-Life agenda, and also opposed Gay marriage. In expressing her Christian beliefs she promoted the display of the Ten Commandments in public places. She was a senior official in the Baptist church, having served as a First Vice President of the Georgia Baptist Convention</p>
<p>Schaefer was found dead at her home in Turnerville, Georgia in Habersham County on 26 March 2010 with a single gunshot wound to her back along with her husband of 52 years, Bruce Schaefer who was found with a single gunshot wound to his chest. Police concluded the deaths to have been a murder–suicide perpetrated by her husband, but the motive for the murder was unclear and never established.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Schaefer">Source</a></p>
<p>DID YOU KNOW: the father of the Gay Rights Movement is a pedophile. <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/097111S.jpg">The LGBT+ is literally a front for pedophilia.</a></p>
<p>It is sad that we have fallen so far. When I was a kid my grandmother would always warn me about faggots and to be on the look out for \'dirty old men in trench coats\' and \'homosexual perverts\' and told me that faggots were all child molesters. This was a known FACT for thousands of years. It was common sense that faggot = pedo. Now we let these evil monsters molest children in the broad of day and we do nothing to stop them....it is sick.</p>
<p>We need a movement like Occupy Pedophilia in Russia.</p>',

            This Texas Bill tells us something.  Lawmakers are getting feedback and calls from their people.  They are demanding change because they have become  aware of the horrid job CPS is doing.  Keep up the good work.

            This is so fucking sad, that poor kid. His dad’s body language just screams pedo, and his mom has a severe case of Munchausen’s by proxy. It’s so obvious he’s drugged up to the eyeballs in the Michael Alig video. It’s so upsetting to watch these grown adults ruin an innocent child’s life in real time and not be able to do anything about it. These people shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near a kid.

            I agree almost with everything OP said apart form gay= paedo. That alone is so dumb that it puts a downer on anything OP said that is correct.
I really don't care about homos, as long as they shag only each other. 
Are there homo paedos? Absolutely, in the same way there are hetero paedos, but certainly not more. If we want to discuss this seriously you have to avoid coo coo god talk and 'playground science'.
I find it highly suspect that CPS didn't find anything. Kids have been taken from loving homes for being overweight here in the UK, yet a kid prancing around in front of adults [whatever their sexuality] is fine by them. 
They are of course in on the whole paedo business. CPS = free kids [to deliver]. It's a sham and a sex trafficking ring. Hence they can't make a precedence here.

             There is a DEFINITE place for pedos and that special tie in the homo world. Since the beginning of humankind. If you don't know that, you've been living under a rock.

            I am shocked CPS didn't do anything. People in the public realm can trust their instincts when they see Desmond joking about doing Ketamine and is obviously high as hell. You're not imagining things and it is one hundred percent obvious that child is being abused just from what we can see from social media. There is obviously some sort of coverup due to this childs popularity there can be no other explanation. There is no one in this society or in a small town that cannot say their child would be removed from the household if things like that were happening. I just don't understand how some things can seem so upside down for them when things are so straightforward here for us in the "real" world. We get shaken down for pot or crack when we cross the yellow line but these bitches an dress a child in drag and "pretend" they are doing a horse tranquilizer - even one of our childs KNOWLEDGE (in that vein; non academic setting) about such a substance would warrant child abuse in any small town.

            I'm sure the money is important to those parents as well, but after just one look at the mom, I've always felt the mom is doing this so she can feel the popularity she never had in highschool, college or now, though her son.

            STILL exists. Desmond even refers to himself as one on his instagram. "World’s Youngest Club Kid"
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem with things like this is they can analyse the situation based very much on whether or not the kid is happy and wants to be doing these things. It doesn't take into account that he may have been forced into doing these things, or brainwashed into doing these things, and it's now just an accepted part of his life. He obviously wants to do these things now, but how they have deemed it okay for him to be in such environments with such people is beyond me.

            I was convince with the video of Desmond (pretending to) snort ketamine off his hand, and talking about the date rape drug, and if that wasn't enough him sitting with a convicted killer on the couch with a painting with the word rohyphnol on it definitely seals the deal.

             males to gay bars with free drinks? Sometimes they'd convince the straight ones (that's why some young women were there, to attract non gay males) to dress up in women's clothes and eventually take them home and accidentally 'find' ecstasy laying around (hypothetically speaking they said in a radio interview) and next thing you know that chicken hawk and his boyfriend (back in the day) would then have sex with the teen.
             <em>
              that

             Convicted killer?, the on who killed  his drug dealer?  The guy who lived for free back then, supported by some billionaire and lives rent free today as a grown man, again, supported by a billionaire.

              It was his room mate he killed by injecting a concoction like pipe cleaner into his veins.  Was his roommate also his drug dealer? Or was there another one, or are you talking about his boyfriend that was on the right of Dez.

               .  I read about Michael Alig telling his friend 'Screaming Rachel' about the murder
               <a href="http://archive.vn/dQgFt">
                http://archive.vn/dQgFt
               </a>
               .  It's an interesting account (scroll down to Club Kids/Murder Coverup):
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Rachel and I had become acquainted years earlier when I covered the nightlife scene as a columnist for a local magazine. Thus, once Rachel was back in town, the two of us got together, along with a mutual friend, to catch up with each other over a few drinks. That night Rachel drank more than usual, and soon she was opening up to something that was bothering her. Just a few days earlier, her friend Michael Alig had visited her in Chicago, en route to a drug rehabilitation facility in Colorado where Michael was being sent to attempt to beat his addiction to heroin and Ecstasy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Alig had brought with him videotapes of his favorite movies, which he and Rachel watched during his visit. One was ‘Rosemary’s Baby,’ the 1968 film about a group of Devil worshippers in New York City. Also in Alig’s possession were his favorites "Seven," about a psycho who dismembers a drug dealer, and "Angel Heart," the Mickey Rourke thriller about the Occult and murder in New York and New Orleans.
               </p>
               <p>
                At some point while watching these movies, Rachel claimed, Michael confessed that he and his room mate "Freeze" had murdered a drug dealer named "Angel," dismembered him, and thrown his body parts into the Hudson River. Rachel then noted that her friend Michael was a practical joker and that she wasn’t convinced he was telling the truth. The speed with which Rachel downed her next drink, and then another, convinced me that she believed Michael had in fact murdered Angel.

             Exactly, that's what makes the CPS investigation so fucking extrordinary. If they sweep a highly publicized and obvious case under the rug, how many other cases are being simply ignored?

            This simply means CPS is afraid of the political backlash.
           </p>
           <p>
            Especially if the MSM desperately needs to cover something up. Who knows who they will throw into the gladiator pit for the next circus.

            SPANISH SPEAKING PIZZAGATERS:

             This is Angel David Revilla, aka DrossRotzank

            . He's a YouTuber with over 16 Million subscribers who specializes in horror content and conspiracy theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            He exposed his audience to things like #PizzaGate, and recently Hillary probably being not completely 'okay' (the bloodclot, seizures and shit) while sneakily suggesting that we might have dodged a bullet. It'd be nice if someone else who speaks Spanish
            <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/WWkw4S9.png">
             contacted him about this

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we need to get this out to more people.
