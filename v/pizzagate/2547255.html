<p><strong>LAPD PEDO Rapes friend/fellow LAPD Officer\'s daughter...the Pedos are turning on themselves!!!</strong></p>

<p>&quot;A Los Angeles police officer was charged Tuesday with sexually assaulting a teen girl while he was staying at her parents’ house in Torrance, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Kenneth Collard, 51, allegedly committed the abuse after entering the 13-year-old’s bedroom in the middle of the night on April 4, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said in a news release.</p>
<p>Collard is friends with the girl’s parents, officials said. One law enforcement source told the Los Angeles Times that the victim is the daughter of police officer.</p>
<p>The officer faces three counts of lewd act upon a child and one count of sexual penetration by foreign object.</p>
<p>The charges come after a thorough investigation that involved forensic evidence, Torrance police said in a news release.

<p>The fact that an LAPD officer was suspected of assaulting an underage girl first came to light on May 3, but Collard had not previously been named.</p>
<p>A warrant was filed for Collard’s arrest on Monday, prosecutors said. Inmate records show he was taken into custody around 9 a.m. Tuesday in Torrance but released by 4 p.m. He had been held on $400,000 bail.</p>
<p>A date for Collard’s arraigned had not been set, the DA’s office said.</p>
<p>The 51-year-old face up to 32 years in state prison if convicted as charged.</p>
<p>Collard, a more than 20-year veteran of the force assigned to the West L.A. station, has been placed on administrative leave, the Times reported.</p>
<p>The LAPD has previously said it is conducting an internal review of the accusations and could not comment further, citing an ongoing investigation. The agency did not immediately comment on the announcement of formal charges on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the labor union for LAPD officers, issued a statement saying it was “sickened by the repugnant allegations” against Collard.</p>
<p>“As police officers, we are sworn to protect the innocent, not to exploit them,” the statement read. “There is absolutely no room in law enforcement or society for anyone who commits such acts, especially on a child.”</p>
<p>The department has also launched personnel complaint investigations into three other personnel in recent weeks. Two supervisors, Cmdr. Nicole Mehringer and Sgt. James Kelly, were involved in a suspected DUI crash in Glendale on April 27, while another officer, Mambasse Koulabalo Patara, was charged on April 25 with transporting two men in the U.S. illegally.&quot;</p>

            A warrant was filed for Collard’s arrest on Monday, prosecutors said. Inmate records show he was taken into custody around 9 a.m. Tuesday in Torrance but released by 4 p.m. He had been held on $400,000 bail.
           </p>
           <p>
            In at 9 and out by 4.  How amazing.  I bet a poor person arrested for Marijuana possession could not get out that quick, or not at all.  Also his bail was $400K  which means he had to come up with $40K to get out on bail.  He is out.  A child rapist.  Think about that.

            Scores of LAPD officers were implicated in alleged crimes and misconduct in the Rampart scandal. Most were not prosecuted and remain on the job. Others resigned or were fired, but never faced criminal charges.

            Rampart Scandal

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Partly as a result of the scandal, Mayor James K. Hahn did not rehire Police Chief Bernard Parks in 2002. Both the scandal and the de facto firing of Parks are believed to have precipitated Hahn's defeat by Antonio Villaraigosa in the 2005 mayoral election.[5] As of 2018, the full extent of Rampart corruption is not known, and several RAPE, murder and robbery investigations involving Rampart officers remain unsolved.

              On February 3, 2013, a series of shootings began in Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside counties in California, United States, in which the victims were law enforcement officers, their families, and civilians misidentified as the suspect.    YES, that I remember.

             The same LAPD that  knew about the "grim sleeper" serial killer for decades and never even told the public?! It was a group of local black women from the community that  began warning the public citizens of Los Angles!
            </p>
            <p>
             He even worked at LAPD too???
Some say they was much more collusion between them , but that intel hasn't YET surfaced.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lonnie Franklin Jr., 63, a former city trash collector and garage attendant for Los Angeles police, was convicted of 10 counts of first-degree murder last month for crimes dating back more than 30 years.

               There's a documentary on the grim sleeper 
His youngest victim was 13.
He repeatedly requested the whores he'd hire to wear dog collars and be held on leashes - even asked some to "bark like a dog"
?!
...that's Satanism!!
