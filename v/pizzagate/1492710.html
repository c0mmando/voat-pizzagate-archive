<p>had to manually search the website of www.missingkids.com and copy the numbers, which makes them questionable. Or they must be script-kiddies that copied the database. But I wasn\'t convinced, so started digging to search for (big) data and ran into a couple of interesting things:</p>

<p>These FBI reports do not split any data by state, or age, but hey it\'s the FBI. They certainly know. So could you ask them? I\'m not a US citizen, I just would like to know.</p>
<p>I did not copy all data into a sheet to actually compare (too much work), so disclaimer: the following is a loose statement based on observation: *I was triggered by this <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1454609">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1454609</a> suspected that the number of missing kids could increase leading up to Halloween.. </p>
<p>Looking at the second table in the FBI links called NCIC Missing Persons (Monthly Totals), and comparing years. It seems that May &amp; October - together with April &amp; March always among highest number of cases.* <em>This can be verified if anyone is interested.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>As my search for \'by state\' data of missing children continued a lot of sources where referring to NISMART</strong>  and <strong>this is where it get\'s interesting</strong>.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NISMART">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NISMART</a></p>
<p>&quot; NISMART or the National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway and Throwaway Children, <strong>was a research project</strong> supported by the United States Department of Justice. It was enacted to address the 1984 Missing Children\'s Assistance Act (Pub.L. 98-473). This required the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to conduct periodic national incidence studies to determine the actual number of children reported missing and the number recovered. &quot; </p>
<p>Finding data on NISMART-1 from 1988, seemed unrelevant. NISMART-2 which was initiated in 1999 and published in 2002 and can be accessed.</p>

</ul>
<p>This research is mentioned in almost every research on child abuse I\'ve found, even here on VOAT it\'s been used to debunk the &quot;800.000 children go missing every year&quot; statement <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/comments/1435600">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/comments/1435600</a> however it\'s based on one 1997 sample group and is not actively monitored. * <em>I didn\'t plowed through the datasets+inlog for their prediction on stats for Virginia.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>So where is NISMART-3 ???</strong> Good question! here is a timeline of evidence that seems to suggest that ..ehmm? yes what happened exactly?</p>

<p>How did they publish only this almost 6 years after the start of the project? By looking at the Grant Application they had much much bigger goals back in 2010. <a href="https://www.ojjdp.gov/grants/solicitations/FY2010/NISMART3.pdf">https://www.ojjdp.gov/grants/solicitations/FY2010/NISMART3.pdf</a> So are we still waiting, or is Wikipedia right that it <strong>was</strong> a research?</p>
<p>*I\'ve lost a reference, will look it up. It was something about the ambition to make NISMART a triannual thing, by law..</p>

<h2>HERE COME THE KIDS</h2>
<p>Anyway after finding all of this, I wasn\'t one bit closer to the missing kids in Virginia, so I said ff it, I\'ll do it. Back to <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/home">www.missingkids.com</a>* <em>who make some compelling trafficking infographics btw</em> <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/desktop/CST-Full-1-5-2016.png">http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/desktop/CST-Full-1-5-2016.png</a></p>
<p>The website <a href="http://www.fugitivehunter.org/Statemissing.html">http://www.fugitivehunter.org/Statemissing.html</a> made opening 52 tabs pretty easy. Copy+paste &amp; voila! </p>
<h2>guess we could have trusted the original posters of the information on the #extremly high rate of children missing in Virginia, this is shocking!</h2>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Pfkxu57.png">http://i.imgur.com/Pfkxu57.png</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Virginia has a 260% higher rating of missing children than the US average for missing childeren when accounted for population size</li>
<li>Also note that Virginia bordering state West Virginia has the lowest rating?</li>
<li>Compare this with the map of Huffington Post, looks like completly different picture!</li>

           These FBI reports do not split any data by state, or age, but hey it's the FBI. They certainly know. So could you ask them? I'm not a US citizen, I just would like to know.
          </p>
          <p>
           I did not copy all data into a sheet to actually compare (too much work), so disclaimer: the following is a loose statement based on observation: *I was triggered by this

           suspected that the number of missing kids could increase leading up to Halloween..
          </p>
          <p>
           Looking at the second table in the FBI links called NCIC Missing Persons (Monthly Totals), and comparing years. It seems that May &amp; October - together with April &amp; March always among highest number of cases.*

           <strong>
            As my search for 'by state' data of missing children continued a lot of sources where referring to NISMART
           </strong>
           and
           <strong>
            this is where it get's interesting
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           According to Wikipedia:
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NISMART">
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NISMART
           </a>

           " NISMART or the National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway and Throwaway Children,
           <strong>
            was a research project
           </strong>
           supported by the United States Department of Justice. It was enacted to address the 1984 Missing Children's Assistance Act (Pub.L. 98-473). This required the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to conduct periodic national incidence studies to determine the actual number of children reported missing and the number recovered. "
          </p>
          <p>
           Finding data on NISMART-1 from 1988, seemed unrelevant. NISMART-2 which was initiated in 1999 and published in 2002 and can be accessed.

            Maybe we could get a team of researchers to each take a few of the kids missing in Virginia in 2016 and look into them, see what comes up - are they all going missing from one place/children's home, did they all attend the same school/church, do they have parents? Are their parents all in huge financial trouble, who do their parents work for etc. I think if we looked into all these kids we might find some useful patterns.

             Yes, agreed.. if we agree to rely on the missingkids.com data. Honestly I think the FBI has much clearer data and can pull reports like you are suggesting out of their databases within seconds.

              Yeah probably, but we're not the FBI so will have to do it the old fashioned way! Are you up for looking up say the first 5 kids? And I'll do the second 5?

            I miss simpler times. All of these problems could be fixed with a .45 and a couple hundred boxes of ammo. But instead, we have to just mine for data like a bunch of pathetic bitches. Laws have got to change. Immediately.

            Another interesting thing that seems weird to me is the number of kids on the Virginia missing children list that have no picture! Isn't that the 1st thing authorities get from the family is a picture of the child? How are strangers supposed to keep an eye out for kids with no picture? Their name, hair color that's most likely changed. 
...and where's all the little ones? These are mostly teenagers

            Northern Virginia, and to a lesser extent Maryland, is home to a large population of illegal aliens from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and other countries in Central America. If you check the pictures of a lot of the missing kids, I think you'll find that a majority of them are Hispanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the past couple years, we've had a resurgence of MS-13 in Northern Virginia. As this group deals a lot in human trafficking of all sorts, they are most likely the culprit of the large numbers of abductions we're seeing. In Phoenix, a few years back, they were going crazy on abductions - largely for ransom purposes, but there were a fair number who were not returned. They tend to stick to the illegal alien families as targets, as they have a much lower chance to contact authorities. It raises much less attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, the thing to note here is that if these kids are still on the "missing list", and if MS-13 got them, then they were most likely sold. For direct sales to work, they would have to have a market for those sales in somewhat close proximity, as transporting them to another country would be virtually infeasible and highly risky. If they're not being sold, then they could be prostituting the kids themselves. That's fairly risky as well, unless they have the blessings of the Feds and local police agencies.

             the question is could MS13 be working with this ring...criminals seem to attract people with same mind set....excellent way for them to make money without getting in trouble...why else would there be a insurgence of these latin gangs...when a place like that has none of there culture that they love so much...viva mexico

              Yes - it's odd that MS-13 crops up so far North. Their main hubs have been in California and Texas, but they also spread up the East Coast, primarily in DC and NYC. Their main business is running guns into Mexico, and running drugs into America. This gets much riskier the further you get from the Mexican border - lots of transporting illegal goods across State lines.
             </p>
             <p>
              Kidnapping, however, can be profitable everywhere. Either you ransom, or you set up a prostitution ring, or you sell them. MS-13 has set up brothels in America, and it could be they're doing that in Northern Virginia and DC. Of course, if there's a market - then yes, they could be selling them to the elite.
             </p>
             <p>
              There have been allegations that MS-13 works with the CIA. As for the truth of that claim, I have no idea. CIA is known to traffic in all sorts of illicit goods, so it's not too far of a stretch to make a possible connection between them and both parties (MS13 and the Elite). They could even be the intermediary. I somehow doubt that guys like Alefantis are going to run around gangland looking to buy kids.

             They do, and they get that for Native American kids, I am Half Native, we have a extreemly high incident of having our kids taken away and never returned. I was not raised in my culture so of course I have never had to suffer this type of loss, but I am aware of it.

            What I want to know is how many of the total are IVF babies and of IVF babies, what is the % of them that get kid napped and under what circumstances and what ages. Medical Organ trade is as big as pedo trade. DNA compatible donors could be big bucks for the extremely rich who need to live well over 100 so they can keep this shit going. Like Soros!!

            As for Huffpo, they are a bunch of feminist pedophiles them selves so I am sure they will do anything to miss inform people.

              That thought stems from the fact that people kept pointing out that the elites and some victims seemed to have the same genetic condition, the eyes iris. One of those victims was Maddy McCann. Her case seems to have all the ear marks of a pre-planned abduction. So the thought came to mind to ask the question, was she an IVF baby? I thought if only we could ask the parents. Well, it turns out they talked about the matter a long time ago and my question was answered. YES, she is an IVF baby!

              Now what drives me to think about is knowing that this gene is rare and hereditary but most prevalent in multi generational inbreeding. In other words, if you breed incestuously for several generations, it is highly likely to develop this gene, once formed it becomes hereditary. And guess what, most people who have this gene are wealthy descendants of royalty and other elites. These elites are all related so closely, they are developing sever birth defects. I believe they are some form of supremacists who believe they must stay pure of race and pass their blood line by the mother only. This means female babies will be used in research, pedophilia and organ donors while male babies who are seeded through IVF will be used to impregnate pure elite females to produce off spring that most resemble their fathers blood line but with introduction of out side breeding to attempt to correct for the deformities of their genes.

              This way the genetics are still in the elite family bloodline but removed by one external barer and reintroduced back into the family tree.

              When I was a kid growing up on a ranch, I was the master at animal breeding. Not as simple as just sticking 2 animals together. And even though most animals are mature within a couple or three or four years, it can still be an extremely time consuming project to create the results you want. You can not simply breed two champion horses to produce a third champ. Or to create a stable champion breed.
