<p>What is McKamey Manor? Well, they call it a haunted house, but it\'s a torture chamber where safe words are reportedly ignored by those who have encountered this place at their own free will. </p>
<p>My question is, how many people have entered this experience against their will?</p>
<p><em>The notorious terror attraction known as McKamey Manor is trying to leave San Diego again — this time for locations near Huntsville, Alabama, and Nashville, Tennessee.</em></p>
<p><em>A previous attempt to move — to Illinois, in 2015 — failed when nearby residents got wind of the proposed move and rose up against it.</em></p>
<p><em>Proprietor Russ McKamey told The San Diego Union-Tribune of his plans to move again, but would not identify locations more specific than metro area. Searches of property records and business licenses in the south did not turn up any documentation of his plans.</em> <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-mckamey-manor-20170613-story.html">http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-mckamey-manor-20170613-story.html</a></p>
<p>Huntsville, AL is a popular child trafficking hub because it sits in the center of 3 major highways. All you have to do is google search huntsville+al+child+trafficking</p>
<p>Nashville is also a huge child trafficking and programming hub according to Cathy O\'Brien. <a href="http://trance-formation.com/about-mark-and-cathy/">http://trance-formation.com/about-mark-and-cathy/</a></p>
<p>When McKamey Manor was in San Diego, it was in the middle of a regular neighborhood. Yes, start thinking about the phrase &quot;hiding in plain sight.&quot; </p>
<p>When Russ McKamey sends his goons to collect the willing victims, it\'s done in true kidnapping manor with no holds barred. Russ even admits in one of his videos that he alerts the police to where this will be happening in the area in case any member of he public sees this and calls 911. </p>
<p><em>“Compared to Guantanamo Bay, we’re a lot worse,” he says. “We don’t have months to break people down. We have five minutes.”</em></p>
<p><em>The experience begins when Russ and his crew of actors blindfold guests and throw them into a red, windowless Dodge Sprinter.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s known in the neighbourhood as ‘the kidnap van’ and has a license plate that reads ‘Djparty’.</em></p>
<p><strong>Initiation?</strong> <em>In fact, its crew of masked kidnappers are mostly volunteers who were once guests themselves.</em></p>
<p>I think he hides behind his greyhound rescue. <em>In truth, he and his partner Carol Schultz are committed to rescuing greyhounds – so much so that they only accept payment in dog food.</em></p>
<p>From what I understand, Russ and his wife only go to Mexico to get their greyhounds. Is he only going to Mexico to do rescue work? </p>
<p>But Russ sees no harm in using German Shepherds to terrorize people. (It\'s in a video and I\'m too tired to find it right now, but will post it later.) </p>
<p>Russ McKamey is  ex-military. <em>His love for haunts dates back to when his father used to take him trick-or-treating – he was entranced by one particular yard that featured a maze built from cardboard boxes – but the psychological warfare is something he picked up from serving twenty-three years in the Navy.</em></p>
<p><em>“Nobody is altering minds or brainwashing people but there are mind control tactics that you can do to make people more submissive,” says Russ, who still has a buzz cut. “That’s the name of the game: getting in your head and psychologically beating you down – fast.”</em></p>
<p>So, you\'re bringing blindfolded people into your home and the neighbors are kept in the dark because you\'re calling it a haunted house? And in areas where sex trafficking is a huge problem? And you\'re ex-military where you compulsively think about how to instill terror in people? *“All night long, I think of new stunt scenarios and rehearse them in my head, going over all these different options to find out what works and what doesn’t just by visualising it.”</p>
<p>And how can serious investigators NOT appreciate the coincidence that the name McKamey Manor contains both MK and MM? MK of course for MK Ultra, which involves traumatizing someone, and MM, which represents programming called twinning, vampire/serpent fangs, and corporate copyrights (Mickey Mouse for one) to communicate they\'re in the club.</p>
<p>But, who am I kidding, this is all legit. Nothing to see here... </p>
<p>I\'ll add in the videos later, but I encourage any readers to find them before I do. ;)</p>',

            Coincidence? I posted this on the 18th, then Voat went down, and Avicii died on the 20th.
           </p>
           <p>
            I simply find this extremely strange (from the OP):
            <em>
             It’s known in the neighbourhood as ‘the kidnap van’ and has a license plate that reads ‘Djparty’.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as I'm aware, McKamey Manor has nothing to do with DJs or DJing, so why would their license plate say this, and almost immediately following my thread, the most famous DJ in the world is found dead?
           </p>
           <p>
            Some say there are no coincidences, but maybe this is the first, and maybe it's not.

            Thanks! It's just tough writing things and not being condescending to the audience, especially this one because so many people here know so much more than your average person because they're woke. The last thing I want to do is offend them, then they don't search further.

            I can confirm that they do this in the military. It is a form of Mind control - You think this is bad?? This is child's play what they do to SELECT  individuals in the military. They also cannot talk details about it. - I would not second guess it if these people were involved in PG, child trafficking, torture, MK. Someone does it out there right?! It has to be somebody that does this shit to kids, adults in real life. You just seeing their face's would confuse your brain automatically assuming or not even second guessing that these people COULD or WOULD do this stuff IRL, because you've trained you're mind to think its RICH and FAMOUS , Political, people who just do this. Well think again, it could be your neighbour, could be your employer, could be the crack head down the road from you, or even the rich woman who rides her bicycle every Sunday. I'm not saying they do, do this IRL, I'm saying don't toss it out so quick.

            This whole modding thing is ridiculous, you could be closing down POTENTIAL leads here, like you did to mine a year ago. Potential leads that could open many other doors, but fuck it, why should the mods give two shits, that's why their mods. Another form of BS government. If any of these mods, or this website whoever its run by  gave TWO SHITS about PG, SATANISTS, PEDOVORE etc there would not be any BEATING AROUND THE BUSH to make a damn post.

             I don't doubt what you're saying one bit, and the guy who holds the record for staying in the longest (I think 6.5 hours) said that Russ asked him to be part of a military black ops. Don't know how true this is, but he said he turned it down. I'll try to find the info about this, but I'm pressed for time today. Thanks for your comments!

            I am grateful, in a horrific and traumatized kind of way, for posts like this.  I have been very lucky to live in a bubble where I had no idea of the depraved indifference to human life and human dignity that is so rampant in our society.  Examples like this are shocking.  More of us normies need to know , and outing the vile rivers of evil that are flowing under and through our communities will be key to helping people understand and accept when the worst parts are revealed.  I respect why we have post rules and why mods enforce the rules, but we must acknowledge PG is not just some narrow, specific rabbit hole, its significance is to unravel world-wide nefarious and damaging activities.

            Insinuating posters are trolls is getting pretty old, and so is the fact that posters are supposed to explain everything to the readers as though they're five is, too. There are numerous articles about Huntsville, Alabama being a trafficking hub and I was simply trying to get readers to do a simple investigation to discover this for themselves, but I'll provide links. No problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought just mentioning MK Ultra, sex trafficking, and Cathy O'Brien would give this enough weight to not have this content questioned as to why I placed it here, but I'll explain it like you're five, and post proof because, well, why should anyone be tempted to delve deeper and do their own research.

             This sub has turned to shit.  I quit posting after Vindicator suppressed my article on pay for play human hunting parties held in the NATO controlled areas of Ukraine in 2014 - 2015.  Asked to post links, posted them, article still stuck with an "accuracy in question" Flair and then thrown down the memory hole.  No relevance to pizzagate there (despite the fact that the elite western "tourists" were free to shoot ethnic Russian children as well as adults).  At least some of the mods here must be Deep State.  Eff you Vindicator!

              Hi
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Enigmatic_Continuum">
               @Enigmatic_Continuum
              </a>
              , thank you for editing. I can totally see why you are worried about this guy and his methods.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wasn't, however, able to find a connection to children here. Were there reports that children might have been abducted by him and his buddies, or that children took part in the 'experiences' he offers?
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, mind control of adults (and torturing adults) is not the same as MK Ultra, although it is related of course.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe other users can dig up something more about the involvement of children? I am afraid moving his business to a known trafficking hub is not enough.
             </p>
             <p>
              You will have 16 more hours to add some info.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please keep up the good work!

            This woman got bruised from going through the experience. I think that there will be more rejection considering how the South tends to be much more conservative.

            I've long thought it was a case of in your face human psych experimentation. Somebody funds this guy and lots of people protect him. I sense that he's evil, but that's just speculation. Either way, anyone who would volunteer for free torturing is already a troubled individual.

             I agree and believe he's completely evil. I think he role model is Michael Aquino.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              During the Feb. 5 hearing, Noreen Gosch stunned the court with sworn testimony linking U.S. Army Lt. Col. Michael Aquino (ret.) to the nationwide pedophile ring. Her son, Johnny, then 12 years old, was kidnapped off the streets of West Des Moines, Iowa, on Sept. 5, 1982, while he was doing his early-morning newspaper deliveries. Since his kidnapping, she has devoted all of her time and resources to finding her son, and to exposing the dangers that millions of children in America face from this hideous, literally Satanic underground of ritualistic deviants.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              “What this story involves is an elaborate function, I will say, that was an offshoot of a government program. The MK-Ultra program was developed in the 1950s by the CIA. It was used to help spy on other countries during the Cold War because they felt that the other countries were spying on us.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              “It was very successful. They could do it very well.”
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Then, the Aquino bombshell: “Well, then there was a man by the name of Michael Aquino. He was in the military. He had top Pentagon clearances. He was a pedophile. He was a Satanist. He’s founded the Temple of Set. And he was a close friend of Anton LaVey. The two of them were very active in ritualistic sexual abuse. And they deferred funding from this government program to use [in] this experimentation on children.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Furthermore, even as Aquino was being investigated by Army Criminal Investigation Division officers for involvement in the pedophile cases, he retained highest-level security clearances, and was involved in pioneering work in military psychological operations (“psy-ops”).

              I will not be able to see it.  But thank you for those that can.  I had a horrible time getting to sleep the other night over the Heather O Post.  Visuals really do me in, reading is bad enough.

                Oh God.  I am reading something right now that will def interrupt my sleep.  It's the post about a blog.  More covering up by the Diocese of PA.  It is horrible.

                 I'll have to read that when I get home. This stuff is so dark and disturbing! Try not to let it get it get to you, and take breaks when needed. Gotta run for now, and thanks for letting me know to read it.

             Thanks for looking it up and, yes, there are a ton of videos, but remember that they're all edited by Russ. What is he editing out? Not one video exists online that isn't edited. According to people who have gone through it, after so many weeks or a couple of months, a package will arrive on their doorstep that contains the unedited version of their entire experience. I don't know that anyone has ever shared one they've received. Some have said they were traumatized all over again because of this.
