            There was no lie about the basement, an earlier Washington Post article from 2013 makes it clear that the jarred tomatoes are stored in the basement of Buck's two doors down -- because Comet does not, as he has said, have a basement (confirmed by iirc either WaPo or NYTimes, who said their reporter confirmed it).

             Correct.   He may have been a tad inaccurate, but it was a plausible error as he owned both businesses and they are close by.   Wish this would stop getting repeated (like the meaning of his name or the old sign).
