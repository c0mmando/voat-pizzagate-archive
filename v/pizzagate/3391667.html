            Yes and Ghislane had the license.  I'm also curious about Wexner's yacht "No Limits".  That could easily hold a submersible.  Very little is known about the yacht's interior.  It is registered out of Newport, RI (no luxury tax), and is through an act of Congress, allowed to fly Old Glory, the American Flag.

             The 3 year ownership clause that the non-profit had to sign to receive the yacht makes me even curiouser

           <p>
            The explanation might be that the charity has to maintain ownership of the yacht for the 3 years, in order for ME to take a full tax deduction.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you donate to charity, you are only allowed to deduct the amount that the charity receives or would sell the item for retail. But if the charity actually uses the donation in its operations, then you can deduct the full value of the contribution. iirc

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The lesson is that you are better off finding cover than creating it.
             </p>
             <p>
              That was how the Navy hid another secret program 20 years later. The search for the sunken liner Titanic was, in effect, a cover for a highly classified Navy program to inspect the wrecks of two lost Navy submarines: the Thresher, which sank 200 miles off the coast of Cape Cod in 1963, and the Scorpion, which was lost in the mid-Atlantic in 1967.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Navy was concerned about the condition of the two subs’ nuclear reactors, as well as the nuclear-armed torpedoes that the Scorpion was carrying. However, the Navy did not want to draw attention to the wrecks, lest others—such as the Soviet Union—get the idea to grab parts of the submarines for themselves. So any survey had to be secret.
             </p>
             <p>
              Robert Ballard worked for Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, an independent research center in Massachusetts founded in 1930. Today Woods Hole employs about 600 people who work in fields ranging from ocean physics, biology, and engineering to policy studies. Most of its work is purely scientific and totally open. Ballard had taken a year off from Woods Hole and spent some time at Stanford University just as the Information Revolution was taking off. There Ballard got the idea of applying the new technology to create a new field: virtual exploration of the ocean using robotics, just the technology the Navy needed for finding subs deep in the ocean.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ballard also had a dream: finding the Titanic. People knew where other lost ocean liners—Andrea Doria, Lusitania, Britannic—had gone down, and divers had explored most of them. But no one knew the exact location of the wreck of the Titanic, the grand prize of ocean explorers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ballard proposed a deal to the Office of Naval Research: fund most of the development for a deep-sea robot (Ballard would raise the remaining money). Ballard would first use the robot to look for the Thresher and Scorpion and survey the wreck sites. Then he and his team would use whatever time he had remaining to look for the Titanic.
             </p>
             <p>
              This robot became the Argo/Jason system. Argo served as a docking station for Jason, a smaller sub-robot that carried the lights and camera. Jason could reach tight quarters, like the interior of the Titanic or the torpedo room of a submarine that had been lost years before.
             </p>
             <p>
              For the Navy, using Ballard’s research as a cover offered many advantages—not the least being Ballard himself. Ballard was an officer in the Naval Reserve. So whenever the Navy needed him to perform a classified mission, it simply reactivated him. Robert D. Ballard, Ph.D., became Commander R. D. Ballard, USNR. He was a bona fide employee of the U.S. government—but still looked like an oceanographer, which he was. For keeping cover, the arrangement was perfect. By publicizing the search for the Titanic—which was bound to get the spotlight anyway—and being coy about how much time Ballard was actually at sea, the Navy succeeded in making sure no one brought up the subject of the Thresher and Scorpion. The secret parts of the mission remained secret until Navy officials decided to reveal the survey operation in 1996 to reassure the public that the reactors posed no safety hazards.
             </p>
             <p>
              The basic technique was the same as in GRAB: Find a large research institute with enough routine activities so that a secret project can get lost in the noise; find or create a project with a bona fide scientific function. Blend the sensitive operations into the larger project. Publicize the hell out of the public operations, or just be nonchalant when the press follows its own instincts for a good story. Then simply say nothing about the sensitive part.

              Okay, I misinterpreted: as far as I can determine JE is not known to have owned a sub. He chartered one from a company called Atlantis operating out of St. Thomas for a scientific conference on St. Thomas attendee by Hawking.
             </p>
             <p>
              Reports say JE modified or even customized the sub for SH. I’ll guess this meant one or more seats were unbolted and temporarily removed.
             </p>
             <p>
              So Maxwell’s next boyfriend Ted Waitt is known to have a sub on his yacht “that [she]... knew how to pilot” says the NYT. It begs the question where/when did she learn? Pictures of Hawking’s big underwater adventure definitely show someone other than GM in the driver’s seat.

               Another thought......CIA etc. have information about the lost continent of Atlantis which was in this area. Since nazis, the heart beat of all this evil, were very much into this kind of thing....perhaps this was of interest to those who backed Epstein. Have just found out that Hemingway's mother was very interested in Atlantis.....Edgar Cayce, the great American psychic, used to give readings and referred to Atlantis often. He spent a month with Hemingway's mother in her home. Hemingway himself was very psychic............lived in Cuba for the last of his life. Because there is so much skepticism among us commoners does not make it a myth............reason for the subterfuge? They keep important information to themselves.........the power grid.

            Ghislane was at 1500 Ft and did not find anything but a coat hanger, and she always striven since she got her first gold star. Who wrote that piece, Her? The Orwellion speak/lies of not realizing that there were no rules 200 miles of shore and wanting to make rules for everyone to share equally is astounding too.

            This is great research for me because I have been eerily sure for over a year now, that The Beatles were killed on the solstice of June 1964. They were put into a submarine and dropped to the bottom of the ocean somewhere near New Zealand, because the clip of them arriving Wellington airport was the last we see of that iteration of the fab 4.

             YouSogoth.......far fetched? How about this....those who believe that the continent of Atlantis was ever a thing are called conspiracy theorists.......but the govt. does research into it , keeps the documentation on it secret. There may be occ. mention of seeing things underneath the water that are man made around Bimini &amp; the Caribbean Islands. Ships and planes have disappeared and still, very little mention....not like say, the latest big shooting. Ernest Hemingway 's mother was very interested in Atlantis and had the great 20th century psychic, Edgar Cayce,  at her house for a month...Cayce did a lot of readings about past lives of people who lived there. And Hemingway was also very psychic. (reading a book of his letters)........Psychic ability runs in families and the times when they were alive, they may not have wanted that information out. Atlantis had some great weaponry which probably had a lot to do with the entire continent going under .  The missing ships and planes go down in the area where many think Atlantis was located........and probably has something to do with the weaponry...........since our govt. is so into weaponry , maybe Ghislane and Jeffrey were looking around under water for sightings of past civilizations.........Hemingway lived in Cuba a number of years, which is also close.......as well as dropping off bodies?

             Hate to support this because it sounds so ridiculous, and makes matters even more confusing, but, :Allyn Vine was one of the very first scientists to think of the possibility of looking at the deep sea in an underwater vehicle. The Alvin is named after both Dr. Vine and the famous cartoon character from Alvin and the Chipmunks. Alvin and the Chipmunks were a toothy musical group. Strangely enough, there is a McCartney present. In the 2007 CGI/live-action film adaptation and its 2009 sequel, they were voiced in dialogue by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney. Of course there was a part where they got lost in the Pacific in Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. This baby is all yours.

              Yes, the 4 on the cover of the album "With The Beatles" disappear at the time A Hard Day's Night (album &amp; movie) is released in the UK. The album for AHDN has the replacements on the cover and they feature heavily in the movie.
             </p>
             <p>
              The replacements are also swapped out at the retreat in Rishikesh, but they come back and you don't see the Rishikesh 4 again.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Ted Waitt is the tech billionaire co-founder of Gateway, Inc. who became Ms. Maxwell’s boyfriend after she broke up with Mr. Epstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Plan B, the yacht Ms. Maxwell helped him obtain and renovate
             </strong>
             , brought her to Croatia and the South of France. His check writing helped secure her place at conferences as they replaced benefit galas as the first-tier social gatherings of the late aughts. That was essential to getting the TerraMar Project off the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
             When he met Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Waitt had a stringy, graying ponytail and wore drab suits. After she became his girlfriend, Mr. Waitt shaved his head, started wearing tinted glasses and became a virtual doppelgänger for Jason Statham.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              There was even a submarine put aboard Plan B that Ms. Maxwell knew how to pilot
             </strong>
             . She began deep-sea diving, which she said is how she had discovered human-made debris all over the ocean floor.
