            Are there tunnels? I've only heard people echo about tunnels, not yet seen any evidence.

            Although I encourage everybody to keep going, who do you think you can turn the info over to? The DOJ FBI and all intelligence agencies are in on it. The country has been finished and under control for a long long time. You are only just now seeing it. Break this open even more and that will it least wake people up that we are already slaves and the government and entire establishment is controlled by a Masonic blackmail pedophile cabal. A PI however, would have nobody to turn the evidence over to, and no court would allow you to have a trial. So that is that. They are all in on it.
