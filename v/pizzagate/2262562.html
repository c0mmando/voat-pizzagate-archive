            is for serious source-linked research posts only. We have shills pushing all kinds of BS here every day to try to make this sub look like a bunch of wackos; that's why we require coherent arguments backed by evidence and have separate sister-subverses for discussion about the moderation of the sub, and discussion about speculative theories that have little or no supporting evidence as of yet. Our rules do not allow you to make posts saying "Hey, what if XXX? Someone should research this." The onus is on the submitter to do enough research to be able to present a plausible link. I am removing this post per Rule 4.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding the question posed in your post: No one has ever made a substantive, thoroughly researched post showing evidence of a likely connection between blood or organ harvesting and the sexual and other abuse of kids by the global elite. There has been a lot of speculation, and a lot of disinfo peddling, but no actual reliable evidence this is happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one has provided evidence such a drug exists, or that it is even chemically possible as theorized. There have been numerous replies to such posts from different users debunking the idea.
           </p>
           <p>
            There has been scientific evidence that transfusions of young blood might cure diseases of aging (parabiosis), but no evidence so far that kids' blood has been stolen, or that kids have been abducted and exsanguinated. The only organ harvesting evidence I've seen has not been connected to the abuse of kids by the global elite. Until such evidence is presented from reliable sources, we are considering this topic likely disinfo and will remove it.

             , I did a lot of research in old books and doggone it, I think I found evidence that such a drug exists.  It was produced as a VETERINARY drug by a company based in ... wait for it ... Omaha, Nebraska.  I found it in a veterinary drug book published in 1982.  The book is called Veterinary Pharmaceuticals and Biologicals.  I also found the now-dead Trademarks for the drug, and evidence that the company stopped manufacturing it in 1988.  (We should track these dates in comparison to the important dates during which THE FRANKLIN SCANDAL was unfolding).  I saved all the evidence as PDFs and don't know how to upload them as images, etc.  I'm fixing to head over to a library today to look at old Physicians Desk References.  We once had one in the office but I can't locate it.  The Omaha-based company no longer is in existence, but appears to be running out of New Jersey now.  So there's a good lead.  I found a pretty damned good lead.  I'd like to share the info with you guys, but it would involve archiving the websites I was on, and possibly uploadiing images of the PDFs I just made early this morning.  The drug was touted as "a highly purified anterior pituitary preparation" that was allegedly "obtained from the pituary glands of domesticated animals."  The phrase "DOMESTICATED ANIMALS" could be a euphamism for "kidnapped kids being held in a basement in Omaha."  So if you guys can help me figure out how to upload this info, I'll do so later today.

              Jangles, it's not that I don't believe elites are involved, it's that no one has provided evidence they are. I find the tissue harvesting conducted by the abortion industry reprehensible and refuse to allow my kids vaccinations developed from fetal tissue. However, it's not part of pizzagate as defined in the submission rules the community created last December and reaffirmed here a few weeks ago. Furthermore, abortion and it's abhorrent spin-off "tissue donation" industry is currently legal. But we're not going to be able to bust the Clinton Cabal with it, even if we get it on video. It's preaching to the choir and a distraction from what we ARE trying to do.

              Really? This is what you're putting up as evidence? Why don't you make a full-fledged post, Jangles, quoting the salient parts you think prove this is directly related to Pizzagate, with links directly to the salient material, and enough info about the journal to demonstrate it should be given credence. I four of these links -- blind links I might add -- and saw nothing about adrenochrome or elites harvesting children's organs.

               There are whole books detailing the history of Jewish Ritual Slaughter. In all cases blood was drained because it was the goal. Toaff wrote a book on it. St. Simon of Trent is a famous case among dozens of others. Blood harvesting is well documented. In the 1700's people would go to public hangings and drink the blood of the hung victims. That is what puzzles me about people not understanding that blood harvesting happens. Its easy to find on the internet.

                It's not enough to demonstrate it happens. The investigation -- on

                anyway -- requires showing it is likely happening now, and that elite pedosatanists are doing it. And it is such an unusual claim it will require unusually rigorous evidence to convince anyone it is the driving force behind child abduction and trafficking. One obscure professor's book just isn't enough.

               Ok.  I will take the time and put all this together into a clear post.  Tried a few times and was deleted when 'verifying my bits'  ERG. . Writing in notepad nextime, I see where you are coming from but give my next post a chance.  It may be days before it is complete so it has some quality work in it.

                Thank you, Jangles. I am sorry the bit verification thing is making it difficult. It's happened to me, too. When you make the post, you may want to make it first in
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                 v/pizzagatewhatever
                </a>
                and ping me. Then, if you've provided solid enough evidence to get over the bar set by Crensch, VSD and MF, I will ping them to let them know you are submitting it to the main sub. That way, it won't get summarily deleted if it is providing new, solid source material. It is a fact that the constant battling against shills can tend to make you see them everywhere, especially if someone is posting about something the shills regularly push.

             Got it.  I will discuss it in one of those other forums then if I get around to it.  Thanks for taking the time to explain.  I still say discussion of it is more pertinent to the investigation than news of Roy Moore and the Hollywood celebs diddling around with teenagers.  Its going to take some brainstorming, will try and do that elsewhere and if solid tangible evidence comes up, will bring it back here for discussion.

             The point of my original post that was deleted is there was a site found, which I linked to elsewhere last night.  It did act as evidence the drug existed, as it was a large addiction website and had the drug listed with all the details.   My original post was to show I found that site and coincidentally it was taken down today or "suspended"... the information gone.   People in the comments were able to find archive of it.....and listed that in the comments... thus giving evidence the drug is real, is used, its effects described, signs and symptoms of addiction and treatment for addition to the drug adrenochrome.

              I agree it is fishy that link was suspended right after you posted about it. From my perspective, it is further evidence that we need to be generating the most serious, hard-hitting, irrefutable research possible here in the main sub, because we are being watched and constantly subjected to efforts to undermine the validity of what we publish. We definitely should investigate this -- and publish credible findings here when we have them nailed down. But those two things need to happen in different subverses. Remember, it's not enough to prove the drug exists; you also need to cite sources verifying it has the effects the hypothesis requires (it gives a "high" worth killing kids for), that it is likely being manufactured (i.e. the process is feasible for black market drug production), and that there is some reason animals couldn't be used instead of kids. Then you'll have to show a connection to the elite of some kind.

              I personally think the parabiosis hypothesis for Pizzagate is a much stronger angle to pursue. Just as many people have no qualms about aborting inconvenient offspring, I suspect many wealthy people would jump at the chance to turn back the aging clock with transfusions of young blood, and wouldn't ask too many questions about how it was acquired. I could see the abortion industry easily playing a role. But so far, there's no evidence this is actually happening yet, other than the missing kids.

               I am talking about the whole of it.... I guess my question was, where would be a good place to try and recruit help in putting something together which is concise, to the point, and spells everything out in a readable way... perhaps a documentary.  I can write it up, or the narration for a documentary.... but some help in compiling specific things to put into it would be very helpful, if not necessary to put something like that together for maximum effect.

                and myself ride a theory closer to it being as much or more of a replacement for genetic things they lack. Jangles has identified some peptides associates with PAX 6 he does research on. I think he understands it better than I do.

                There is also the "Vampire Disease." Its not a joke that these people stayed out of the Sun. I think as much, or maybe more, this is a physical thing. If they went out in the Sun the could get burned so bad they could lose parts of their face or fingers. Purple is the color of Royalty for a reason.

                Their anger and rage against the rest of humanity because we don't want to be the host of their parastitic psychopathy desires has caused them to become what they are. They want to destroy the earth and everybody on it until they can reign supreme in broad daylight and act like psychopaths publicly instead of having to "shape shift" from one personality to another. Baby kissers in public and psycho killers at night.
               </p>
               <p>
                They want to fuck and torture our children because they hate our guts and they want to subdue us totally.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have no sympathy for the baby raping mother fuckers. We cannot throw everybody out of the life boat simply to let them destroy the whole boat. They have to go if humanity is to survive them. They have almost ruined the earth totally. Humanity will already mutate in the future from all the radiaton contamination. They have poisoned most of the water. All intentional.

                They want to destroy Male/Female recognition in elementary school so that they can confuse and prey on our children.

                My research indicates that it can also produce a high. I listened to Mexican Mafia Cartel member two days ago say that he killed a man and drank his blood right after he did it. He said "there is no high, not even cocaine, like drinking human blood."

               <p>
                The evidence I have collected for blood drinking is overwhelming. My questions reside in exactly why? How much is recreational addiction and how much is replacing genetic components they don't have neough of?

                I have also concluded that it is addictive to the point that people will kill to attain blood. Ceasar reported that the Khazars from the Black and Caspian sea area (modern day jews) would drink the blood of their horses if they could not get human blood.
               </p>
               <p>
                The blood from a human baby is top grade in the blood drinking world.

                Animals are also used to make a super viagra using pheromones from calves they beat to death before the substances are extracted. This viagra like pheromone is so strong it makes people's eyes bulge out and can do brain damage. They sometimes give it to sex offenders and watch them go nuts on it. They also give it to their victims.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is no doubt that this is all going on. Putting the exact details together is tough because it is so secretive. A BBC reporter wrote a story about the underground blood drinking culture. He mixed in with the blood drinkers and wrote about it.

               <p>
                Kerth Barker talks about how addictive it is. He was abused in a cult. It is happening but documenting it and finding all the puzzle pieces is difficult.
               </p>
               <p>
                Another reason the drank blood is Hemophilia B which is a severe form of Hemophilia.
               </p>
               <p>
                Its a complicated story.

                 Wouldn't the easiest, most logical way to get human blood for this purpose be to run a blood bank? How would anyone know if you were actually giving everything you collected to hospitals?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, I know a bit about pharmaceuticals due to a bunch of genetic mutations I have thanks to my dad's exposure to Dioxin in Vietnam, and my own early childhood drinking tainted milk and eating tainted vegetables as a Hanford Nuclear Reservation  "down-winder". It's hard for me to believe it would be possible to get high from digesting a substance carried in another person's blood. We have so many p450 enzymes that break down substances in our food that most drugs have to be formulated in a very high concentration (as compared to the concentration found in nature) to have any efficacy after they've made it through our digestive tract.

            That led me to Jen Psaki and Chi Omega. Notice the symbolism on the crest with the skull and crossbones to the left and the owl to the right. They are aligned with Make-A-Wish Foundation, and that is made fun of by this southpark episode  Kenny Dies. Cartman makes a Shakeys pizza out of stem cells.  That leads to the first American pizza chain ,Shakey's Pizza - Wikipedia    Conclusion; this is a big joke to these sick bastards, and the fact that the first pizza chain in the USA is now in the Phillipines proves that.  Still not sure why I can't post links here. Ask a mod?

            As for people who say certain topics aren't relevant or "shit isn't post worthy"....  from your understanding that might be so, but when everyone else give it merit, is interested and are discussing it.... maybe listen in a bit and see if you can learn anything from it, otherwise allow others their own course without the heavy hand of opinionated censorship.

             for the link! I also agree that this is more important than the Roy Moore allegations.

            This is totally a relevant topic, but you need to put some links to sources. I googled 3 for you to put in your post. Here is one from a drug addiction website:
            <a href="https://drugs-forum.com/threads/adrenochrome-report.17239/">
             https://drugs-forum.com/threads/adrenochrome-report.17239/
            </a>
            Here is a chat discussion Q&amp;A about it:
            <a href="https://forum.grasscity.com/threads/adrenacrome.229/">
             https://forum.grasscity.com/threads/adrenacrome.229/
            </a>
            Here is another where they are discussing the veracity of the rumors about the drug:
            <a href="http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/109042-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Adrenochrome-Thread/page5">
             http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/109042-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Adrenochrome-Thread/page5
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it is still worthy to consider. The only pop culture reference I have is Hunter S. Thompson. There was some talk that he made it up, but a little voice in my head is telling me the only things he really made up the time that he said that he made something up.
In the future, keep an eye on the submission requirements and you will likely have less trouble from the moderators.

            To pick up where it was left off when censored.... someone was going to go through the Podesta emails for any connections to the use of the drug...  some of the known slang words for it are drencrom, milk-plus, the korova milk bar, moloko, qrunq, korova milk bar

                 Yeah, unfortunately the real information disappeared from the internet today, then in the post discussing it, that information was found in archive.... then disappeared again because it was "irrelevant", but Roy Moore dating 16 year old was deemed relevant.

                   Seems odd that everyone says there's no information on it.... information is found on the internet at a large drug addiction site, that site goes down today.... people here find the info again, then the entire post is deleted.  So now we're back where we started.... there's no proof.

                   The entire point of my post was that with regards to Adrenacrhome being a real drug that people use, I found an addiction site that told about it.  I was not the only one, that site was linked to by other sources outside of here with the same discussion about its harvesting and usage.  That site was active last night and today was suspended.   Someone in the comments found an archive of it, and posted what it had said before the site was suspended today.... others were going to search the Podesta emails for any links.   Also the notion of Alex Podesta's art being sold as a money laundering venue for underground activities was brought into discussion beneath that.  All deleted.

               Sorry, don't really watch TV.   Are we still on the subject of satanists using children for child sacrifice?  Or is that a conspiracy theory all of us crazies just think is real?

             BTW, in most states its legal for an adult to marry a 16 year old with the parents consent.... I'd say that topic is not even remotely related to the satanic sacrifice and/or harvesting of children and/or adults.

             Oh, and when trying to get to the bottom of child trafficking for use of children in the sex trade, satanic ritual abuse and snuff films  aka "pizzagate"... and an article on Roy Moore courting young women is relevant?   Somehow I don't see the logic. Unless it were the perogative of this site to label Pizzagate all about adult men dating 16 year olds.

               And the legitimate source I found last night, disappeared this morning.... a large site on drug addiction; the only one I found with information on the drug was taken down down today "suspended" it said.  People found a way to see what it used to say... then the mods here saw fit to delete it all.

                 Google search results for the most part say nobody uses that drug and relate it to fictional in the movie.  The one source I found which addressed it as a drug, listing its effects and so forth was taken down today... less than 12 hours from when I looked at it last night and I and others shared it.  The entire site, not just the page where it was at was taken down.  So it won't be in Google Search anymore and there won't be any discussion about it on here... therefore you are right, there is no legitimate information on it.... well there was, until the mods deleted it and ended that conversation.  Lets all talk about Roy Moore courting a 16 year old instead!!

             The post received at least 7 upvotes and no down votes last I saw and there was productive conversation started, people putting pieces together with old facts on here.  People even found the back-up of the website that disappeared and posted what it said about the drug before it went down.

             I started logging in and posting a year ago when adrenochrome was discussed.
At least 3 threads were removed within a few hours of posting.

             Rule number one.... it wasn't relevant.  I posted about the drug Adrenochrome who people were suggesting might really be being used.  It is harvested from live people.. said to be in its purest form harvested from children... specifically children in terror pumping adrenaline.   My post specifically was to update that the one site I found which showed the drug as real, listed its effects, use, symptoms and treatment... mysteriously went down "suspended" as of today....when it was up and working just last night.

              You will find three subjects that are "not relevant" to pizzagate subverse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Organ harvesting.

             <p>
              Blood Harvesting.
             </p>
             <p>
              Banking families that fund child abuse. Lately i think somebody posted something about the Rothschilds so that one may be only semi banned.
