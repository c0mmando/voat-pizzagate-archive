            Could it be BECAUSE HE COVERED A CHILD RAPING AND NECROPHILE MONSTER, that he fits perfectly to the NEW YORK TIMES?
           </p>
           <p>
            Isn't Carlos Slim, owner of the NYT, that disgusting fat man, suspected of being a Mexican drug lord and a Pedosatanist?

            I am wondering how the REAL journalists at the NYT are feeling these days, when they have to write child rapist propaganda?

            i bet the NYT got Thompson because maybe they saw the Epstein affair coming up in the future. Now he's got this, too. Gotta wonder about karma sometimes.

            Something to keep in mind is that what we're investigating is a lot of rich, powerful elites with massive access to resources and people all over the globe; people who have the ability to commit crimes of this nature. Those accused in McMartin, and Kern County, and many others, were normal, average, everyday Americans who were quickly thrown through the legal system into hard time, only to be found entirely innocent after years of torment. Oh...and some didn't live long enough to see their innocent proven. That is entirely different than what we are looking into. Nobody has been punished. They are above the law. This is a huge, profitable empire we're facing. Not some middle-class Americans just trying to get by whose charges are later cleared by the victims themselves admitting the police coerced them into supporting their case.

            Just a PS on the "Conspiracy of Silence" by Discovery Channel - the Discovery Channel is pretty much gone now after many attacks on it.  They did run "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" but by the time they got to "The Guilty Men" there were full out attacks on Discovery.  Think it may have been shown once, but then stuff pulled and allegedly programming destroyed.  Years later "The Guilty Men" showed up on YouTube and believe still plays there.  There  was also a program on JFK which was on Tunheim Panel where we learned that the panel unanimously concluded that:  "Oswald was employed by the CIA working on high level assignments and probably also for the FBI."  This was based on 1992 JFK Classified Records Act.  Presumably they got to see Oswald's IRS records, W-2's etal. which had immediately been died to our press.  At the end, Tunheim repeats that conclusion twice and the TEXT appears below as he repeats it.  After about 4 weeks or so the program disappeared.  The story was that Jimmy Carter had alerted on it and the programming was confiscated, destroyed.  That was at a time when the Discovery Channel was calling itself "Network for the New Millennial" --  so probably 16 years ago and it has never turned up on YouTube to my knowledge.  Most people have never heard that there ever was such a program, or ever heard about Tunheim's conclusions.  How many other programs based on investigations of what's been happening in the US have also been prevented from being shown?

            When someone claims I am spamming by responding to multiple people, while simultaneously responding to all such posts himself, they're no longer engaging in respectful discourse. Those people are unimportant and should have no more time wasted upon. We're supposed to be on the same side.

             This also means a lot of journalists are looking for work.

Remember Operation Mockingbird is still in place - drafted two years before end of WWII -- and immediately they had the NYTimes.  From "History" :  Wisner recruited Philip Graham from The Washington Post to run the project within the industry. According to Deborah Davis in Katharine the Great, "By the early 1950s, Wisner 'owned' respected members of The New York Times, Newsweek, CBS and other communications vehicles."[4]

            He is right that we need better quality control than the virtual Wild West currently offers.  He is wrong that the NYT is part of the solution -- at least, for now.  He talked about transparency, and that is a good concept, but with an extremely powerful owner, the NYT will always be tainted with the suspicion of bias in favor of the will of that owner.  The NYT is property, and property serves the will of its owner.
           </p>
           <p>
            When we've got better tech to help us sift out true from false, then the NYT might be able to prove itself,
            <em>
             if
            </em>
            they actually do opt to start being honest.  Until then, they have shown their dishonesty and are unfit for human consumption.

            Pizzagate is proving quite helpful indeed in smoking out the 100% corrupt among us.

            So many comments on that article have been deleted. I despair when I see all the comments that buy into it still. Once you've seen behind the curtain it's really strange to see people so emphatically defending the old illusory world I used to live in with a horrible arrogant superiority. Normally I would feel a bit offended by people lording it over me with their presumed superiority but now I just feel frightened for them, and for me. The media is so powerful, SO powerful. It's the one thing, that, if we could turn it around, or turn it off, we'd have those sociopaths in prison within a month.

              And it makes you feel so sick when people you know and love mock you or even get angry with you for trying to tell them what you've found, what's really going on, and then point to that pile of lies as their evidence to prove you wrong. Makes me wanna puke!!

             We can pull the plug on cable -- just bow out.
Just as we can stop supporting organized patriarchal religion.
Stop eating animals/dairy -- 
If we really don't like capitalism and the power it has there are ways to
improve our health, help the planet and defund corporations/capitalism

            Remember, this is what the entire media did to make McMartin go away: gaslight anyone who looked at the evidence and was suspicious.  But when the tunnels were found, nothing changed.  Recent books ignore the tunnels being discovered 26 years ago.

            The best proof we have so far of the larger version of Pizzagate theory is the media's complicit stonewalling and the push for global censorship based on one guy shooting a computer.  So this Guardian article is yet more proof something nefarious and massive is afoot.

             Elite patterns are very clear from one scandal to the other.
What you're saying about McMartin is also what happened in Belgium.
Very quickly, they use media to flip the situation so that suddenly the innocent are guilty, demonized ...
and the demons are still in power running things.

             McMartin was a hysteria started by a single parent who made wild accusations who also happened to be a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic and died from complications of chronic alcoholism. Pizzagate is not hysteria.

               The source for the McMartin accusations started from a single woman who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and died from complications of alcoholism. At one point during the trial she claimed one of the accused could fly. She. Was. Not. Credible. Nevertheless, the cops sent form letters to hundreds of parents alerting them that an accusation had been made and that they should interrogate their kids about anything suspicious. From there it snowballed into the most expensive trial in history that resulted in no convictions. It was a model of our broken, corrupt system.

               Pizzagate sprung from suspicion of emails that was shared across a sizable group of people, and is gathering larger and larger amounts of circumstantial evidence; all of which is far more than was considered to accuse a bunch of innocent people of crimes including alleged supernatural acts in the 1980s. Those who cannot tell the difference are going to be of little use here.

                Would recommend that you actually read or watch Ted Gunderson's report on McMartin case.
As we often see, there are no convictions because the investigations are stopped by powerful people.
We are seeing this over and again in US, in Norway, in Belgium, in Australia -- on and on.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pizzagate arose from WikiLeaks alerting this nation to JPodesta emails with very questionable comments in regard to what
turned out to be code words for pedophile activities as made clear by the FBI.  Currently, JPodesta's sister seems to be 
running a child adoption agency out of VA.  We heard that Alefantis was an "innocent person" accused of crimes, but clearly
Alefantis is heavily involved in this pedophile ring, locally -- and probably beyond that.  He's visited the White House 5 times
and coincidentally on the same day as Silsby.
               </p>
               <p>
                And, of course, neither did the Franklin Scandal involve innocent people -- except the children who were victimized by pedophiles.
               </p>
               <p>
                The patterns are quite clear in attempts to cover up all of this -- including the McMartin case.

              Strange then that a tunnel complex exactly as described by all the child witnesses was dug up there in 1990. Equally strange that some were diagnosed with blunt force trauma to their privates and some even had chlamydia.

               The tunnels weren't "dug up". They were detected via radar that E. Gary Stickel used. People actually investigated and found they were waste tunnels that had been dug decades earlier, and further confirmed that the only objects they could find from the last 25 years were near the edge of the concrete slab floor that completely covered them, rendering them inaccessible to anyone but rodents. McMartin was hysteria just like Kern County was hysteria as were others. It's funny to me that some here are willing to believe government agents are corrupt and untrustworthy with regards to pizzagate but won't apply the same attitude to the law enforcement who imprisoned innocent people in the 80s. That's a real double standard you got there.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for saying the kids had chlamydia, do you have actual evidence for that? I studied the McMartin case and never saw anything about that.

                Your source, W. Joseph Wyatt, is a psychologist and 'expert' in child sexual abuse of the kind who sprung up after McMartin.  I know more about archaeology than he does.
               </p>
               <p>
                His 'analysis' is just trying to justify the modern approach of assuming ritual abuse allegations are made up.

              Wow, everything you just said is false.  McMartin was dozens of kids with physical symptoms of abuse, even some with VD, telling similar stories.  The tunnels they described were found in 1990 after the case was over and the acquittals had made it impossible to pursue.

               All that were found were waste tunnels constructed before the day care existed that had been rendered unusuable by a concrete floor that covered them. Stickel's claim of tunnels was made solely on a radar reading. Do you have a source on the VD thing? That's one of those "facts" I've never seen backed up by any evidence.

                Read the archaeology report in its entirety.  It was what we call in archaeology a rescue dig so they went fast under time pressure.  They dug it in reality, did not rely on GPR.

                If you understand absolute chronology and the root evidence, it's not even slightly credible to say the tunnels pre-existed the school.  Moreover, the point at trial was the tunnels did not exist.  They did, 100%, exist.  And then they were mysteriously filled in with 1980s refuse and fill dirt.  Moreover, there were pots and carved pentagrams (my take, Stickel says stars) recovered from the space during the excavation.

             we don't even have reliable facts that dude shot anything. there may have been a computer destroyed, but then WHY would Alefantis destroy a hard drive that contained all his valuable child porn, snuff films and cannibalism? that stuff doesn't grow on trees, and it's a cash cow for him now that it's produced (sick sick sick)

              We have Megyn Kelly's interview with footage shot in CPP showing a bullet hole in a computer.  One bullet would not necessarily destroy data stored in a computer.  Towers have a lot of air space.  But it is a good excuse to get rid of the computer.

              However,  I am in longterm wait-and-see mode when it comes to that event.  We may never know.  The media is clearly lying and exaggerating.  But that's often true.

               Possible reason he shot it... The hard drive had evidence on it. If he got rid of it and bought a new one instead, that would look suspicious to a jury--he just happens to replace his hard drive when pizzagate breaks out and he's a main suspect. He also did not want to delete the evidence for the same reason. Not only is it recoverable, if he uses bleach bit, they will probably know.
              </p>
              <p>
               So why not destory it via proxy hoax gunman? Not only does it give the media reason to attack pizzagate, but it gets rid of the evidence while making him out to be the victim.
