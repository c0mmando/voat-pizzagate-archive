<p>Spreading child pornography to snare porn-addicted adults into infertile sexual lives is not mentioned, but it is a logical extension of the program outlined in the &quot;Jaffe memo&quot; as it\'s called. Is fear of insufficient population control the reason the Cabal preys on children?</p>
<p>There is a USAID document called &quot;World Population Crisis&quot; that is an internal history of how overpopulation was addressed: <a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov">https://pdf.usaid.gov</a> /pdf_docs/PNAAN187.pdf </p>
<p>USAID has been <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/06/deadly-aid">called out for funding repressive govermments</a> in the past, and <a href="https://frontpageafricaonline.com/front-slider/liberia-usaid-probes-mercy-corps-grant-to-more-than-me/">helped Mercy Corps</a>fund Liberian schools <a href="http://time.com/longform/more-than-me-investigation/">raping girls as young as 10</a></p>

<p>Possibly also related: <a href="https://insidethevatican.com/news/newsflash/letter-48-2018-some-enemy-has-done-this/">There is evidence that the largest worldwide barrier to a systematic global depopulation scheme, the Catholic Church, was deliberately targeted and infiltrated in an organized attempt to destroy it from the inside</a>. <em>Vatican Insider</em> author Dr. Robert Moynihan reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are indications of another strand in the fabric, a strand which is intentional and corporate.</p>
<p>That is — hypothetically — indications that there as been an intentional infiltration into the Church: an enemy of the Church, or a group of enemies, have acted according to a precise plan.</p>
<p>Is there really any serious evidence of this?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There is an affidavit that many people do know of, but one perhaps that many of you have never heard of, that is relevant: the testimony of a woman named Bella Dodd (1904-1969 — so, she died at the age of 65 almost exactly 50 years ago; Bella Dodd lost one of her legs in a tram accident in New York City when she was about 19 or 20, so she was a person profoundly familiar with human suffering; by the way, though she came to Amerca, she was born in Italy — “She was born in Picerno, Basilicata, Kingdom of Italy, in 1904 and baptized Maria Assunta Isabella”).</p>
<p>And Bella Dodd’s testimony in that signed affidavit is that, under instructions from the American Communist Party, of which she was a passionate and high-ranking member for many years, she had headed up a special operation to place 1,200 young men in seminaries, all of whom were agents of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>And this is what she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the late 1920s and 1930s, I personally put eleven hundred men into the priesthood in order to weaken the Catholic Church from within.</p>
<p>“The idea was for these men to be ordained and progress to positions of influence and authority as Monsignors and Bishops…</p>
<p>“Right now they are in the highest places where they are working to bring about change in order to weaken the Church’s effectiveness against Communism.</p>
<p>“These changes will be so drastic that you will not even recognize the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>“Of all the world’s religions, the Catholic Church was the only one feared by the Communists, for it was its only effective opponent.</p>
<p>“The whole idea was to destroy, not the institution of the Church, but rather the faith of the people, and even use the institution of the Church, if possible, to destroy the faith through the promotion of a pseudo-religion.</p>
<p>“Something that resembled Catholicism but was not the real thing.</p>
<p>“Once the faith was destroyed, there would be a guilt complex introduced into the Church… to label the ‘Church of the past’ as being oppressive, authoritarian, full of prejudices, arrogant in claiming to be the sole possessor of truth, and responsible for the divisions of religious bodies throughout the centuries. This would be necessary in order to shame Church leaders into an ‘openness to the world,’ and to a more flexible attitude toward all religions and philosophies. The Communists would then exploit this openness in order to undermine the Church.” <em>(taken from Dr. Bella Dodd, lecture at Fordham University in 1953)</em></p>

            No, it is not. The objective is debauchery, to inverse the natural order, to desanctify innocence. That is wall what satanism is about. This brings about what is outside, inside.

             You don't think population control/global infertilization is Satanic?  What could be more of a slap in the face of the Creator who made us in his own image as generative, life-giving beings and told us to "be fruitful and multiply"?

              I agree. Though i think that a global war can be much quicker and effective if depopulation was the objective.

            No, it is an agenda so they can legally fuck kids and it be accepted by the masses. Stop thinking too much. I downvoated you for what you are, not because your thread is bad. You made a good contribution even though I think the answer is much simpler. Now stop gatekeeping and censoring.

              They were in league with the Nazis and Facism and communism were manufactured by the same people. Do not get this confused. They are not mortal enemies any more than the dems and gop are. Hegelian dialectic, both sides controlled by same entity. Want them to slap you with the left hand or right? You have the choice. Church is controlled. Gov, education , church, media. They cover their bases. And no, they do not arrest themselves.

               Of interest to you may be the book "From Darwin to Hitler," outlining how Darwinian teachings were interpreted as humanity having a moral duty to destroy the fertility and even the lives of the "unfit."

              I believe the Catholic Church is intertwined with the Jesuit Order and always have been since the Jesuit Orders' inception. I only base this on the playlist I linked. According to Walter Veith, the system of the Catholic Church is what is known as the Antichrist, not one specific person. His explanation of the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation are the most compelling I've ever heard anywhere given. That being said, you and everyone else is free to make up their own mind about what he is saying and if he is lying. Pizzagate is about the fight against child abuse wherever it is found, not just in secret societies. Anyway Walter Veith was once Catholic and claims he left after realizing the meaning of the Book of Daniel. His opinion is that most Catholics are innocent and simply being used. My opinion is that he presents a compelling view on those two books, but not everything he says, I agree with.
