           I have some concerns. I believe that the way the symbols are distributed in society is set up to create "false positives" and to allow creeps to hide in plain sight.

           It has gotten to the point where if someone has "nested triangles" or "nested hearts"(boy love girl love), the community goes wild. "Clearly this is a pedophile!!". This is a dangerous practice, and it is also counter productive.

            It's silly to suggest anything isn't worth investigating.

            Censorship is a fool's game. It doesn't work, and if anything, it spoils intellectual discussion.
