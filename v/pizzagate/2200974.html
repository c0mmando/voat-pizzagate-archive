             "So, based on these types of partnerships and based on that kind of success story, on June 14 Secretary Clinton will host a meeting here in Washington â€” youâ€™re all invited â€” that weâ€™re calling the Child Survival Call to Action. Because of the technology that we now have, the partnerships we now have, the scale and the ability to reach mothers giving birth and children seeking to survive, we believe itâ€™s possible for the first time in history to say that within a generation we can literally end preventable child death. For those who want to talk about the statistics of that, Iâ€™m happy to do that later. Thatâ€™s about 6 million kids per year who we think we could save compared with what is currently about 7.5 million kids who die. The point is that they can be saved easily and efficiently, and doing so can help change whatâ€™s possible in country after country after country. So, we urge you to come to the Child Survival Call to Action to partner with us to figure out how to make this more successful over time."

              What brings us together this year is a sense that the social contract is fraying but that itâ€™s also evolving â€” and that social contract is the means by which societies allocate responsibilities and allocate resources when it comes to managing shared problems, seizing shared opportunities and providing for the public good.

              If you look around the world, whether itâ€™s evidenced by the Arab Spring, by weather extremes, by civil conflict or the financial meltdown, weâ€™re certainly very aware that weâ€™re experiencing very fast-paced change â€” sometimes very wrenching change â€” and no single entity can manage these processes on its own.

             Littlefield led OPIC from 2010 until the end of the Obama administration, having previously served as CEO of the World Bankâ€™s Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest. OPIC made $3.29 billion in new commitments and generated $239 million for the U.S. government in 2016. The agency has a $21.5 billion portfolio of loans and guarantees in about 100 developing countries, a 160 percent increase from 2009.

               So, clearly we need the private sector to shoulder most of the work. The private sector â€” that vast, decentralized, rough-and-tumble $60 trillion network of corporations and firms and enterprises and small businesses that already supports livelihoods and lives around the world â€” is the largest lever we have.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              And you know what? Itâ€™s already happening. OPIC was carved out of USAID 40 years ago because it was recognized that the private sector needed its own dedicated agency to focus on it. At that time the money flowing from the United States to the emerging markets was 75 percent overseas development assistance [ODA], and the rest was foreign direct investment. Today, 40 years later, thatâ€™s completely flipped around: 80 percent of the money flowing from the US to emerging markets is foreign direct investment, and the rest of it is ODA. So now every single year, more than a trillion dollars in private capital â€” both strategic investments from corporations as well as portfolio investment from investors â€” is flowing into the poorer nations of the world.

             <p>
              We see our job as helping to channel private-sector capital to solve development challenges in emerging markets, and we do that â€” OPIC does that â€” by providing the loans, the finance and the risk mitigation tools that remove the barriers to investing and provide incentives. So, if we believe in a certain country, take Afghanistan for example, it is a country, of course, thatâ€™s incredibly important to this country; and as we pull our troops out of Afghanistan, we leave behind some beginnings of a credible economy that can provide opportunities and support into the future as we shift from a military- and aid-based economy to a private one. Now many investors are not going to go and invest in Afghanistan...Itâ€™s probably not high on the list of places that look like attractive business environments, so we try to figure out: What is it we can try to do in terms of providing political risk insurance, providing long-term financing, that could incite an investor to make an investment that we think will be powerful for that economy going forward.
