            I saw one of this guy's (Oktar)videos on YouTube years ago. He acts like a news commentator, talks about the political climate in the ME. And he's surrounded by several blonde women with gigantic lips and eyes like zombies. Its very weird.

            But there are rumors of an even deeper connection between Oktar and Erdogan. In 1994, the Islamist Welfare party, the precursor to today’s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), scored several significant victories in the local elections, including in Istanbul and the capital of Ankara. The conservative Erdogan started his political career when he became the mayor of Istanbul 20 years ago. Fatih Altayli, a prominent Turkish journalist and editor, noted that the Islamist party was unprepared for power, lacking both the experts and sufficiently Islamic business connections to govern effectively. It was at this time that Altayli has alleged that Erdogan and his party established a lucrative and mutually beneficial relationship with Oktar and members of his sect.
           </p>
           <p>
            “In 1995 and ’96, companies from Oktar’s sphere of influence made big business deals with municipalities under the control of the Welfare party, especially in Istanbul and Ankara,” Altayli wrote. “During a raid at a meeting of [Oktar’s] group, for instance, the police arrested Oguzhan Asilturk, an acting minister in the Welfare government, and one of the leading ideologues of political Islam in Turkey. It was really during these years, that [Oktar’s adherents] gained a lot of economic clout. Followers even established companies in Dubai.” Others say that members of the group established businesses in Central Asia with the help of leading Turkish investors and the money they’d stolen from their rich parents. Of course, any profits were funneled into the Harun Yahya enterprise.
           </p>
           <p>
            And in October, when Prime Minister Erdogan visited Prizren to lend his support to his Kosovo counterpart Hashim Thaci in advance of the recent local elections, members of the sect approached the premier with a copy of the Atlas of Creation. Erdogan was photographed with the enormous book shortly after making his infamous “Kosovo is Turkey, Turkey is Kosovo” speech. Then, followers swarmed Thaci and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. Thaci was lucky enough to have snagged a seat tucked safely away in a corner, but Rama was left exposed to Oktar’s evangelists, who gave him several Harun Yahya publications. Rama looks to have handled the entire encounter like a gentleman, and Oktar proudly played the video footage from Prizren on his talk show two nights in a row:
           </p>
           <p>
            KOSOVO &amp; Hashim Thaci    Turkey (Erdogan)  and Israel are running a Organ Harvesting Business KOSOVO is Involved as well

            Possibly there is a link here.  Yes NXIVM could be part of it, but Oktar seemed to support Erdogan and now he is arrested.  Something Erdogan did not like.  Oktar maybe was wanting a piece of the action, and possibly his sex trafficked girls were being harvested by Erdogan and Israel.  This is a stinky nasty business.  Erdogan is dirty and so is Thaci and now Oktar are fighting for control.

            , here we go again - a sex cult involved sexual abuse of children and money laundering - and blackmail. This time: Islamic version.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Oktar first came to media attention in the 1990s when he was the leader of a sect caught up in multiple sex scandals. As a result, he had faced similar criminal charges of setting up a criminal organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Istanbul police said warrants were issued against Oktar and 234 of his followers and that financial crime units were carrying out operations in Istanbul and four other cities to detain them.

            <p>
             Sam, The patriarch, first marriage was to Ann Loeb
            </p>
            <p>
             Ann Margaret Loeb was born Sept. 19, 1932, in New York City. Her father, John Langeloth Loeb Sr., was a Wall Street investment banker whose company was a predecessor of Shearson Lehman/American Express.
            </p>
            <p>
             Her mother, the former Frances Lehman, was a scion of the Lehman Brothers banking firm. Her parents were major benefactors of Harvard University and other colleges.

              I know at least a few folks here have been following the blog CDAN - there was recently a reveal involving Sara Bronfman and NXIVM:
              <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/07/blind-items-revealed-4_9.html">
