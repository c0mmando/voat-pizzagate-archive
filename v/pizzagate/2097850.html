            I wanted to post on this thread, but could not.  I wanted to respond to the comment about the pinwheel. You are correct. Spinning was used on me as a child because it creates chaos in the brain and confuses the neurons. However, the pinwheel symbol itself was not used.  Yet, the pinwheel has been used in symbolism of pedophilia, since we know that these disgusting people are definitely code talkers and masters at neuro-linguistic programming and communication. One of my missions, is to take away from  the Cabal all of the things they use against us.  Cathy O'Brien was just on my radio show, and we discussed this.  A few months ago, I was dealing with a visual trigger that was haunting me.  I talked with Cathy about it.  She suggested that I make a piece of art WITH the image.  So I did.  I made a piece of art and hung it on my wall.  The trigger went away, and now, when I see this image, I feel no emotion toward it.   So we talked about taking back trigger language, like not allowing the Cabal to be called "Illuminati" as they are NOT illuminated individuals.  Using the symbols they used AGAINST us back against them.  There is an art in counter neruo-linguistics, and those of us who were part of MK Ultra programs are coming to understand that.  So, I wanted to be able to share a bit with you my perspective and experience, that I purposely chose that frame for my picture.  I want to have conversations like this with you.  In doing so, I can share that we have to take from these evil people the tools they have used against us.  We need to break their code wide open and say, nope, you don't get to have this anymore.  I also pay attention to HOW a symbol is used and who is using it.  If I saw, for instance, an account that looked pedophiliac, and the posts were using these types of visual languages, then I know what I'm dealing with.  If I see another child rape survivor like me, who knows the inner workings of these sickos, taking back these symbols and returning them to pureness and light, then I understand what I'm dealing with.  I hope that discernment and critical thinking will be at the top of the list for us as we fight to break open what I consider to be the most IMPORTANT issue on this planet; the protection of children.

             Hi there Vennie! Welcome to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             . Thanks for including a link in your post, and the topic you are talking about is important and Pizzagte relevant. I don't know if you've seen all the hullabaloo about submissions being removed due to rule violations, but if you have let me say please ping me any time if you need help making a post that satisfies our submission rules. We have fairly rigorous rules because we are the most shilled spot on the internet. Half the posts we get are from hostile folks trying to make this investigation look bad, discourage us, or otherwise disrupt the forum. Due to Voat's anti-censorship policies, mods may only remove posts for violating the rules, and we have to remove ALL posts, even when we know it's a technicality from a legit contributor. We have to administer the rules consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
             Voat is a nutty platform, not intuitive to use. If you are on mobile, go to your browser settings and choose "view desktop site". That will allow you to see the formatting buttons. The third one in is a link of chain -- you can use that to highlight any text in your post or comment and turn it into a hyperlink to another post or any other source on the internet. Do you think you could paste the url to the thread you reference in your first line into that box and turn it into a hyperlink, so people know what you are referring to?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, it would be great if you could add additional links to supporting material about NLP and stuff. And maybe a link to the recording mentioned with Cathy O'Brien.
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             is a research subverse -- we don't allow unsourced discussion (due to the shills, who would just take advantage of Voat's free speech rules to post and endless stream of foul rants). The more well sourced a post is, the better it satisfies our submission rules (also, the more value it has).
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, I just wanted to point out that Voat sitewide has an odd definition of spam -- you have to make a post linking to one source you don't personally control for every post you make linking to sites you do control, or your URL will get banned sitewide for adspam. Some great contributors have been unaware of this and inadvertantly triggered it. Check out the Voat User Agreement and FAQ at the very very bottom of your screen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for your first post. Looking forward to more.
