<p>Al Vernacchio is a teacher, preK-12 Sexuality Education Coordinator, and chair of the Upper School English Department at the elite Friends\' Central School in Wynewood, PA.  He has been a &quot;Sexuality&quot; educator for over 25 years, and in 2011 his work was featured in The New York Times Magazine cover story, &quot;Teaching Good Sex.&quot;  Al has given 4 TED Talks and has appeared on NPR\'s &quot;Morning Edition.&quot;  He holds a BA in theology and a MSEd in Human Sexuality.
<a href="https://alvernacchio.com/about/">https://alvernacchio.com/about/</a></p>
<p>Here is what Al has to say in the &quot;Philadelphia&quot; article:
&quot;As pornography is ever more accessible - yes, your kids are watching it.&quot;  His approach makes pizza a metapor for sexual activity for the purpose of making sex easy for children to understand.  In his interview with the NYT he detailed his approach:</p>
<p>&quot;[W]ouldn\'t it be great if our sexual activity started with a real sense of wanting, whether your desire is for intamacy, pleasure or orgasms...And you can be hungry for pizza and stil decide, no thanks, I\'m dieting, it\'s not the healthiest thing for me now.&quot;  He continues, &quot;If you\'re conna have pizza with someone else, what do you have to do?  You gotta talk about what you want.  Even if you\'re going to have the same pizza you always have, you say, \'We getting the usual?\'  Just a check-in.  And square, round, thick, thin, stuffed crust, pepperoni, stromboli, pineapple - none of these are wrong; variety in the pizza model doesn\'t come with judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>In a TED talk he says, &quot;There are a million different kinds of pizza.  There\'s a million different toppings.  There are a million different ways to eat pizza.  And none of them are wrong, they\'re different.  So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexual education?  If we could create sexuality education that invites people to think about their own desires, to make deliberate decisions about what they want, to talk about it with their partners, and to ultimately look not for some external outcome, but for what feels satisfying.&quot;

<p>Philadelphia Magazine journalis had to have been been in the classroom with this scumbag creature reporting as follows:
&quot;The school day is almost over, and the students at Friends\' Central sit in groups in their hoodies and jeans as an animated Vernacchio, weraing a long-sleeve lavender button-down and an eggplant-colored tie, approached te topic of the day: \'What is sex?\'</p>
<p>He strools around the room passing out white envelopes.  Inside wach are pieces of paper describing various sexual acts, from kissing and feeling someone\'s body parts  to more advance features, like fellation and cunnilingus (which the 9th-graders have trouble pronouncing) and \'penile-penetration\' of boththe vagina and anus.  \' Imagine your friend  just told you - Dude, I had sex last night\', Vernacchio says.  \'What activities would have had to happen?\'</p>
<p>THe kids discuss the cards for a few minutes, then slowly shuffle to the whiteboard where they use their magnets to display the definitions of sex.  Every group has different answers, but they all agree on one requirement: penile penetration of the vagina.  Vernacchio has a problem with this and offers a statistic from a sex researcher...&quot;</p>
<p>I can\'t go on with this.  It\'s all here in the link.  It\'s just too much.  It\'s just too unbelievable.

            I am posting a lot about Quakers here because I once drove by a Quaker pre-school and saw child-sized headstones dotting the front lawn.  Even though I learned later it's common for a Quaker meeting house/school/burial ground to be all together, churches do that too, something about the sight haunted me.  Especially since the Clintons chose a Quaker school for their child, and many other elites have as well.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            Food for thought:
           </p>
           <p>
            While I was unable to find
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            threads or comments tying Quakerism, or the Friends' 'elite' schools, to Pedogate, I found this comment in a thread on /pol/ called "Trafficking, Pizza, Pedo General":
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The
             <strong>
              Fox
             </strong>
             family are an Anglo-Scot-Irish
             <strong>
              Illuminati bloodline
             </strong>
             involved with the British Peerage, British government, and the founding of the
             <strong>
              Quakers.
             </strong>
             They were also merchants and bankers that helped to create Barclays Bank. They are the Earls of Ilchester in the UK and own large amounts of land. Another branch from Cornwall helped to establish the
             <strong>
              Quakers
             </strong>
             and were involved with the merchant trades and banking.
             <strong>
              George Fox who is not identified as a relative of the Fox family of Cornwall
             </strong>
             established the
             <strong>
              Quakers or Religious Society of Friends.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Catholic is defined as universal and claims to control all Christian denominations including the
             <strong>
              Quakers.
             </strong>
             The Fox family are intermarried with the Barclay family who are also
             <strong>
              Quakers and they established Barclays Bank
             </strong>
             which has assets estimated at over 1.2 trillion today. The David Barclay and Frederick Barclay are relatives of this family and worth 6.5 billion. The Barclays brothers own Press Holdings and Telegraph Media Group.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Fox family established Fox, Fowler and Company which was bought by
             <strong>
              another Quaker bank called Lloyds Bank
             </strong>
             and Lloyds Banking Group with assets estimated today at over 817 billion. Liam Fox is an influential British politician with an Irish Roman Catholic background from Scotland. Liam Fox is Secretary of State for International Trade, President of the Board of Trade and was previously the Secretary of State for Defence where he supported using military force against Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

            <p>
             Deep down, I believe these two spiritual traditions [Quaker circles and witchcraft] have important core values in common….there are usually plenty of Friends ready to reassure me that I am welcome; they tell me that there are plenty of Pagans within Quakerdom

            That sounds like grooming
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            From one anti-SIECUS/Calderone pamphlet, 1968:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Page 2:
            </p>
            <p>
             However, the thrust of SIECUS is to get the most sex information to the child as early as possible to ostensibly counteract what Dr. Calderone describes as misinformation children learn from parents….
            </p>
            <p>
             Page 3:
            </p>
            <p>
             Her answer to the 'question, "How can I judge if our sex-education courses are good?" is an amazing, "I'm afraid that parents cannot exercise judgments as to quality in terms of content because most parents are not qualified.

             OMG!  I must have been in a Funk Fog.   Why did I not pick up on that?  WOW.  Wynnewood could be a Satanic Area since our Victim was a member of a cult family.  I am sure there were other cult families around there as well.  Is this moron a SRA product?  Hmm.  Wonder where he went to school. I am going to send her the article.  WOW Again.  and Thank You!

               I also found that he admitted he was an Irish Catholic and that he taught at the same Catholic HS he went to.  All Boys!!!  He goes out of his way to never mention the schools he went to but I am sure he must have gone to all RC schools since his parents were Die Hard Catholics.  WOW.  Wonder if he was abused by a priest.  God, every article I have seen almost, he talks about pizza.  You should do a post on him in particular and his background.  I have tried to connect him to PIE but can find nothing.  There is something behind his agenda.  I think it is the Normalization Tactic.  He talks about LGBTQA  WTH is A?  I forgot. Dang, they are going to add the whole Bleeping alphabet before they are done.

            When I went to school they separated the boys and girls when they even gave the girls the talk about the time of the month.  Then we were also separated later in 7th grade for the very simple and generic man and woman talk.  Wow.  We have come a long way baby.  I bet their parents don't know what's going on in that class.  Vernacchio seems to just love the word pizza.

             Actually, the Phildelphia mag article states that no parent has ever complained.  This is just another story about the blatant in-your-face slap-in-the-face reality of manipulation of the masses.

             Just another ho-hum event in most people's lives as they watch the next movie or episode of whatever s$%t  they watch on tv, neither knowing nor caring what their children are up to.

              The Binge Watching Netflix Generation.   Shameful.   Also the NYT is a sympathizer with the pizza crowd.  The Head of the Times was with the BBC when he covered for Savile for years.
