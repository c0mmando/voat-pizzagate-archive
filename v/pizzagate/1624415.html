<p>&quot;The government in November hit Yin and Ng with fresh charges, accusing them of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing former U.N. officials, including former deputy U.N. ambassador from the Dominican Republic Francis Lorenzo, who has since pled guilty.
But Yin fought against two tax charges added against him under this new indictment, which allege he concealed a portion of his own income and helped Lorenzo route bribery money into a Dominican company to avoid U.S. detection. Yin said these counts don’t adequately allege that he committed actual crimes, instead focusing on lawful actions like wiring money or requesting cash payments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The reasons, the whistleblowers tell Inner City Press, is so that Feltman\'s UN pension can &quot;vest.&quot;
But is it wise for the UN to spend taxpayer money in this way, keeping on an official so closely aligned with Hilary Clinton?</p>

<p>&quot;But where is the UN communications guidance (or 2017 propaganda plan by Under Secretary General Cristina Gallach) in all this?
Nowhere. Intentionally so. 
The communications chief of the UN, already named by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services as having done no due diligence on Ng Lap Seng, the defendant in the first of two UN bribery cases, promulgated a self-serving rah-rah trying to promote herself, not the Organization. Her CYA made an A of the UN.&quot;</p>

            ...Macau, which is separated from Hong Kong by only a strip of water, has always been considered a main channel of corruption and money laundering for CCP officials. Earlier this year, the Chinese Central Discipline Inspection (CCDI) stationed a team leader of discipline inspection in the State Council of Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The team leader, Li Qiufang, recently told the media that the corruption within the system in Hong Kong and Macau is under investigation. Meanwhile, a few major cases were cracked in Macau.
           </p>
           <p>
            These include the breakthroughs in Ng’s complex bribery scheme, the imprisonment of the nephew of Macau casino tycoon Stanley Ho for manipulating prostitution, and the arrest of former Macau Attorney General Ho Chio Meng for corruption.

               I figured they were in cahoots then but now I'm sure I had no idea how bad. The documentary Spin, is also interesting, I saw that first and it made me wonder how Clinton's got so much power back then but now I am confused who has more power, Bush's or Clintons.

                they seem to swing back and forth to keep up properly distracted, but they are more the "front" and its the bankers and cia running things. This becomes clear when nothing really changes despite who is in the white house.

                  Hard to know, seems that Trump is acting like a bulldozer. I think Comey threw the election to Trump, being aware of all the evidence, and finally getting a Trump administration as an opportunity to "clean house". But I worry nothing will come of all this.

            "...Although the government hasn't said what it suspects Ng's cash was really for, prosecutor Daniel Richenthal said at a Saturday bail hearing that Yin admitted after his arrest "that among other things that cash was sent to people to engage in unlawful activities."
           </p>
           <p>
            Ng, who was linked to Chinese businessman Charlie Trie's effort to funnel foreign cash to Democrats for the 1996 election, is being held without bail after the government told a judge that his enormous wealth made him too much of a flight risk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prosecutor Janis Echenberg said he was worth more than $1.8 billion, made $25 million a month, had private planes worth $30 million, had wired $20 million into the United States since 2010, and when arrested had 20 credit cards, three phones, $30,000 in Hong Kong currency and a gold and diamond encrusted watch worth $200,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            She also told Magistrate Sarah Netburn that Ng had previously dodged a grand jury subpoena in a different case, and had absented himself from the United States for five years after his name surfaced in the probe that led to Trie's conviction on campaign finance charges...."

             He was never scheduled to testify against Clinton.  This is made up.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was under indictment for corruption and there were pre trial meetings up coming up.  His trial was not even set to begin.

              That is the one I missed.  I never believed that story about his dying when the barbells fell on his neck, and also the story of a heart attack.  They just are not good at lying.  They do it a lot, but just aren't good at it.  But we sure have been good at believing them.  Have to run to a meeting, will check that link out.  Thanks.

            I haven't read all your links yet, this is related to the UN guy who got bar-bell suicided. John Ashe, days before he was due to testify he suffocated lifting weights. Check out his picture and tell me if you believe that story.

             Thanks, there has been at least one post relating to suspicion of UN being involved in pizzagate.  The last article is recent 
"The communications chief of the UN, already named by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services as having done no due diligence on Ng Lap Seng"

              Many years ago I went to a lecture by the Canadian guy who was in charge of the UN peacekeeping in Rwanda. It was heartbreaking, the photos of the abuses that they UNpeacekeepers were not allowed to interfere in, and they were made to look the other way. The whole controversy was orchestrated by the Belgians to create internal civil war so as to exploit the resources there. The canadian guy was so distraught about it all that he was suicidal for years afterwards til he finally started giving lectures. Bill Clinton rolled in at the end and claimed himself and the US a hero. (in the Rwanda genocide, not the lecture). the UN is not what it seems.
