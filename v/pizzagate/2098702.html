            'Putting Americans at risk merely for them to create some phantom scapegoat for their humiliating election loss......' - THAT WAS JUST A SMALL PART OF IT, THE MAIN REASON IS THEIR DISGUSTING PRIVATE APPETITES FOR 'PIZZA' That is what all this is about!  They know people would forgive them for their 'election loss' but no NORMAL person would EVER forgive them for their disgusting, despicable, conduct if it got out into the public arena.  That is their PANIC!! Look how hard it has been for 1,000s of us trying to break through that barrier wall.  They have had years unchallenged and it just made it stronger to control people.....BUT....the wall is weakening, we need to push harder, because once that crack comes, the WHOLE vulgar lot is going to come spewing out!!!

            Wow.  That is ridiculous.
           </p>
           <p>
            So how does this frame job work?  The DNC releases their own emails to Wikileaks?
           </p>
           <p>
            The cybersecurity team hired by the DNC announced that Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear hacked the DNC system a month before the emails were leaked.
           </p>
           <p>
            So exactly how does this frame work?  We will release our emails which will make us look bad, because our main goal is not to win an election, but to "frame a nuclear super power."

             Oh look, the shill is here trying to defend the leftist elites again. That means this thread is in fact true.
            </p>
            <p>
             You still refuse to answer why you have the need to have 3+ accounts. The honest have no need for that. Only shills need that many accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why don't you answer when pressed about those audit differences Dark Math kept mentioning.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why don't you ever respond when pressed about the Clinton Foundation's financial involvement in the "White Phosphorous Incident". Unless of course you're an intellectual coward and a hypocrite.
            </p>
            <p>
             GTFO shill. You contribue NOTHING of value to neither this community or to life in general. Hint: Being a shill doesn't give anything of value to life or society, making you a waste.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hey guys, you know which arrow to hit in order to silence this shill, so bring on the "brigade".

              I think you mean "Khazarian"....right? I could talk about them in more detail, their fake conversion (they were basically a satanist culture during the 1st millenium AD) and their involvement in the Russian Revolution.

            Most of us already knew the Russia collusion story was complete bullshit, especially those of us who have researched the Clinton Foundation. Projection, much?! Thanks for this. It is a huge deal. I will be showing this to my family and friends who get tongue tied when I bring up Russia now.

             don't forget to remind them of the earlier precedents of media lying to the people:  Mobile Labs, aluminum tubes, yellow cake uranium from Niger, Iraqi terrorists (only 1 of 19), anthrax...

              Everyone (as CNN sting vids show) has always known the collusion story had NOTHING behind it for the simple reason that Russia wouldnt need or benefit from any to sabotage THEIR less-desired candidate.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>

              Trump can still independently collude with RUSSIANS because both he and Putin are bought and paid for by JEWISH BUSINESS INTERESTS
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Jew-media simply needed an overarching narrative to raise TV viewership and pretensd Trump illegitimate and constantly on the defensive.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Basically its all Jewish lies.  How can you not notice that theres no "good side" because Breitbart and FOX and InfoWars are Jewish-produced controlled opposition (who have savaged pizzagate).
           </p>
           <p>
            Tucker Carlson even acknowledged that he wouldnt allow the Daily Caller to badmouth his other employers.  Jewish money is vital for any political campaign or media company.

            They freak out so much about PG because its mainly THEIR THING:
           </p>
           <p>
            They run the modern art world
           </p>
           <p>
            They run the newsmedia
           </p>
           <p>
            They are loyal to a foreign state
           </p>
           <p>
            They have enough power to put dual citizens of that foreign state into CABINET POSITIONS
           </p>
           <p>
            That foreign state has repeatedly been caught
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1997494">
             engaging in sexual blackmail
            </a>
            in addition to violent false flags against Americans
           </p>
           <p>
            Also their mysticism includes the PG symbolism (Alefantis even wore the red string) and their history includes occult human sacrifice. Also it explains the representation of Greeks, Italians, and Armenians in PG.
           </p>
           <p>
            Couldnt be more obvious, though I have other strong evidence, especially regarding the CIA serving Jewish interests even domestically.
