</p>
<p>With this in mind I came up with an idea weeks ago on something I could actually do.  And after reading this post (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1474315">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1474315)</a>) I have decided I should share my idea with others.</p>
<p>Several companies have supported people or groups perpetrating this filth.  I believe they should be held responsible for their affiliation.</p>
<p>Let’s get right to it:</p>
<p>Many people were sickened by the display put on by Kreemart (<a href="http://kreemart.com/">http://kreemart.com/)</a>)  at the MOCA, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 2011.  Hosted by Marina Abromovic:  <a href="https://sli.mg/a/mdv0hG">https://sli.mg/a/mdv0hG</a></p>
<p>In addition to government funding, a list of MOCA’s supporters can be found on their website: <a href="http://www.moca.org/support/many-thanks">http://www.moca.org/support/many-thanks</a>  They include: Wells Fargo, Delta Airlines and Steinway &amp; Sons. </p>
<p>A list of Kreemart’s sponsors can be found on their website: <a href="http://kreemart.com/about/">http://kreemart.com/about/</a>.  Some include:  Dunkin’ Donuts, Kool-Aide, and MOMA (The Modern Museum of Art)</p>
<p>Continuing, a list of MOMA funders can be found on their website: <a href="https://www.moma.org/support/corporate_membership/corporate_roster">https://www.moma.org/support/corporate_membership/corporate_roster</a></p>
<p>I was also troubled by the attendance of prominent celebrities at the event, Will Ferell, Gwen Stefani, Pamela Anderson and many others.  Some have claimed that perhaps the participants were unaware of the significance of the event.  Personally I don’t believe that is an excuse.  Any person spending any amount of time in that environment should realize that is not a place they need to stay, far less smile and pose for photos.  And all of these celebrities have sponsors; for example commercial sponsors of ‘The Voice’.</p>
<p>There is no end to the supporters of these degenerates.  There are many articles praising the ‘artwork’ showcased in Tony Podesta’s house: <a href="https://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">https://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/</a> perhaps these publications sponsors should be made aware that you do not support Mr Podesta’s taste in art.</p>
<p>There are many, many articles and videos praising Marina Abrovic’s ‘art’.  And all of those groups have sponsors as well.</p>
<p>And I don’t have to tell you there are dozens and dozens of media sources denouncing all of this as a conspiracy theory; and now a definitively, debunked one.  And all of those sources have sponsors of their own.  There is a minority in America that believe all of this is acceptable.  It is time for them to realize that they are not the majority.</p>
<p>It’s time to hit these people where it hurts, their wallets.  There was a time when filth like this was regulated to dark rooms and secret meetings.  Now its all normal.  In your face.  Government funded.  It’s touted as art.  It’s praised as genius.  I think its disgusting.   Sure, that is just one persons opinion.  But there was a time when people and companies had enough good sense not to be publicly affiliated with groups that could potentially tarnish their reputation.  That time is gone.  It is up to us to restore it.  Sure this will push them back in to the shadows.  But one step at a time. </p>
<p>My opinions on satanism are irrelevant.  I certainly have nothing against art, or free speech.  What I do have a problem with is when all of this is part of a system supporting and perpetuating negativity towards children.</p>
<p>Lastly, I in no way want to take-away from or derail the important work that others are doing for this cause.  Again, I just felt helpless to facilitate any change and this was the only way I could think of actually doing something, rather than just talking about the problem.</p>
<p>I have gotten the ball rolling, if any one is interested the next step would be to comprise a list of sponsors and their contact information so that our attempts to reach them can be coordinated.</p>',

            Good thinking, OP. This could help to get the ball rolling to force the mainstream media to discuss things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, I don't think it will accomplish anything, but the good thing is that it's a safe way to do it to apply pressure to organizations. Sponsoring this kind of filth is completely inappropriate.

             Thanks.  I agree this may not get much done, but then again it could.  Look at what's happening with Breitbart.  And as you said, it's safe.
