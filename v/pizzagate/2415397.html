<blockquote>
<p>The 10-page redacted memo written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee amounts to a rebuttal of a separate Republican memo released earlier this month. That memo alleged opposition research on Mr. Trump that was partly funded by the Democratic Party was the driving force in the government’s surveillance applications on Carter Page, who served as foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Page hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The memo’s release was blocked by the White House for weeks over concerns about the disclosure of classified information. The redacted version released Saturday was the product of negotiations among Democrats on the committee, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Justice Department and the White House.</p>
<p>The GOP memo alleged that Mr. Page was improperly surveilled on the basis of information from former British spy Christopher Steele, whose work was being paid through Democratic Party intermediaries.</p>
<p>The Democratic memo released Saturday said that in asking a court to approve surveillance of Mr. Page, federal investigators relied on much more information than the Steele research, detailing Mr. Page’s “past relationships with Russian spies and interaction with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign.”</p>
<p>Mr. Page has confirmed he was targeted for recruitment by Russian intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover in a high-profile 2015 New York spy case. He wasn’t charged with any crimes in the case.</p>
<p>While the Republican memo said the FBI and Justice Department had omitted from its warrant application that Mr. Steele’s research had been funded by the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic memo states the application clearly disclosed the document was produced by a party “likely looking for information that could be used to discredit” then-candidate Trump.</p>
<p>A focus of the Republican memo was the FBI and Justice Department’s treatment of Mr. Page, whom it described as a “volunteer adviser to the Trump presidential campaign.”</p>
<p>Law-enforcement officials obtained four court approvals to surveil Mr. Page, the first in October 2016, and then three renewals. The Democratic memo noted that Mr. Page parted ways with the Trump campaign before the Justice Department applied for a warrant.</p>

            reading about this now.  Some key points.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nunes memo said that the FISA application was tainted because they did not say who hired Christopher Steele.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dem memo says 
*the FISA application mentioned  Steele “was hired by politically motivated U.S. persons and entities and that his research appeared intended for use ‘to discredit’ Trump’s campaign,”
           </p>
           <p>
            Other points,
           </p>
           <p>
            *Steele Dossier was used in a "narrow" way in the FISA application.   "Multiple" other sources were used.
           </p>
           <p>
            *FBI trusted Steel because he had a “multiyear history” of providing solid info on Russia.
           </p>
           <p>
            *Surveillance of Carter Page was justified
           </p>
           <p>
            *Aspects of the dossier have been "independently verified."  What these aspects are are redacted.
           </p>
           <p>
            *FBI had multiple inquiries about folks connected to the Trump campaign BEFORE they got the Steele Dossier.
           </p>
           <p>
            *No abuse of FISA process by DOJ for FBI
           </p>
           <p>
            What are folks hearing  about this?

             Biggest bombshell is the FBI assessed Carter Page to be a Russian agent.

              <strong>
               Carter Page, someone the FBI assessed to be an agent of the Russian government.
              </strong>
              DOJ met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement, by demonstrating:
— contemporaneous evidence of Russia's election interference;
— concerning Russian links and outreach to Trump campaign officials;
— Page's history with Russian intelligence; and
— (REDACTED) Page's suspicious activities in 2016, including in Moscow.
