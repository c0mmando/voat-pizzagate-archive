<p>PETER STRZOK THE ONE IN THE NEWS
Is in his 40\'s, works for the FBI, and was the only person to interview HRC with no recording.</p>
<p>THE FAMILY TREE</p>
<p>MELISSA HODGMAN
wife of Peter Strzok (uses maiden name) who was promoted to the role as director in the SEC at the same time that the FBI was drafting the exoneration letter for HRC\'s emails.</p>
<p>PETER STRZOK, SR.
Peter\'s (the one in the news) father who was in the Army Corps of Engineers.  He was a career expert in sanctions nuclear activity in Iran.</p>
<p>JAMES STRZOK
brother of Peter Strzok, Sr.  He is a Jesuit priest working in Kenya and also has a solid military career with deep knowledge in energy and resources.</p>
<p>MARK STRZOK
Peter Sr.\'s younger brother who works for Mammomet, a world leader in big cranes with a specialty in moving nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>DEVIN STRZOK
Mark Strzok\'s son who is a Coast Guard graduate and lives in DC.</p>
<p>MARIANNA STRZOK nee CARTWRIGHT
Mark Strzok\'s wife and Devin\'s mother.</p>
<p>GENERAL JAMES CARTWRIGHT
whose daughter is Marianna Strzok and the grandfather of Devin Strzok.  General Cartwright was pardoned by Barak Obama on his last day of office. Once known as &quot;Obama\'s favorite general,&quot; he pleaded guilty to the felony charge of lying to the FBI during its investigation into the leaking of classified information about covert operations against Iran to two journalists.</p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/18/obamas-pardon-of-gen-james-cartwright-is-a-new-twist-in-the-war-on-leaks/">https://theintercept.com/2017/01/18/obamas-pardon-of-gen-james-cartwright-is-a-new-twist-in-the-war-on-leaks/</a></p>
<p>Go back to March 12, 2015.  Devin Strzok, Katherine Ustler, and Eugene D. Mok are scheduled for a &quot;West Wing Tour&quot; that was requested on March 6, 2015.  Their &quot;tour&quot; started at 9:45 pm and ended at 11:59 pm. </p>
<p>Not much info on Katherine Ustler other than her being a Lieutenant in the Coast Guard.  I am uncertain if she is/was married to Devin Strzok or a Coast Guard acquaintance.</p>
<p>Eugene Mok\'s history is kind of vague but he was once a 2nd year law student and was part of the US Navy for 6 years.  He &quot;left active duty to pursue a legal career dealing with national security&quot;; worked in the intelligence community; interned with the Chief of Naval Operations Special Counsel; and interned with the DOJ National Security Division.</p>

<p>Peter Strzok was THE person who requested the server containing HRC\'s email backups and the last person to see it on 10/15/16.</p>
<p>A tweet from 12/24/17 from Truth in Government reads:</p>
<p>&quot;Remember the Datto server node with Hillary\'s emails?  A panicked FBI grabbed the Datto cloud on 10/06/15 after a Grassley letter to Datto 10/05. After it was checked in as evidence it was never mentioned again.&quot;</p>

            I can't say I have any faith anymore. Whenever it comes to the people on top, evidence goes missing then people forget about it and are distracted by the new theatrics. It goes on forever.
