            The truck was registered in 2017 in Varna Bulgaria and yes it is owned by an Irish woman. When something so heinous occurs you can bet this was not the first time so many were trafficked by this truck. Trafficking is a huge money maker as we all know. They better release her name soon. Someone able to arrange such excursions and pay and hide (there must be bribes) surely has elite connections. The authorities that are morning and lamenting surely have taken some of those bribes and are as guilty as the owner.

            They might be Vitetnamese, at least some of them, with fake Chinese passports. One woman seems to have travelled to France before she was put into the container. The youngest person was 15 it seems.

             The scale of this goes way beyond CEMEX. I'm currently investigating locally and I don't want to draw attention to these other companies. What I can tell you is that there's a high probability of a global, industrial-scale slave trade happening under our noses.

            They're reporting in the UK press over here its pretty much Snakeheads/triad groups. When I lived in Glasgow there was a restaurant called Zen on Sauchihall Street. I used to go after a night out and get a take out. Every week there were different girls, one 'manager', obviously the Madam. The place was raided by other triads and a guy was shot. It shut down for a few weeks then was back up and running.

            The similar story from 2000, where 58 people were found in a refrigerated truck. Again they arrested the driver, again they are mostly male, Chinese, but there were two survivors. In this case the refrigerator was not on, so did they just suffocate ?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The bodies of 58 people have been found in the back of a lorry at the English port of Dover.
            </p>
            <p>
             The driver of the Dutch-registered lorry, which arrived from Zeebrugge, Belgium, just before midnight, has been arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 54 men and four women are thought to have been illegal immigrants and reports suggest they are of Chinese origin. Two survivors, both men, have been taken to hospital. Truck drivers at Dover expressed shock but not surprise at the grisly discovery of bodies.

            I don't think this is what this was, it sounds a lot more like slave labour or something as all were Chinese and most of them were male and all, I think, were adults. Seems more like a fuck up that accidentally killed them and unwittingly blew open a human trafficking operation. That may well lead to much, much more of course. It reminds me of a storyline from the TV show "The Wire" actually, only they were prostitutes that were accidentally killed in a shipping trailer due to the air vent being squashed shut.

             Not all trafficking is children, so many impoverished adults become victims too. They are lured, groomed, sometimes born in to this. Some are trafficked by choice, because they had no other choice. It seems being these are adults, they died accidentally in transit and needed to be incenerated. I'm sorry to even have to type that sentence.

             Amazing Polly just finished a video about what could have happened to these adults. They could be victims of human experiments?

             Yes the truck was refrigerated. They speculate that the migrants froze to death. Reporters in Britain are saying that this helps them bypass border scans.

              That doesn't make any sense.  Pretty sure temp doesn't affect backscatter, millimeter wave, and/or xray used to scan vehicles at border crossings.

                Yes, you can block x-rays, but that is a big red flag.  Like having 2 laptops next to each other when going through the airport.  They'll make you pull and separate them as the x-ray machine can't see through it.  A big black box on the screen.

               The suggestion the media came up with was it stops IR heat detection, but as you say, I'm sure that is not the only detection method being used, so that might just be a cover for the real reason the 2 times this has happened they were in refridgerated vans (The same thing happened with 58 Chinese in 2000)

               The insulation might black x-ray and similar scans.  Refrigeration would mask heat while the generator running would mask noise.  Alternatively they may just get less scrutiny.

                  E. Coli, cyclospordia, etc. which comes from the wetbacks shitting in the plant rows is microscopic.  THe scanners they use at the border are looking at the level you see in the airport.  Not a microscope.  Did you go to school?

            So these were frozen bodies right?  More than likely done so to preserve them.  I am guessing they were being taken to a chop shop to be stripped down for parts.  Kidneys, organs, bone marrow, etc.  What we are probably seeing is possible a processing plant for body parts to be sold on the black market.

             I am with you on the Organ Harvesting angle. Theoretically, Would that make Cemex a front for organ/fluid sales? Or are they just your global disposal site for people in these grizzly businesses, and the truck didn't make it inside that day?

              Certainly would make a fantastic way to get rid of excess "evidence" once harvested. I think the mob has been doing that forever.

              Good question.  Maybe a processing plant for parts.  I do not think frozen organs can be harvested for transplant, but for food and other things, yes.  Ever heard of a cannibal butcher?  Frozen bodies, like you see meat on racks

               Organs wouldn't be useful once frozen would they? And, why so many organs at once? To whom do all these harvested organs go? Are there that many sick elites?

               Is it possible they were victims of human experiments?

               Processing tissue seems likely, for who knows what kind of sick ritual. Take a moment now to pray for the enslaved people who are still alive awaiting this fate.

               The restaurant in NY or just a cannibal purveyor ? If its not for ogran's, blood, or human trafficking (gone wrong), why not just move the

                Cannibal butchers.  Give them a body and the butcher will prepare it for you.  Some elite orders ribs, he chops them up and prepares them.  Could be keeping the entire body intact is fresher or tastes better?  Who knows.

            What's your take on the whole Arizona CEMEX VOP story? It was drowned in a sea of disinfo and smear campaigning here and many of us don't know what to make of it.

             If I may stick my nose in here on this one...
            </p>
            <p>
             The "pedo camp" was fabricated entirely, deliberately on/near CEMEX property. There's three possible reasons for this in my opinion:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              It was done in order to bring attention to CEMEX and relevant connections, to stimulate a dig albeit under false pretense but at least for good reason.
             </li>
             <li>
              It was done in order to seed disinformation into the mix and otherwise create a pre-text for stamping out anyone (discredit by association) who might look into CEMEX and relevant connections for another reason, or just pizzagaters in general.
             </li>
             <li>
              It was done purely as a troll against pizzagaters, with no intent to defend/assist the corrupt.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Personally, I'm leaning more towards 2, but 1 and 3 are equally possible.

              The dude that fronted for VOP was a lunatic. He brought attention to the situation but in a bad way.

              He is broke. Looking for money. I still have not figured out what he will do for money. He might be a good guy that just does not want to work a real job. I don't know. I DO THINK his big show of saving children was mainly a grifter thing looking for money.

            the bodies go in the limestone kilns ( about 1800*F )... not much left after that... and anything that is left (skull, teeth, hip &amp; femur bones) gets pulverised in to dust as the cooked limestone runs through the crusher...

            OMG. This is how we know how the blood gets in the cement!  I knew when I saw this on the news there was something super nefarious going on.

            There is much to dig into here. It’s not just going on over here. They are world wide. With HRC connections. Mint Press did a good article. Thanks for looking into this. This really angers me. So maybe they were possibly sec trafficked first?  What are the ages. Where any minors in those 39. Morbid.

              Hey. Yes I agree. I believe all the crime somehow facilitates organ harvesting in some way. Drug cartels that kidnsp for sex trafficking and then the victims become disposable and used for organs bathos world has become a vile place. The devil has made inroads.

             The report made it clear that there was only one child and the rest were adults, though that may have changed. The early reports were very certain of some facts while at the same time getting other facts (like the route) completely wrong.

             As for HRC connections, Aggregate Industries is also a stone's throw from the depot. Aggregate is a subsidiary of HolcimLafarge, the global market leader in concrete, and Hillary used to be on the board of directors back in the 90s. This has been largely omitted from the internet, but one major revelation he made was that cement barges owned by the company transported military tech out of the United States to the Hussein regime in Iraq.
