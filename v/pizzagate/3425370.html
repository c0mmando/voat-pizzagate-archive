            I'm going to reply simply because is a combination of two things here, one a sacred geometric symbol, and the other being a sacred geometric circle.
           </p>
           <p>
            The spiral, or golden mean, is defined as the enteral wave/propagation form. Instead of a closed circle on a two-dimensional plane, the spiral (also representing the golden mean of proportions) represents movements of time, through cycles of events. It is a variation on infinity with a specific attribute correlated with motion/time/space.
           </p>
           <p>
            The triangle also being a sacred symbol, is generally represented to be a simplified symbol for fractal emergence. Or even crystalline structures (crystals being an amazing naturally occurring element).
           </p>
           <p>
            In other forms of meta-analysis related to all kinds of other forms of socio-sciences, biology, medicine, etc., 3 occurs often. Or the trinity of–whatever you're studying. It happens all the time in 3, 5, 7, and so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not claiming to know what the reason is for the FBI claiming the symbol is related to pedophilia, but I have personally seen rings worn by people in the early 80s.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have also shared a lot of information here, and on other threads, showing a lot of ritual abuse (in whatever form you choose to cite) is related to occult practices where by an individual is awakened from their beast state. From primal impulse into higher-awareness. This can all be researched through more established occult literature. I've also made pretty strong correlations against OSS/CIA/NSA programs from the 20s-60s where they were seeking to create super soldiers, meta-humans, uber-men (super-man), along with more archaic forms of recorded knowledge as a basis for their torture programs and abuse/stalking tactics (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress).
           </p>
           <p>
            I've also stated that sex magic, or more perverted forms of it, where consider the lazy-mans version to awakening. Try fasting for two-weeks or walking 10 miles a day, or whatever you can do to change your frame of mind and awaken new aspects of your brain. Some of you may remember the 80s news was filled with reports of China still using the switch on children's legs and feet in order to awaken their bodies earlier, and then making them perform in the olympics. I personally remember my Grandmother, a self-claimed Nazarene, stating that you can potty train an infant faster if you let them know they have a butt to control; she would poke their butt cheeks with a toothpick in order to ignite the sensation/nerve responses (not to hurt them or draw blood) so the infant would recognize the area through pain-centers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think objective researchers have to be careful with both magic and claims about magic. Or so-called magic and 'sigils' because this stuff is real. Just not in the context of modern media pundits and religious fanatics.
           </p>
           <p>
            People without children see things quite differently than people with children. It is a massive developmental phase of consciousness for both the parents and children. Provided the parents are actually participating actively in their child's development, not pushing it off to the state or hired help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be objective and research everything with a critical eye towards interpretation and the vastness of recorded human knowledge.

              Templeton continues to pour millions of dollars into origin and evolution of life projects that result in fiasco: (1) the 2013 origins conference at
              <strong>
               CERN
              </strong>
              ; (2) funding of religious scholars by NASA &amp; Templeton to investigate how the religious community would respond to the discovery of life in outer space; (3) the dig through 18 levels of civilization for religious evidence at 10,000-year-old Çatalhöyük—to cite just a few.  But science is not being compromised for big laughs, it’s being compromised by greedy academics and their university money managers who, with a wink, look the other way while Templeton’s Big Creep mission blurs the lines between science and religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the stickiest origins projects Templeton has recently funded is “Cooperation and Interpretation in the Emergence of Life,” which looks to find purposeful RNA fragments that agree to cooperate.  Six hundred thirty thousand dollars ($630,000) has been awarded for said project to the team of Christopher Southgate-–a British theologian/biochemist, and Portland State University chemistry professor Niles Lehman.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lehman was recently elected president of the nonprofit origin of life society “ISSOL” replacing Sandra Pizzarello.  As ISSOL president, Lehman will now also be majorly soliciting funds, including more from Templeton.

            I think the pedo symbols are probably older than this.

            But it's interesting that Ghislaine Maxwell had the spiral-in-a-triangle symbol on a mask in her house as a wall decoration.

            It's older than 96, but I believe the symbolism is intentional. I was posting extensively to 8chan in the weeks b4 it was shut down.

            I've been digging into the origins of the "blue spiral" and "triangle spiral" as separate threads, and both led to wilhelm reich. This blogger summarizes some of it:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            there is more to this that I haven't posted yet because I'm still trying to flesh it out, but research Reich's female acolytes and it connects directly to pre-internet pedo mailing groups

             Reich's work was the first to accept ESP and PSI as a wave form, or unseen energy (called it Orgone) and was a big influence for many  scientists who did support Einsteins borrowed interest in piggy-backing on newton's stolen ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding the orgasm as a power center, that is exactly what tantric yoga/sex are about. Conception is a sacred art, respected by almost every religion known to man.
            </p>
            <p>
             That blogger is inflating a lot of pain into their mind by viewing reich's work. For a less unscrupulous interpretation of riech, try Gerhard Weber; Dawn Of The Cosmic Age. Not filled with new ageness, or anit new age speak. Orgone is also a mineral not related to orgasim.
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically the same notions of the Jedi Force, Matrix Trilogy, Egyptian Magic.
            </p>
            <p>
             But now I'm going to research riech a bit more myself based on your posts.

              I don't think any of that nonsense is defensible. The orgasm most certainly is not a mystical power center and the mystery religions that teach such things are implicated in these very issues. Sex magic is evil and the "Cosmic Age" is new-age speak for the age where the "Cosmic Christ", aka Lucifer, will awaken humanity.

               Nothing you typed or stated is correct. Much energy can be drawn and retained from celibacy and with-holding the release of an orgasm.
              </p>
              <p>
               No such thing as new age. Every day is new. That is a social construct designed to undermine knowledge and allow it to be controlled through fear-mongering.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can either read the book referenced or not. But I doubt you did, and instead simply defaulted to the books you have read, and then confabulated a response based on that book.

               Lucifer is an anagram of Lucid, which is an anagram of Euclid; using geometry to divide space and time, as well as creating letters, maths, language, architecture, sailing, and much more. It is a vatican psyop. Nothing more.

                What kind of energy are you talking about? Mystical energy is a New Age belief. New Age beliefs aren't new, but they are new in the West. Most of them are made up, channeled or come from paganism such as the eastern religions. Also, Reich is directly supporting pedophilia with his psuedoscientific beliefs, (there are direct quotes) which appear similar to Dr. Kinsey's child sex pedophile "studies." It's all nonsense designed to push the pedophile agenda. Lucifer was not an invention of the Vatican, though most New Age nonsense does derive from Jesuits who work with the Vatican. Lucifer is a much older idea embodied in the world religions predating the Vatican by thousands of years. For example. Prometheus is the Lucifer figure who rebels against the Gods and gives man "fire," or secret knowledge, against the will of the Gods.

                 You didn't read the book. And you make over-generalized and hyperbolic claims like most fanatics do. You are completely unaware of any knowledge outside of, apparently, your own book.

                 And for the onlookers, Prometheus was punished for HELPING men against ZEUS. Who actively sought out the destruction of man through the giants and consider men and woman play-things. Prometheus taught men and women to protect themselves from Zeus... Not the christian/vatican redaction of "lying to zeus." Read books friends, read many.

                  That's exactly the attributes of the Luciferian view of Lucifer. Modern Luciferianism takes its roots from Gnostic teachings as well as ancient Egyptian and Babylonian paganism. God of the material world is seen as a stubborn and sadistic figure who seeks to keep mankind in perpetual darkness while Lucifer is the savior of humanity by giving it the gift of knowledge, very much like the Prometheus figure, as you said, HELPING man against ZEUS.

                   Wrong. That is not the attributes of 'lucifer.' If you're saying Zeus ( Jupiter plus Zeus = Jesus) is God, then I'm not even sure what you are talking about other than trying to continually misrepresent truth with metaphysical demons and lies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is written in the books as is. Christians and Catholics bastardized the meanings. Before the bible was ever written.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Egypt was sacked and raided, did not free anyone, but took slaves who were initiates. Another Jew/Christian/Catholic lie.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   These days, unfortunately, it is not worth debating someone who repeats the same tired stories, over and over. While the world passes them by each day with newer and newer discoveries, some predicated on correcting previous lies, while others show a falsified understanding of previous 'facts.' You have emotional materialism with your ideas, of which, you have no knowledge of outside of one or two books written by christians, if even that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, there were no bibles when Jesus walked. So they are manufactured after the facts. Used as part of the Catholic churches attempt at a universal religion by mixing it all up. Same tactics, same lies, same misrepresentations. Same as Rome tried doing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Do more research and offer me more than tired cliches and metaphors.

                Do you believe in reincarnation? Do you believe in humanity's awakening? Do you believe that the age of Aquarius will bring that about, and that we are entering that age? Do you believe in sex magic? Do you believe that each person has a mystical energy about them? Do you believe in sacred arts, such as geometry, astrology and alchemy?
               </p>
               <p>
                You have been indoctrinated into New Age teachings. The only energies such activities and beliefs can give you are the influence of demons.

            No. The symbol has been around for hundreds of years. It's the fibonnaci sequence. The golden ratio- It's been an international symbol for Ju jitsu way before 1996... There are countless examples of this symbol- all with different meanings.
