            Hmmm, I wonder if some of these "suicides" might be what jewish pedophiles do when they're facing legal trouble for raping small children: fake their suicide, and maybe paint a few swastikas on the property for good effect.

            The most obvious omission is that news coverage includes the fact that Hixon was under investigation for sexual abuse and "inappropriate touching: ( a euphemism usually reserved for child victims) , and yet fails to include any data whatsoever about the alleged victim(s) themselves.
Since Hixon requires no further protection ( there being no lawyers present at the Pearly Gates) the only credible explanation is that pedophilia itself is being protected.

                Agree.  Erring on the side of allowing some larpers --in order to avoid banning folks who just honestly disagree-- is the better  approach.
                <br/>
                I do think extra attention to folks with obvious political agendas should be paid.  The pedos CAN'T defend pedophilia, so hurting the white hats politically, and attempting to dispirit supporters with ...for example, "Trump is an insider Globalist pedophile"...types of arguments is what they are doing at every level.

                   Q forewarned us about the LV shooting and NY terrorist incident. Q has also given us proof that he and Trump are connected. If time passes and they still haven't taken down the elite, we have a watertight case to get them arrested. (What I'm saying is that no one is short-sighted enough to give evidence that they're on the other side in the hopes that they can keep that game up forever.) If Q were a shill - which he isn't - we can definitely take him down and Trump after.

                     I meant it would be short-sighted of Trump and Q to reveal that they knew about LV and NY attacks before they happened if they weren't on our side. If you think they're just laughing to themselves after giving us misinformation, why would they prove that they knew the biggest mass-shooting in US history was about to take place - if they

                     don't intend to do anything about PizzaGate, they've just proved beyond all doubt that they're complicit and plan false flags. We would have the ultimate blackmail on them and could use the tactic of the elite against them. Their only option now is to help us.

                      .  That is really saying something.  You don't understand that fellow cult members can't be used to CORROBORATE the "wins."  Like Cooper missing a TV show.  You dont even FACT CHECK WHAT YOURE POSTING FAGGOT!  Netanyahu has not been indicted and there's no 3-family ruling elite , NOBODY gives a fuck about Saudi women driving you dipshit. JEWS rule this world for the benefit of other Jews the facts bear that out amply.

                       I always find it fun to read a comment from you that doesn't back up any of its claims in any way at all. It's also refreshing to see you change the subject when you can't explain something. It feels good, keep doing it.

                       Also, keep calling me dumb - it reminds me of the media. Next you'll say that I'm a Russian bot made by trolls who hacked the election.

                          I meant it would be short-sighted of Trump and Q to reveal that they knew about LV and NY attacks before they happened if they weren't on our side. If you think they're just laughing to themselves after giving us misinformation, why would they prove that they knew the biggest mass-shooting in US history was about to take place - if they really don't intend to do anything about PizzaGate, they've just proved beyond all doubt that they're complicit and plan false flags. We would have the ultimate blackmail on them and could use the tactic of the elite against them. Their only option now is to help us.

                           How many times are you going to misinterpret what this means? Are you feeling okay? getting enough sleep? You're clearly not thinking properly. The point is that, if they're stringing us along we'll eventually find out for sure. At that point, it is undeniable that they've staged a false flag and would be immediately exposed. No one is that stupid.

                           The blackmail point is irrelevant because we won't need to blackmail them, retard. The only reason to warn us is to help us. To think they're taunting is to admit insanity.

Your ignorance is LAUGHABLE.  Bezos is almost definitely a Jew and gates too probably.  "There are plenty of Jews who aren't evil" WOW NICE STANDARD DUMBASS.  How high a proportion of PG would u find convincing, one poster said 25% wouldn't be enough.  You are a fucking newb apparently since it is no longer in dispute here that Jews are bheind it all: people have had to resort to saying they're fake Jews called khazars, LMAO.  So it's cool to say entire Turkic or Arab nations are evil but not Jews, NICE

The JQ on the other hand has resulted in their mass expulsion hundreds of times.  BECAUSE THEY RITUALISTICALLY SLAUGHTER GENTILE CHILDREN AND DRINK THEIR BLOOD.  You can take entire college courses about Mayan ritual sacrifice and no one says a word but god forbid you mention that Jews do it too.  Who's the racist here asshole

            Possibly, or it could be that this latest suicide was because he was under investigation for sexual abuse, likely of a child. He was accused of "inapropriate touching" while at home babysitting in 2014 but the victim appeared to be too young to give enough details for an arrest. Sounds like this guy is a pedo who was about to be busted for diddling his kids! Here's more info. Hopefully more will come out over the next several days.

             That is the other obvious valid explanation. I just saw a correlation of two (probably) guilty men dying of gunshot wounds and decided to question it a little. After all, we know what they do to leakers...

            Was just about to post the same thing...Did some digging into Hixon's voting history and run-ins with the law. He sounds like a lost soul -- problems with alcohol, some DUI's, Evading Police charges, and TWO criminal investigations into sexual abuse -- one "with a child."

            While your theory has merit, I have yet to connect him to the larger scaled issue aka PIZZAGATE directly. Was hoping a red flag would leap out, but we can't make facts fit coz we want them to...
