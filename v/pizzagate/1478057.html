            have exerted with no proof that "Andrew Kline  Besta-Pizza is NOT DOJ" with NO proof that he's not. I would assume he is.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            Follow the FLYNN-JR test
           </p>
           <p>
            "Follow the Andrew Kline is DOJ" assertion until proven false, NOBODY has ever proven that Besta-Pizza is NOT DOJ.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's always been a taboo subject on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            for two reasons, (1) is that Kline is Jewish(TRIBE), (2) is that Kline is DOJ, to link DOJ with Pedo-Gate would be a narrative that NYT has never wanted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember folks the MOD's here are working with NYT to re-enforce the narrative that CPP is HQ for Clinton Satanic Games.
           </p>
           <p>
            MOD's have NEVER allowed us to discuss Andrew Kline Besta-pizza "Arab owned" DOJ. Note the guy running besta-pizza is arab, it would make complete sense that DOJ kline was in charge of passing kids to the SAUDIS under bill clinton so that clintons could become a crime family like bush, and clintons children could run USA gov forever.

             That's not true, there was a shit fight because people were asserting crap as fact. Nobody is saying your DOJ Kline isn't involved in any way, but the agent for Besta isn't him. Thats another part of investigation that maybe you should initiate with some quality research. You're trying to spin the narrative that because he's Jewish he's off limits and I certainly haven't seen that. You're a bit of a wanker thinking this, almost like you're trying to spin things in a totally warped direction. The Klein/Kline name would be pretty common, I assume, why wouldn't there be multiples of the name holding various positions in DC?

            It looks like there are 2 Andrew Klines and one Andrew Klein.
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Andrew J. Kline, ex-DOJ, AU professor, now at FCC. Graduated from Harvard. No direct connection to Comet or Besta that we know of but does have connections to Clinton

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Andrew J Kline, Veritas law firm, restaurant lawyer, Graduated from William &amp; Mary, has had Comet &amp; Bucks as Clients. Most likely to have been the guy representing Besta as well, since he specializes in restaurant law

            You are correct that Andrew Kline is the registered agent for Besta in a legal document, but that does not make him the owner.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Andrew M Klein, Klein Law Group, communications lawyer.

            Albany Law School, Doesn't appear to have anything to do with any of this stuff.  His office is also on Connecticut Ave (in a different part of town) which i think confused people.
