            Why is this individual taking shots at truthers while adding in chemtrtails which is real and mixing it with Flat Earth which is intentional disinfo? That is not a good start to an article.

            The link above for the entire sordid story and its disgusting outcome.  This asshole's net worth in 2015 was listed as $3 billion making him the 160th plus wealthiest in the world.  And, yes, most definitely he avoided prison because of marrying into the DuPont family known for their pedo connections.  Also Richards grandfather or great-grandfather was the founder of the prestigious law firm in Wilmington, DE, Richards Layton &amp; Finger.  Without a doubt, Judge Jan Jurden was given her orders or else face the consequences to let this low-life go free.

            He's part of the DuPont Family Clan and gets special treatment because they are special and deserve special treatment.  . I remember hearing the judge's decision and couldn't believe my ears.  God knows how many more innocent children have been abused by that monster. I am very glad you brought this up and it absolutely deserves attention!
