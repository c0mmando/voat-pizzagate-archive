            Interesting catch.  You know I wonder if these people do embroider their robes and other stuff with these symbols.
           </p>
           <p>
            They'd have to have professionals do it to look nice.  It'd be interesting to ask local dressmakers / tailors in the D.C. area if they've ever done custom robes with those symbols on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, they might draw less suspicion if they have some Hollywood costume designer do it and say it's for a movie...

            Reposting with proper context:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "RAPE OF CHILDREN: The End Of Silence?" is a documentary presented by Elise Lucet on France 3 on 27 March 2000. This report reveals the existence of an active pedo-Satanic network in France by unveiling lived through hell experiences suffered by several children who have been abused in very strange ceremonies which they recount and represent on drawings.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report mentions allegations of pedophile rapes allegedly suffered by a brother and sister, named in the report under the pseudonyms Pierre (born 1989) and Marie (born 1986), who claim that their father and other adults have abused them several times during sectarian ceremonies. The report mentions the existence of a pedophile network that would benefit from the protections within the leadership of justice and of French policy (thesis developed in the report).
            </p>
            <p>
             In this report and in the debate that followed, it comes to rape, ritual murder, severed heads, child graves (particularly in the Paris region in the words of prosecutor Bouillon), but it is also about the strange attitude of the justice department despite the many incriminating evidence against the father, including extracts of various eloquent conversations from telephone tapping, the justice department still forces these children to return to their father against their will despite their testimony and tears.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the end of the report follows a debate moderated by Elise Lucet. Among the guests: the Socialist MP and former Minister of Youth and Sports Frédérique Bredin, family therapist Martine Nisse, Commissioner in vehicle safety Jean-Yves Leguennec Martine Bouillon Georges Glatz, member of the Grand Council of the Canton of Vaud delegate CIDE2. The Zandvoort case is mentioned in this debate, it is said that part of the operation of the lucrative economy of these pedophile networks consists of snuff movies on DVD which feature raped and murdered children, these snuff movies are sold for the average price of 20,000 Swiss francs on the pedophile "black market", this is a very disturbing key element regarding this subject.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Here's
            <a href="https://youtu.be/r7v5tPWk7EU">
             a documentary about this Zandvoot case
            </a>
            called "The File of Shame"
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The File Of Shame was released Wednesday, May 26 of 2010, it exposes a pedophile network uncovered from a CD-ROM containing 8000 photos called the "Zandvoort File".
            </p>
            <p>
             The "Zandvoort File" first came to light in 1998 when Belgian founder of child support group 'Werkgroep Morkhoven', Marcel Vervloesem, provided a mountain of evidence to Dutch police indicating the operation of a systematic network which dealt in the kidnapping, torture and sexual abuse of children, even infants. Included in this evidence were high-profile names and matching bank account details proving their involvement. Mr. Vervloesem's reward was to be framed for child rape and possession of child pornography. He is currently languishing in a Belgian prison, suffering from terminal cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CD-ROM was obtained from Gerrit Ulrich who was then murdered in Italy. Marcel Vervloesemh discovered an additional 20 CD-ROM's in Ulrich's appartment. The 21 CD-ROMS contained around 90 000 images of children being raped, babies being raped, child mistreatment, torture and even children put to death.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who are these children? What is being done to find them?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Pizzagate researchers are on it ;)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Despite the recognition of more than 80 children including some victims of famous trials such as the "Disappeared of the Yonne" and also the actions of associations like Innocence in Danger, "Justice" still finds a place where the "Zandvoort File" is never mentioned. The Zandvoort file has long since been buried.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why such a silence about pedophile networks?
            </p>
            <p>
             On the occasion of the publication of this special issue of Karl Zéro Facts Prime, 13ème RUE supports the work of the organization Innocence in Danger which fights against pedo crime and helps victims of this horrible sick crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             These pedophile networks are real and they exist all over the world, they have ties to very prominent people in society and this is why this information is being discredited and suppressed from the general public. These horrific crimes must investigated and exposed, they must be stopped for the sake of the poor innocent children that are being raped, tortured and even killed everyday.
