</ul>
<h1>...Made me read for hours, resulting as this <strong>theory</strong>:</h1>
<p>The murder of Seth Rich was ordered by a person with a position in high level of freemasonry / illuminati / cabal, and spread to the insiders via Associated Press as <strong>a story of a rare owl being shot</strong>. Mr. Rich was either already, or was about to become a whistleblower (symbolically, coming from night into the daylight). Shot on Mr. Rich possibly took place using a gun registered to the FBI, later informed as stolen. Also a real owl was shot in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The related news on the owl should be read as they were <strong>coded</strong>, locations mentioned as important related location, like for example &quot;Santa Fe&quot; noting that &quot;Zorro Ranch&quot; is located there.</p>
<ul>
<li>2016-06-29 A real owl was probably shot. Fact: mate found alone on the next day. Y+M: 16+6=22. D: 29=2+9=11 Y+M+D: 16+6+11= <strong>33</strong></li>
<li>2016-07-10 Exactly 11 days later, the &quot;bad owl&quot; Rich was murdered. Y+M=16+7=23 D=10 Y+M+D=23+10= <strong>33</strong></li>
<li>2016-07-22 Related events reaching completion. Y+M=23. D=22. Y+M+D=45= 9 or <strong>333</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Using freemasonry symbolism for the numbers, on which</p>
<ul>
<li>9 represents wholeness and completion, especially significant for the Royal Arch. Also interpreted as three times three (333, TTT)</li>
<li>11 is the essence of all that is sinful, harmful, and imperfect. Bible prophecy assigns the Number 11 to Antichrist in Daniel 7:8</li>
<li>22 the number of the what is ‘fixed and squared’, the construct from which something can be built upon. Identifies the Master.</li>
<li>33 stands for highest degree achievable in Scottish Rite Masonry, and is therefore a &quot;supreme&quot; number. Thirty-three is also a Janus-number, because it is the age at which both Jesus Christ and Alexander the Great died.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, my theory is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSM delivering an extremely rare owl story, including gunshot, as <strong>the headlines</strong> on the date of Seth Rich murder</li>
<li>News on the rare owl include connections to earlier findings in pizzagate, both by times and locations mentioned</li>
<li>Catholic Bishops Conference sharing a matching read in their Gospel for the day (July 10)</li>
<li>Seth Rich was from a Jewish family (relates to the symbolism)</li>
<li><strong>Owl</strong> is also a very traditional symbol used in freemasonry representing:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;a filthy bird, because it pollutes its own nest with its dung&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;sinners who have given up living in the light and have chosen the darkness of sin&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;For the medieval men, the owl also represented the Jews who have rejected Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;When the owl ventures out into the daylight, <strong>the other birds attack it</strong>. The scene of the owl mobbed by other birds is common in manuscripts and is often carved on misericords.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>note: An Owl is also <a href="https://archive.is/qqWDX/baa790564528c88cf98bf52bf63326394279e49f.png">hidden in the One Dollar Bill</a> </li>
<li>note:  A Panda (surprise surprise) had a birthday (4 years, 4 = 22) on July 10th, 2016. I felt this was reaching, so I didn\'t add this to the list, but here\'s the panda, &quot;iced&quot;, original image description as <a href="https://gdb.voanews.com/5BAA57BD-C004-413A-B7FF-82BA88994B89_w1023_s_s.jpg">&quot;Chinese panda Le Bao his birthday cake made with ice in a celebration for his fourth birthday at the Everland amusement park in Yongin, South Korea.&quot;</a></li>

<h1>Pizzagate connection: &quot;Chicks&quot; on Airport, on College and... behind <strong>Pizza Hut</strong></h1>
<p>The news on the rare owl, before edited by Associated Press, included &quot;chicks&quot; spotted on Santa Fe Airport, and more behind &quot;Pizza Hut&quot;. Compare the original (July 5) to the AP version (July 10) and to <em>WaPodesta</em> version (July 10). A quote from the original:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walters spotted his first burrowing owl in Santa Fe in <strong>2008</strong> as it was emerging from a prairie dog hole off Airport road, trailed by <strong>eight small chicks</strong>. Soon after, he documented large populations at the <strong>Santa Fe Municipal Airport</strong>, the <strong>Santa Fe Community College</strong> and even <strong>behind a Pizza Hut</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jeffrey Epstein, known billionaire pedophile, pleaded guilty on <strong>2008</strong>. He landed on the same airport often, flying his Lolita Express airplane**. Alan Dershowitz (Epstein\'s lawyer, denied, not convicted) was also accused on child sex in New Mexico.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Epstein owns or has owned a 26,700-square-foot mansion near Stanley south of Santa Fe on 10,000 acres known as the Zorro Ranch&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Alan Dershowitz has filed a detailed denial of a woman’s claims he had sexual contact with her <strong>in New Mexico and other locations when she was underage</strong>, in a case also involving Britain’s Prince Andrew.&quot;</p>

            <strong>
             eight small chicks
            </strong>
            . Soon after, he documented large populations at the

            The French president pledged his country's full support for the UK and the fight against terrorism in the wake of the Manchester bombing which killed 22 innocent people and injured 119 more.

              I don't see how they could get away with it.  Fake bomb, fake injuries, fake photos of body coming down steps on stretcher, fake interview with consultant paramedic and surgeon, but getting the Queen into the hospital?
             </p>
             <p>
              Someone is going to blab.  Too many moving bits to keep in order.

             <p>
              The guy's family was working for British MI in Libya.  I can see him getting talked into setting off a bomb by an MI handler.  I see the advantages of keeping the population in a state of fear.  But you would have to be seriously sick to pull this stunt.
             </p>
             <p>
              MI was running the IRA by the end - fully infiltrated - so why not the islamics?
             </p>
             <p>
              Take advantage of it by all means after the fact, militarized police, censored internet etc
             </p>
             <p>
              But false flag done by the Gubmint?  Naaah!  IMHO

                More police, more military, more spooks.  So there was a real bomb, real bodies, but the false flag aspect is that it wasn't a self motivated disaffected Islamic youth, but a put up job by the deep state to stoke war, stoke spending and thus borrowing and keep the central bankers in clover?

                 Where is the evidence that there was a bomb at all--or anything other than sound broadcast over a loudspeaker jsut as was done in Paris at the soccer stadium--where they kept playing--or at the Boston prior amputee hoaxathon? The cell phone videos--and there are only a few made available because nothing really happened--show that no one moved until someone in the crowd starting shouting and running, then herd mentality ensued. 
In Manchester there had already been a rehearsal fake terrorist attack in a shopping mall with actors that looked more realistic than this latest farce.

                  There are a number of "debunking" videos out on youtube.  Certainly makes one wonder....  I saw no dust or smoke in any of the videos of the Manchester "event" which had me wondering from the getgo,

            Huge Upvoat. This is by far the best post yet. If you ever re-post and can include the words "understanding the occult" that might get even more attention. Amazing depth.

            That's quite a common interpretation in many cultures, but not helpful for this case. Let's try to look for owls which can be connected to people involved in child rapes, like e.g. the one decorating Epstein's Island.

             The pattern I've seen is a quick Chaldean or Pythagoras "33" to let a hoax/psyop be known (quick message to intelligence agencies to stay off the investigation because it will only lead to exposing the fakery), and then Gematria to describe the entrails.  "Pizza"=33 is at the front of this investigation and could have + continue to send the message "don't investigate if you're not involved with this production," (Pizzagate is very real, however, which is why it's so different than all the other psyop/hoaxes).  I did this way back in time with the Ted Kazinsky hoax bombings (make people fear those trying to connection with God/nature, encourage people to double down on the 9-6 city beast as the only way of life).

            Well here's some nightmare material. A symbol revered by masons, tying in classical references to goddess Minerva, as well as an ancient symbol for the Jews who denied Christ. Oh and the Egyptian word for owl was Mulak (Moloch)

             they're numbers, they're used for adding and subtracting as well as accounting for things. even if true (which i doubt), you're not convincing anyone. this will get us nowhere with the investigation. waste of time.

            Since I'm not the OP I'll just put this out there because though it's not directly tied to Seth Rich (as far as I know) it ties in with this post. Recently, I too was researching the significance of owls in the freemasonry/illuminati/cabal world after I was told by someone with knowledge in this area, "They had it right in Twin Peaks. The owls are not what they seem." And so down another rabbit hole I went. I pop my head out and it turns out I'm now in the Seth Rich owl rabbit hole... The more research I do about Pizzagate and about our very existence as humans, I'm reminded that everything is connected to everything on every level.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a clip from Twin Peaks where they introduce the significance of the owl. I just watched it again and now after the Seth Rich shooting, I see it with fresh eyes. Be sure to pay close attention to Cooper's question to the major, btw.

             Bohemian grove is an actual owl sanctuary as well. They also have a sign that reads "Weaving spiders come not here". What is with these spiders and owls?

              maybe not intentional, but you're looking for evidence to support your conclusion - you should be reviewing evidence and then drawing a conclusion instead

               Quite the opposite. I read all the sources before writing my theory, and I did not have a theory in mind while reading. But what gave you this opposite impression? Might be something in my text worth some attention

                i just gave your post a complete read. great job on the sources. everybody needs to be doing this.

               <p>
                however, the numerology stuff is bullshit.
               </p>
               <p>
                there is no evidence that the addition of dates of events in media are used to disseminate information to "insiders". if you can find evidence of this, which i doubt you can, then your post might have some merit.

                  the freemason code 'founded on kabbalah' is bullshit. there is no evidence that the addition of dates of events in media are used to disseminate information to "insiders". if you can find evidence of this, which i doubt you can, then your post might have some merit.

                  your post hurts the pizzagate investigation because it wastes voat real-estate, upvoats, distracts and discredits legitimate investigation that goes on here.

                   The use of media to transmit secret messages has a long history. It was used extensively in World War II because AM radio signals can carry across great distances and, unlike FM radio signals, are not reliant on line of sight. Here's a video of how many messages were sent to spies via radio broadcasts:
                   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gDgNi30spA">
                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gDgNi30spA
                   </a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Fast forward to today's world and the NWO/Cabal/Illuminat/etc. has expanded their methodology to include all forms of media from films to TV shows to ads in magazines to, well, everywhere you look. This guy, who happens to be a Freemason, wrote this interesting blog post about that:
                   <a href="https://masonictao.com/2011/04/01/masonic-messages-in-the-media/">
                    https://masonictao.com/2011/04/01/masonic-messages-in-the-media/
                   </a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We know that they own the media. We know they place great emphasis on the power of numbers and sacred geometry. Why is it a stretch that they're sending out messages (sometimes via numbers) to their people? It's certainly safer than sending an email, yes? Certainly, Johnny Podesta has learned the downside to sending messages in emails.

                    your links are interesting, but not really useful IMO. Your point about sending out messages rather than emailing is valid.

                    where did you get the idea to add the numbers in the dates together? was that your own idea? i could not find mentions of it in the sources you provided.

            . With respect to the owl, what immediately popped into my mind was another animal that burrows and lives underground - a mole. Which is what they would've considered Seth to be.

            Nope.  The article you linked to is dated July 5, 2016.  The owl was actually shot at the end of June.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Driving across the Caja del Rio plateau
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the morning of June 27
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , Julie Luetzelschwab photographed two burrowing owls on federal land, peering out from tall grass dotted with cacti, their yellow eyes wide and unblinking. Less than a foot tall, their bodies were half obscured by the brush.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Three days later
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , one of the owls was spotted again, but its mate was missing."
