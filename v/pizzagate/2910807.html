<p>Dr. Reginald Archibald, working for Rockefeller University, held himself out as a renowned expert in pediatric endocrinology. Parents throughout the United States brought their children to him for specialized treatment for decades from the late 1940s through the early 1980s. As a physician and professor at Rockefeller University Hospital, he told parents that he could help children who might have growth issues by examining and treating them. Using his &quot;expertise&quot; in childhood growth and his position as a doctor at a prestigious medical center, young boys and teenagers – many of whom dreamed of being taller – were brought by their parents into Dr. Archibald\'s examining room.</p>
<p>Once in the examining room, however, Dr. Archibald engaged in horrific behavior, telling the children who were in his care that he needed to touch them in their private parts, insisting to boys that he needed to make them &quot;bigger&quot; to &quot;measure&quot; them. The children had no idea what he was doing or that this should not be happening – after all he was their doctor. And as children, they did not have the words or ability to process any of this. He made it part of the treatment and insisted with his authority – and the trust that their parents had placed in him – that this was expected. Then he engaged in sexual abuse in a variety of forms, from masturbating them and/or attempting to arouse them, to taking photographs and other egregious behavior.</p>
<p>Rockefeller University issued two statements about the abuse, one on October 5 and another on October 18:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rucares.org/statement-re-dr-reginald-archibald.pdf">https://www.rucares.org/statement-re-dr-reginald-archibald.pdf</a></p>
<p>Shockingly, in the first statement, <strong>Rockefeller University admitted that it learned about Dr. Archibald’s systemic abuse of its young and vulnerable patients in 2004 but waited 14 years to begin to contact survivors. And when Rockefeller University finally started to contact survivors in October 2018, it only acknowledged that “some” of Dr. Archibald’s “behaviors” were “inappropriate.” Nor has Rockefeller University provided information to survivors about whether their medical files contain photographs that may constitute CHILD PORNOGRAPHY or whether it may have knowledge of such photographs existing elsewhere.</strong></p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>&quot;The Rockefeller University (&quot;Rockefeller&quot;) A New York Not-For-Profit Corporation&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We call upon your office to launch a thorough investigation into Archibald\'s misconduct, whether Rockefeller was aware of and concealed it, the manner in which Rockefeller addressed reports it received from victims about the abuse over the years, and the extent to which Rockefeller has knowledge of the existence and whereabouts of photographs of our clients and other victims that may constitute child pornography under federal and state law&quot;</p>',

            Jeffrey Epstein was on the board of trustees. Also note that his brother was on the board of trustees of Cooper Union, an elite college in NYC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein, Kandel and Kissinger Join Rockefeller University Board of Trustees
November 22, 1995
The board of trustees of Rockefeller University has elected investor Jeffrey E. Epstein, neurobiologist Eric R. Kandel, M.D., and Nancy M. Kissinger, M.A., as new members.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The experience and wisdom that Mr. Epstein, Dr. Kandel and Mrs. Kissinger bring to The Rockefeller University board of trustees is most welcome and will improve our mission to support and strengthen the biomedical research and education activities of our faculty and students,” says Richard M. Furlaud, chairman of the board.
           </p>
           <p>
            Each of the new members will serve three-year terms. Epstein is a member of the advisory board of the university’s Center for Studies of Physics and Biology. Kissinger has served as a member of the university’s council since 1991.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The trustees are dedicated members of The Rockefeller University community and we look forward to their contributions to our pursuit of new knowledge and understanding of the biological and physical aspects of health and disease,” says Torsten Wiesel, M.D., president of the university.
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein

           <p>
            Kandel
           </p>
           <p>
            Kandel, University Professor in the Columbia University Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and a senior investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, studies the molecular basis of memory and learning. He received the National Medical of Science, the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award and many other honors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kandel received a bachelor of arts degree in 1952 from Harvard College and a medical degree from the New York University School of Medicine (NYU) in 1956. He completed a residency in psychiatry at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, Harvard Medical School, later joining the center as a junior faculty member. He returned to NYU in 1965 as an associate professor, becoming professor and head of the Division of Neurobiology and Behavior in 1968. Kandel moved to the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia in 1974 where he founded the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, which he directed until 1983 when he became University Professor.

              Just above Rockefeller University is a collection of absolute elite tier medical facilities, like Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital.

             <p>
              Also located right there above Rockefeller U is NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.

             <p>
              Weill Cornell is also sponsoring and co-creating the Israeli - technical college across the river there on Roosevelt Island.

              Also, given all the Israel connections to this Jeffrey Epstein/Rockefeller University/Kissinger stuff, note that an Israeli university is being opened just a few hundred feet across the river/bridge from Rockefeller University:

              I tried but I can't create a new post because I'm new. If you want to create a new post I've already written it. Jeffrey Epstein's brother is included too. His high rise where he kept Jeffrey Epstein's underage girls is just two blocks from Rockefeller University. Please create a new post with the following text:
             </p>
             <p>
              Somebody suggested making a new topic. I'm a new poster here but was a visitor when this Voat sub first started.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jeffrey Epstein's brother Mark deserves examination, plus, Jeffrey Epstein and Henry Kissinger's wife were both appointed as Trustees of Rockefeller University in 1995.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm also pretty sure I remember Epstein giving a donation or science grant to Rockefeller University.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just as Jeffrey Epstein went from a high school drop out to high school teacher to the top of Wall Street in very suspicious fashion, his brother Mark had a similarly suspicious rise to real estate mogul and Chairman of the Board of Trustees at Cooper Union, the Harvard-level NYC college where tuition is free.
             </p>
             <p>
              The biggest building that Mark Epstein magically became owner of (just as Jeffrey was magically gifted the largest residence in NYC by Les Wexner) is just two blocks away from Rockefeller University.
             </p>
             <p>
              More interestingly, I distinctly recall that even after Jeffrey Epstein was disgraced, convicted, and sentenced to jail, the "models" and "child sex slaves" that Jeffrey Epstein "bought", were living in Mark Epstein's Upper East Side high rise, two blocks from Rockefeller University.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mark Epstein was (is?) involved in Jeffrey Epstein's sex life. How much I don't know, but I guess it's worth mentioning the connection and exploring the Jeffrey Epstein/Kissinger/Rockefeller University connection.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the real estate business Mark runs, and like Jeffrey's business dealings, it should be regarded with a great deal of curiosity by pizzagate researchers:

             </p>
             <p>
              If my memory serves me right, it was/is exactly that 301 East 66th Street where Jeffrey Epstein stashed his girls after he went to jail.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mark Epstein started that real estate business in 1991, just as Jeffrey Epstein was becoming a big shot with the girls and the probable Israeli angle to the whole story.  Jeffrey Epstein was named to the board of Rockefeller U in 1995.
             </p>
             <p>
              This here is the girl who Jeffrey Epstein referred to as his child sex slave, that he bought from her parents in Eastern Europe through a modeling agency, when she was just 13 or 14. I'm pretty sure I remember that she was/is living in Mark Epstein's building, while she was also giving very suspicious honeytrap-like "Flying lessons" to horny men on Jeffrey Epstein's Gulfstream IV Jet:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Nadia Marcinko (Slovak: Naďa Marcinková) is a Slovakian FAA-certified commercial rated pilot and flight instructor, holding a Single (land &amp; sea) Multi-engine (land) instrument rating and Gulfstream C/G-IV &amp; C/G-1159-type rating certificates.[1] She is the CEO of Aviloop, an aviation website.[2]
             </p>
             <p>
              The Guardian reported that Marcinko was previously known under the name of Nada Marcinkova and worked as an assistant to Jeffrey Epstein. According to the article, Marcinkova was questioned in 2010 concerning Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.[3] In written testimony given by Epstein's underaged victims, Marcinko is also described as having encouraged and engaged in sexual acts with the underaged girls, sometimes involving sex toys, at the suggestion of Mr. Epstein. [4]
             </p>
             <p>
              After a career as a model, Marcinko started flight training at a flight school at the Palm Beach County Florida Airport. With 250 hours in her logbook, she accepted an offer from a friend to obtain her Gulfstream II rating and was certified shortly thereafter.[5]
             </p>
             <p>
              After Marcinko started calling herself "Gulfstream Girl,"[6] the Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. filed a trademark infringement suit (Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation v. Aviloop LLC et al.) against her on November 18, 2013, alleging that Marcinko had unlawfully appropriated its signature "Gulfstream" trademark to promote her company Aviloop.[7][8] Marcinko and Gulfstream reached an out of court settlement filed on January 6, 2014 after Marcinko changed her online name to Global Girl.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now using the name "Global Girl," Marcinko promotes aviation on social media. "I believe a career in a tech field is the best-kept secret for girls. Aside from the increased job security, there is also a unique sense of accomplishment that comes with succeeding in a male-dominated field."[2]
             </p>
             <p>
              Marcinko was born in eastern Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Her father, Peter Marcinko, is a prominent architect in Prešov."

                It gets a lot darker. I did a couple more hours of research. Check it out for yourself.

                The entire area around Rockefeller University is crawling with Mossad. Not just Mark Epstein's high rise where Jeffrey STILL keeps his girls, but the whole (Sandy) Weill Cornell medical complex takes up like 3 blocks. Weill was the CEO of Citigroup, and on the board of the NY Federal Reserve, in addition to a big supporter of Israel.  He gave Cornell $400 million. Then Cornell re-named their entire medical school and hospitals after him.  Then Cornell partnered with Israeli Mossad front "The Techion" to build a brand new huge Israeli spy-technology university right across the bridge from Rockefeller University/Weill Cornell Medical.
               </p>
               <p>
                You've got sexual blackmail (Epsteins), probable medical experiments like organ trafficking and MK-Ultra stuff going on at all the Weill medical centers there, and then you have the Israeli communications spying school being built right next door on Roosevelt Island.
               </p>
               <p>
                PLUS whatever they get up to at Rockefeller University!

                  Turns out Epstein's stint on the Rockefeller University board was "short-lived". A fellow board member described him as "arrogant", according to James Patterson's book.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What I want to find is an article I read a few years ago that in the 90s, Epstein had a big office space, and all his stock traders were Orthodox Jews.  I think that was a big Mossad operation. But I can't find the article.

                    Yeah that's basically who was running the Jeffrey Epstein operation, but I want to find that article about the Orthodox Jews in Epstein's office, and where that office was located. I think it was in a prominent building, like the former office space of some big business guru from decades ago. Thanks for the Mega link though. They were also running NXIVM cult through Edgar Bronfman's daughters, in my opinion.

                     Yep, I saw that Bronfman is involved and that you are correct on NXIVM.  The Bronfmans are part of The Mega as well.  I will keep looking.  I think Epstein found out real quick how he could get ahead with sex.  He being bisexual and Leslie being gay.

                      Bill Clinton was a rumored bi-sexual, and Kevin Spacey gay pedo, and Chris Tucker "bunked" with 15 year old cutie Aaron Carter at Michael Jackson's house.  When those guys all flew to Africa together, it could have been for boys, not girls.

             A year ago there was a user here, Wisconsin-something, who said Racine was a huge part of the NWO. Wish I could remember the username. The comment history would be worth a read if you're that close to Racine.

            The Kinsey Institute's extensive collection of fine art and photography documents centuries of human sexuality and exploration from around the world.

           <p>
            For Dr. Alfred Kinsey, the study of human sexual behavior went beyond science. He also saw art, artifacts, and photographs as essential tools for researching sexual behavior and customs across time and cultures. Dr. Kinsey's collection is the heart of the Kinsey Institute's archive

            Smoking Gun for confiscating assets per Trump's executive order that will be lawful for those who systemically abuse children. Same thing happened at Duke Hospital......they have been implicated in MK Ultra.....it was to a friend of mine who went there for treatment.The resident started rubbing himself up against her when she was 12. ...BUT , she was from the country...gave him a swift kick to the crotch, yelled bloody murder. Her mother came in and not only told him off, but reported him. Odd , there are not more reactions like this.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              DowDuPont Inc. is an American company formed after the merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont on August 31, 2017. It is the world's largest chemical company in terms of sales. Within 18 months the company will be split into three publicly-traded companies which will focus on the following: agriculture, materials science, and specialty products.[2][3][4] The agriculture division is named Corteva Agriscience, the materials science division is named Dow, and the specialty products division is named DuPont.[5] Jeff Fettig is the chairman of the board of directors,[6] and Edward Breen is the CEO.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to former United States Secretary of Agriculture during the Clinton administration, Dan Glickman, and former Governor of Nebraska, Mike Johanns, by creating a single, independent, U.S.-based and -owned pure agriculture company, Dow and DuPont would be able to compete against their still larger global peers.[26]
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other hand, if Monsanto and Bayer, the 1st and 3rd largest biotech and seed firms, together with Dow and DuPont being the 4th and 5th largest biotechnology and seed companies in the world respectively, both went through with the mergers, the so-called "Big Six" in the industry would control 63 percent of the global seed market and 76 percent of the global agriculture chemical market. They would also control 95 percent of corn, soybeans, and cotton traits in the US. Both duopolies would become the "big two" industry dominators. According to Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union, the key to innovation is competition, not concentration.[27] [28]
             </p>
             <p>
              The merger formed the world's largest chemical company in terms of sales. Dow DuPont is dual headquartered in Midland, Michigan and Wilmington, Delaware.

                 As the NHS is collapsed from within ready for take-over by the private sector it is interesting to see that Cyril Chantler is Chairman of The Kings Fund and of University College London Partners and also the Media Standards Trust (media manipulation closely linked to Common Purpose). The Media Standards Trust comprises big elitist names  [include] : Amelia Fawcett ( (Chairman, Pensions First)...
                </p>
                <p>
                 How 'independent' is the King's Fund? The board appears riddled with interests in the drug companies and large scale consultancies. Is this why the common purpose is to collapse the NHS to facilitate take-over and control by the private corporations.

                 The Media Standards Trust claims to be an independent registered charity which aims to foster high standards in news media on behalf of the public. “We’re a ‘think-and-do-tank” .... to promote quality, transparency and accountability in news. We are committed to the freedom of the press, and are not aligned with any political party or particular media company.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 In reality the MST is anything but independent, being funded by a shadowy network of vested foundation interests - Esmee Fairburn, Gatsby, Joseph Rowntree, Eranda, MacArthur, Knight, Nuffield, Pearson, Cohen, Story and Scott. Dig deeper and the threads include Sainsbury, Rothschild and Guardian Media Group. Deeper still is David Halpern’s Institute for Government with a board of ‘stars’ - Lord Sainsbury, Sir Roy Anderson, Sir Brian Bender, Jocelyne Bourgon, Sir Andrew Cahn, Lord Curry of Marylebone, Sir Christopher Foster and Lord Heseltine.....then there’s the Cabinet Behavioural Change Unit.....the list goes on and on.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Board of the MST is also interesting. Chairman Sir David Bell Chairman Financial Times Group and Deputy Chair Julia Middleton - are both kingpins with the political charity Common Purpose. Their board colleagues include:
                 <strong>
                  Amelia Fawcett Chairman Guardian Media Group
                 </strong>

                </p>
                <p>
                 The mix of vested interests in high powered banking and media is notable. And then there is Common Purpose.

                 We've all heard of Common Purpose. Their name became synonymous withthe McCann Case for various reasons. Common Purpose share the same firmof auditors - Haysmacintyre to name the most obvious connection.
                </p>
                <ol>
                 <li>
                  Common Purpose have a couple of "famous" trustees:a) Sir David Bellb) Julia Middleton2. Common Purpose's address is: Discovery House, 28-42 Banner Street,London EC1Y 8QE3. A similar outfit to Common Purpose is the "Media Standards Trust".
                 </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                 So, we have Common Purpose (an organisation infiltrating and sappingmoney from local authorities and masquerading as a charity), the MediaStandards Trust (an organisation able to manipulate the news), and DurrantsLtd (a media monitoring outfit - a sort of "Clarence Mitchell" company)..
                </p>
                <p>
                 Are there more connections other than the building?You bet!1. Sir David Bell and Julia Middleton are two Trustees of Common Purpose.2. Sir David Bell and Julia Middleton are on the board of the Media StandardsTrust. Here is that board;* Chair Sir David Bell (Chairman, Financial Times Group)* Deputy Chair Julia Middleton (CEO, Common Purpose)* Sir Cyril Chantler (Chairman, King's Fund)* Sir Robert Worcester (Founder, MORI)* Tim Waterstone (Founder of Waterstones bookstores and Daisy &amp; Tomchildren's department stores)* Robert Peston (Business Editor, BBC)* William Davies (Goldsmiths College, London)* Roger Graef (Films of Record)* Baroness Helena Kennedy QC* The Right Reverend Stephen Platten (Bishop of Wakefield)* Geraint Talfan Davies (Chair, Institute of Welsh Affairs)* Anthony Salz (Executive Vice Chairman, NM Rothschild)* Sue Stapely (Quiller Consultants/Sue Stapely Consulting)* Amelia Fawcett (Chairman, Pensions First)* Albert Scardino (journalist, editor)* Sir Philip Otton (retired judge)* Mary-Ellen Barker (Thomson Reuters)* Charles Manby (Goldman Sachs)
                </p>
                <p>
                 And why did I highlight Baroness Helena Kennedy QC? Here are somenotable details:1. She used to chair the Human Genetics Commission2. Presenter, Raw Deal on Medical Negligence, BBC TV, 1989.3. Chair, Reading Borough Council's Commission of Inquiry into the health,environmental and safety aspects of the Atomic Weapons Establishment atAldermaston (final report Secrecy versus Safety, published in 1994).4. During the 1970s, she was a member of the Communist Party of GreatBritain. (Wasn't Julia Middleton as well or was it her father?)

             In the late 1990's, a document called the "Earth Charter" was drafted by a group of prominent Humanist-Socialists including: Steven Rockefeller, Maurice Strong, Mikhail Gorbachev

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In place of the simple elegance of the rules for self-government and social stability expressed above, the Earth Charter calls for the imposition of a global tyranny over every aspect of human activity which becomes evident once you strip away the rhetorical devices and eco-socialist jargon.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Earth Charter was inscribed on papyrus paper and enshrined in a wooden box called the "Ark of Hope" which was decorated with neo-pagan, politically correct artwork and paraded around the world by a troupe of believers. According to the official description, the carrying poles for the Ark are "unicorn horns" which ward off evil spirits (I'm not making this up, see for yourself).
            </p>
            <p>
             ..the Earth Charter needs to be looked into. It leads back to the UN Sustainability Agenda, the Lucis Trust and a number of dodgy characters and psyops...eg: the Hampstead case. (No wonder you're getting such push back, I can't believe the scale of this thing. No time today to explain further about that .) Quick rundown..

              Thank you. Yes, I understand your comment about the trauma-informed approach.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just think that the studies on trauma are now being applied in a nefarious way in a number of psyops on the general population. The Harvard psychiatrist  John Woodall who specializes in trauma  turned up at Sandy Hook just before the shooting in order to manage the situation.

             François-Henri Pinault (French: [pino]; born 28 May 1962) is a French businessman, the chairman and CEO of Kering since 2005, and President of
             <strong>
              Groupe Artémis
             </strong>
             since 2003. Under his leadership, Kering divested the retail industry and became a luxury group.
            </p>
            <p>
             François-Henri Pinault moved PPR towards managing luxury brands. He sold PPR’s leading retail assets: Conforama, CFAO, Printemps, Fnac and La Redoute. PPR then merged with the Gucci group, its subsidiary since 1999. The brands Gucci, Yves Saint-Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Boucheron, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney were now under the direct supervision of PPR’s executives.

             François-Henri Pinault is a member of The B Team, a pro-environment not-for-profit organization founded by Richard Branson.[14] In 2009, he financed the documentary Home by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, which shows aerial shots of various places on Earth and discusses how humanity is threatening the ecological balance of the planet.[15] In January 2018, Kering was named top sustainable textile, apparel and luxury goods corporation in the Corporate Knights Global 100 index.[16]

             In June 2016, alongside his father François Pinault, he introduced the renovation project of the Bourse de Commerce building in Paris which will house part of the Pinault family’s art collection.

             The early work, which depicts a nude young girl with a flower basket, was reportedly bought by the Nahmad family, two sources told the New York Times. The powerful international family of art traders has a large collection of works by Picasso estimated to number more than 300.

             The painting’s new owners will in turn lend it to the French museum. A spokesperson for the Musée d’Orsay confirmed the loan deal in an article by AFP. “We’re very happy,” a spokesperson for the museum told the French press agency. (The spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for further comment by artnet News.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The Nahmad family did not immediately respond to artnet News’s request for comment. In a conversation with the Times, the dealer Helly Nahmad declined to identify his family as the buyer, saying only, “It’s a great painting.”

              David Nahmad (born 1947) is a billionaire retired fine art dealer.[2] A descendant of a Jewish Syrian art family residing in Monaco and a cousin of the late Edmond Safra, he and his relations are perhaps the single biggest buying force in fine art.[2]

                There was a famous email about Podesta and Wyss.  Wasn't Wyss involved  in  something really nefarious with Podesta being connected.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/podesta-palmieri-wyss-links-could-be-a-problem-for-hillary-clinton-in-2016">
                 https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/podesta-palmieri-wyss-links-could-be-a-problem-for-hillary-clinton-in-2016
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                It was at the liberal think tank founded by Podesta that he and Palmieri benefitted from Wyss's generosity. Wyss is a reclusive Swiss billionaire who is among the center's biggest contributors and is a member of its board of directors.He is also the former head of Synthes, a corporation that conducted illegal human drug trials that resulted in the deaths of three people.
               </p>
               <p>
                As the Washington Examiner reported last July, four of Wyss's executives at the corporation served jail terms as a result of the illegal trials. The federal judge who heard the case said the company's "pattern of deception is unparalleled."
               </p>
               <p>
                Podesta, Palmieri and Wyss have been financially linked for years. The center received $4.1 million from Wyss during Podesta's tenure as the liberal nonprofit’s founding president and chief executive officer. When Podesta joined the Obama White House, he listed on his financial disclosure form an $87,000 consulting fee he received from Wyss's private foundation, the HJW Foundation.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Wyss and other Synthes executives decided to enter the highly profitable field of spinal surgery in 2000 with Norian XR, a cement-like mixture of calcium phosphate with barium sulfate," the Examiner reported in 2014.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Company managers claimed the compound could act like bone when injected in the spine in a procedure called 'vertebrosplasty.'
               </p>
               <p>
                That Podesta Family is a piece of work.

              Since 2008, public high schools in the State of Florida no longer have health education classes due to a change in the graduation requirements. Consequently, the Miami-Dade County School District does not offer health education classes, only physical education classes, in its high schools. Due to this lack of relevant health education and accessible resources, teens are suffering with a myriad of serious health issues such as depression, suicide, sexual assault, physical abuse, eating disorders, obesity, anxiety, stress and bullying.

             The weak link in the Chain of Command through all networks of Global Criminal Corruption is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons.
            </h1>
            <p>
             The Johnsons and other partner corporations in Racine, Wisconsin are who gave legitimacy to the Art in Embassies program.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Rothschilds are in Wisconsin and New York along with the Johnsons and Rockefellers.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Rockefellers own the patent to the Zika virus which was used as a test for Agenda 21, biological warfare, social engineering, and population control. This was linked directly with the Olympics in Brazil, and the Johnsons were the primary beneficiary as they control both the means for development with the most advanced mosquito labs in the world, and the "solution" which is poison. The Johnsons are closely linked with Brazil, Haiti, and many other hubs of trafficking, corruption and despair.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Freemasons, Club of Rome, Atlantic Council, Trilateral Commission, Royal Order of Jesters, Aspen Institute, Brookings Institution, Cato Institute, Sphinx Head Society, Committee of 300, Majestic 12, Council of 13 and many other overlapping groups involved are all directly connected to these families and to Wisconsin.

                   Pizzagate and Pedogate are one of many forms of control, compromise, complicity and covert communication in a pervasive system for Global Criminal Corruption and the Real Agenda of Eternal Enslavement.

                   You can also compromise and control people through the hotel and hospitality industry. Think spygate. Now connect that with social networks, communication networks, and 5G+ AI. Think beyond Prism and Palantir.

               Yes, they are and they are based in Wisconsin.  The same ones that make the Baby Powder.  Huge lawsuit they had to pay and are trying to get out of.

                Ah, okay. I've seen the name of Johnson &amp; Johnson crop up a lot in my donation/funding searches through the foundations. I'll have to start noting the things they're backing from now on as well then.

                  Yes don’t forget the Johnson family daughter Casey Johnson was murdered by her own family and Nicky Hilton Rothschild along with Bijou Phillips tried to help cover it up. Tila “Tequila” with whom Casey was in a lesbian relationship with spilled the beans on Casey’s upbringing and Satanic Ritual Abuse long before pizzagate ever broke out. The Johnson family is evil to the core.

                   Thanks for that Evil Gossip.  Yep, the whole family is  Luciferian just like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.  Remember all their relatives came over on that same boat.  It was all in the plan imo.  Disgusting Ancestors can lead to Disgusting Relatives and on and on.  They have had to sacrifice members to create evil loosh.  It gets them points and kicked upstairs to high level positions.  Yuck.  I'll just stay where I am at.

               That is correct. They also control Cornell University in New York and Qatar through which where they promote the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise piloting programs in Rwanda, Ghana, Haiti, Brazil and in other areas of corruption, disease and despair.

               What happened when one of the new generation confessed to assaulting, abusing and raping his own step-daughter and other children for years? Where did he work previously? What business are they in? Who are their global partners? What is the Ninth Circle Satanic Cult? What is the Sphinx Head Society? Who are the Knights of Pythias and Knights of Malta? Where is the Schmitz family from? Where were the Podestas MADE? Where is the Majestic 12 from? How are they all linked to the Pilgrims Society?

               What is the news TODAY about that same judge's father, and how are they protected and controlled? What groups are they involved in? What is the Siena center and who are the Dominicans? Who did the judge's father work for in the past? What is the big SECRET SEALED CASE that same judge is currently manipulating and why? Why did the last mayors resign? Why did another judge end up dead in the Root River? Why did the last mayor suddenly resign during the biggest development deals in the history of Racine? Who made him resign and why? What position did they force him into in order to help them control the Great Lakes? What is the World's Most Valuable Resource, and what is the primary ingredient in their "products"?

               Who did Bill Clinton appoint to the President's Council on Sustainable Development? What is the result of Hillary's model for Community policing in the area? Who ran Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign in Wisconsin, who is his famous Scientologist sister, what position did his daughter just get, who did she work for previously, and how did that person suddenly become Mayor to HIDE THE TRUTH ALONG WITH PAUL RYAN, REINCE PRIEBUS, SCOTT WALKER, and DONALD TRUMP.

            ** UES Hospital Must Return Photos Of Sex Abuse Victims: Lawyers **
           </p>
           <p>
            A doctor at Rockefeller University took photos of the children he abused for years. Victims are worried the images are unaccounted for.
           </p>
           <p>
            UPPER EAST SIDE, NY — Sex abuse victims of a long-time Rockefeller University doctor who was hailed as a "miracle worker" stood in front of the Upper East Side institution Tuesday with their lawyers to demand the hospital turn over any medical records that may contain nude images taken of victims under the guise of medical research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rockefeller University Hospital admitted in October that the institution was aware that Dr. Reginald Archibald may have molested, raped and photographed children between the ages of 6 and 16 from the 1940s to the 1980s. In the wake of the admission, lawyers representing Archibald's victims are calling on the university to "do the right thing" and turn over any illicit photographs the doctor took of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Those photographs have not been returned, and we have a number of the former patients — then children now adults — who have traveled across the country to formally demand that Rockefeller University either turn over the photographs, provide answers as to where the photographs are or to alternatively get the Attorney General of New York involved investigating where those photos are," Attorney Michael Pfau said Tuesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gail Coleman, who was a victim of Archibald for four years, came to New York from Washington D.C. to say that she has been "haunted" her entire life by the existence of the images. Coleman has been trying to get the photographs from the hospital since 1993, but when she was sent her medical records she found no evidence of the images.
           </p>
           <p>
            The discovery led Coleman to believe that the photos taken by Archibald were never intended for any medical or research.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Dr. Archibald victimized me, but for as long as these pictures are unaccounted for and are out there in the world — every single day that i don't know anything about these pictures or where they are — I am being victimized," Coleman said. "This time by the university."
           </p>
           <p>
            Should Rockefeller University be unable to locate the images, lawyers are hopeful that the New York Attorney General's office can investigate the whereabouts of the images.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It doesn't matter if [the photos] were taken 10 years ago or two days ago. So whoever holds these images, whoever possess them — whether it's the institution or the individuals — they're liable for the possession of child pornography," Attorney James Marsh said. "The fact that we don't know what happened to tens of thousands of these images is very disturbing for our clients."
           </p>
           <p>
            The hospital's statement did not include a description of Archibald's "inappropriate conduct," but victims claim that the doctor forced victims to undress, molested them, photographed them and in some cases raped victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Child Pornography.  I don't think for one second they have been tossed.  Someone has those photos and may still be distributing them.  You bet they are

             Trump signed another executive order that the victims of child pornography should be given money from the abuser. This would be huge for rockefellas. Thought the selling of family possessions after David Rockefella died was to hide assets.....same for selling off of family compound by Rothschildren in UK.

              That certainly would be a first if they had to pay for Victim's Abuse.  I haven't heard anything on the news about this report, but that's to be expected. I am sure they are trying to keep it hush hush.  Yes I heard about the Trump order, actually on the news.  That in itself is surprising.

            could this get a flair of some kind? It's fucking egregious, and needs to be shared. The Rockefeller's are the ELITE of the ELITE. Read the PDF, this looks like a Rockefeller sponsored child porn distribution ring

             Yep. I will give this a Potential Lead flair. The guy should be looked into, as well as those in charge of the school.

             Looks like they attempted to wait until after the statute of limitations ran out to disclose it? How did the university find out? Any news stories on this?

               In 2004, The Rockefeller University Hospital was informed of a report by a former patient related to the propriety of certain of Dr. Archibald’s conduct during physical examinations. The University notified the federal Office of Human Research Protections, the New York State Office of Professional Medical Conduct, and the Manhattan District Attorney. In addition, the University retained legal counsel Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP to investigate.  Following its review of then available information, including from interviews with former patients,faculty, administrators,and staff, and two prior reports made in the 1990s that were located, Debevoise found certain allegations credible and determined that it was likely that some of Dr. Archibald’s behavior towards this patient was inappropriate. A policy relating to the further protection of pediatric patients was added to the Hospital’s then existing safeguards and processes designed to protect patients
