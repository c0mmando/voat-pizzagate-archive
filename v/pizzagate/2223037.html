<p>Yesterday, the alternative media exploded with reports about an anonymous 4chan poster\'s posts about Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Here is a thread on The_Donald about it:

<p>I\'m writing this post on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> because (A) I think this new series of posts has a LOT of credibility and (B) it makes me more optimistic about Trump truly being the hero we needed.</p>
<p>First, I want to establish something important: not all 4chan insiders are LARP fakers. Sometimes, these insiders actually make predictions that turn out to be true.</p>
<p>A. The original FBIanon in July predicted that the Clinton Foundation was associated with child trafficking. This prediction was made four months before Podesta\'s emails were released and #pizzagate (this entire VOAT community) existed.</p>
<p>B. The same (or different) insider on 4chan predicted that the FBI would do something critical on Sunday, November 1, 2016.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aqvr4/this_is_the_secret_of_the_fbi_tweets_this_is_what/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aqvr4/this_is_the_secret_of_the_fbi_tweets_this_is_what/</a></p>
<p>This prediction was precise down to the exact minute.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ao7p1/looks_like_they_delivered_the_goods_right_on/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ao7p1/looks_like_they_delivered_the_goods_right_on/</a></p>
<p>C. An anonymous insider warned people to stay away from Vegas three weeks in advance:
<a href="https://squawker">https://squawker</a>.  org/politics/4chanvegas/</p>
<p>D. White House Anon predicted something big would happen on July 27. That day Imran Awan was arrested and Congress called for an investigation into Clinton, Comey, and Lynch:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6q0leq/either_the_whanon_727_post_was_legit_or_we_just/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6q0leq/either_the_whanon_727_post_was_legit_or_we_just/</a></p>
<p>And so on. There are probably other examples.</p>
<p>Making valid predictions is probably the most powerful way for an &quot;insider&quot; to gain credibility. That\'s why I always ask George Webb to make specific predictions.</p>
<p>Now let\'s get back to this new alleged insider, who calls himself &quot;Q Clearance Patriot&quot; (I\'ll use &quot;Q&quot;). First of all, Q makes two big and bold predictions:</p>
<p>A. Tomorrow (November 3) Podesta will be indicted (doesn\'t specify John or Tony)</p>
<p>B. Sunday (November 5) Huma will be indicted </p>
<p>Just based on all of the fake predictions and &quot;happenings&quot; in the past, I find it emotionally difficult to actually believe that this will happen. But there are several things that make me cautiously optimistic about Q.</p>
<p>A. Q says that U.S. military intelligence recruited Trump. This is almost exactly what the FBI Twitter activity, on Oct. 30-Nov. 1, suggested, as analyzed in this famous thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aqvr4/this_is_the_secret_of_the_fbi_tweets_this_is_what/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aqvr4/this_is_the_secret_of_the_fbi_tweets_this_is_what/</a></p>
<p>Specifically, after tweeting about Trump, the FBI then tweeted about deputizing new agents and left-behind sleeper agents in occupied territory.</p>
<p>I believe that Steve Pieczenik has said similar things about an intelligence counter-coup against Hillary.</p>
<p>B. Q\'a overall theory (that Trump was recruited by military intelligence to stage a quiet coup to restore government integrity) fits with several things we know about the military.</p>
<p>First of all, the military has a very low rate of Jewish people. For some mysterious reason, Jewish people rose to disproportionate levels of power in finance, lobbying, Hollywood, and media, but not in the military. If you look at the picture of Trump with his military team (&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79D2YXv5Me0">calm before the storm</a>&quot;), you see virtually no Jewish people there. FBIanon, who is widely regarded as the most credible of the 4chan insiders, said that the deep state corruption has a heavy Jewish influence.</p>
<p>Second, Trump alluded to a &quot;calm before the storm&quot; at the same time as his military team meeting. The quiet coup is the perfect candidate for what Trump\'s cryptic phrase meant.</p>
<p>Third, Trump has appointed a high number of generals to his cabinet and other positions. General Flynn (who tweeted about pizzagate) comes from the military.</p>
<p>Fourth, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1671832">I have personally written</a>, repeatedly, that if Trump was really going to drain the swamp, he would need to engage in some kind of coup, such as marching the National Guard into CIA headquarters in Langley. Q explicitly refers to Trump\'s authority over the National Guard (and coordination with the marines).</p>
<p>Fifth, Q says that Trump was given assurances and protection, if he ran for President. This makes perfect sense as to why Trump always seems so cool, calm, and collected, for a man who is widely discussed as a target for assassination (see the new <a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3604425.1509562522!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/snoop2f-2-web.jpg">Snoop Dogg album cover</a>. If the deep state corruption was so bad (JFK assassination and pizzagate bad), I wondered how Trump could be so calm and smug. Q gives one explanation. Look at the smug smile <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNlspllUEAAVE4g.jpg">on Trump\'s face here</a>, this is the face of a man who is given deep assurances and protection.</p>
<p>Trump\'s assurances and protection are also consistent with principle #2 from The Art of the Deal, &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump:_The_Art_of_the_Deal">Protect the downside and the upside will take care of itself</a>.&quot; Why spend dozens of millions of dollars, and put your family name and businesses through the mud and microscope, if there is a big chance that you won\'t win? Trump protected the downside by getting assurances and protection from U.S. military intelligence.</p>
<p>Sixth, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/court-docket-mystery-are-other-mueller-indictments-hiding-in-plain-sight/article/2639179">there are speculative reports</a> that there are two more sealed indictments from Mueller\'s investigation already docketed.</p>
<p>Seventh, Q says that Soros is targeted. This is consistent with a lot of other information. FBIanon said that Soros is the kingpin. Hannity has stated that Soros is the target of one of his tick-tock happenings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are also reasons to doubt Q.</p>
<p>A. So many &quot;happening&quot; predictions have turned out fake before.</p>
<p>B. Q portrays Mueller as a Marine and hero. But Mueller covered up 9/11. The only way I could see Mueller being a hero is if he was blackmailed or controlled during the 9/11 years somehow. Notably, anonymous &quot;insiders&quot; have repeatedly reported that Mueller was pardoned by Trump. Still, the 9/11 test is a key test of credibility, and Mueller fails it.</p>
<p>C. Trump himself has wide ranging and suspicious connections to Roy Cohn, Larry Silverstein, Henry Kissinger, and other Wall St. people, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2129581">which I go over here</a>.</p>
<p>D. On the surface, it doesn\'t make sense that a true patriot, engaging in the most important military counter-coup in modern U.S. history, would leak it to the internet several days in advance. The potential downside is astronomical (compromising the counter-coup), and the potential upside (a little internet fame) is virtually nil. </p>
<p>E. For the life of me, I cannot understand why Trump would wait a full year after taking power. If you discovered that the deep state was involved in mass drug and child trafficking, treason, sex blackmail, false flag terrorism, and illegal spying (and who knows what else), why would you wait one day to expose it? On January 20th, Trump could have held a live television press conference. Perhaps the white hats needed a year to plan a counter-coup that wouldn\'t destabilize the country or start a war. But that\'s a long time to let evil go unchecked.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, something about Q rings credible to me (and to most of the other users on reddit commenting on Q\'s thread).</p>
<p>For the last few months, I have thought that Trump was simply selected by a different fraction of THE POWERS THAT BE, likely because Hillary Clinton was too reckless and risked exposing deep state operations. That would explain why Trump\'s campaign promises were so attractive (nationalism, America first, end the wars, end lobbying corruption), and yet he didn\'t really fulfill them.  Q\'s thread makes me think that the fault line is drawn differently, between:</p>
<p>A. Trump, the FBI agents in control of the Twitter Records Vault Account, Wikileaks, the U.S. military, and U.S. military intelligence
B. everyone else in the permanent deep state corruption (Democrats, RINOs, CIA, FBI upper management, State Department, etc.)</p>
<p>I guess we will find out tomorrow what happens. Even if nothing happens, I suspect Q gave us some good information.</p>
<p>UPDATE: This is another excellent analysis, which fits with Q\'s story here. In this other analysis, the author argues that Trump has known all along about the multiple different attempts to compromise his Presidential campaign, because he got insider information from Michael Flynn:</p>

<p>UPDATE: POTUS Twitter went down for five minutes, consistent with Q\'s predictions:

<p>UPDATE: After the original series of posts yesterday, Q also started posting again today:

           A. Tomorrow (November 3) Podesta will be indicted (doesn't specify John or Tony)

           </a>
           , this is the face of a man who is given deep assurances and protection.
          </p>
          <p>
           Trump's assurances and protection are also consistent with principle #2 from The Art of the Deal, "
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump:_The_Art_of_the_Deal">
            Protect the downside and the upside will take care of itself
           </a>
           ." Why spend dozens of millions of dollars, and put your family name and businesses through the mud and microscope, if there is a big chance that you won't win? Trump protected the downside by getting assurances and protection from U.S. military intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sixth,
           <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/court-docket-mystery-are-other-mueller-indictments-hiding-in-plain-sight/article/2639179">
            there are speculative reports
           </a>
           that there are two more sealed indictments from Mueller's investigation already docketed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Seventh, Q says that Soros is targeted. This is consistent with a lot of other information. FBIanon said that Soros is the kingpin. Hannity has stated that Soros is the target of one of his tick-tock happenings.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nevertheless, there are also reasons to doubt Q.
          </p>
          <p>
           A. So many "happening" predictions have turned out fake before.
          </p>
          <p>
           B. Q portrays Mueller as a Marine and hero. But Mueller covered up 9/11. The only way I could see Mueller being a hero is if he was blackmailed or controlled during the 9/11 years somehow. Notably, anonymous "insiders" have repeatedly reported that Mueller was pardoned by Trump. Still, the 9/11 test is a key test of credibility, and Mueller fails it.
          </p>
          <p>
           C. Trump himself has wide ranging and suspicious connections to Roy Cohn, Larry Silverstein, Henry Kissinger, and other Wall St. people,
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2129581">
            which I go over here
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           D. On the surface, it doesn't make sense that a true patriot, engaging in the most important military counter-coup in modern U.S. history, would leak it to the internet several days in advance. The potential downside is astronomical (compromising the counter-coup), and the potential upside (a little internet fame) is virtually nil.
          </p>
          <p>
           E. For the life of me, I cannot understand why Trump would wait a full year after taking power. If you discovered that the deep state was involved in mass drug and child trafficking, treason, sex blackmail, false flag terrorism, and illegal spying (and who knows what else), why would you wait one day to expose it? On January 20th, Trump could have held a live television press conference. Perhaps the white hats needed a year to plan a counter-coup that wouldn't destabilize the country or start a war. But that's a long time to let evil go unchecked.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nevertheless, something about Q rings credible to me (and to most of the other users on reddit commenting on Q's thread).
          </p>
          <p>
           For the last few months, I have thought that Trump was simply selected by a different fraction of THE POWERS THAT BE, likely because Hillary Clinton was too reckless and risked exposing deep state operations. That would explain why Trump's campaign promises were so attractive (nationalism, America first, end the wars, end lobbying corruption), and yet he didn't really fulfill them.  Q's thread makes me think that the fault line is drawn differently, between:
          </p>
          <p>
           A. Trump, the FBI agents in control of the Twitter Records Vault Account, Wikileaks, the U.S. military, and U.S. military intelligence
B. everyone else in the permanent deep state corruption (Democrats, RINOs, CIA, FBI upper management, State Department, etc.)
          </p>
          <p>
           I guess we will find out tomorrow what happens. Even if nothing happens, I suspect Q gave us some good information.
          </p>
          <p>
           UPDATE: This is another excellent analysis, which fits with Q's story here. In this other analysis, the author argues that Trump has known all along about the multiple different attempts to compromise his Presidential campaign, because he got insider information from Michael Flynn:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           UPDATE: POTUS Twitter went down for five minutes, consistent with Q's predictions:

            Excellent take. We share the same perspective but you worded it so well. I am concerned about a Zionist takeover. I’m hoping Trump is a Trojan horse of sorts to the Israel-firsters. I wish someone would do a response to Q’s questions.

            The coup you speak up already took place a year ago on Nov. 1st in secret. Everything happening this year is just a show for the public. Steve p. Said this last year.

             Trump's Twitter going down, and then Tony Podesta being targeted by Mueller (per AP), both seem to vindicate Q. I guess we'll see tomorrow. We've been disappointed so many times before...

             I can't say it emphatically enough.  ALL OF YOU ROCK.  THIS THREAD IS GOLD.  God willing, the good guys win this week.  Soros Clinton, Jared, Lynch, Podesta, and the Gang go down. This could result in a shake-up in the media and removal of CIA assets who have been feeding crap to the American public for decades. Maybe the entire swamp will be drained. That would be so awesome. I'm praying for everyone. Well, everyone on the good side, that is.

            With all of this hopefully finally being brought to a head, I wonder how the pope's latest statement that  Catholics should not having a personal relationship with Jesus. He said that the Catholic church will tell them what to believe. That scared me into thinking he is using his power to run a cult that believes pedophilia  will be approved under the NWO. Sure hope not!

             Have you heard of the 7 Noahide Laws? I've read the NWO will usher in those laws - one of which is no homosexuality. Which is effed up considering how they promote it constantly. Pedophilia would be illegal too. But not for the elites or the (((chosen people))).

             Maybe I am completely misreading the situation, but isn't Q's talk about NK and taking hostages implying that NK will take Obama hostage?

            Great news. Fingers crossed and prayer sent. That being said, even these few things Q has laid out will only be small victories. Well still need to hunker down for the shot show that follows.

              One thing's for sure. After this weekend twitter could be getting their ass handed to them. - These fuckers really think taking down the president is gonna be a good idea. lol - Don't worry. I'm sure the prez is in good hands.

            If Trump gave a rat's ass about child trafficking, abuse &amp; pedophilia, he would not be so buddy-buddy with SAUDI ARABIA, who's human rights record is the most atrocious in the world regarding child brides, trafficking, enslavement, rape etc. (which he lied about the amount, apparently) now why would he do that? let me give you a big fat hint: the saudi royal family are JEWS. that's why their crimes against humanity are overlooked.

            so i say, Melania doesn't trust him, so why should i?

              what i'm hoping for is some this idea that military &amp; others against the NWO are making their moves. i reaally really hope that is true. because to be honest without that we're fucked!

            No one noticed that "Q Clearance Patriot" refers to a Department of Energy level clearance.  Q is roughly equivalent to Top Secret.

              Not necessarily.  A Q clearance, like a Top Secret (TS) only means you have been approved to have access to classified at that level.  First, you must have a need to know.  Secondly, you would likely have access, if you have a need to know, to info pertaining to the pit and the detonator only.  Most likely, one would not have access to the mechanism design.  Also, that information would likely be in a special access program (SAP) requiring further credentialing to access.  It all depends on who/what their role is.

            A lot of interesting points.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like I said in reply to somebody else's comment below, Obama was loathed in the DoD.  Bush was more well-liked, but his wrong-headed foreign policy was still seen as exactly that.  Hillary, however, might as well be Satan in the eyes of your average servicemember, and that was before we all knew about this shit with her private server, spirit cooking, and everything else.  It would not surprise me at all if the very few of us who might have been in a position to help in some capacity did so.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that people actively recruited Trump to run, but I'm sure that some may have encouraged him, helped him, and exerted what political influence they could to assist him.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jewish thing is an interesting point.  I'm a service academy grad, and while I don't have formal stats on this, the breakdown there was NOT representative of the general population.  We were over-represented on Catholics (about 45-55%), Mormons, and Evangelicals, and very under-represented with Jews.  I can't say I knew a single one while I was there, although the Jewish chaplain was cool as hell.  In the decade of active service I've had, I've only worked with one (and funnily enough, the entire unit hated the guy).
           </p>
           <p>
            ...oh no, wait, I do know about one Jewish guy from the Academy.  His last name was Weinstein, and his dad went on a rampage against the school when somebody made a joke about his son having a "big nose" during training.  It sounds funny, except his dad was a flaming anti-theist and advocated things like eliminating the chaplain corps entirely.  He was also appointed to the DoD as a special advisor under the Obama administration.  I should see if I can dig anything up on him.  He was a fuckwad.

             Jewish people are statistically very high on atheism (I'm not that religious myself, but when you learn about Satanism, it makes you want God to be true).

             I have no idea why Jewish people don't go into the military, but it could be a critical mistake if FBIanon and Q are right.

                The famous "Satanic" panic cases from the 1980s had repeated links to the CIA (Michael Aquino was CIA at Presidio; CIA shut down The Finders investigation; Nick Bryant traces the Boys Town scandal back to a child trafficker's house in DC, claimed he was protected by the CIA)
               </li>
               <li>
                The CIA is into the occult:

               </li>
               <li>
                Wikileaks HRC/Podesta/DNC emails have the keywords "Thelema" (Satanic religion of Alister Crowley), "Minerva," "Moloch" (referencing animal sacrifice), and "spirit cooking"
               </li>
               <li>
                Spirit cooking is clearly Satanic:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkAVgsOgaw0">
                 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkAVgsOgaw0
                </a>
               </li>
               <li>
                Stanley Kubrick's films are filled with references to clues about deep state corruption. His last film references a Satanic cult, sex orgies, child trafficking, and human sacrifice. He died a few days after showing it to Warner Brothers, after witnesses heard him say "they're going to kill me." The film was released on the 30th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11 (which I believe he directed and faked).
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               And so on. As far as I can tell, some kind of ancient Satanic cult basically setup the CIA.

              Nepotism is despised in the military, and minority status gets you very little.  The tribalism that Jews seem to demonstrate in other industries isn't possible there.  So that's a possibility.  It's a very conservative environment, and most Jews seem to be left-leaning.  It doesn't pay very well.  It's looked down upon by the coastal elite, or seen as a place where only "stupid" or "desperate" people end up.  It's also unapologetically faithful, majority Christian, although most people are not assholes about this.
             </p>
             <p>
              And yeah, a lot of Jewish people do seem to be atheist.  Seems weird to be able to claim your religious affiliation as an ethnicity ut not actually follow any of its tenants.
             </p>
             <p>
              Satanism is creepy as fuck.  From a Catholic perspective at least, demons are out to desecrate God's creation or mock the holy trinity, so a lot of Satanism is based on degradation, humiliation, disgusting sex acts, blood sacrifice, and so on.  You don't need to believe in God to find that sort of thing horrific, although the idea of willfully choosing to reject God utterly and damning yourself for the sake of temporary earthly gains makes the whole thing that much worse.

                That bastard?  I would say so.  During my time in I only knew one pagan and everyone hated her.  I don’t think I’ve ever met a Satanist in uniform.  Of course there are several types of Satanists and some of them go to great lengths to not give off creepy vibes... but I do think it would be a very difficult thing to hide.  For the record, I have had to deal with a couple of civilians who practice black magic and those fuckers just feel rotten to the core.
               </p>
               <p>
                But then, the British military has an actual Satanist chaplain now.  So who knows what’s coming.
               </p>
               <p>
                It seems like people have these ideas about shady cabals and secret societies/organizations within the military.  At least in my experience, that shit just doesn’t exist.  I’m sure things can get a little strange at the Pentagon, more for its proximity to DC than anything else.  There are individuals who no doubt run little crime rings or pedophilia operations; military brats would be easy targets.  There are likely generals who are pedophiles, in the same vein as some of our elected politicians.  Getting the patronage of a senior colonel or general is extremely helpful to one’s career, but even then, the most you usually get is a choice of assignment or an early promotion.  Lots of separate abuses of power.  People are assholes and military people are not exempt from this.  The only thing we have going for us that your average civilian doesn’t is the UCMJ and a foundational expectation of decent behavior.
               </p>
               <p>
                I just seriously doubt there’s some kind of underlying, depraved secret society that runs the DoD.  I mean, maybe there are some people who fancy themselves to be such a thing, but the very structure of the system prevents that.  Our bigger problem is the goddamn GS civilian mafia.

               All of that makes sense. I suspect that Jews, as a constantly persecuted minority throughout history, developed conflict strategies that were based on sneakiness, deception, etc. More prey strategy than predator strategy. In contrast, the military is all about big, bold strength and violence.

               I remember the first time I watched the videos of Majestic Ape at Comet Ping Pong. That's when I realized that Stanley Kubrick was trying to warn us about something in Eyes Wide Shut.

                The military can be sneaky, in terms of operations.  But dealing with other people around the base?  Yeah, nobody puts up with sneaky bullshit.  (And goddamn, yeah, that Jewish guy tended to be really underhanded about things in terms of getting what he wanted.)

                I think it's likely that the Jewish community nurtures tribalism in their children through the SIX MILLION OF US WERE KILLED BY THE NAZIS AND THE WORLD HATES US! thing.  Joining the military, for anybody, is inherently about giving up some of your biases/beliefs and adopting a new group identity that's based on a shared sense on duty and love of America.  From what I understand, a lot of Jews think anything that even hints at nationalism is Nazism.  I think it might just be a more jarring transition for them, and the ones who do make that transition probably aren't interested in the tribalism any more.  After all, most of the black people I know in uniform think racial politics are fucking bullshit.

                 I still remember reading FBIanon write that "9/11 was Mossad" back in October of 2016. I thought that was crazy disinfo then. Later I watched hundreds of hours of videos on youtube and learned the truth.

                 Read the Culture of Critique if you want to learn more about Jewish culture and its affect on U.S./gentile culture. The book is blowing my mind.

                  I might have to check that out.  Like a lot of subjects, it's hard to find something objective about the over-representation of Jews in our cultural institutions.

                   The book is written in a very scholarly way that gave it credibility in my mind, even if liberal academia has largely spurned it. Scholars like Steven Pinker haven't even read it.

              Quoting scripture is good, but that to me signals the anon might be real and what they're predicting is unsettling (lights out, martial law ... something like this could have dire and unintended consequences).

               Be an upstanding individual and you will be fine. Can you trust in that? Regardless of religion, the universe is a benevolent place. Karma is very real. If you watch the news, it unfolds like a story with small blips of truth here and there. Be righteous and trust that your good judgement will shield you from unintended consequences as they unfold.

             Obama and his Bitch Valerie Jarrett had ping-pong for the Kiddies. Sometimes they even paid 65K for Chicago Hotdogs.
Who the hell brags about spending 65 bloody thousand dollars for Hotdogs?

                My demeanor has changed dramatically since I learned the true nature of the people that rule the world.  I learned in stages starting about a year ago.  I thought it could not get any worse, but I was wrong.  Pedophilia, ritual human sacrifice, cannibalism...  I think I learned this late compared to most people here.

                I say this all ends, and we end it now so that future generations do not have to deal with it.  We can't live with ourselves otherwise.

                If all this really does go down, how much will the American people be allowed to know. I've lost sleep over pizzagate and have a stronger constitution than the average normie.

                 They need to know everything so steps can be taken to prevent it from happening again.  This has been going on for thousands of years now, and it needs to stop.  I think the best way to stop it is to shine the light on everything.

            Fellow Patriots, I'm being advised actions have created accelerated counter-actions. We have not yet ascertained the scope of the attack. Watch the news outlets. POTUS' Twitter take down was not by accident (as referenced several hours ago). Should the lights go out please know we are in control. Do not panic. We are prepared and assets are in place. God bless - I must go for good at this point. Q

                I live in smack bang in between two, one nuclear, both 30k apart. We've always known we'd be the first to be taken out in the event of a war. How is this a positive?

                 .  We made it back from our trip to a large, large city without any weirdness.  But interestingly, there's a huge Department of Homeland Security that rolled into a smaller city in my state late yesterday.  A well educated, red-pilled friend brought it to my attention this morning.  Cannot say where, unfortunately, but just wanted to let you know there are strange things going on.  I will look for links to stories or posts online....

             but what if this anon guy is on the other side and is just saying this stuff to squash a counter coup. Anon could be trying to assure us while they impeach the President saying the whole time; don't worry, trust us, martial law, Trumps really in comtrol, blah blah, then they are taking over.

               If Podesta gets arrested there is a good chance him encountering another Jack Ruby on the way to the court. Global Pedophilia is THE NWO. We know that JA is a possible Rotchild - how many JA are out there?!!! We are living in scary times!

                Oh look! Yet another completely unverified and different IP address posted some more cryptic questions: half of which are already public knowledge and have been for years, the other half don’te have any answer (and he knows absolutely nothing classified, so he can’t even post what he is implying). I REALLY believe it now! Come the fuck on, man. The original faggot doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode. Anyone can post anything now. There won’t be martial law.

                    Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of ONLY TWENTY PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with that level of security clearance. Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important is not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 20 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of MARTIAL FUCKING LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the us government.

                    Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! Don’t question it, just spend the entire day ignoring literally everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

                    <p>
                     You could have just said that. All the caps and the fonts and the formatting make you look kind of...well, angry.

                    <p>
                     I don't know what a tripcode is either. The chans are public - anyone can go there and post. I doubt someone with alleged high level access to classified information is going to care what a bunch of pre-teens consider to be proper web etiquette.

                     I notice that you tend to call people you disagree with shills. Shilling implies someone is getting paid. You also like to accuse people of sucking cock. Only faggots and women suck cock, of which I certainly know I am neither. People are allowed to disagree with each other, and they can usually do it without these accusations.

                     I hate the jews at least as much as you do. Maybe more, since I just left a job that had one and he made us all miserable. Trump is fairly pro-jew, unfortunately.

                     This is pretty much the only part of your argument that I agree with. That's why my comment said "Maybe not" - of course it's a LARP. Unlike you, however, I like to entertain the possibility of something like this being plausible. Do YOU know what's actually going on right now? No. And neither do I. And neither does this person, probably. Probably.

                    <p>
                     I stand by my earlier posts - everyone (even you, tremendous asshole) need to stay safe and learn about their local laws surrounding home defense. Go to the store and buy some groceries that won't go bad if the power goes out today. And if nothing happens we'll be a little bit more ready for the next time (that, yes, nothing happens).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If you're tired of all of this, go out, get off of your computer and make something happen.

                      No. I’m angry because people are either being paid–or are so fucking stupid–to say that something will happen. This is all fake. You’re spreading lies created FOR THE PURPOSE of demoralization.

            It's an interesting theory. But let's not forget that Trump hinted at running a long time ago.

             He has hinted on and off for over a decade. That is consistent with being recruited - military intelligence recruited someone who had expressed interest before and also (A) had a clean record, (B) billions of dollars to prevent being bought out, and (C) the media experience to win votes.

            When Trump was 1st beginning to rise in the Republican Party primaries, I had a series of online conversations with a Viet Nam veteran activist. A former Clinton supporter, I was now reading online info especially re child trafficking and what happened to the American public's generous donation to Haiti. I quickly realized no one not reading online info would believe nor accept the possible  downside to a Hillary candidacy.
           </p>
           <p>
            My online friend said that there was a secret coalition in the FBI who had joined with the military to try and reclaim our country. True patriots, they were adamantly against the NWO. The top military officials had all been replaced by Valerie Jarrett's influence and were now very pro-Islamic. Notice there were extremely few military personnel at Obama's farewell speech to their units. There are secrets re Benghazi that have not yet been revealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's believed Trump was threatened by the Deep State once in office that family members would die tragic deaths if he didn't kow-tow to orders breaking his campaign promises. He was recruited because he'd dealt with the swamp before and was used to mafia type tactics. He pulled away, saying "these girls don't even have tits yet." Meaning he wasn't interested in sex with a child. He didn't kill his former lovers &amp; sex partners either.

             Are you saying Jarret appointed proislamic generals? Why would they not show up for Obama’s farewell?  What’s your impression on how Trump is handling deep state threats to his family?  I’m guessing he is treading lightly...

              Jarret's only ability to appoint generals would have been through Congress.  I doubt this is what happened.
             </p>
             <p>
              Having been active duty during the Obama years, I would say that there were less conspiratorial forces at work with regards to the GO ranks, but no less damaging.  This SJW bullshit infected everything, and the DoD is especially susceptible to it, since nobody in uniform is allowed to publicly fight back; no politics in uniform.  Obviously, this starts to really fuck with your head when clear falsehoods and dangerous ROEs get shoved down your throat.  Add a crushing war, insane deployment timelines, personnel cuts and budget drawdowns, and morale was in the shitter.
             </p>
             <p>
              Good CGO and FGO officers (the tough, war-minded, fair, no bullshit ones who loathe the waste and bureaucracy) started leaving in droves.  The older officers had to toe the line if they wanted to make rank.  After all, generals had to get appointed by a Democrat Congress and then keep those same politicians happy.  I know personally of at least one GO whose career was intentionally destroyed by Claire McCaskill for daring to buck the "all men are rapists" meme.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are unfortunately a few "true believer" liberals in the DoD.  I worked for a colonel like that.  It was horrible.  However, most people, even the ones who got their general stars under him,
