<p>It is important to know that the Clintons had a warm friendship with a notorious human trafficker almost 20 years ago!  We were surprised to learn that.  This is well documented, and we try to be brief.  The trafficker even after his global crimes were known, by the corrupt MSM as well, was able to visit America, continuing the Clinton friendship, and even befriending Joe Biden, whom he visited in the White House.</p>
<p>There are thousands of references to the enormity of the story, again, we want to keep it short and highlight the key points. This has roots in the Yugoslavian War between the Serbs, Croatians, Muslims, etc. It is a complex situation and we focus on the trafficking aspects. The violence was on all sides, and there was major provocation of the Albanians who formed KLA. However, they too late prevailed, with rapes, murders, organ trafficking, and USA support from the Clinton Foundation, the Podesta Group, and Joe Biden of the White House.</p>
<p>The Clinton Foundation invited the prime minister of Kosovo Hashim Thaci to the 2011 Clinton Global Initiative conference knowing he had been implicated in human organ trafficking as head of the Kosovo Liberation Army in the late 1990s.
“What are USG views on WJC inviting former Kosovo PM [Hashim] Thaci and the current PM to CGI?” Clinton Foundation foreign policy adviser Amitabh Desai wrote in an Aug. 17, 2011 email to several top Hillary Clinton State Department officials.
“Is Thaci still embroiled in organ harvesting issues and is that of consequence?” Desai asked, which the State Department later released to the group Citizens United.</p>
<p>It gets worse, as the Clintons do everything in a large way.  Thaci, the trafficker, was asked back again in 2012 and 2013 to help with Clinton Foundation meetings. Clintons knew this was wrongful.  On Feb. 23, 1998, Robert Gelbard, Bill Clinton’s envoy to the Balkans, called KLA is “a terrorist group.”  Yet Bill Clinton is regarded as a hero in Kosovo, supported by his friendship with Thaci.  A boulevard in Pristina, Kosovo’s capital city, is named after Bill Clinton. A monumental statue of Clinton was erected there in 2009 after the Democrats were elected again, giving Thaci a new friendship with Joe Biden. Hillary Clinton is also regarded as a heroine in Kosovo, with fashion stores named after her. The dowdy and pear-shaped Clinton is praised as a style icon.  The first Hillary boutique is located on Bill Clinton Boulevard. </p>
<p>Thaci and the Republic of Kosovo signed a $50,000-a-month lobbying contract with The Podesta Group, and John and Tony Podesta.  John is Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman while Tony runs the lobbying side and has bundled more than $250,000 in campaign contributions for Clinton.  Podesta Group’s relationship with Kosovo is mentioned in the WikiLeaks dump of John Podesta’s hacked emails.</p>
<p>Crimes of KLA, according to the Council of Europe, heroin, and human organs. Knowledge of how to transport prisoners of war over borders to harvest their organs.
The sex trafficking in women and girls with the knowledge of Thaci, if not direct handling, goes back many years.  This first article has most sex trafficking info.</p>
<p>“According to an International Labor Office (ILO) report, a single female held for sexual exploitation yields an average of $67,200 annually in Western Europe. In a three-month investigation, Global Post has uncovered mounting allegations that the highest levels of the U.S.-backed Kosovo government are involved in this human trafficking.”…</p>
<p>“Luan said that officials in the parties of two former KLA commanders are closely tied up in the trade. The parties are: the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), whose leader is the current prime minister of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci; and …Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister who is currently in custody at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague as he awaits trial on charges of war crimes.”</p>
<p>One man goes to jail, the other man gets to be consulted by the Clinton Foundation and be received by Joe Biden at the White House!</p>

            <strong>
             THIS IS BAD
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Despite that critique, Bill Clinton is regarded as a hero in Kosovo for his opposition to Milosevic. A boulevard in Pristina, Kosovo’s capital city, is named after the Democrat. A statue of Clinton was also erected there in 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thaci and his government have another Clinton connection. In 2012, the Republic of Kosovo signed a $50,000-a-month lobbying contract with The Podesta Group, a lobbying firm co-founded by brothers John and Tony Podesta.
            </p>
            <p>
             John is Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. Tony runs the lobbying shop and has bundled more than $250,000 in campaign contributions for Clinton. His signature appears on agreements with the Republic of Kosovo disclosed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).
            </p>
            <p>
             The agreement states that the Podesta Group would “research and analyze issues of concern to the principal; counsel the principal on U.S. policies of concern, activities in Congress and the Executive branch and developments on the U.S. political scene generally; and maintain contact, as necessary, with Members of Congress and their staff, Executive branch officials, members of the press, and nongovernmental organizations.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Podesta Group’s relationship with Kosovo and other foreign governments is mentioned in the Wikileaks dump of John Podesta’s hacked emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             In an April 13, 2015 email chain, Clinton campaign officials are seen discussing whether to take campaign donations from lobbyists registered under FARA.
            </p>
            <p>
             After internal debate on the issue, Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, decided to continue accepting the money.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks,” he wrote.

             It finds the KLA did hold mostly Serb captives in a secret network of six detention facilities in northern Albania, and that Thaçi's Drenica group "bear the greatest responsibility" for prisons and the fate of those held in them.
            </p>
            <p>
             They include a "handful" of prisoners said to have been transferred to a makeshift prison just north of Tirana, where they were killed for their kidneys.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report states: "As and when the transplant surgeons were confirmed to be in position and ready to operate, the captives were brought out of the 'safe house' individually, summarily executed by a KLA gunman, and their corpses transported swiftly to the operating clinic.''
            </p>
            <p>
             The same Kosovan and foreign individuals involved in the macabre killings are linked to the Medicus case, the report finds.
