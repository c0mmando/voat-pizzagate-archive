<p>Excerpts from March 17, 2020 Forbes article: <a href="http://archive.is/EGUus">To Fight Coronavirus, This City Is Asking 911 Callers To Agree To Self Surveillance</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a regular day in New Orleans’ 911 communications center, 45 people answer approximately 2,500 emergency calls. But days are anything but regular right now. Starting on March 16, 2020, emergency responders in the city of New Orleans are adapting to the new normal amidst the coronavirus pandemic by testing out Carbyne, an Israeli startup providing “next-generation 911” tech, founded by 35-year-old entrepreneur Amir Elichai.</p>
<p>These responders are now using a tool built in part by former members of Israel’s military intelligence—Elichai being one—that’s backed by <strong>Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund</strong>, former Israeli Prime Minister <strong>Ehud Barak</strong>, who is now the company’s chairman, and a small, passive investment from deceased multimillionaire pedophile <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>. </p>
<p>Its founder thinks Carbyne’s tech could make the lives of 911 dispatch and healthcare professionals much less chaotic in the Covid-19 crisis. Carbyne relies on callers submitting themselves to self-surveillance via their own mobile phone. Once a caller uses their Android or iPhone to call 911 (85% of emergency calls now come from mobile devices), they receive a text message that asks for permission to get their precise location and access video from their smartphone camera. </p>
<p>..hortly after, Elichai founded Reporty, which he later renamed Carbyne, a nod to the strongest material on earth. In 2015, he cold-called former prime minister Barak, now an investor with a penchant for surveillance companies. He was soon joined by Founders Fund partner Stephens and <strong>NJF Capital founder Nicole Junkermann, advisors like President George W. Bush’s secretary of homeland security Michael Chertoff, ex-commissioner of the Met Police Lord Bernard Hogan-Howe, and a roster of Israeli surveillance veterans bulking up the Carbyne team</strong>. </p>
<p>..<strong>The Epstein association may well prove to be a minor distraction</strong>. Since 2017, Carbyne has built up a customer base of 30 American 911 departments and some 20 emergency response units in Mexico as well as 9 in Israel. It also partnered with two major companies in 2019. Last April, the company started working with the network equipment giant Cisco for its hardware, and two months later, announced a collaboration with Google to use Android phones’ location services at emergency command centers across Mexico. In October, Elichai, who sees Carbyne’s main market as the U.S., moved the company headquarters from Israel to New York City. </p>
<p>Such is Carbyne’s growth. There is a big chance it could go public in the next three to five years, Elichai says, speaking to Forbes days before the stock market had its worst day since 1987. “Carbyne is going to be a unicorn and basically the new public safety monster. And this is what we’re trying to build here.”</p>

            That's really disturbing. I thought there were only two US 911 departments using this technology.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hogan-Howe served as Commissioner in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal in 2012, after which more allegations of historic sexual abuse were made to police and police began a following a guidance by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary which said "the presumption that a victim should always be believed should be institutionalised".[20] Operation Yewtree, which was set up by the Met following the Savile scandal, saw many celebrities arrested and repeatedly bailed without charge. As a result, then-Home Secretary Theresa May proposed that bail time be limited to 28 days and Hogan-Howe supported the proposal.[21] The 28-day limit came into effect in April 2017.[22] Broadcaster Paul Gambaccini was arrested by Operation Yewtree police and spent a year on bail before being told he would not face charges. Gambaccini described Hogan-Howe as "the villain of my life" and that he "attempted to destroy my life and end my career for their own public relations purposes in a 100 per cent fraud".[23]
            </p>
            <p>
             The Met launched Operation Midland in 2014 after Carl Beech, then known publicly under the pseudonym "Nick", alleged that several high profile men had abused him and that he had witnessed them murder three boys. DS Kenny McDonald issued a statement in which he said that they believed Beech's allegations were "credible and true" but the probe was closed after 16 months when no evidence was found to corroborate the claims.[24] Hogan-Howe initially refused to apologise to those wrongly accused by Beech,[25] but did so after a report by Richard Henriques detailed numerous failings by the Met and found that those accused were victims of false allegations.[26] After these failings,
             <strong>
              Hogan-Howe called for the Met to change their approach, and no longer automatically believe complainants
             </strong>
             .[20] Beech was convicted of charges related to lying to the police in July 2019 and was sentenced to 18 years in jail

            I was introduced to them digging Junkermanns associations, and knew this would be one of the tools for the next phase of global surveillance.  Carbyne has been back on my mind since I began reading about the cellphone data being used to see if people were obeying mandates in the CV lockdown. I thought this 'MONSTER' might be involved...

             Check DJT donor and supporter Erik Prince. He developed a similar software for the Chinese, to be used for the surveillance of the Uighur minority.

             Incidentally, Prince employed convicted pedo George Nader (currently in prison again), and some of the men involved in organ trafficking in Kosovo.

              The article names members of the Arizona Mafia in a list, which is similar to the list I reported on a few days ago. According to the Arizona Capitol Times, “At least 25 Arizonans, mostly from within her gubernatorial administration, followed [Janet] Napolitano to Washington D.C., and served within the massive U.S. Department of Homeland Security that she has overseen for the past four-and-a-half years. Many have moved on to bigger and better things.” By “bigger and better things,” the author meant that many of the 25 individuals gained senior positions within agencies of the
              <strong>
               Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
              </strong>
              . Usually those positions were at or near the top of the agency organizational chart, such as “Chief of Staff” or “Chief Administrator” positions.
