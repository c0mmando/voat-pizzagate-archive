Here is also IBtimes <a href="http://archive.is/AN2sM">supposed rebuttal</a> of the claims.</p>
<p>From the Russian news agency Tass\'s <a href="http://archive.is/Dkzl9">article</a> on the CyberBerkut claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Ukrainian hacker group, CyberBerkut, has published the results of its investigation, which say that a network of biological labs is running covert experiments in Ukraine under the US control.</p>
<p>&quot;CyberBerkut continues to follow the covert activities of US special services and non-governmental organizations in Ukraine,&quot; the group said in a statement, posted on its website on Thursday. &quot;Recently, outbreaks of diseases rare for our country have been actively discussed on the web. Many Ukrainians believe that they were caused by secret experiments with pathogenic microorganisms, held in US biological labs in various cities of our country. A total of 15 such facilities, financed by the US, have been built in our country since 2009 with an alleged purpose of reducing biological threats.&quot;
However, according to the statement, the number and scope of biological threats has multiplied after the construction of those facilities.</p>
<p>&quot;Outbreaks of rare diseases that shocked Ukraine in recent years were probably caused by routine leaks from these labs. However, this scenario appears to be highly unlikely, considering how skilled US specialists are. Most likely, those outbreaks were intentional and were a part of tests on modifications of biological warfare agents with a purpose of testing and improving them,&quot; the group says.</p>
<p>According to CyberBerkut, its hackers were able to uncover &quot;the organizational structure&quot; of US biological experiments in Ukraine.</p>
<p>&quot;It is officially claimed that the labs are under the supervision of the Ukrainian Health Ministry. Although, of course, this is just a formality considering that since August 1, 2016, this agency has been headed by US citizen and Maidan activist Ulyana Suprun. In reality, covert biological experiments are being carried out under the Pentagon’s aegis,&quot; the document reads.
According to the National Medical Chamber of Ukraine, the rate of infection by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C and other socially dangerous diseases in the country remains among the highest in Europe and the world. The country’s medical community is particularly concerned by the spread of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In recent years, the country was hit by several outbreaks of measles. Last year, the southeastern Ukrainian city of Izmail was hit by an unknown intestinal infection. Outbreaks of swine flu, botulism, leptospirosis and other infections have also been registered.</p>

            CyberBerkut has some amazing stuff on the CF.  Here is a (MF) deleted topic I had on their revelation that millions of dollars Victor Pinchuk gave to the CF came from stolen IMF money.

                Doesn't work that way, homes.  I'm telling the truth, but not giving you a source, because you are rude and accused me of dishonesty.

and you somehow missed one of the biggest developments in the hacking story in the past month.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Ukranian story on the Clinton Foundation came out because Donald Trump Jr and Trump himself were so compromised by the Trump Tower meeting with Russians close to the Kremlin who promised Clinton dirt to be used in the campaign.  In fact, people predicted it based on the timing of previous leaks.

                Of course, Guccifer 2 is fake.
               </p>
               <p>
                The persona of Guccifer 2 didn't exist until Crowdstrike wrote the blogpost exposing Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear of hacking the DNC.

               </p>
               <p>
                Guccifer 2 was a quickly thrown together cover story to try to cover their tracks.

                You missed my point.

            This should absolutely ne discussed by everyone. The Clinton Foundation had Neonatal clinics instituted in the country prior to release of biological weapons to get the most bang for their buck,
The mothers were even forced to deliver early at 6 and 7 months gestation to get access to smaller Body and organs from live  babies!
           </p>
           <p>
            The Pinchuk Foundation was involved and his name is on the neonatal clinics. The buoweapons released included swine flue and worse. Swine flue was created by the military than released on purpose to the people of Ukraine. Most of these new diseases and flues are this way and the reason fir pushing the vaccines is sinister. The babies in Ukraine that lived were adopted out to gay couples everywhere...mostly male because their is no background checks. It is literally an incestous baby factory and many of the children were found to have gone to sick sick pefophiles. This is why Russia stopped their adoptions to US because of Satanic pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are graves in the Ukraine of children's bodies that were empty of their organs stacked together. They called them "kid shells"
           </p>
           <p>
            This was/is happening as the Senators on the Senate Foreign Arms committee including the Biden's put themselves on the boards of the wealthiest banks in the UKraine and have been making money hand over fist into their off shore accounts while little babies are purposely born early and harvested.

              I'm not sure but I would suspect in its current form probably at least by the mid nineties during Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma (Pinchuk's stepfather) term.  But things definitely got many magnitudes worse after the Orange Revolution.

             Working on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, the Podesta Group lobbied in Washington for positions favored by the pro-Russian political party, of which deposed former President Viktor Yanukovych was a member. The lobbying work ended in 2014 after Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia, where he remains in exile.

             Ukraine became essentially Soros territory after the Orange revolution.  I need to learn more about Manafort and his connection with the Podesta group.  Swordfish appears to be much more knowledgeable on the topic than I.
