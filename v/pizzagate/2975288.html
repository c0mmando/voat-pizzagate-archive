Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead!</p>

Being considered for high posistion in Clinton presidency. Its almost as if everything seems to directly or indirectly tie to the Clintons somehow.</p>
<p>From all this, I can deduce the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The CIA is stupid. In trying to pull this false flag against the Heather O’Rourke, they tipped their hand. Guess I should wear this incident as a badge of honor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The timing (August, less than a month after I identifed the date of the fatal incident) means someone is scared of the truth coming out. Over the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tipped hand shows us EXACTLY who in Pedowood we need to be focusing our collective wrath on. Steven Spielberg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason the media and the CIA are circling the wagons around Spielberg is because he is an essential piece regarding Operation Mockingbird’s fog on the masses minds. If he falls or is exposed to the public, the Mocking Bird dies. Meaning that Operation Yep Yep Yep must succeed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2967972">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2967972</a></p>
<ol>
<li>If the Mocking Bird dies, their ability to suppress Pizzagate dies too. Pizzagate comes out, they’re ALL fucked.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=Hntlv5Zl04Y">https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=Hntlv5Zl04Y</a> Seems Jamie Dlux suspects Winkler too. The name of Heather’s agent is Mike Myer. Seems the coroner was told that the cause of death was congenital stenosis. Meaning he was deceived too.</p>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<ul>
<li>Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois.</li>
</ul>
<p>** Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. </p>
<p>** Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<ul>
<li>Happy Days: </li>
</ul>
<p>** Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</li>
</ul>
<p>** Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her rectum. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>** Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples (or an accomplice).</p>
<p>** Accomplice (others): Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the false flag.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9p0EMeFUqsU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9p0EMeFUqsU</a> The MacCuly Culkininterview itself. The exec that tried to molest him refered to his shoes being made from Heather O\'Rourke\'s skin. Note that the original article was scrubbed from the internet within hours of appearing. The fact that this was scrubbed is further evidence that it is real.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-items-revealed-30.html?m=1">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-items-revealed-30.html?m=1</a> If my deduction is correct, given the above, the Heather O\'Rourke story could be the subject of the threats in this blind. I personally suspect that the bad shit in Culkin\'s life (the drugs) was from trauma due to the horrors he saw or experienced (namely the O\'Rourke skin shoes). He could have some split personalities.</p>
<p>🚨 Any producer, actor, or director with the red shoes needs to be identified. This subject matter is worth its own thread (maybe it will help me find the identity of the people who have “trophies” of O’Rourke). 🚨</p>
<p>Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=npXwUnfk6Eg">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=npXwUnfk6Eg</a> Around the 24 minute mark, seems Heather didn’t have ANY symptoms until 1987. Based on the account of a medic, its highly unlikely for a congenital birth defect in the colon to go completely unnoticed in terms of symptoms for that long.</p>',

             The timing (August, less than a month after I identifed the date of the fatal incident) means someone is scared of the truth coming out. Over the target.

             The tipped hand shows us EXACTLY who in Pedowood we need to be focusing our collective wrath on. Steven Spielberg.

             The reason the media and the CIA are circling the wagons around Spielberg is because he is an essential piece regarding Operation Mockingbird’s fog on the masses minds. If he falls or is exposed to the public, the Mocking Bird dies. Meaning that Operation Yep Yep Yep must succeed.

           Seems Jamie Dlux suspects Winkler too. The name of Heather’s agent is Mike Myer. Seems the coroner was told that the cause of death was congenital stenosis. Meaning he was deceived too.

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           ** Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.
          </p>
          <p>
           ** Accomplices: Judy Wix

           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           ** Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           ** Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her rectum. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           ** Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples (or an accomplice).
          </p>
          <p>
           ** Accomplice (others): Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the false flag.

           The MacCuly Culkininterview itself. The exec that tried to molest him refered to his shoes being made from Heather O'Rourke's skin. Note that the original article was scrubbed from the internet within hours of appearing. The fact that this was scrubbed is further evidence that it is real.
          </p>

           </a>
           If my deduction is correct, given the above, the Heather O'Rourke story could be the subject of the threats in this blind. I personally suspect that the bad shit in Culkin's life (the drugs) was from trauma due to the horrors he saw or experienced (namely the O'Rourke skin shoes). He could have some split personalities.
          </p>
          <p>
           🚨 Any producer, actor, or director with the red shoes needs to be identified. This subject matter is worth its own thread (maybe it will help me find the identity of the people who have “trophies” of O’Rourke). 🚨
          </p>
          <p>
           Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.
          </p>
          <p>

           </a>
           Around the 24 minute mark, seems Heather didn’t have ANY symptoms until 1987. Based on the account of a medic, its highly unlikely for a congenital birth defect in the colon to go completely unnoticed in terms of symptoms for that long.

             Heather’s death isn’t the only Pedowood murder I’ve been trying to solve. The Judith Barsi murder (NOT a murder suicide) is a case I’ve been investigating for about a year. The O’Rourke case for 11 months.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both cases are personal, albet for different reason.

                I'm serious...if you want to REALLY put post-1970 cinema (not just Hollywood...think about what that implies...) together, this is the one...his resume is unprecedented, his connections beyond compare, and is absolutely revered by the sodomites of LA....

              The only one I remember is Vincent Dee Costume Dept. There is a Vincent Dee Miles who may be related. He is actor and Ptoducer and is connected to Jurrasic Park of 1997. He may have been connected to SS before. Am on phone and am not doing well lately. Good luck with this. Will help more if I can later.

               Riffing means letting loose with verbal blows of intellectual fury that resonate through and beyond the space time continuum...this is Bill...he's a the greatest man next to John Wayne to ever be shown on a television screen...

               but seriously tell me every detail of the gay mafia trying to wack you...I think Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, David Geffen, Steven Spielberg, Tom Steyer and his brother are all Sir Sodomites and Regal Reamers of the gay mafia...it's too obvious...
