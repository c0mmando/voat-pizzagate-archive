<p>Question 3: Why is it that when I watch old horror movies of vampires I am supposed to be frighten of the idea?

            Dracula was JEWISH.  He actually wore a Star of David around his neck in the original/older B&amp;W movies.  Of course, Jewish Hollyweird couldn't have that, so it was removed in later versions.

            The title of nobility, COUNT, is a huge CLUE.  All entitled nobility are of JEWISH BLOODlines.

            I saw a website posing the question if Johny Depp's tatoos were Illuninati, Satanic or Vampire. The first two are redundant, because Illuminati and secret societies are believed to have occult/satanic worship. And considering Vampires are blood suckers/drinkers, they do what the elite are accused of doing. Vampires seem to be a sort of metaphor representing an elite being,  that lives off the blood of the young.

            YES!  My first thought when we heard of the blood drinking and Blood as the New Fountain of Youth was the Vampire Movies.  They wanted to Romanticize the idea of Vampires and the idea of draining the blood from people as Sexually Exciting. Remember the flurry over the characters?
