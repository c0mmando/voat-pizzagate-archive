            Even if a 10 year girl is pregnant -- that is no reason for her to get married.  It is reason, however, for the adults in her life to be investigated to find out how this was allowed to happen (failure to supervise, molestation, etc.).  You cannot make a bad situation (a child getting pregnant) better by making an equally bad mistake (forcing them into a marriage that they are not ready for or which they do not actually want).
           </p>
           <p>
            A 16 year old can be engaged for 2 years until they are legally old enough to get married.  If the relationship doesn't last long enough to get to the legal age of marriage, then it would have been a mistake to get married anyway.

             Primarily because they feel that if a girl gets pregnant, the boy has to marry her.  In other parts of the country, they don't bother getting married -- the "baby daddy" just hangs around as long as he wants to cuts out when he is tired of playing house.

            not too many generations ago, people in the US in their late teens had actual responsibilities and started working to support themselves. some still do.  it's only recently where most are successfully able to avoid growing up until their 30s.  don't see that much of a problem, in and of itself, to allow responsible 16-17 year olds to marry in certain circumstances especially if both parties are religious, understand the obligation, and the marriage is age appropriate

              no you're right, that part of the law is a difficult one.   realistically any kid 14 and under who has a baby, maybe the parents of that tweenie should be charged with a crime of neglect for allowing it (obviously stat rape for any perp whose 18 and up).  i guess that the presumption should be giving the baby for  adoption (and no marriage) for kids under 16 with marriage being allowable with a judge approval for those at least 14..  idk it is a tough problem esp with the us being so promiscuous generally

               has it occurred to you that measuring age in terms of the natural stages of biology is more sensible than the number of revolutions around the sun.  ponder this for a bit and you might see how absurd this conversation is.  it's almost surreal.  yea it is a serious 'problem' that fertile creatures get pregnant, and without even having obtained a Masters degree in dance theory!

                yeah ok, try implementing laws in even a village that bases consent/marriage upon "natural stages of biology", that should be easily defined and implemented.. yeah threre's no absurdity in that..  btw you do realize that the natural stages of biology are out of whack currently with some girls hitting puberty before they can actually carry a baby due to our effed up diet and environmental factors right???

                Except that you cannot go simply by physical maturity.  There is a psychological maturity level to be considered as well.  Also, chemicals such as BPA have accelerated the maturation process (lowered the ages of puberty) with endocrine disruption.  So you have 9 year olds getting their periods and growing breasts.  A 9 year old -- even if physically mature, is in no way shape or form psychologically mature enough to engage in a sexual relationship.  They aren't even ready to have the type of boyfriend you just kiss.
               </p>
               <p>
                Add in the fact that previous generations were very adult centric and that adults were expected to grow up, be responsible and act like adults -- having sex, getting married at that age and being pregnant meant that you became and acted like an adult.  You didn't leave your kids at home with grandma while you went out partying and acting like you are still a child.  Our society today cannot function the way that previous generations did because our society is youth obsessed and we have adopted this idea that we should NEVER grow up.  We should party and act like teens for our entire lives instead of following the natural order of things where we sow our wild oats in youth and then put away childish things and behave responsibly like adults.  We can't go back to the "old ways" unless ALL of society goes back to ALL of the old ways.
