            You know if she wants to be a satanist and drink semen blood or whatever the fuck she was doing fine as long as there are no actual laws being broken im cool with it. Where i draw the line is fanatics of this shit then using it to try and make policy decisions involving our government. What happens when the decision to start a nuclear war or not is based off divining chicken bones or whatever delusional shit they are doing at the moment. I think thats totally unacceptable. Also the pedo shit is criminal and anyone linked definitively to that should be brought down hard.

            I think we quite not nailed all the codes yet. That famous image which supposedly decipher all the codes is very wrong to me, because it doesn't make sense in some e-mails.
           </p>
           <p>
            About the pedo stuff. There's a solid connection between Marina Abramovic, the Podestas and James Alefantis. Abramovic is a well-known satanist, so I guess "normal" people woundn't like to be friends with her. Alefantis posted some crypto-pedo stuff in his Instagram. Podesta used code words in his emails.
So it's not that hard to make the connection: satanism - child sex - coded language.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the coded words are not pedophylia related, why don't they tell us the true meaning? t can't be possibly worse than that, lol.

                Ask yourself, if their relationship with those kids are as cozy as some think, why mention their ages? They would obvously know.
               </p>
               <p>
                How many times have you been invited to an event or party, where ages have been relevant?
               </p>
               <p>
                I still think is very unusual, and something worth mentioning.

                 I don't think mentioning the age is something unusual at all. Women love to tell the age of their kids so the other person can imagine how cute they are.

            I'm trying here to put just the undeniable evidence. The McCann connection for an example could be a super coincidence. If we can put him in Portugal that would be a smoking gun, but we're not there yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the MSM denies all the evidence, they have to explain to us what the hell Podesta and his friends are talking about, because is not pizza.

            If we're talking literal pasta with literal walnut sauce, I do. It's a real dish. Here's a recipe:

             http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/nigella-lawson/pasta-with-walnut-sauce-recipe.html

           </p>
           <p>
            Could be code, but the idea that it's a not a real thing was flawed from the start.

             No one says it is not a real thing. It is just an extremely uncommon dish. I've had more Chinese dishes with walnuts in my lifetime than Italian.

            Exactly. I'm suspicious of the guy who upon being told learning that he'd inadvertently used a symbol for fucking little boys as his business logo is just like, "Idgaf, it's my logo now."

            I mean have you even tried pasta with walnut sauce? I guess your point would stand that it's an uncommon food item - but for someone with his paychecks who knows that could be a weekly thing.

            To many already connected dots of dirty politicians to deny that this whole scandal just does hand in hand with what we sort of already knew.. it almost seems like something we should have picked up on earlier... the signs were all there.... we just assumed these sick desires were reserved for a special breed of fucked up people but it certainly seems much much deeper than that!

            Yes OP, the problem is that those things don't mean pedophile ring. SURE, plenty of rich dudes fuck kids. People in power too. But that's the desert. It's the reward to them, it's not the drive. Pizzagate could uncover so much, but everyone wants it to be pedo stuff because one 4chan guy "connected" those "code" words and everyone has been tunnel vision sense. My problem is, you are probably looking at a few cases of pedophilia and missing the big picture. He's not going to come out and say "boy I sure like fucking kids so much." But those pass through businesses are clearly money fronts (what pizza shop owner travels the world like that?), the connections around the world with all these businesses are clearly fronts. The money involved is clearly illegal. Pizza gate needs to expand their focus. Lazering in on a child stealing ring for the whole purpose of fucking kids is a lot harder to believe than a ring of rich people SELLING humans around the world, playing a shell game with the money, buying guns and drugs and selling those, and probably fucking a kid or two along the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone is looking for proof of a ring of satanic child fuckers, when they need to be finding the proof of illegal activity and TYING child fucking to that.

             I think you're right in some sense, but we can't ignore the Marina Abramovic connection. I think that Podestas are definitely into satanism, and child sex is just one of the things involved in this cult. The child sex part is probably provided by Alefantis, who has some very cryptopedo posts in his instagram.

             A guy in the UK spent 15 years researching that kind of thing among the UK establishment, he has reams and reams of evidence apparently exposing hundreds of thousands of steel companies and fraud and money laundering being done by UK politicians and government. There's also an elite child abuse scandal as well, although they refer to it as 'historic abuse' because they're focused on victims from the 80s who recently came forward. Even though it is clearly still going on, why wouldn't it be? No one did anything to stop it in the first place or put safeguards in place. I bet that researcher's work ties in with Pizzagate in some way.

              Child trafficking is HUGE business. I posted the numbers somewhere on voat but its hundreds of millions of dollars a year made, and the charities also make tens of millions a year. It's a big business. I think it's like owning a whore house, you aren't IN IT to fuck the girls, it's just a perk when you're bored. You are in the trafficking game, to make money.

            Yeah, and #chickenlovers literally means Alefantis' friends all love hens, and the baby in the photo with the yellow necklace around his head just happened to be in the nice #chickenlovers arms when the photo was taken 
And silly us, Alefantis knows a talented carpenter who specializes in creating boxes that just happen to resemble tiny child-size coffins. 
Then there's the pool parties where grown adults actually transport stranger's kids to come swim with them in heated water. Everyone knows it's good to swim with children under ten to build aerobic strength in case you have to hold your breath while eating pizza.

                  I searched the Podesta emails for "Gendelman" and got about 150 results but no attachments with a baby picture. I've found the searching to be lacking in the past as well. Please link to the email or tell me the criteria. Thanks.

                   The Voat.co search function either works extremely badly or else the relevant threads have been removed (this seems to be the case). It is definitely in the Podesta emails. Search for "Juliana Kohl Gendelman." The subject line is something like "Happy Birthday Mr. Podesta." The attachment shows a photo of the baby. Then there is another email in which Gendelman says she is flying to Washington with Rosie to see him.

            James Alefantis coincidentally is the live-in boyfriend to David Brock, who operates the PAC Media Matters that gives talking points to the media, and any media outlets like NYT and NPR that write stories defending James Alefantis is purely coincidental.

             Yes, the most likely person to be behind the 'debunking' of Pizzagate is Brock. Possibly working with Podesta, but I doubt it.

             And if Podesta was just a 'master of cuisine' wouldn't he be talking about dishes with more expensive ingredients? Most of the superfoodies I know are into truffles, lobster, real caviar etc. - stuff that most people can't really afford.

              Alefantis is indeed part of this chain of emails, albeit I think Tony is who sent the photo. A possible correlation is that pigs are a "substitute" or a euphemism for humans in many ways, including "long pig" being a code phrase for humans who are eaten, "pigs" being a phrase to describe NeoFascists, and the similarities between pig and human organs. Tony has an elongated pig-human mother suckling piglets on one of his couches. Tell me what the deep, artistic meaning behind
              <em>
               that
              </em>
              piece is.

              Holy fuck! "James A" is our very same James Alefantis and I gotta say the text/photo combo leaves me speechless. There's pretty much nothing in the text to warn or prepare you for a sliced up pig corpse and yet, there it is, just hanging out.

            This post is me every day. When you've drilled down to it, it's seriously more difficult to
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            to think something's going. I said once, I'll say it again, the DNC would have to be the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to justify this much fucking talk about pizza.

            Yes, but is this really proof? Or just a photoshop joke?
Same with hillary clinton going to comet-pizza,where is the proof?
Or the basement exist or not? Where is the proof?

Early on city building permits were pulled and there is NO mod on file for that location. If it be true that they built tunnels without a permit you could have the entire city-hall crawling up their ass.

             I've cooked Italian from dozens of cookbooks in my lifetime and have travelled in Italy extensively and I have never once seen a recipe for pasta with walnut sauce in a book or seen it on a restaurant menu. It is NOT a popular dish.

              While it may not be a popular dish, it at least makes sense. I actually love OPs narrative and think it should be pushed through memes in a sarcastic way, but it should only include the really bizarre ones.  Also to make a correction it was Todd D. Stern who was dreaming about Podesta's hot dog stand in Hawaii.
              <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231">
               https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231
              </a>
              So now we have to believe that either Podesta has a hot dog stand in Hawaii, or his friends think he does.

               I'm not arguing against pizzagate as a whole, but...
              </p>
              <p>
               My dad always used to always talk about quitting the rat race and opening a chili stand. The big joke was that he was going to intentionally make
               <em>
                bad
               </em>
               chili so that no one would come buy anything. It's a joke "dream" about getting away from a stressful job - and I could definitely see the same being the case here.. Podesta is even from my dad's generation, so that type of joke could be common in that age group.
              </p>
              <p>
               Stern could just be playing on a running joke like that to indicate that he's stressed out.

             Of course. It needs to be real actual things for the code to function.  But yeah, maybe OP didn't know it was a real thing.

             I would say that in America it isn't really that common of a thing. I've never eaten it in my life, and I'm a big restaurant eater.

              True, but the guy's also meant to be a "gourmet" chef and these people are massive yuppies. Walnut sauce makes more sense to me than spaghetti and meatballs from these kind of people tbh.

            My initial belief was that people very directly linked to Clinton/DNC did not have direct involvement.  If nothings else, too many red flags would keep them out of the inner circle.  In politics, the appearance of impropriety is as bad as the reality of it.  But then I see Podesta's brother invites  people into his home with large cock photos on the wall and a sculpture of a Jeffery Dahmer victim.  Now it is hard to say who wouldn't be involved with what.  People that brazen and outwardly perverse would think they could get away with something like this.

            In order to fake Pizzagate, someone had to:
           </p>
           <p>
            Fake wrote cryptic emails and spread them trough Wikileaks.
Connect those emails with a pizza restaurant in which The Clintons and Barack Obama:
Celebrated events.
Funded.
Make the pick so pedophile codes match the contextual symbology.
Build, promote or find a sinister Instagram pizza restaurant owner in which sex and violence towards children are referenced.
Use the Clinton Foundation and its multiple relations as a source of weaknesses to explode.
Relate local artists with sinister connotations.
John Podesta and Tony Podesta resemblance with Madeleine McCain's case suspect portraits is arbitrary.

             No offense... I really wish people would stop bringing up the McCain disappearance. The two photos of one suspect based on two different eyewitnesses leaves room for MSM to immediately dismiss the whole thing. Stick to the more concrete evidence that exists. Yes the resemblance is uncanny, but that cannot be evidence used to cement the case because it is difficult to prove, despite Podestas supposedly traveling etc. at that time.

              Plus the notion that, if the Podestas
              <em>
               are
              </em>
              major players in an international human-trafficking ring, that they would be

              </em>
              running around, stealing tourists' children. Doesn't that seem like a high-risk task they'd assign to somebody lower down the ladder?

              I agree, until we have hard evidence of their travels we should stick to the truth.  What I will say is this:  The fact that her abductors look so eerily similar to the Podesta's is perhaps consciousness' way of showing US, that we're on the right path.  There is no way that happened by accident or sheer coincidence.

             I watch PizzaGate unfold and hear 100's of lies daily, and notice that nobody questions the insanity of this witch hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
             1.) James Elefantis says he has NO BASEMENT in his interview, I would agree modern strip-malls don't have basements they just sit on a slab of cement. The photos of the cold-storage room, there is no proof those photos are from comet-pizza, The photos of the digging, there is no proof that those photos are from comet-piazza.
            </p>
            <p>
             2.) Elefantis said in his interview he never met Hillary Clinton. Who is lying? Him or the people that seeded the wikileak emails??
            </p>
            <p>
             3.) There is a photo of Elefantis in the whitehouse with Obama, and Elefantis is leaning against the wall and Obama is playing ping-pong witih a child. Who has proven these photos are not fake, who has proven they are real. Elefantis says he has never been to the white house.
            </p>
            <p>
             4.) Alex Jones say's that there are 1,000's of reference to code-word pizza in the Podesta wikileak emails, I have read and grep'd these emails, I count about 18 references to pizza in 55,000 emails. Gourmet cooks like Podesta frequently bake pizza in their homes, its fun and everybody enjoy building their own custom pizza.
            </p>
            <p>
             5.) PizzaGate is on record saying that Elefantis is the #48 most powerful person in DC and quote a faux GQ article as the source, if you read the article you will see that krusty-the-clown is #1, and Hillary Cllinton is #10. James Elifant is a fuck-bitch of Brock ( a powerful man ), I don't even think Brock made it to the list why would that be unless the makers of the list were retarded. Elefantis has records that he didn't pay his payroll taxes and he has judgements against him for $25k that he didn't pay his janitorial services. So Pizzagate is saying that a guy facing bankruptcyr during the past two years is the #48 most powerful person in DC? This is insanity, the meme is that he is supplying baby's to the richest ppl in DC, if that were true they would be paying all his bills and debt and keep him out of the courts. I could go on, but PizzaGate is deep in lies. I also note that the pro-trump people running pizzagate have quit defending their arguments now they just do personal attacks on anybody that questions the PizzaGate witch-hunt.

              I think we should all be very skeptic, but you didn't debunk any of my points.

             <p>
              1) The fact he has or doesn't have a basement doesn't change anything. Why would he post that #killroom photo?
2) It's probably a lie, because he was involved in the campaign.
3) He was at the White House several times, it's documented.
4) So he draws "pizza-related maps" and "eats pizza for an hour"? Lol
5) Maybe the GQ article is bullshit, I'll give you that. But that doesn't mean pizzagate is fake.

              You replied my post and yet failed to address any single one of the points I listed. Cherrypicking stuff you think you have a good explanation for while ignoring all the key pieces of evidence suggests that you are nothing but a SHILL.

               Of course hes a fucking shill.  look at his username.  Anyways innocent until proven guilty, however investigations are to prove guilty so there is nothing wrong with investigating.  This is not a witch hunt yet.

            Also:
- The pedo symbols found in the Besta Pizza logo, in the video clip of a Comet Ping Pong related band and in other related places/people are all a coincidence.

             To me the most damming thing was the artwork in Tony Podesta's house.  Nobody, and I mean nobody, in their right mind, who was not a pedophile, would have the artwork of kids being tortured, bound and gagged in their home.  That tied everything together for me, much more so than James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong.
