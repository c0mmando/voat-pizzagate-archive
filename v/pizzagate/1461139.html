            I am skeptical that Trump, who is in Epstein's black book, would really put anyone away. And Giuliani has covered these things up before. Very skeptical. Thinking an international effort is needed as this is global. We shouldn't be nationalist about this, or anything.

            Well hopefully it won't be another joke like Kenneth Starr! That man will burn in the deepest part of hell for letting the Clintons go years ago when perhaps it would have stopped a lot of what has happened over the last 16 years from those bastards!

            A psychiatrist friend of mine that works with children in Portland Oregon, told me a while ago that the biggest threat to children in the United States is sex trafficking.  She told me she's worked with victims as young as 3 yrs old.  I didn't believe her.  I couldn't believe her.  Now I'm so sick to my stomach that this really exists in the U.S.  What I'm saying is, people that work with children know what is happening but are silenced.  They need a voice. This needs to get out and it needs to stop.  Please don't stop investigating.  I keep reading all your very well documented evidence and theories.  I know in my heart #pizzagate is real.

             It's odd that you mention these.  Tasteless jokes (and obsession over grotesque art, for that matter) usually fall into character evidence, which builds a "profile" and is meant to suggest what a criminal is capable of.  Mention of pizza in

              stolen
             </em>
             emails (which is obviously still evidence), as part of a code verified and documented by the FBI, will certainly attribute to a conviction whether classified as circumstantial or character or demonstrative.  But no, I didn't expressly ask.  Thanks for your comment.

               I was wrong here.  Only the symbology verification is
               <em>
                published
               </em>
               openly.  But where obvious coded language is in play, the need for correlating definitions for each word will be unnecessary to impart reasonable doubt.  Many of the suspects are (as far as those that will actually be prosecuted), I believe, more likely to go down for RICO crimes anyway.  Thanks for helping me get this straight, though.  Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?

                A main if not THE main foundation for all the Pizzagate nonsense was the "pedo code" in the emails. It turns out that there is no known pedo code corresponding to those emails (despite a widely circulated bullshit list made up by some troll), nor any context in those emails that would by any stretch of the imagination suggest pedophilia. What does that leave you? Hey guys these dudes who are always away from home and working late talk about getting pizza a few times over 40,000 emails spanning almost a decade. They must be pedos!
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe you should ask yourself why and how the original troll gathered that tiny handful of emails in the first place. Given that "pizza" and "pasta" are NOT pedo code words, why was he searching for them? Why did he single them out? And since that was not pedo code and there was no pedo context, do you think it's just coincidence that all these people actually turned out to be pedos (in your opinion)? Or is it more likely that your pre-conceived bias, based on false claims like pedo code, kill room basement, "I love children", etc, caused you to see pedos where there are none?

                 It's not that I don't enjoy your replies, but your efforts are likely better placed elsewhere.  I'm not here to perpetuate any assumptions.  In fact, a general search of my comments and submissions would probably show that I'm a proponent of researching transactions and relationships, especially of the Clinton Foundation.  The amount of effort and obsession over satanism, pedophilia, and restaurant fronts is IMO misplaced even if relevant.  You do ask good questions (though blatantly leading and inviting conjecture), so I would encourage you to find someone whose mind you can change.  I wish you the best.

            The current recidivism rate varies widely depending on the sources I can find. The biggest variance is 10% to 50%, while the smallest is 18% to 45%. Anything I can find pre 2005 shows recidivism rates as high as 14%. Things can easily change in ten years, so I try to not use studies older than ten years when talking about statistics unless it's the only thing I can find.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you have any contemporary sources about recidivism rates for us to look at?

            As a former attorney, with some experience representing abused children, I can attest to the "pile" or "chain" of circumstantial evidence as having tremendous value and validity.

            We got to keep doing what we're doing, and keep building the "pile." Critical mass can, and WILL be reached!

             I agree.  I am a retired trial attorney.  This is how I would research a case for sure. Pick apart, research every aspect of an issue exhaustively. Kind of like reverse engineering. When walks like duck, quacks like duck, usually a duck. I am now picking apart donors of Clinton Foundation and who they are affiliated with. I have back tracked two that are non-profits that deal with homeless hungry kids in US and Congo. I have since researched their sponsors that also donate to Clinton Global Initiative. One used to be an Asst. Secretary to DHS. They in turn are affiliated with a pizza chain that have occult and pedo symbols throughout their restaurants. I wish I could get a 4chan slueth to investigate bf known and wipe everything clean.

              What do you need researched? If I can help, would be happy to give it a shot. (It's what I do for a living now that I'm not practicing law.) Not quite sure I understand what you mean by "4chan slueth to investigate bf known and wipe everything clean."
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, do you spend any time over at 4chan? The "Eyes Wide Open" research/investigation threads are there pretty regularly. (Although they seem to have moved elsewhere recently, to avoid censorship perhaps, based on comments I've seen here.) I know a couple of the 4chan guys. If there's something in particular you need done, maybe I could connect you or pass the message to them.

               Another donor to Miriam's Kitchen is Ameriprise Financial which used to be known as American Express Financial. They are a donor to Clinton Global Initiative and they also gave $1.1 mil to Miriam's Kitchen. It's CEO made $20 mil I think 2015 and when this article compared his salary to his competitors' salary was odd. I think there were 5 competitors and nobody else in similar position made more than I think $1.3 mil.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another non-profit to research and archive is Share the Strength owned by Bill and Debbie Shore. They also have a separate entity under it call No Kid Hungry. They are also big donor to Clinton  GLOBAL Initiative.  Now where these all seem to tie in is thru a pizza chain called Mellow Mushroom Pizza.  The corp isinAtlanta GA and they sell franchises which are all individually owned and operated. They have 126 of these at least. They have one in DC in Adams-Morgan neighborhood.  Also one in VA these restaurants are owned by three guys. Two are brothers named Pooja and Amit Metha. Amit is a doctor and Pooja is a judge. There are a few lawsuits I found inDC thatAmit was in if I remember. One where he and Unification Church from Asia and others were being sued.  Definitely needs researched more. Also the third owner is James Allen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now Mellow Mushroom is a dba for Hot Pies Inc. They have a website, houseofshrooms.com where they sell merchandise which is interesting. Lots of occult/pedo symbols. Handkerchiefs in diff colors, etc.  Also, the backdrop on the webpage is filled with symbols like black/white checkered flooring,white rabbits, owl ina boat,fish, sun etc.  They also have a page for corp employees. The art Director has been there 30 yrsand iwentto hiswebpageandhehassomeinteresting"artwork".  I read their privacy stmt and it speaks of onlyhave few people have access to buyers confidential info, etc.  Just seemed a lot of overkill describing the stuff.  It also lets them know what will it will say on credit card statement almost like a strip club would tell you! I googled numerous pics from various locations. Yelp seemed to cover the most pics of establishments.  In San Antonio,which is owned by an Indian couple,they have interesting artwork on walls. I read some newspaper article. That said Robert Tatum was the artist I googled him and his artwork is occult like.  They also owned a company in San Diego Calle Seta, but forfeited corp filing in 2014. Looks like they also live inAustin. The restaurant inRound Rock TX which is a burb of Austin I believe is corp. owned.  That is filled with pedo/satanic type pics. They have a pentagram highlighted behind the bar.  They have paintings all over with symbols. A t-shirt is hanging on wall that reads,"Muluminatti".  I think I found those pics on Yelp as well. Anyway, it all has ties back toClinton Global Initiative. I don't want to put this info out there on Voat and someone sees it  it and they clean everything out.  If a savvy tech cansnoop around and maybe archive everything first Alsothe pizza box is suspect.  The big mushroom is bent back and three little mushrooms look.ike they may be doing sexual act. Almost like a"Daisy chain."  Also, the one inNew Orleans has a pic ontheYelp site where the pizza slices are position inaway that you might say testicles and penis is showing subliminal sign and same above with his nose.  This mightall be crazy, but I see direct correlation to CGI and these charities affiliated with pizza are for homeless kids and down and out people probably willing to dump kids.  Give me your take.

               Miriam's Kitchen in DC also runs a place in the Congo called Miriam's Mission (I believe as I am away from my research pad at the moment).The woman that runs both name is Susan Keeler and she went down there late '90s and ended up with a Congo baby. Said parents died, but she helped homeless Congo babies for 9 yrs living and still does.  Her place in DC is Miriam's Kitchen where is is for homeless, women and children.  If you go to her website (has one for both) down in the bottom is a banner that scrolls across with her sponsors. Boeing is one.  I went to their website and they show flags to all places they go. I clicked on India and they brag about some plane that is able to land in remote terrain and how many people the plane will hold, etc.  They also brag about flying Bill and all his billionaires cronies to numerous countries.  Also found research where State Dept gave Boeing huge contracts.  Also stories on net about Ralph "Skip"Royce being pedo in Asia and had nickname Boyz.  Found graveyard where 50 dead boys bodies were buried over there so could be connection.  Another donor for Miriam is Lantham-Watkins Law Firm. I looked at where areas of practice.  They do a great deal with working with foreign govts, handing regulations, import-export matters, etc,  could be dealing in something nefarious. Never know more research. Another donor is CEO of American Beverage Assn. or something like that.  (Again, any thing I mess up is bc I don't have exact names in front of me). Prior to this job she worked as Asst. Secretary for DHS. I remember in Wiki Podesta emails mention of a Kevin. Don't know if husband.  Also Wiki leak search brought up her and Ambassdor Sobel who owns Valor Financial. Will send another email. A bit later have to and don't want to lose this

            Whether or not evidence would hold up in the court of law there is still the court of public opinion. Although there are a few "strays" I've been very impressed at the self-discipline that this investigative group practices. As some of the evidence piles up and people continue to communicate it there will be inevitable consequences to the businesses and reputations of these criminals.

            I don't believe we will ever have the government or media advocating for these children. Call me a hardened cynic. We have evidence of thse crimes being committed since the 1980's and nothing is done. We must continue to act as this is only on us. Don't wait on the cavalry that is being told to stand down.

            I am so waiting to see who Barry's presidential pardons are going to be. Seeing the name Podesta would pretty much confirm them all being in on it for me.

             This is not common knowledge but many LEO's wish they had death sentencing for pedophiles, the recidivism rate is astronomically  high, Honestly it was like a revolving door , finding,arresting and sending these slugs to jail. I knew there was no help for them then(from conversations with Pedo's) and now that I am getting my Masters in psychology  I absolutely know there is no cure.

              I have read the same - pedophilia is nearly incurable. However, the pedos are "users" in this cartel and quite frankly, a pretty small component. There are businesses running these rings and farming these kids and producing the horrific viral imagery that makes the filth go round, creating a $32B industry. There IS something that can be done to shut the money down. And if the general public was educated about the elite's participation and ownership in all this, those people would be cut off from their power sources.

               Let me quote to you what a doctor, I was registering after his release. I asked him why, as I always did in my early years working the 290 program.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why, why did you do it, you are a normal, good looking guy, you could get any woman? his answer was Because I can't help myself. he then told me he went to med school because he was sure that being in a position of power he would never be caught.
So there you go these pedo's look for, a position of authority so the children are disbelieved , so others are discredited.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yes, this is about Power,  SEX, Position and The Occult.

            Thankyou! Ive been waiting to hear from some legal professionals. This is exactly what i thought. We dont necessarily need a smoking gun. The mountain of pieces to the puzzle has convinced nearly 100% of us here that this is real... so why wouldnt it convince a jury is what ive thought for a while now. Besides, im sure the smoking gun(s) are being held under lock and key by the FBI right now. My thinking is search warrants are probably a few signatures away from becoming reality.

             Way too early for a jury. What we have must be fully
             <em>
              investigated
             </em>
             . A bunch of search warrants, interrogations and forensic drilling would blow this thing wide open. You only need
             <em>
              one
             </em>
             of them to start talking and it's over.
            </p>
            <p>
             This, of course, requires a real investigation. So far we've only seen suppression from our "authorities".

             You have to consider there will be many left wing liberals that are still reeling from all the liberal college indoctrination, who would not convict.
In college they are now teaching tolerance for Pedophila ....at least in my psychology classes they are.

              Oh good grief.  Really?!!  I know they are trying to push this, but I didn't think teachers were teaching it as normal.

              The innocence of children is pure and special.  You just don't go there.  You just don't.  These poor children:(
             </p>
             <p>
              Imagine how they must feel.  Toddlers and children are supposed to go about their lives happily wondering about flowers and doodlebugs---not whether or not going to the bathroom is going to hurt as much today as it did yesterday or when the next person is coming to hurt them.

              It's just not natural!

                Insanity. If you have a "disorder" that makes you commit the vilest of crimes, then you are a vile criminal. Crimes against children are crimes against humanity itself. A child really represents what humanity itself should embody. Innocence, curiosity and a desire to learn, the ability to connect with people in ways that we seem to forget as we grow old. I like to believe that most of us have an instinct to protect them because they are the pinnacle, an example of what
                <em>
                 we
                </em>
                should be. If you are going to reject humanity, you should not expect humanity to answer your cries for help when the hammer comes down. Cold, hard, pitiless justice.

              I know all about their sick agenda, and how they have contaminated colleges and universities. It started with accepting homosexuals as normal when it used to be classified as a mental disorder, this was accomplished by the very same people we are now talking about and their homosexual lobby, then they attempted to normalize transgenderism and made great grounds, but the ultimate goal is the sicker deviant behaviors such as pedophilia, bestiality, necrophilia and ultimately human sacrifice as a religious right as they already got animal sacrifice legalized in New York (the pit). This shit needs to be stopped NOW before it gets worse, and yes it will get way worse. The homo lobby is the root of it all and needs to be driven back into the closet or we will continue to see this crap more and more.

               I think you need to dig into the history of these pedo satanic rings... they have been a part of society here and abroad for centuries. It seems like there has been a surge in activity because of recent events but it's likely that we're just hearing more about them. While some of these crimes are homosexual in nature, most aren't. Young girls are typically more common targets. If you study the victims' statements, many of these criminals simply don't care what sex the child is--the preferred form of torture is anal rape.
"It" gets "way worse" because people aren't educated about it, people don't pay attention, children aren't believed and a duped public get seduced by political machines.

                 Feminism has nothing to do with equal rights and men are the ones who have never had equal rights anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Not to be insensitive to your abuse but I have seen it my entire life. Women dominate men! Both my grandmothers and my mom warned me that feminism was a nefarious organization and I never listened to them and I got to learn what they were through investigative experience. All through our history, true history not fabricated by feminists, men have been treated like second rate citizens and even held accountable when their women in their lives committed crimes or even worse, abused the man. Men could be stoned and humiliated if he was abused. Much like Islam does to women!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Feminism has one purpose, that is to demonize, demoralize men and destroy families and brainwash women ultimately feeding children into the hands of criminals.

                  But without feminism and the suffragette movement women would have never been given the right to vote, or own property or any of that. I am an engineer and have worked with men almost exclusively all my adult life, I like guys and am way more comfortable with most guys than most women.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  However, never would I claim that one sex has treated the other poorly exclusively. If my dad beat me that makes him a bad guy and if my husband's mom manipulated her kids and drove them away then that makes her bad, but translating one persons actions onto the whole sex is wrong. I have learned through a great husband that every guy isn't going to cheat and hit and he has learned that every woman isn't going to try and manipulate him into doing her will.

                   My grand mother was a lawyer by the end of the 1800's and she said that women always had the right to vote, it is in the bill of rights! Feminism merely used manipulation of common practice to claim women didn't have the right to vote. It helped their narrative. Feminism also fought to take "misandry" out of the dictionary and re-define the true meaning of feminism from what it once stated as being and matching the construct of the word as a female supremacist. Feminism was devised for evil purposes. Not equality! I am not blaming one gender or another I am blaming specifically "feminism" and it is a multi trillion dollar industry all by itself, and as a former human trafficking agent and pedo hunter, feminists always came into my spotlight, same with teachers, lawyer, priests, CPS and numerous others orgs and individuals. It is all part of an infrastructure bent on manipulation.

                    I'm a Canadian and our laws are based on the UK and we didn't have the right to vote. Some jurisdictions allowed but it was up to the men of the jurisdiction. I assumed it was the same in the states.

                    I understand that you are anti-feminism but I appreciate some of the fruits of their labor so I am not so radical as you. Women weren't allowed into Engineering schools until after my mom was a nurse. She would have been an awesome engineer. In fact I applied to RMC (Royal Military College for engineering) to get a full ride because I was poor. They didn't accept women in 1986.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So I don't know what feminism was intended for but it allowed me to do what I wanted to do.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Are you saying that feminists were more common in your pedo hunting days than men? Because I've met plenty of pedo men and I don't think I know any pedo women. Maybe one high school female drama teacher was a predator. But my high school had 5 current and former priests that were pedos. They targeted teenage boys.

                   <p>
                    Also a boy in my neighbourhood. And a non-priest teacher at my high school. And a brother of a friend. That is off the top of my head. Those were just the ones that were convicted or I had personally witnessed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So maybe feminism isn't the big bad wolf and we should just stick to pedos.

                     As for female pedo's there are just as many as males. And thats the ones that don't get over looked in a gender biased society that denies that women can be pedo's Also in a gender biased society these female pedo's often don't get convicted for their crimes or get such light sentences they might just as well be set free... One case example being a female teacher convicted after drugging and molesting 11 yo boy over 300 times and received a 4 month sentence. This gender bias is rampant throughout the world!

                      I have never witnessed a female pedo though but I have witnessed 2 male pedos and know personally many others that were convicted and always gave me the creeps. And yeah, I don't doubt there is gender bias. Not at all. But I just don't think there are as many women as men.

                       There are actually presently more female pedophiles than males. In each school, for example, that fell into my sights, we found a 3 to 1 ratio female to male perpetrators. None of the females ever were charged by jurisdictional authorities regardless of evidence. In 99.9% of all these cases, these perps were connected to one another and to a larger group by which we found them. Larger groups include but not limited to: churches, feminist orgs, family and child services, members of the justice system.

                       I can can also give you a fresh example based on my ex who was influence by feminists and became a prostitute with their help, they also had the child services take away her daughter. Anyway, she told and showed me of a call from a female client who wanted her to have sex with her 13 and 16 yo daughters while she masturbated. My ex still has some morals left and refused the call.

                     Women were allowed in engineering, the only thing stopping them was a willingness to do it. And that applies more so to Canada and the UK which had more female enrollment in technical classes than the US during the 1800's.
I was just reading the data a few weeks ago, the problem women had was dropping out or of those who completed education either failed to join the related field of expertise or quit not long after starting. My great aunt lived in Canada and went to an engineering school there.

                     This is classic feminist propaganda! The only thing that related to the prohibition of female engineers was rail company policies that refused to hire female LOCOMOTIVE engineers do to extreme work condition and fatigue, it was deemed unsafe in such an extremely stressful and dangerous job where lives can be endangered. And to this day, I would agree, even though we have come a long way from steam engines, operation of a locomotive is an extreme job that women can not handle! Emotionally or physically! It wasn't part of discrimination, it was just facing the reality!

                      Okay, yes, technically I guess you correct. My mom could have made it into an engineering school if she wanted to fight for every little thing. Fight the completely male board for admission, fight her brother for permission to go, fight every prof for the right to pass, fight other students for the right to learn along side them. Now I am not sure how hard that would have been for me, but for my mom who was submissive and shy, it would have been near impossible.

                      You seem to think that going against societal norms is of no consequence and that willingness is the only thing that stopped women from male dominated fields. I had every school counselor try and convince me to go into English or Nursing. I was told at RMC that they did not accept women (in 1986). I was told by many classmates that I would never make it. Thank God that someone telling me not to do something just makes me double down.

                       So in other words, she had to do all the same things men have to do! As for her brother, that is personal, not systemic!

                       We all have to double down, that is what men have to do, it is not un-equal that women have to do the same thing! It may not be obvious to you because men simply accept what has been normal for centuries. These pursuits are not fair and reasonable for a reason. Your passion is what makes it right, if you don't have the passion to fight for it, you don't belong there. This should equally applied to women. the fact that "affirmative action" has taken away this safeguarding system and allows women to easily obtain these fields or any field, undermines the quality imposed by hard knox!

               I do have real problems with what they are teaching about pedophilia in school. They are now saying it something that they are born with , a sexual attraction...JUST no.

              A person who worked on my team a few years ago was going to college for psychology. One of the things she told me was that from a medical standpoint, these people can not be helped. There is no medicine or treatment that we currently have that will ensure they stop touching kids so they can be a productive member of society. It was in their opinion that they should be locked away for life as it was the safest and most humane thing for everyone involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder if the tolerance comes from the fact we can't help them.

               I cannot comprehend someone being sexually attracted to children, but knowing the kind of messed up porn and sexually explicit material that gets created on the Internet, I imagine it could be possible for someone to develop a warped sexual attraction to them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bear in mind that some pedophiles were, themselves, abused as children, and this corrupted them psychologically. I think we should be

                Easy, we need to make the ones that have touched kids an example. And that means taking this ring down and making an example of it. And I dont care they were abused as kids. That does not make it ok, and we need to try to stop this circle that keeps going around.

               the only solution we have for them is the abstinence. So yeah. This is sad for them. But we are not even talking about low level pedophilia in pizzagate. It is way worse then "love" between an adult and a child who does not know what is love or sex.

               As a former LEO that put scum like that away, 96% have zero remorse and are only sad that they got caught. I have ZERO pity for them ,the shit I have seen, I will never ever be able to un see. I will die haunted by the work I have done to help put these assholes away. I am not proud to say it that I wish death on anyone. I want to help people but I know these people are beyond help. since my medical retirement I have tried to put this behind me and not think about my work. but then this came up and I knew I had to help.
              </p>
              <p>
               Working on the clerical side of this is one thing, seeing the horror of what is done to these children IRL is quite another.
              </p>
              <p>
               I prey Trump institutes the death penalty for Pedophiles. There frankly is no help and not even chemical castration works,they then go on to violate children with OBJECTS, so fuck pedos! and or kill them or torture them.
