            I know I posted this earlier regarding Neil Wolfe's one man protest but it touches on some important points. Pizzagate is just one of the many bits of evidence we no longer have a working Government down in DC. And we don't have much of a Constitution left either and if we don't stand up we're going to lose that too.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            There's a lot going on in Neil's one man protest video. Obviously the DC police thought ignoring him would make him go away. They'd have been better off rolling out a red carpet for him. Instead they turn a one guy protest into an assault on the Freedom of Speech. Everyone can read between the lines and see what's happening. Police are there to serve and protect. Ignoring people isn't in their job description.
           </p>
           <p>

            </a>
            But they lost this one. And they are going to keep losing until the war is won. Next time it will be two protesters, then four and on and on until it's an army and we finally chase the entire legion of demonic clown frauds out of DC and watch them dry up into desiccated twigs from lack of bribes.

            . Please forgive the following religious reference. I'm no Bible thumper but when even a 4 year old child can see the Prince of Darkness is now running the show down in DC and has been for the past 50 years.......ya kinda gotta get a little old timey religious.

            And to any lurker who reads that quote from the New Testament thinks Jesus Christ thinks homosexuals like James Alefantis should be locked up you need to realize the Religious Right is saying that not Jesus. And to Neil and/or any other Pizzagater who might think JA is evil because he's gay you need to flush out your head gear. I don't think that's what Neil believes but it's worth mentioning. The only reason we're pissed off is JA and Co are lying to us. CPP was a psyop, we're not stupid so stop treating us like fools. When you fold napkins to look like kids underpants and put it on your restaurants web page people will get suspicious. You knew this and making fun of us has a cost. We don't condemn people for being gay, we condemn dishonesty. Why? Because Jesus only had 2 Commandments:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Love God
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Love one another.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jesus Christ never mentioned homosexuality because he didn't need to. When Jesus told the Leper they were just as righteous in the eyes of God as anyone else that included everyone. Sick people, healthy, short, tall, gay, straight, left and right, everyone counts. The only people that don't get in are evil men that spread injustice and inequity. Making fun of the meek for being uncultured hay seeds when we're not has a cost. It's actually, duh, the meek who inherit the Earth. It's actually, DING DING DING, the LAST who shall be first and the first shall be last. Now you've gotten the memo.

             Good post thanks!  The pedo club is wide spread and has powerful friends...Thankfully there are plenty of Americans who woke up during the past year and more will be waking up, people outside America as well.  All the pedos and their rich, politically connected enablers need to be outed, then the network speaks for itself.  It's a Totalitarian regime.  People can't ignore a mountain range of facts forever.  Keep up the good fight!

               Sounds good to me...I'm a researcher and idea person...not a social media person just voat and gab.  I post on both of those.  I also make crude (because it's faster) memes, some are good, some stink, but I'm always open for feedback to make them better. :)

                Hey whatever spreads info lets coordinate. Also for non-social media members A quick ad with memes or links,  under craigslist communties, using a fake email of course, is simple. It could bring national awareness to this situation in just a few days.

                 So much information behind the word...pizzagate is like one of those magic eye posters, to the casual viewer it looks like noise, but for someone looking past it an whole integrated, 3D picture emerges.  Wish we had one for PG lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I hope to have some new meme's on Monday...busy weekend. I like to tie in PG info or relatedness into news related memes, but those are flash in the pan memes, as the news keep changing.  Doing a series of info memes would be good, it's just a matter of picking the right focus to start a series.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That Breitbart article about the family of Mexican Nationals pleading guilty to child trafficking is a good topic to tie in some key issues in the big picture...Obama didn't stop this, yet he was spying on everyone.  This casts doubt on his so called willingness to protect kids coming across the border, how could he possibly NOT know the issues with child trafficking when the border is porous?  So a meme casting the child traffickers as Obama's Dreamers, while pointing out how many pedophile rings have been caught lately...a promising angle, for people to start getting some of the big picture of corruption in high places.  The media is so quick to bury news, stories maybe get 24 hours (unless it's Trump bashing).

            Maybe since we can't all make it to protest, we can coordinate a suggested area to bombard, like this weekly, as a team. In the end no one will be able to state they were unaware.

              That is a great idea do you know how to do that? Maybe we can coordinate as a team specific entities or individuals daily/ weekly for our message to be heard.  At some point we can figure out who is complicit and willing to let it continue. Also it will show who shouldn't be operating in this country any longer. Or if anyone has a better way of doing this lets work together.
