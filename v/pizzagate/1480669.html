             TruthTrumps - You may be right. Of course, it seems kinda relevant to an investigation about the possibility of high-ranking politician pedophiles if the Vice President is hitting on and groping underage girls right out in the open (as he appears to be doing throughout the whole ceremony in longer videos of it).

            It makes me wonder if the audio I was working with had already been processed by someone else trying to enhance it, because on this vimeo video it clearly sounds like he's saying "to have a 13 years old girl standing right next to me", which I couldn't make out at all on any version of the audio I was working with.

            Can we think of a first part of what he's saying that would fit in with the father's claim instead of him saying "horny"? The father is right that Biden mentions his daughter ... but he only seems to mention one daughter, not multiple. And the girl does look creeped out, whatever her father says.

            TimmyK - I considered that, but I couldn't figure how that could possibly tie into his next statement where he says: "You can talk to my daughter, Ashley. She knows."
