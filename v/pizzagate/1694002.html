 According to the UN, an orphan is a child who has lost ONLY ONE parent.<br />
From Wikipedia, 
&quot;Various groups use different definitions to identify orphans. One legal definition used in the United States is a minor bereft through &quot;death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by, or separation or loss from, both parents&quot;.[5]
In the common use, an orphan does not have any surviving parent to care for him or her. However, the United Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), and other groups label any child that has lost one parent as an orphan. In this approach, a maternal orphan is a child whose mother has died, a paternal orphan is a child whose father has died, and a double orphan has lost both parents.[6] This contrasts with the older use of half-orphan to describe children that had lost only one parent.[7]&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently, a country can declare you an orphan if you do not have the correct parenting.<br />

            The whole culture/system is set up to separate children from parents, the educational system where parents don't actively participate and after generations don't feel a responsibility to, the medical system where people are brainwashed to hand their kids over to total strangers, a whole system of "experts" that people are supposed to allow access to their kids. Children made to feel they need to become a part of that "system" and then leaving their parents behind. In countries that haven't been contaminated with this, just try to take control of someone else's kid.

            I read years ago that during the Ottoman Empire the army was made up of orphans, which being taken in by some father figure I can see would ellicit gratitude and loyalty. I can see creating orphans to be used in various ways such as armies, think military in Latin America and the Middle East. Destabilizing a country could create a military of hostile orphans that could then be attacked again. By the same token, women as orphans would not have a stable environment to raise their kids, those offspring would grow up to be more pawns, second-generation baby machines, thugs to terrorize their own people and continue the social chaos, more men to draft to use as cannon fodder. And then, of course, there's PedoGate/PizzaGate. I think I'm going to use the combined form from now on to try and help move PedoGate into people's awareness, hopefully to become the more-encompassing label. Parents/families will take notice of "pedo."

            I'm in the L.A. area.  I was told by a co-worker years ago that if you have adopted kids or if there has been a complaint about your parenting skills, CPS can come to your house unannounced to "inspect" it for being suitable for kids.  If they look in the fridge and you don't have much food and a few beers, they can take the kids and claim you're not providing a good home.  Also there was a friend who was leaving her 17 and 15 year old sons at home overnight while she stayed with her boyfriend five minutes away.  The co-worker told me my friend could lose the kids for leaving"minors unattended overnight" even though the older boy was obviously old enough to babysit the younger.

            Just to reassure you.... I did not know this either, and I do appreciate your posting it. I do agree that it is highly suggestive of abuse, in that it expands the scope of the State in getting children away from their blood relatives.

            I'm honestly shocked and horrified yet it makes sense.  The UN seems to be nothing but creating situations for grabbing "orphans" and trafficking them, as well as using them to blackmail and extort.

            George Webb, on his YT channel, explains the creating wars AND using weather weapons (cloud seeding,  think Chem trails)  around the world AND using tectonic weapons (earthquakes created by shooting small nuclear weapons into faults... Think Haiti).

            Another interesting thing is that the UN has a statement against child sales. Included in the definition of child sales is surrogacy, which is considered a felony in many countries and even in many U.S. states. For good reason. I know of women who became surrogates for the payment only, and if they couldn't conceive through IVF they would go so far as to get pregnant with their own children even with hubby if the donor sperm method did not work, and then adopt them out and take the fee for surrogacy, basically selling their own baby because they were convinced that someone they had barely any knowledge of was infertile or a gay couple wanted kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Certainly altering the definition of orphan at the UN would enable those relief organizations to claim they were kidnapping orphans and not someone's kid. 
I guess if that were the law in the U.S. (I doubt it) they could take away all the single mothers' children and pretend that they weren't kidnapped.
           </p>
           <p>
            And this is a perfect example of why the NWO is a bad idea and the sovereignty of our country is one of the most important things that there is. The UN is literally the Illuminati world government.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder how long before the UN realizes they are done for? Is Brexit their first clue?

            {Side note - Ironically as I type this the song playing on my Pandora station is called Blood Bank by Bon Iver. It goes:
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags
You said "see lookit, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another
Even in their plastic little covers"
And I said I know it well
That secret that you knew
But don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good, girl
'Cause its running you with red
Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said "ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this"
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss
And I said I know it well
That secret…"

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              From 1854 to 1929 an estimated 250,000 orphaned, abandoned, and homeless children were placed throughout the United States and Canada during the Orphan Train Movement.
             </p>

            <p>
             Google search orphan trains:

              They didn't laugh in part because they damn well know that they contribute to the problem of child trafficking by looking the other way when it involves 'their own kind' or their own financial interests (child labor).  Their main concern is not stopping it, but making sure they aren't exposed as the hypocrites and enablers that they are.

            This is news to me.  When we hear about "orphans being adopted" it may mean that the child could have been taken away from his/her only surviving parent, especially if they are from another country.  This is very important information to have to continue and read things properly..

             Perhaps a thread on the Bushes needs to be started. I've forgotten all the "coincidences" surrounding the Bushes, including the Hinckley assassination attempt
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://theamericanchronicle.blogspot.com/2012/02/did-bush-assassinate-reagan.html">
              http://theamericanchronicle.blogspot.com/2012/02/did-bush-assassinate-reagan.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The Vice President’s son planned to have dinner the day following the assassination with Scott Hinckley, brother of the alleged assassin, an event acknowledged by the younger Bush.
            </p>
            <p>
             George also had a lucrative relationship with John, Sr. which involved the latter’s generous contributions to George’s presidential campaign according to Sharon Bush, the wife of Neil. Later the Bush camp vehemently denied  the story – not by Bush himself, but by his mouthpiece Peter Teeley.
            </p>
            <p>
             In another repeat of the John Kennedy cover-up, the FBI suppressed nearly all information about Hinckley including his financial records, relationships, and personality. Also suppressed were hand written notes Hinckley left in his cell describing conspiracies to eliminate Reagan.
            </p>
            <p>
             And we certainly don't want to forget Prescott Bush and his Nazi connections.
We suggest strongly that Hinckley was an MKULTRA subject who was programmed by the CIA – Bush’s CIA – to murder the president and to obsess about Foster as a plausible basis of his insanity. This technique was the same type used on Sirhan Sirhan in the murder of Robert Kennedy. Kennedy, of course, was not murdered by Sirhan Sirhan.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a CIA George Bush mentioned in the JFK papers now open to the public. Supposedly another George Bush, but the only other George Bush working at CIA was not an agent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two more things to investigate:
            </p>
            <p>
             Prescott Bush had Nazi and bank connection during WWII. He was also a founder of Planned Parenthood.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clinton/ Bush Mena Airport Drug Running and possibly involved more than drugs and arms.

              I saw a photo of Geo. Bush Sr standing outside by the School Book Depository where Oswald worked supposedly on the day of JFK's murder. I think it was on the site

              I think some Bush antecedent was in the arms business, rifles?, during WW1.

              I've considered the possibility that Hinckley was one of those Illuminati sacrifices, where you give up someone close to you, only they didn't off him. I vaguely remember him being a no-good guitar-playing hippie in his father's eyes.

             Marvin, the neglected Bush We hear about the Bush family a good deal but seldom do we learn much about the "other brother," that is, "Marvin P. Bush, the president’s younger brother, [...] a principal in a company called Securacom that provided security for the World Trade Center, United Airlines, and Dulles International Airport. The company, Burns noted, was backed by KuwAm, a Kuwaiti-American investment firm on whose board Marvin Burns also served. [Utne] According to its present CEO, Barry McDaniel, the company had an ongoing contract to handle security at the World Trade Center "up to the day the buildings fell down." But then, Marvin has led a rather odd life, and more can be learned about him here Wikipedia sums up this Bush in a short bio, and notes the rather odd accident befalling his baby sitter This accident had been reported by The Washington Post but largely ignored by other papers.

              Has anyone seen the videos of 9/11 where they show that the planes never even hit the WTC and were edited in, and there was some other object that hit them? I mean obviously it was controlled demolition but what the hell were those objects? They looked like UFOs or something.

               Those were missiles shot from the Woolworth building. As I recall, police went there after getting reports and were greeted by men in black who said everything was under control.

               09/11 involved a ton of FAKERY.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look into:  Largely empty towers, smoke machines, people wearing harnesses, anatomically correct dummies in the towers, and Gelatin (The B Thing) hiring a private helicopter and rehearsing "suicide leaps" from the 91st floor.  Also, there were several criminals who needed to "disappear" who were conveniently listed on flight manifests.
              </p>
              <p>
               09/11 was huge INSURANCE FRAUD and destruction of EVIDENCE.

                ok so those jews in the building were arrested with a fuckload of diagrams, i believe the were gelatin.... i was watching a documentary online and it shows the diagram of a short range projectile being fired from another building (i cant remember which unfortunately) and i got to see footage of "something" being shot off the building. i guess this is one of the things that was fired into them or idk. ive seen all the nutty shit i agree with you... can u link some of the harness stuff though thats the only thing i havent seen

                 you mean occams razor as referenced on television constantly? all things being equal, the one theory will less supposition is always better, or correct. yeah well, we live in a really fucked up world. does anything about pizzagate come off as simple? george webb connecting dots is suupeerrr straightforward. the only thing i havent seen evidenced in his comment are the harnesses. thats it.

                  But Occams razor also applies to pizzagate, since the amount of coincidences required to produce the overwhelming amount of evidence is so big that it is less likely than the reality of an elite pedophile ring.

                 fewer assumptions most likely the right pick. Most likely. likely. Ockams razor is too often used when a motherfucker is too lazy to think out something critically.

                IDK if I am ready to contemplate harnesses and fake jumps. Seems plausible that people might jump. I have an ex (ex's) family member who was actually in NYC that day and staying across the street during 9/11 and overslept, she was supposed to be doing a tour that day of the WTC. I'll look into it though.

                 I don't get the correlation.  Are you suggesting that because you have a former relative who was in NYC that day and overslept so failed to make their WTC tour, then it's unlikely that most of that was faked?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Note that I never suggested that the towers weren't demolished.  :)

            Yup, the child trafficker's MO is to use any excuse to take children from parents and either take them immediately into the undocument/underground network, or through the foster home/adoption abuse machine.   In the US, an 'unaccompanied child' is a child whose parents are not in the country, or
            <strong>
             parents that are in the country but not able to take care of the child.
            </strong>
            They can throw the parent in jail for whatever, then the kid must be in the Office of Refugee Resettlement within 72 hours.   From there, the kid is adopted usually within 34 days.
