<p>Jay Scott Walker (born November 5, 1955) is an American inventor, entrepreneur and chairman of Walker Digital, a privately held research and development lab focused on using digital networks to create new business systems. Walker is also curator of TEDMED since 2011, and a founder of Priceline.com (now known as Booking Holdings) and Synapse Group, Inc. In 2000, Forbes estimated his net worth at $1.6 billion.[1] By October 2000, his estimated worth was down to $333 million.[2] As of 2013, he is not on the Forbes list of the world\'s billionaires. </p>
<p>Walker attended Cornell University where he majored in Industrial and Labor Relations and was a member of the Quill and Dagger society and the Sigma Phi Society. </p>
<p>In 1992 Walker and Michael Loeb[10] co-founded New Sub Services, today known as Synapse Group, a company that used the credit card network to process magazine subscriptions. ...In 2006 Walker Digital entered into a strategic partnership with International Game Technology (IGT), the world’s largest manufacturer of casino games. ..In 2009 Walker Digital subsidiary Walker Digital Gaming introduced the Perfect Pay baccarat table and Smart Table Network, supporting Elite Baccarat.[17] Industry business journals reported that Perfect Pay utilizes RFID technology to track baccarat wagers, hand outcomes, payouts and player ratings in real time while eliminating losses from dealer mis-pays, counterfeit chips and other problems. </p>
<p>Walker has spoken at events of World Information Transfer, Inc., a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization in General Consultative Status with the United Nations, on health and environmental issues. </p>
<p>Walker funded the development of two public policy documentary films about the space race and the role of science in American life.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>In 2003, Walker Digital devised an Internet–based surveillance system called U.S. HomeGuard. The basic concept was to hire 1 million work-at-home employees who would log in over the Internet to provide constant surveillance of image feeds from some 47,000 security cameras. These webcams would be installed nationwide at security-sensitive sites including border crossings, water reservoirs, chemical plants, nuclear power generators, airports, etc.</strong> Observers would report any suspicious activity to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security within 30 seconds. Wiredmagazine called the idea &quot;intriguing&quot; </p>

<p>Wow. So I suppose Epstein has access to all those cameras...</p>

            I can't say too much here, but as a Seminole Injun, I can tell you this. A gaming machine is kind of complicated, but not really. If you can fix a pinball machine then you have a clue. Only so many of those made. I know someone who could explain more, but he is ex-military, and does this for a hobby. Compared to a regular vending machine, the odds of making money on repairs are astronomical (not that the regular vending market is irrelevant). If a casino were to junk a gambling machine? That guy would buy it, repair it, and resell it.

            People appreciate this much research..it takes effort and passion..
But if u concentrate even 0.1 percent of effort and.passion to use a hanful of dollars to instruct the US machinaery to both fund ur life..and instruct them under universal jurisdicgion to research amd.lock these satanists up...
           </p>
           <p>
            A place to start is for a group or individual to spend a few dollars and reduce the US debt and instruct the US labour secretary acosta....especially after he has been outed by the congress commitee memeber..for maladminsitration with regard epstein and his present work cutting funding for child trafficking investigation services provide by the labour department ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Its just an email away and will set the ball rolling with u instructinv ur debtor the US to do its job under universal jutisdiction...
           </p>
           <p>
            Therr is no point using and funding the debt banking system and be helpless as a result ..while they fund criminal networks and then fund the liability to be faced by children and future children..
0.1 per cent of effort and passion..that all it would take ..trust me...
It says on the dollar ..in God we trust..they r trustees tonwhomever pays God..ie reduce debt ..i stead of feeding Ceasar

              Nope i'm actually not clairvoyant although my output would suggest so, I can only go by the fact that you post/quote Q-tards uncritically, which implicitly endorses the whole thing.

               So QAnon is not welcome here? I follow Q.....is it really ok to slash and burn groups like gays, blacks and q followers? Seems like a website like this one would promote inclusion so as to spread the word of pedophilia by way of blackmail running our govt. So, what is the agenda of disqualifying  entire groups? Racist? Ignorance? Bad manners ?

               <p>
                The intricacies of their scams/communications/strategies that happen to be relevant to news cycle filler are all superfluous and are only used as a distraction and to gaslight people into this inane "cabal" "deep state" 4-D chess false narrative.

                 I don't go along with the 4D-chess narrative and I can see why you're not impressed with the Canadian.  I tend to think she gets a lot of her stuff from Voat.  I've used her videos as a quick intro to a couple of my own posts.  But I take your point.

                  If YOU haven't noticed, empowering women and manipulating them is the crux of all their plans.  JewAnon is just the example under discussion here.  Look at what a shit-show that Crayzie's sub is, that's what you'd tolerate here.  You know she's actually mentally challenged, right?

            Armstrong may have resigned from one company but he's still very active, including online internet companies.  So, let that be a lesson to us to keep an eye on where executives go when they resign from one company.  Smoke and mirrors, folks.
