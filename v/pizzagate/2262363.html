<p>Advisory: this topic has been difficult to research. I am IN MEXICO and the cognitive dissonance is strong here. People DO NOT want to have even the most well meaning conversation. Being candid about this topic is deemed as embarrassing and is likely to get one shunned. That said:</p>
<p>Urban Mexico is a class structured society and the trafficking issue is considered to be an issue for those at the bottom. The government is totally corrupt. Everyone knows. Bribery is common all the way down to the simplest interactions in society. In the middle class, there is concern for kids being kidnapped and disappeared into trafficking. It seems that kids are OFTEN disappearing. For low classes, there is no doubt that it is real. Most homes are walled compounds with several layers of security, which is nice, but as one walks about in town, it is easy to wonder what is happening behind the walls of some of these mini castles. Some have outward pointing cameras and almost every house has barbed wire or broken glass crenellations on the walls and parapets.</p>
<p>For rich people, strict laws are talked about, but rarely enacted or enforced, which would provide severe sentences for those convicted of kidnapping a rich hostage. Regular kidnapping is also common and always done for a huge cash ransom, not trafficking necessarily. There are horror stories, but usually rich kidnap victims are returned safely upon payment. The police are almost always involved. I have heard that they get 50%. </p>
<p>For the last ten years, the border towns have been wildly out of control. Juarez (Mexican side of El Paso) has ranked as the murder capital of the world for many years. Women have been dropping like flies in that town for years, with no justice, despite tons of protests. Right now, across the border from McAllen Texas, there is rumored to be INTENSE violence. Of course, Tijuana has a terrible reputation as a deviant sex destination.</p>
<p>Mexico is a predominantly Catholic country, but there are other religions. There is voodoo and Santeria. There are satanic sects. I have heard a few stories from witnesses about priest abusing kids. It’s known, but again not talked about.</p>
<p>These videos tell about victims of human trafficking that were later arrested AS TRAFFICKERS. Many are still incarcerated as far as I can learn. The authorities turned the tables on the people coming forward and locked up some, killed others, so that no more would talk.</p>

<p>I apologize for the age of these links, but there is very little recent from SOUTH of the border. All of the recent stuff pertains to the US side. The silence on the issue is deafening here.</p>
<p>These links explain the deal between previous presidents Bush and Calderon that details how the U.S. contributes a lot of money to support Mexican law enforcement, primarily against human and drug trafficking (Merida initiative). This plan is widely regarded as a failure, unless you look past the stated purpose and notice instead how it arms a paramilitary police force with aims to create a corrupt and predatory police state-US funded to boot! In that case, it has been totally successful!</p>

<p>These measures were supposed to wipe out the crime here. Crime statistics, however, have only been going up dramatically here ever since. I think these payments continue each year, for helicopters and police Dodge Vipers, and stuff. Maybe Trump intends to take this money away to build the wall.</p>
<p>These videos explain the link between the booming economy on the border towns, caused by nafta, the police corruption, the worldwide attraction to sickos and the epidemic of dead girls (all ages).</p>

<p>With so many people murdered and justice unanswered, this town has essentially become a playground for human hunters, IMO.</p>
<p>Recently, lawlessness has passed to an all-time insane high, in my opinion. To explain, I have to go back to the sixties. There was some kind of student protest in Mexico City, wherein many students were massacred by soldiers. It is called “Tlatelolco”. No one ever faced justice for this event, if I understand correctly. In commemoration, and as a continued cry for for justice, families and friends of the victims have continued a yearly pilgrimage, starting from outlying towns; all the way to the sight of the massacre. In 2014, 43 of these were disappeared. Somehow the government was behind it. There was an outcry and more protestors calling for justice. Eventually more were killed. As of now, the matter is basically a dead issues, ending the way it did when the president of Mexico got on TV in 2016 and basically told everyone “that’s enough” and “shut up about it”.</p>

<p>What does that have to do with pizzagate? This just illustrates the attitude of the elites in this country and how they use their law enforcement resources to brutalize the people instead of bring justice to the issue. The government of Mexico supports a globalist regime, btw.</p>
<p>I humbly submit that the justice down here is a crying shame, along with the journalism. Also, I don’t know the names of any of the deputies of the senate or any law enforcement people. There are plenty of corrupt celebrities and gangsters down here, though. Sometimes that is a legit ticket for a politician: “Oh, he/she is from a crimelord’s family, so they will make a deal to keep the place safe! 😃”</p>
<p>I just know the president’s name is Peña Nieto. He is a Freemason. I know that the political parties are infighting and collapsing, because of constant corruption accusations. I wonder if there is a worry that the US funding, which I think is much more substantial than many realize... I wonder if there is worry that it will dry up. I honestly think that the government here is pretty obviously a parasite that is sucking on both the Mexican and US teats to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<p>If any of you voaters have any insight or Spanish skills... here’s a nut that needs cracking. Which Mexicans are connected to our major players? Which Mexican locations can be scrutinized? What companies are doing the transporting? I think a lucrative human trafficking business isn’t gonna march it’s product across the border on the hoof with coyotes, although they are almost certainly rapists and exploiters. Where does the money flow?</p>
<p>Check Carlos Slim... El Chapo... Who else?</p>
<p>I’m not complaining about the wall idea, especially if it helps stems the tide of this slave trade.</p>',

            Great submission. I have long wondered why it is that historically predominantly Catholic countries always seem to be so damn corrupt. Mexico, Italy, France...it's not like they don't know better. And then the majority of US Catholics vote Democrat. It boggles the mind. I researched it once and all I turned up was the mafia/gangs/organized crime/protection rackets being an adaptation to government corruption and an impotent justice system.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've also wondered why all the Mexicans come here instead of changing their own country. They, too, had a revolution after all. I can't foresee a situation in which Americans would leave rather than stay and fight for their country. If Mexicans return home now, will they put up with the BS? How much of Mexican corruption would change if the US Swamp was drained? Think of how much better both countries would be if corruption were eradicated from both!

             I've wondered the same, having experience in Spain and Mexico.  I don't like Spain and love Mexico in spite of it's many problems.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is common theft such a problem in both countries, for cameras, cell phones or bags left unattended?  In the orient, you can't get rid of stuff.  People go to great lengths to reconnect a stranger with anything forgotten or left behind.  It's a beautiful experience, to live crowded in, without fear of theft.
            </p>
            <p>
             The situation down there is, for the average citizen, is not subject to reform.  If you want to stay alive and have a happy life, you stay out of controversy.  Local power centers, neighborhoods,  are always subject to higher power centers overruling them.  The Federal Police, much feared by good low power people, are always from out of town.  No one knows their name or where they are from.
            </p>

             Mexicans come here for the financial opportunity.  It's the most ambitious young males, the bold ones,  who try and may eventually succeed working in el norte.  Young males see it as the greatest challenge around, full of mortal danger, intrigue and opportunity.  It's a rite of passage, have you got the guts.
            </p>
            <p>
             The usual game plan is get across the boarder, work hard for a few years and send enough home to support your family and build yourself a house back home.  Having a house in Mexico is important.  You can't borrow, so it gets built as money is available.  A local wage will never get you there fast enough for the ambitious.
            </p>
            <p>
             For a guy, a roof and some money is your ticket to getting a wife.  No roof, no job, no lover.    Sometimes people do get stuck up here afraid to journey south for fear of not getting back but immensely homesick.  Family is a much bigger deal for them.  Everyone fights but no one is exiled permanently, shunned like we do to our embarrassing relatives.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mexicans who were deported after long periods up here are having a positive impact on Mexico.  They open stores where almost everything is in stock all the time.  Inventory control isn't a foreign concept. Mexico is improving much faster than the United States. In my opinion. And Mexico is full of expat vets fed up with the states.

              It's amazing to see the hold the Catholic Church has over people who go to Cathedral maybe once a year.  It's like voodoo.  Maybe it's the bells all the time.  It's like the Muslim chants five times a day, mass communal brainwashing.  Catholics get to repent at any point in life and still get into heaven.  I'm jealous.

              The often creepy Priests strolling in the city centers, Bible in hand, are untouchables in league with all the other Officious Authorities.  Most are of European descent, tall, arrogant, Gringos.

            That is a very real concern for Mexico.  Remittances from Mexican citizens living and working (most illegally) in the US are now the single largest segment of their GDP.  This is in addition to our $160M in foreign aid.
           </p>
           <p>
            Almost all illegals are trafficked into the US by organized criminal groups.  Some of these are drug cartels, although I'm sure there are other groups as well.  If I remember correctly from my time in Arizona, while trucks and other methods are utilized, most people literally are just marched across the border.  Huge problem in the southwest.  Considering what big business this is for Mexico, and how dependent they are on it for money, I wouldn't be surprised if you could connect those coyotes to legitimate businessmen and politicians on both sides of the border.
