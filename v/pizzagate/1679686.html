couldnt be more obvious. This girl is a player in the game and still very very young. She warrants further research.</p>

Angel Gonzalez (example) 
Time Served: 20 years
On March 10, 2015, Angel Gonzalez was exonerated after serving over 20 years in prison for a rape that he did not commit. In 1994, Gonzalez was misidentified by a rape victim as her assailant. After he was arrested, he was then misled by police into signing a false confession. Although Gonzalez maintained his innocence from the beginning, it wasn’t until 2013 that he was finally able to prove his innocence through DNA testing. He is now living free.</p>

<p>I am going to continue but basically I want to put this out there. This innocence page is trolling young girls sites and posting these phone numbers all over them. They have no followers, but some of the girls seem to know John.  the language is strange  the site is not well done but it exists. I have not called the numbers. I dont think I will, hoping someone else will. I will continue with looking into these people and the company but I want to put it out there as I got to this place directly from trolling Don Podesta\'s page. </p>
<p>Thoughts? I think this is a highly connected network that brings young girls from sexual grooming and abuse. See this picture for example from Llena\'s page.

            Kathleen Zellner is the lawyer working the Steven Avery case. She is the real deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I had to guess, this is way to capital use on that and some shitty group is using the legitimacy of the innocence project and their name to slander the lawyers or the real group. They do not specialize in any one kind of case. They go with the cases that were not represented correctly and where the evidence proves innocence.
           </p>

            I am not seeing what you are getting at. DNA is used to free the wrongly convicted in these cases. Keep digging though. Maybe I am missing something.

            Just the fact that both of you dismissed in a timeframe that woudl not allow for further exploratoin.. I am now convinced its worth the time to continue with this one. Thanks so much.    NCMEC has a website. What the hell is wrong with protecting exploited and missing children? Is there an IOTA of evidence when this started? No it was a gut feeling and certain people being connected. Because it was "Podesta" people ran with it. Based upon your shoddy arguments, we shoudl have all walked away from that one too.... smh.

               Ahahaha, so because I haven't found anything, because I don't consider myself an investigator, just a concerned cictizen, I'm not capable of calling you out for being full of shit. What have you contributed? This is your highest rated submission, and it's a worthless piece of shit with absolutely nothing to substantiate anything other than a link to an article where a john mcwilliams represented a couple of bad people. There are numerous john mcwilliams who practice law across the united states, we can't even be sure it's the same person. But if it were, you've proven lawyers can be scumbags who defend bigger scumbags, congratulations. What a contribution. And this is your highest-rated submission! It's objectively worthless. It's also your lowest-rated submission so I guess your are really doing the heavy lifting here on Voat. By the way, you still haven't explained why I'm mistaken other than your intuition. Whereas I've explained how your post is insufficient not to arouse suspicion about yourmotives! What's your 2nd highest rated submission? "WHAT IF? The satanic cabal wants us to be immersed in this dark matter in order to enslave us? (I dont believe it, but must ponder)" is the title of it. Again, don't need to read it to know it's worthless and likely designed to keep us from digging deeper based on the title alone. And guess what, it's also your 2nd lowest rated submission, go figure. So again, try and rally the shills, it's not like you guys aren't already keeping my upvotes invisible on threads.

            The connection is he is trolling young girls. Period. He is suggestive and giving his number out to these girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            In regards to the REAL project... I am still not so sure. I am not sure why both of you dont think this warrants a looksie. Makes no sense to me, ESPECIALLY with the added information from the "real" websites board of directors, founders and "Innocence Ambassadors"   And yeah.. we dont have proof. ISNT THAT WHAT THIS SITE IS FOR? ISNT THAT WHAT WE ARE ALL DOING? RESEARCHING AND LINKING INFORMATION POINTS?   you know at this point I am not sure at all what VOAT is really turning into.  To post that something is WRONG and not look at the website is just stupid.

              oh Pokey, just because you dont have the skillsets to do your own research, doesnt mean you can go around making up silly stories about others. you have no interest in contributing. I bet you have an extremely small penis and still live with your mother.

               Oh my god, I needed that laugh. The skillset to do my own research. You're killing me! From someone with clearly the masterful skills of investigation you possess, that's a compliment.

               Again, I've made up nothing. those are easily confirmed facts, the same way you clicked my account, i clicked yours. You've submitted a 23 things but only 5 show, guess the other 18 were taken down for being objective shit posts at face value! I challenge anyone to go read our comparative post history; I tend to freely accuse others of being shills when i suspect they are, but i'm not distracting from the investigation with my hokey intuition. On the contrary, I'm inclined to believe i'm a bright person who applies a degree of skepticism to research I evaluate. And i definitely think there's a concerted trolling campaign to undermine the research being done here. You are the embodiment of that. You just called for people to downvote my profile? To try and have me removed from here? Spoken like a shill. EXPOSED.

            There is a real Innocence Project.  It's not the twitter account or webpages you link to.  It doesn't specialize in pedophiles.  It's website is not a Wix page.  Here's the actual Innocence Project's website.

             He's not linking to the innocence project, so perhaps you should consider the fact that someone might hide behind the recognizable similarity to an actual non-profit.That said, I can find nothing wrong with the site he linked other than its supposed shoddiness. Actually. And the example he cites about it is bizarre. I understand people have a confirmation bias about this stuff because of the nature of it. But, if DNA evidence can exonerate a man serving years of a rape sentence of which he is innocent, what the hell is suspect about that? That's a good thing. The question becomes, would anyone hide behind the similarities to the innocence project in order to conceal something heinous? If so is there an iota of evidence to suggest that this is one such front? Because best I can tell, his contribution is the social media links b/w Don Podesta and pedophiles, not that he found some website that in no way is seemingly suspect.  (edited typos)

              If he is on this Innocence Project site, he is connected. Regardless of if he is not on the main site. He is a pedophile attorney. Period. It is his specialty.  So yeah, maybe the INNOCENCE PROJECT hides behind the "Innocence Project"  in order to conceal something heinous. Not a IOTA of evidence... whatevah... remove yourself form this conversation if you want to comment without even exploring further. I know something is up with this John Fuck. NO doubt. And he is saying he is related. There IS a website taking submissions. And there are verifiable names of other attornies listed here.  I think you may have a bias not to check this shit out and know for sure. If you think there is nothing suspect about either of the sites considering all the information then I think something is definately wrong. I am not buying what you are selling either...

               You've got to be kidding. You're either an idiot, a shill designed to waste our time and make us look stupid, or an asshole trolling.. You found some teen who has an instagram profile. I found nothing shady on it, neither pedo comments nor imagery. I would like you to link me to what you think specifically warranted suspicion. Because all I saw was an emo young girl trying to become famous through social media, interested in things young girls are interested in. I couldn't find your vaguely mentioned comment from this lawyer, nor do i think anyone will be dumb enough to take your bait and start harassing a seemingly noble cause. How you concluded she is a finder/handler is beyond me but i guess i'm obtuse for not just seeing it and taking your baseless leads as gospel. Claiming you know something is up with someone, in response to people's request for evidence, isn't proof of anything other than that you're an asshole. Period.

                 On the contrary, I exposed you as a fraud, someone paid to shit post here. Again, pretend those of us who just don't get it are well-intentioned idiots, even though it would appear the inverse it true, and post screencaps of anything that you think warrants suspicion. Because, as we've explained, not one link you provided has any visibly accessible suspicious activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's what I think: you're here because you belong to a community of youtube perverts and we've recently been making you all feel tremendously uncomfortable and nervous. In response, in what I don't doubt you fancy a brilliant campaign, you've all taken to bombarding our pizzagate forum with unsubstantiated, baseless shitposts. People are explaining to you that they searched your links and found nothing that remotely qualified as anything suspicious and, on thecontrary, find your representation of the people in question dishonest. I'm vulgar? Wow, you got me there! Heaven forbid I used the word asshole, what will my peers ever think of me!? If that's all you've got, you should just retire this account, start a new one. because you've been exposed as a fraud.

                  Seriously though Pokeymon, if you want to shame me for at least TRYING to contribute to this atrocity... go ahead. That is precisely what the world at large is doing and as a result there kids being hurt, kililed, abused and ruined. This is not ok. I am ok with some of my finds not always being relevant. But at least I am trying because I care. As a woman, as a human being and as a person who sincerely strives to make a difference in the world. People like you do nothing but bring it all down and you contribute ZERO. I will continue to try and many of these seemingly uninteresting (to others) strings often come into play down the line as the puzzle pieces fall into place. This is fact. So stop it. YOu are wasting time. Energy and space in this world if all you want to do is naysay without even trying to be a decent human being.

                  SOOOOOOOOO  its been fun playing with you Pokey but this little mamma is going to move on to something a little more productive and a little less ewwwwww. girls dont really like you do they pokey? and you are very very angry about it. Unfortunately,  women like me tend to like men with well developed minds, a sense of humor, natural curiousity and at least a little more going on "down there". Best of luck with all that...keep poking away little man. go harass someone else. I have to get back to doing something that matters.

                   Also, it's hilarious you attack me ad hominem, whereas I'm attacking you on the basis of continued insistence upon not substantiating your intuition. People asked you to spell it out for those of us not able to understand your brilliant research. Know what you did? You offered beligerance and then played the victim because I used the world asshole. You're not doing a very convincing job of playing the victim for someone who's objectively attempting to persecute me. Really,m please anyone go look at my account, go look at my comments and see who has recently been trolling me, since i called them out on being a shill. Actually, please, anyone go read the ocmments she posted and tell me you believe that there's the slightest possibility that this "momma" isn't paid to be here.

                     Yeah, you're totes a momma, just a concerned woman. You haven't projected already why you do it, namely your tiny penis about which you're angry at the world. You haven't attempted to refute anything i've said, not when i was being polite, not when i was asking for just a link, not when i was pointing out that you make unexplained leaps that you won't elaborate on when requested to, that you see nefarious imagery on instagrams that in no way resemble any other pizzagate established suspects instagrams or the themes discussed within. I'd be terrified if you were actually a woman, actually a mother, actually spiritual, and just so feeble minded that you couldn't. but then you wouldn't b such a cliche troll, which you are, and anyone can see.

                   Listen you flake, if you're not a shill you're a piece of shit. But who we kidding, one comment you use broken english, another you're fluent. Some you act spiritual, othes you're analytical. You're a professional shill. I'm going to start posting more regularly. I will literally post twice as often from now on to show my appreciation for lighting a fire under my ass. Mission accomplished you inept "intellectual" prostitute.

                   So this guy has gone and left a downvote and a megative response to every comment i've posted recently on any thread. Even comments widely upvoted. Honestly Voat, something needs to be done about these pieces of human refuge.

                    I am a woman pokeymon.  I leave it to the mods to decide whats best... I would be happy to submit any proof of who I am they would like.  I have nothing to hide and I find your posts funny because it is just SO DAMN TYPICAL. I know there is nothing anyone can do about your tiny organ pokey. but if you at least try to be a decent human being I bet you could actually find yourself a woman and stop being so ANGRY all the time.  ;) Seriously though... this is about children. this is about corruption. this is about satanism. this is about things that actually MATTER. and unfortunately, you dont. at least to me. but I bet your mommy loves you like only a mother could.

                     Does it occur to you that the more you make this about my penis, the more it's plain to see for anyone reading this exchange that you've not even so much as attempted to validate any of the claims you've made. That you have no evidence, that you're trying to send people on a flagrant wild goose chase is so obvious, it's sad for you that you don't see it.

Stephen Colbert is an "Innocence Ambassador" (remember the guy who said none of this was real?) along with a bunch of other people who are definately not "Innocent". Did you even look at the other website? This site THE ONE I POSTED has a submission function as well. I am going to continue but based upon the "

             The whole mission plays into getting sex offenders OFF. Based upon WHAT? The site I posted is related and trolling along with JOHN who seems to like very young girls and cultivate friendships with them when we thinks pictures are "sexy". I think it is possible AREWESURE... that you are a troll. I am not yet sure.. but to dismiss something without exploring doesnt serve the goal of bringing down sex offenders. Don Podesta is connected to this. He liked posts on this Llena's page (though he appears to like little boys and MK'd girls)

             then why is one of them TROLLING YOUNG GIRLS? John is trolling sexually explicit photos. I dont buy it. Have you looked at this website? It is shoddy at best. Misspellings. Sorry but I think THAT is wrong. Oh and these organizations NEVER represent something they are not? NCMES for example.. come one dude. ARE YOU REALLY SURE? I am not.
