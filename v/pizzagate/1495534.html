<p>I mentioned that the NY Times published an article on Ms Summer Camp, real name Shea Van Horn, in 2010, profiling him for his work as a deejay and a female impersonator. Something notable from that story is that he used to work with entertainer and gay activist Dan Savage.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is a photo of Ms Summer Camp appearing around Halloween 2015 as &quot;Miss Planned Parenthood&quot; at an annual drag event called the Miss Adams Morgan Pageant, which is said to draw influential D.C. residents: <a href="http://archive.is/2L8F4">http://archive.is/2L8F4</a> . Besides wearing an evening gown and tiara, &quot;MSC&quot; also has on a mask of a crying baby\'s face and has fake blood on himself. Most disturbing of all, he carries a plastic see-through purse containing what is supposed to look like a bloodied, late-term aborted baby. </p>

The ad\'s text says, &quot;Tasting summer in a bite: Priceless.&quot; MSC comments, &quot;Saw this while I was in Greece. &quot;Priceless&quot; isn\'t the word most people use upon tasting me. #Greece.&quot; Another commenter on the photo (berett_sea) writes: &quot;I think it\'s an error in translation?

<p>Then there is an Instagram user going by the name Mf_dirt (who comments on JKC\'s photo). Some photos from &quot;Mfd\'s&quot; account:</p>

<p>Another Instagram user who commented on the &quot;10 holes&quot; post by berett_sea goes by the name &quot;PizzaF------Party.&quot; He does use the actual profanity. I\'m referring to this account name as &quot;PFP.&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>PFP takes a photo of himself next to a &quot;Baby Doll Pizza&quot; truck (it\'s a pizzeria located in Portland, OR, and it very likely isn\'t connected to Pizzagate except that PFP liked the name and took a picture in front of one of the restaurant\'s trucks).</p>

<p>Andrewbrischler is another associated account. He has an artist\'s studio, and in one picture he is holding a very young boy who seems to be crying, while Andrewbrischler is smiling (it is of course entirely possible the child is his nephew but some things about the photo and comments are still troubling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>andrewbrischler Uncle Andrew had a very special studio visitor yesterday.</p>

<p>Then there are photos from two different accounts of two similar birthday cakes which have on top the heads of boys, and which are &quot;bloodied&quot; to represent birth:</p>
<p>First, one to Shea Van Horn/Mssummercamp:</p>

<p>Then there is one on the account of &quot;metalhair.&quot; (who is associated with this circle through &quot;timmysdown&quot; <a href="http://archive.is/C9OMB">http://archive.is/C9OMB</a> . This cake photo is far more graphic than the other, including more blood, and anatomical features of a woman giving birth, as well as depicting her anus and feces:</p>
