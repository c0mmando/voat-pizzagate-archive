            Listen to me, one of my post got deleted by admin, the others did not pick up traction. I am very CONFIDENT  I have seen this women at Sachem Public Library. This library is off exit 61 on LIE expressway. Ms. Agnew mentions sleeping in her truck... well funny enough there is a "park and ride" off the expressway where people occasionally leave their vehicle overnight. (These are all things mentioned in tweets)
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the same women I have seen at the library. I have no vested interest in this topic or taking the time to post these things. I literally made an account on voat to relay this information but it does not seem to be going anywhere.

             Hi, Voaterookie,  I posted to an above post about your theory a couple of days ago.  And I definitely think these tweets were done at a library.  Here's what I posted as an answer to the post that had all the links posted:
            </p>
            <p>
             Hello, lurker here who finally has something to submit.  I went through the above list and created a spreadsheet to try to get a birdseye view of these Catherine Agnew twitter accounts.  I did so after reading one of the posts related to these twitter accounts where the poster said he thought he knew this woman from back when he was in college and had seen her at a library repeatedly on the computer, sometimes behaving erratically.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I put each of the above twitter addresses onto a spreadsheet and then logged the following data:  date of tweets, time range of the tweets, number of tweets, first few words of first tweet in each account, etc.  Having done that, it is clear that this woman is using a computer at a library to do these tweets.  All the posting times fall within normal library hours.  And, in fact, in the catherineagnew40 one, her first words are "HI ADMIRAL BACK AT LIBRARY".  Though she is obviously suffering from mental health issues, she appears to have been very determined in her purpose here with these tweets.  From the catherineagnew2 which is dated 9/19/2011 through the catherineagne99 which is dated 11/30/2011, she missed very few days and some days she created multiple accounts (consecutively numbered).  Likely that was due to library rules/restrictions?  She also typically spent an hour or less per sitting, again probably related to the rules of computer use at the library.
            </p>
            <p>
             Looking at this with this birdseye view I'm less hopeful than I was when I first saw this thread last night.  She's clearly dealing with mental/emotional challenges.  And while lots of names come up, including John Podesta, Tony Podesta, and Heather Podesta, they are rare compared to the more oft-repeated names:  Bill Gates, Nancy Pelosi, and a good number of others.  However, even in just scanning some of the tweets as I did this (not reading all of them), there are quite a few interesting (albeit deeply disturbing) references to brainwashing, torture, the murder of babies, organ selling, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some have speculated on here about her being a victim of MK Ultra or SRA.  The overview doesn't exclude either of those as real possibilities.  I'd say if she knows personally some of these people in elite circles, then that would certainly be possible.  On the other hand, I know somebody who has what appears to be very similar mental health issues and some of the patterns in these tweets are all too familiar, I'm afraid (the tampering with a vehicle, the repeated complaints regarding stolen property, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
             I would love to share the spreadsheet, but I'm not quite sure what the best way to do that would be.  It's in Excel format right now.  Any suggestions?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is my first time posting anything, so I'm hoping I'm not breaking any of the rules here.  I'm good with spreadsheets, but pretty much a novice on what's available out there for sharing docs.  So if you have advice, I would be grateful for specificity.

               Definitely saw what you wrote.  And my post was my first time posting.  I now see how easy it is for important information to get buried.  I know there's a wiki on pizzagate, but I'm not sure if that's a viable solution or not.  The anonymity of all these forums is good for a multitude of reasons, but it also makes it ripe for misinformation and disinformation agents.  I can say this:  I've been getting a crash course in discernment for the last few months.  Makes my head spin.
              </p>
              <p>
               Regarding approaching this woman, someone in an earlier post, if I recall right, mentioned finding the death certificate in FL that Catherine Agnew talked about.  If she is alleging that her death was somehow staged so her money could be stolen and there is a death certificate that is for this same Catherine Agnew that supports that allegation, I say that goes a long way toward making her a possibly credible source (albeit a very wounded source).  I'm also curious about what it is about ADMIRAL MULLEN that makes him the guy that she keeps reaching out to.  I can't take the time now, but I'll try to find where the earlier poster said something about finding the death certificate later tonight and then edit this post to add it.

             How long ago did you last see her? Can you find her again? And if you ARE able to find her what do you say to her? She's probably rightfully very paranoid, maybe due to her mental state especially paranoid. Then someone she doesn't know approaches her years after she stopped tweeting and says, "I know who you are. Many of us know who you are. We've been looking for you. You're safe now." If I were her in that situation, I'd run like hell. And can you imagine the woman's response if you tell her that and it's not her?" Actually, that could provide some comic relief. And if you're able to find her, maybe she can help the investigation.

              I have no idea if she is still using the library -- if she is I could find her. If I find her, I would tell her the truth... I would like to help get her story out.
             </p>
             <p>
              Honestly, she is so erratic I don't even know if anyone could reason with her. I'll look into going to the library, maybe I can get some answers from the staff if I bring her mugshot.

               Might sound silly, but be careful. Not to sound like a bad movie, but she might be under surveillance at this point-- I believe she and her info are real. I would be very careful about giving anyone at that location your information as it could get into the wrong hands. Keep your situational awareness at maximum dial and tell someone you trust where you're going and why and when you expect to be back. Also, if what you say triggers her, understand that you don't know how she'll react.

                I really appreciate your advise. It's part of the reason why I am trying to remain anonymous. I could post more information about myself to help with my credibility but there's too much heat around this subject. If this is true about her, I'm sure something would "happen" to me.

            There's several threads on voat and a popular one on reddit regarding her. I figured more would be skeptical considering the unorganized nature of the rantings, but I think there's a dedicated group who are taking it as a true lead. I think the more information you can provide, especially unique, the better.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I were in the position of having info from my place of employment that I could not have come back to me, I would first take whatever steps I needed to protect myself, then try to leak it through users that I trusted. I don't know if that's your situation or not, just saying. Alternatively, one could "lead a horse to water" so to speak, rather than outstretch wet hands.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever you can supply would be beneficial.

            There is just too much personal info being translated; deaths, landmarks, addresses, family names. If it is a twitter bot then it knows very intimate details of this person, not just public records.

            I bet Twitter can.  Just something to keep in mind.  Need to be careful with this one, as this person (if they are real and not a disinfo campaign) is clearly very mentally ill.

            Indeed, stay vigilant guys. Also other thing: I don't recall how hard it was back in 2011, but nowadays it is pretty hard to make a lot of twitter accounts. I always get blocked and have to unlock it with a phonenumber.. But that could be a new thing indeed. Best we can do with those tweets it use it as leads. Because even if it's fake, the names aren't.

            questions to think about:
           </p>
           <p>
            the multiple accounts is interesting, why 50+ accounts instead of just one?  at the start of each account she sounds like she's talking to someone specific and telling them she's "still here"...just extreme paranoia?  Why wouldn't these accounts get shut down?  Who did she even expect to see them, she doesn't tag anyone and lots of them don't even have Followers...
           </p>
           <p>
            anyone have any theories?
           </p>
           <p>
            also twitter is completely compromised, so stay skeptical because an anti-trump SJW at twitter could probably change the dates to whatever they wanted to lay a trap...be careful!!

            if you need motivation just imagine that us normal human beings are sickened by everything we're seeing to the point where we can barely handle looking at this shit or rewatching that fucking fatherhood video...

           <p>
            meanwhile the people involved in this probably LAUGH at us for feeling sick or crying at this abuse the way we laugh at people saying Trump has them literally shaking etc and would taunt us if they could blow their cover...stay strong!

             If she is alleging that her death was somehow staged so her money could be stolen and there is a death certificate that is for this same Catherine Agnew and yet she is still alive, I say that goes a long way toward making her a possibly credible source (albeit a very wounded source).   She mentions repeatedly in the tweets that she is alive and cites the fact that she's on disability (SSI?) as proof that  the government knows she's alive.  That's an interesting point.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm also curious about what it is about ADMIRAL MULLEN that makes him the guy that she keeps reaching out to.

            Do a twitter search for the username "catherineagne" (the beginning of the username that posted these tweets) and you will see she has MANY accounts with the same name but different numbers at the end, and all have bizzare posts. Wtf?

            Wow. This sure isn't a psy-op. Most could say, eh, the tweets show that the person is irrational, seems to be paranoid or suffer from some kind of mental illness. Except that person gives names. Names that we know are all involved in the trafficking of children, money laundering, Satanic Cults, MK Ultra and murder. If I hadn't heard a similar story via a reply sent to
            <em>
             Charles Ortel
            </em>
            , I think I still might have some doubts as to the credibility of this person named Catherine.
            <strong>
             Anyhow, here's a similar message from the second witness:
            </strong>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dear Charles,
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clinton's have stolen millions from me. A $30 million lump some from my 31 August 2007 $330 million winning lottery ticket, was stolen from me by attorneys in the law offices of Anthony Schram, Freddy B Ruiz and others, for continued federal protection to exploit my family and I, my wealth and steal Intellectual Property, that they would then broker for their profit. I never provided legal authorization of representation to any of these people, and any that appears to be given was under the influence of drug / hypno &amp;/or duress. I want my money back, access to my wealth and freedom to leave this country with my children's and grandson's bodies, which the Clinton's allowed human trafficker, Freddy Briones Ruiz to sell for sex, rape, torture and murder as a fellow Clinton pedophile and voodoo practitioner to spiritual influence victims of their criminal choices and behavior. God help us stop their lies and violation of my family, life, wealth and sanctify the lose of life the Clinton family have murdered to progress their criminal capitalism with the enslavement of people like me. I am currently at 407 W 20th, Apt 2, Wilmington DE 19802, still being drug-hypno raped by Clinton Coven supporters to character assassinate, identity theft wealth, pervert my access to truth about the murder of my children and punish me with left of access to my millions for not actively supporting the Clinton's, because I have both a faith and moral issues with their exploitation of my intelligence for their master / slave paradigm in handling me, my family and wealth for their brokering profit and pimping of my body through Delaware VP Pimp, Joe Biden, and his local gang rapists that criminally manage me. My dad was an Army PsyOps Handler, and taught all his children and others, how intellectual property for the brokering of a victim's Handler; ie. Modern Day Slavery. Charles, I want my money back that the Clinton's have stolen, along with my Intellectual Property Rights for knowledge they have stolen from me and brokered worldwide. If I don't get Justice in this life, I am sure all my fellow global citizens can tell God "why" at our Judgment, their reasons for helping the Clinton's, Obama's, Bush's and my dad, steal from me, murder my children and theirs, sell use as whores, publicly humiliate us in a hate crime punk reality show online violation and willfully deny me Justice and lawful, moral assistance and protection from these criminals, which the FBI has formally denied me &amp; my girls, since my asking for protection from these human traffickers July 2007 in San Antonio, Texas. Most sincerely.

               No, I meant I want some nerd to hack that shit and make it available.  If the inhumans made an online reality show of their sickness, we need that!!  Then great justice ahoy.

               Yes. I posted a thread on the Clinton Foundation Investigation done by Charles Ortel once and this voater noticed this particular comment and after I read it, I was dumbfounded, not sure what to think of it, but it stayed with me. And I automatically remembered it, when I saw this new post on similar allegations. It was a a-ha moment for me.

             "agnew" is not a word in English -- at least, not one I've ever encountered.  Just a name ("Agnew").

            <p>
             If it is a word, it's obscure.

             Good thinking to check Wikileaks, but that might be the former White House Intergovernmental Affairs David Agnew they're referring to.

            Is anyone looking at the new one?  New tweets as of a few min ago.  Probably fake right?   All the others are from 2011?   There is no chance someone would be silent that long and pop up again right now.  New one has to be fake unless I'm missing something.

             As the accounts keep getting found, I bet they will stretch from before 2011 to now... Those from 2012 &amp; 2013 are being found now. That would certainly be more proof... I am with everyone skeptical about the current posts and their changing grammar, but I do see her grammar just ever so somewhat improving between 2010 and 2013, so possibly this is still the same tweeter, whether it's all valid info or not.

             I'd say definitely fake. And that says a lot because that person has spent a lot of time and energy creating so many tweets so fast. They're already working on muddying the waters as people looking at the Twitter accounts later won't realize this woman was discovered by investigators on the same night that Twitter account was created. And the person threw in enough similar things to make it look legit.

              Doesn't read the same to me either. Just a gut instinct but sounds like an impersonator.  The only specific thing I can point to is the mismatch of capitals and lower case letters.   All the old ones I have seen so far are full caps.  And the spacing isn't the same.  More words jammed together in the old ones.   Sure it's been years and there is no explanation why the old ones are written the strange way they are but they are consistent.

             On some of them she follows a different person or group but yeah, usually only one. I wonder if it's a clue specific to the tweets on that account. Like glue holding the tweets together or something.

            It really bothers me how often I keep looking up people and coming up blank...I saw that it had been developed to who her brother is .. but it's still disturbing how the Internet is kept clean..I'm trying to trace down 2 people right now because I think they have dirt on them, hardly any info.

             no you cant manipulate the date data ( maybe someone inside twirtter could though?)...
 but can you hide an account and un-hide it at a later date ?
             <br/>
             with no friends accounts would just sit there after being un-hide and just waiting till they are found.

            This is amazing. Okay this weekend my focus is going to be planned parenthood. I'm going to make a post tomorrow to look for people who want to spend their weekend taking on different topics and get the community working together - we're a part of history let's do this.

             There's also a Catherine Agnew Twitter account named similar to all the ones already found and with a similar naming convention, but with a profile pic and only one tweet. However, she looks to be about 50 which is the right age according to what was posted earlier. Also, the background in the pic looks like it could be Florida. The Twitter handle is
             <a href="https://twitter.com/AgnewCatherine1">
              https://twitter.com/AgnewCatherine1
             </a>

             Hello, lurker here who finally has something to submit.  I went through the above list and created a spreadsheet to try to get a birdseye view of these Catherine Agnew twitter accounts.  I did so after reading one of the posts related to these twitter accounts where the poster said he thought he knew this woman from back when he was in college and had seen her at a library repeatedly on the computer, sometimes behaving erratically.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I put each of the above twitter addresses onto a spreadsheet and then logged the following data:  date of tweets, time range of the tweets, number of tweets, first few words of first tweet in each account, etc.  Having done that, it is clear that this woman is using a computer at a library to do these tweets.  All the posting times fall within normal library hours.  And, in fact, in the catherineagnew40 one, her first words are "HI ADMIRAL BACK AT LIBRARY".  Though she is obviously suffering from mental health issues, she appears to have been very determined in her purpose here with these tweets.  From the catherineagnew2 which is dated 9/19/2011 through the catherineagne99 which is dated 11/30/2011, she missed very few days and some days she created multiple accounts (consecutively numbered).  Likely that was due to library rules/restrictions?  She also typically spent an hour or less per sitting, again probably related to the rules of computer use at the library.
            </p>
            <p>
             Looking at this with this birdseye view I'm less hopeful than I was when I first saw this thread last night.  She's clearly dealing with mental/emotional challenges.  And while lots of names come up, including John Podesta, Tony Podesta, and Heather Podesta, they are rare compared to the more oft-repeated names:  Bill Gates, Nancy Pelosi, and a good number of others.  However, even in just scanning some of the tweets as I did this (not reading all of them), there are quite a few interesting (albeit deeply disturbing) references to brainwashing, torture, the murder of babies, organ selling, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some have speculated on here about her being a victim of MK Ultra or SRA.  The overview doesn't exclude either of those as real possibilities.  I'd say if she knows personally some of these people in elite circles, then that would certainly be possible.  On the other hand, I know somebody who has what appears to be very similar mental health issues and some of the patterns in these tweets are all too familiar, I'm afraid (the tampering with a vehicle, the repeated complaints regarding stolen property, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
             I would love to share the spreadsheet, but I'm not quite sure what the best way to do that would be.  It's in Excel format right now.  Any suggestions?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is my first time posting anything, so I'm hoping I'm not breaking any of the rules here.  I'm good with spreadsheets, but pretty much a novice on what's available out there for sharing docs.  So if you have advice, I would be grateful for specificity.  Thank you!  :-)

            Off topic... The last few days have been really rough- this is getting very real. It feels like the adventure I've always wanted as a kid playing things like Final Fantasy or Legend of Zelda. I keep having to take deep breaths because I keep starting to tear up. The closer this comes to fruition the more it hurts. Especially after Skippy's gross video, that weasel slime!

            I know we say this from time to time, but this may be the absolute smoking gun. We have a victim laying out the crime. Please lets coordinate right now. I think we should organize these tweets by account chronologically. I recorded a video of myself recording the initial account...

            I don't know if recordings would be a good way to share this, but its just an idea. I also think the hash tags # WhereIsCatherineAgnew and # FindCatherineAgnew could be effective on twitter. We need to archive spread and crowd source this.

            Stay strong everyone this is real, scary shit. But we will win in the end

            you should. that stuff about jewels and colors could provide detail as to why the sick worldcorp fuck making videos in the bathroom is using the lighting that he does. the video is shot with a purple lighting in the background and it says about this about amethyst:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Amethyst is usually the first one earned, and is linked to keeping secrets, never telling, and passing the first step of 
discipline. Each step is linked to receiving either a jewel or precious metal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ruby will often be next, and is linked to sexual abuse and sexual alters inside. As the child is repeatedly sexually 
traumatized and survives, or creates sexual alters to please adults, they are "rewarded" by being allowed to become a ruby."
           </p>
           <p>
            maybe that was footage of a child victim in the purple room being mentally broken before they graduate to a room with red lighting. just speculation because I still can't make any sense of that video.

            Ok, so to summarize my perspective of what she is alleging -
           </p>
           <p>
            She was living in florida, and possibly has a family government connection.She is aware of human trafficking and organ harvesting and all of the stuff you can read about in her tweets. She goes to escape Florida after her sisters (grace, margaret), brother (Mike mullen died 1987(?)), uncle and aunt are killed. On the flight out, she makes it sound like she is taken to CIA black site and tortured. She claims it is the reason for her (likely mental) illness and disability. Judge Cohalan, who's linked to dirty cops, may have sentenced her or her family in some trial. There's a lot that's incoherent, but there's a few gems of truth tucked in these tweets. If she was a victim of MK like she states, keep in mind that this "craziness" could have come upon late in life. This is an odd collection of ramblings and accusations and there's shreds of intelligence. There could be something valuable here, especially if dates start to match up for where some of these politicians were. She seems to be living in her truck parked at the Sachem public library. Unless I am mistaken, the person named MCJUNK works at the library. He may be the employee who had contact with her.
           </p>
           <p>
            But - please - If you can even investigate one of the profiles and help me correct/tweak the big picture here, let's do it.

            Here's Peter F. Cohalan who apparently sentenced her for some crime(Video unrelated):

            Is anyone familiar with any conspiracies or scandals regarding the FAA? It would be a really good idea to, if possible, prove that she's right about SOMETHING.

              None of these tweets are indexed on the web, and googles cache only extends back to today. can someone explain how these tweets do not appear on social aggregators, if they've been online since 2011? I can't find tweets, backlinks, cached tweets, etc of anyone on tweeter, except these.

              needs to independently verify these tweets. Otherwise, there's no evidence these are old. there internet has no cache of these tweets.

              its very odd , but an account suspended or hidden could of just recently turned back on from a mistake or power that be are no longer in control.  also could of been twitter being hacked , also there is so many accounts meaning a person with some computer skills to make multiple accounts  but then to hide them maybe suspend the accounts or someone at twitter ?    speechless. still interesting.

               I know some of the MKUltra programs were related to taking away someone's personality in order to give them a new one. Could this be what she means by identity theft, or do you think it's a literal identity theft? (I just found this, so I haven't looked through everything yet.)

             thank you for piecing it together.  I'm looking them up and archiving as fast as I can.  I've found 50 so far and I'm sure there's lots more.  I'm gonna have to call it a night soon but it's hard to stop, this is exciting.  There might be some good info in here.

               I use the add on for archive.is on Firefox when I'm at my computer. Otherwise go to the archive.is or another, there's archive.fo I think, you just enter the web address into the bar, enter, and it will save and generate a link for you too. I like archive.is then I download the zips, rename them and tuck them away. If I'm extra ambitious, I also save screen shots of the page, and pictures, make a folder for it so its there, save it off and online. Usually by the time I'm around to it many have archived quickly, so I'll crawl down some rabbit holes from those, and search certain hashtags and start archiving those quickly since I'm in archive mode.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just have copies of bookmarks of the sites, backups and etc offline and unplug the power to it (I use a big ol external drive I purchased for my concert collections, it's probably easier to use a stick drive though, and I have those too lol) there's no incentive to kill any of us when we archive, and we save things in masses. A wise you tuber said it'd one person, you can't kill us all. :)

            I'm not well versed enough on it to be honest. I just dug into this stuff recently. Another fucking crazy coincidence is that this lady mentions people being waterboarded and their organs being harvested in basements in DC and today on Alex Jones that ex-CIA guy said his sources told him that there are basements in DC where you can straight up order children.

                I'm not AT ALL sure so please assume I'm wrong. I just brought it up in case someone with better knowledge of tech/social media could verify it, just because I thought I saw that happen once. Just want to be sure.

            it seems a little fucking freaky that this crazy person is ranting about diamonds and jewels after just reading this today about these occult freaks relishing jewels and associating them with weird rituals/mind control. I'm not saying I believe any of this, but it's just a strange coincidence(page 15 of that pdf for info on the jewels/metal rituals):

            <p>
             Holy shit..!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Just searched "Agnew" and "Lake Ronkonkoma" ...lots of potential leads here. She could be batshit crazy...but could very well be something here.
            </p>
            <p>
             A lot of the names she calls out are already on the suspicious list for PG crimes...
            </p>
            <p>
             Update: Ronkonkoma is only about 30mins away from Gilgo Beach, the primary site for the LI Serial Killer(s) body discoveries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Update 2: She mentions a "Cameron" as one of her abusers. Stuart Cameron was the Suffolk County Chief, Commanding Officer of the Patrol Bureau, at the time of the Gilgo Beach discoveries. (May be stretching here..?)
            </p>
            <p>
             Update 3: She mentions the basement of Islip airport. Long Island MacArthur airport is in Ronkonkoma. (Human trafficking?)
            </p>
            <p>
             Update 4: She mentions Cuomo ties to baby killing and Mercy Hospital, which also happens to be in the same general vicinity of Long Island. Cuomo is also under investigation by Preet Bhara (sp?) for his aides poss taking bribes from Mercy Hospital developers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm just spitballing here....but seems like this part of Long Island could be worth further research. The fact that the airport is there makes me really suspicious. NYC has to be a hotbed for trafficking, just given its sheer size. You couldn't easily traffick through JFK/LGA/EWR...they are too big and too busy. Would have to be done through a small regional airport (if by air).

               His theory was that they (Epstein's clan) disposed of some of their kills here and offed some prostitutes to convolute the investigation.

               George Webb is something else. He may go off on tangents from time to time (probably necessary to advance investigation), but he is one smart motherfucker.

            Damn.  Though  not the same person,  reminds me of a group member we had on fb that rambled almost identical,  claimed she had been mk ultrad,  chip in brain,  stomach liner removed, etc etc.  She rambled and mumbled constantly naming politicians  such as podesta and Obama.  I believe something  happened to this person/ victim..... But it's nearly impossible in my opinion to get clear answers from people like this that (sadly)  don't make them sound completely  schizophrenic.  :(   It's as if they've been so fucked up through  their childhood that putting together a prosecutable statement and  timeline is very difficult for them.
