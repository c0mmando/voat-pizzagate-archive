            Maybe we should turn this into a meme and see what ol Donal J. really has under the hood. If a few thousand people tweeted this regularly what would happen? I don't know. Would it lose its bite and get old so that nobody paid attention to it? Would it put pressure on D.J.T. actually do it? Its a damn bold statement. I'm trying to figure out what the ramifications would be of turning it into a meme but I don't know. Its quick and easy to post though.
