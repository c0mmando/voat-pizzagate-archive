<p>This is an example of a pizzagate style elite ritual sacrifice and mind control slave operation.
This pizzagate investigation has at times been inundated with visual depictions of what actually goes on at MK ULTRA sessions (WorldCorp) and pedophile and sex slave events that are speculated to have been staged at venues such as Comet Ping Pong, Tony Podesta\'s Video Basement, The Pegasus Museum, the #KillRoom, the many farms and homes we have uncovered connected to elite pedophiles, and at hunting parties in the US and Europe at private elite residences, to name but a portion.</p>
<p>I am extremly disturbed beyond what is depicted in this You Tube video - can this be allowed to be on You Tube?   In many ways does not at all appear to be shoot-from-the-hip type photography, nor does it appear to my untrained eye to actually have been done during the period claimed.  But it could be.  It almost has a sick &quot;high fashion&quot; look to the posing of some of it, the color film used and the costuming, except by the end it becomes more violent and appears to be more like stills from some kind of graphic movie, possibly done in the 60s or 70s to depict something that happened in the 40s?  European origin?</p>
<p>Are there any Italians out there that can provide any context for this?   Are these depictions of the named elites - an Italian President, Duke and Bishop - or is it really them?</p>

             This was special effects and chocolate.  All the children were of adult age.  This was all investigated and the charges false.  The murder of the director after the film was released was real.

             yeah.  it was intended to look real wasn't it.  It is a transgression to even pretend to put this on film.  A transgression of these young people and everyone involved really.

            Actually, the movie is called "Salo", somewhat patterned on De Sade's book 'the 120 Days of Sodom'. These are stills from the film edited to illustrate a (unfinished?) documentary narration. Salo was a isolated town in northern Italy which a group of twisted German officers turned into a pedoslave camp during WW2. No one knows much about it. Pasolini (a highly respected Italian poet, intellectual and film-maker who was beaten to death by a hustler) stylized the telling considerably; it probably owes more to his fantasies than to reality. The movie was a shocker with very limited distribution. It's transgressivness seemed to have foretold his death. It's worth noting that Saturnalian activities have taken place continuously among the Italian elite since pre-classical times.

             thanks for weighing in I appreciate your opinion.

            <p>
             When you say "Saturnalian"  I have to say I am aware of the Saturnalia festival, but in antiquity I always assumed it was not about literally copraphiia but more about the end of the year/winter  Saturn themes.   Why do you call it Saturnalian activities?  is there something I don't understand about ancient saturnalian practices?  I never saw the ancients as this cruel I guess.

              Saturnalia is where Christmas actually came from. It was a night of drunken orgies, rape, murder ect. People got away with whatever they wanted on that night because it was part of the festival. This documentary on the origins of Christmas actually talks ALOT about it. This is what I think of when I consider what the elites are into. They know the origins of all these things and they are celebrating it at it's core.

            I remember reading an interview with someone who was in a really popular band said he had attended parties where people would pay $100,000 dollars to murder someone. They would bring some unsuspecting person to the party and not tell them what was going to happen until the end.

            If you have the stomach for it, then the source book 120 Days of Sodom by the infamous Marquis de Sade is a remarkably up-to-date account of a lot of the things we're investigating right now, despite being written in 1785. Drugs, pedophilia, murder, rape, ritual abuse by elites with disgusting pictures on the walls, child trafficking - it's horrific and modern accounts from survivors are uncannily unchanged from back then.

            Pier Pasolini was totally a pederast/pedophile.  He called the "greatest love of his life" a 15 year old called Ninetto Davoli.  He even cast Ninetto as a important part in his Canterbury Tales movie even though the movie was in English and Ninetto spoke barely any English.

            I'm familiar with the Pasolini.  He is completely fucked up.

             Based upon what I hear and read about concerning directors like Roman Polanski and Pier Paolo Pasolini, they would not have even been allowed to make films if it weren't for the acceptance of pedophilia.

            That's "Salo: 120 Days of Sodom" and I ONCE saw the film.  It has no plot just scene after scene of ritual child abuse and torture.  The stunning thing about the film is that all the tortured children LOVED their masters by the end of the film.  It glorifies nothing and makes the abuse revolting.  I can't say I'll ever recommend it though, as it was to me.  Yet if you want to know what the Axis Powers were like in private during WW2, Salo is the way to go.  There is not a shred, not an iota of "mercy" in that film.  And Classical Piano is played throughout.  Appalling.

             It further convinces me that mind control experiments and research on children and adults from the nazi scientists, like Yosef Mengele, were continued in the USA under operation paperclip. It is claimed that MKULTRA/MONARCH style programs are practically tailored to the person down to genetic level and we know for fact that Nazi Scientist Yosef Mengele was obsessed with genetics.

              I believe you speak the truth.  Incidentally, Mengele has been reported to have been seen in the U.S. at child sacrifice rituals by a woman whose first name is Georgia, I forget the last name.  Her report deals with "reptilian" shape-shifters (read demons) and several of her videos can be found on You Tube.

              Many people who see the film have decided it's real, though everything was thoroughly investigated and every actor was an adult and all torture scenes were fake.  Stockholm syndrome was definitely portrayed at the end of the film.  The only way to describe the film is "art or education" because it certainly had no plot, and it wasn't boring but compelling, because I sympathized with the children, I just was appalled when they looked with love at their torturers at the end.  To me, the message of the film was that if you don't stop this early and right away, it is too late because the victim is becoming the victimizer.  It's hard to recommend because it is so revolting, but its message and the fact it had "bad people" initiating "bad things" (the Fascists) I am not moved to condemn the film as evil.  I just hope no one watching it gets funny ideas.

            Excerpt from one review:
            <em>
             The film is divided in four parts (or "chapters," if one may call them so, since the film, it's significant to say, is based on a novel by Marquis de Sade, a controversial and provocative man of letters during his time),where each one represents the stages in which the young, innocent and gentle are deliberately and systematically corrupted and destroyed by the supposed-to-be leaders and guardians of the state---it's like hungry wolves feeding on gentle lambs.
            </em>

              Do not worry, someone will come to our rescue.  I cannot either or I would have horrible nightmares.  I am extremely visual.  We have a wonderful intelligent crew here.

                I am talking about someone that may have seen this before or is well versed on it.  There are many of us that are highly affected by things this vile.  I do not mean in reaching our goal of convincing the fellow human beings, red pilling.
