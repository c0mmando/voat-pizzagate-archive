            These are some quite prominent leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Truth is
            <em>
             as strange or stranger
            </em>
            than fiction but if you are following closely enough you will realize that the truth is even more bizarre than the fiction that represents it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you are witnessing is an actual reality straight out of the movie BATMAN, notice how carefully placed, compromised officials in law enforcement (pedophile police chief), safety (fire chief), and the service industry (SEIU) doormen, janitors, security have a virtual lockdown on having the ability to get to someone anywhere, any time.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have been being warned for a very long time now about this phenomena through the work of people like Able Danger, the Sandy Hook Event, and warned through entertainment.
           </p>
           <p>
            These agents, provocateurs hidden within these organizations (and others like BAMN and ANTIFA) do not share a conspiratorial connection in the sense that they are organized and completely aware and cognizant of  how they are serving the Hegelian dialectic from the extreme left, they are simply guided by the threat of having their lifestyle tampered with, along with their other inculcated mental illness, produces a feral like defense mechanism and are loyal to a fault.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mind you, the other side of the coin contains just as strong of a dialectic, to the point of the threat of genocide and fascism, which is the catalyst for all of the friction. They both believe they are protecting something that to them is a natural right which blinds them from the manipulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            So for all intents and purposes, essentially what you are looking at is a huge network of planted laborers and professionals in the service industry with alot to hide and protect, maniacally duplicitous and as determined, yet as psychologically disturbed as Heath Ledgers "The Joker".

             I'm thinking about these SEIU events, and that we may have been looking in the wrong places (websites, fb and twitter). What about Wikileaks and the events which may be in there?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Anon is saying there should be a paper trail of payments. Where do we have access to paper trails?  wikileaks.

            "Assemblymember Blake [NY] proudly stood with members of SEIU 32BJ to demand a strong and fair contract for **12,000 security workers **negotiating new contracts with their employers. We entrust our security officers with our safety when we visit our cities' most iconic landmarks, such as the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Center, our universities, and government and infrastructure buildings. It is our responsibility to ensure that the people who keep us safe have the financial security that comes with a good paycheck, benefits, and a fair contract. Security officers work tirelessly and are #AlwaysThere for us when we need them. It is our obligation to stand with them when their livelihood is being threatened."

            Interesting .... that screenshot of WikiPedia on MediaMatters contains the following line:
           </p>
           <p>
            "In 2014, the staff of Media Matters voted to join the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Media Matters management had declined to recognize the union through a
            <strong>
             card check
            </strong>
            process, instead exercising its right to force a union election."
           </p>
           <p>
            What did FBIAnon say about "the cards" being important? Apparently, in 2014, the management of Media Matters (hello Mr. Brock) opposed joining the SEIU on the basis of a "card check". Instead, management forced a union election, the outcome of which was that Media Matters joined the SEIU. Many employees felt betrayed by their management:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/28/media-matters-employees-union_n_5229343.html">
             http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/28/media-matters-employees-union_n_5229343.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            All this implies that, based on card checks, Media Matters would have had to join a different union than the SEIU. Since management put a stop to this course of affairs, this means that, somehow, management was not happy about the potential outcome of a card check, or management somehow had a preference for the SEIU. Maybe because the SEIU gave them the most money:
            <a href="http://workerfreedom.org/hypocrisy-matter-media-matters">
             http://workerfreedom.org/hypocrisy-matter-media-matters
            </a>
            ... which casts doubts on the integrity of the union election. Seeing as how this company is run by David Brock, this should not surprise anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe all this means nothing, and I actually don't know shit about how unions operate in the US, but the words "card check" got me triggered. So ... what happened here in 2014? Which MM employees felt betrayed, and why? Why was MM management so keen on the SEIU that they risked all this bad press? What alternative outcome of the card check process did MM management want to avoid, and why?

            But if you stole this gun at 12am, can you buy/acquire these parts in the middle of the night, and then go out at 4am and botch a robbery? 
IF they are proficient with guns enough to do this then wouldn't you think that they probably  already have their own? And someone that weapon savvy isn't going to leave the wallet behind, they'd just shoot the cops too. 
I'm having a real hard time with this FBI stolen guns bit being related to Seth.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               If Brock’s peculiar political shift was not strange enough, more recent reports regarding his mental health are even more unsettling. Brock’s behavior at a Democracy Alliance event in San Diego in 2008 alarmed many observers who believed that he was suffering from mania and potentially had mental health issues. A similar episode in 2010, in which Brock showed aggression, was also disturbing. The Daily Caller reported in 2012 that Brock had become incredibly paranoid, hiring two bodyguards to protect him at all times.
               <strong>
                Brock believed that someone on the political right would try to assassinate him. His personal assistant, Haydn Price-Morris, carried a concealed handgun when Brock attended events in Washington, DC.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Ironically, it was at this time that MMfA received from the Joyce Foundation $400,000 “To support a gun and public safety issue initiative.” When MMfA staffers learned of Price-Morris carrying a weapon, he was fired. This caused Brock to be “terrified” that the story might leak.&gt;

              <p>
               In May 2010, Brock says his lover sent an e-mail to him and his new partner James Alefantis that read: 'David, You and James pulled this same kind of sick nonsense in 2008 to try to hide your financial malfeasance. Next step is I contact all of your donors and the IRS. OK? Do you understand?

            I agree with you.

           <p>
            What I'm saying is that if that's what they did, the bullet wouldn't match the original gun barrel. If the bullet doesn't match the stolen FBI gun, the FBI gun isn't the murder weapon. If the FBI weapon isn't the murder weapon, why would they need to plant a fake story?

             thats what has been bothering me. The gun is less important than the who and why, because the wounds probably weren't fatal. I think he was finished at the hospital after being roughed up in the ambulance whether at 5:57 am or as DRanon said, 8 hours later, either way, who ever shot him had a gun, so even if it was stolen from FBI, that seems irrelevant.  I don't believe for a second that it was a botched robbery. All other aspects suggest a premeditated hit. I think the FBI stolen guns story was later planted to support the botched robbery explanation.

            Here was my initial thought, for what it's worth: 32BJ is big in NYC. I know that they have participated in multiple state grant/funding opportunities to maximize their workforce capabilities in energy efficiency and green energy. Were they feet on the ground for something much larger/Clinton Foundation related. I just heard/saw a video (can't remember...but please let me know if you've seen it) indicating that the Clinton Foundation has been implicated in a Green Energy Ponzi Scheme. This would play to my original theory that the same abusers of HUD money made a switch to Multifamily energy efficiency, and then utility-run energy efficiency and green energy programs as a possible front? Way to bilk money? Along with that, I have often thought that the Climate Initiative by same said foundation was VERY active in "sustainability" initiatives in third world countries...which would give them access to under-priveleged folks ripe for trafficking. I hate to say it, but it almost makes me sick to think that Climate Change has been a scheme all along, to get the masses to "play along," in the meantime using people for trafficking, organs, and eventually to throw them away, or "carbon cap" them as Abel Danger has indicated. Some sick individuals may be at the very top of our government, making wages on who gets carbon capped next, and where. I will have to make another thread, maybe even in a different sub in order to explore this further.

            Shot in the dark, but anyone remember a post about 2guys who were shot in Myrtle Beach just after SR murder?

            someone had made note that this was odd...suggested maybe these were the shooters and they were killed after either for botched job or to silence them. Anyway, using DuckDuckGo I searched on each man's last name plus bj (aguilar 32bj -- first entry returned is a member in HR at SEIU NY) (marmolejo 32bj -- first search result is also an seiu person, and link is to a Chelsea (city) art auction with a very suggestive graphic

            ) not in a place to research further, but found this interesting...(sorry for http insecure but https don't work to get to those sites)

             I believe you are onto something big here. Possibly the shooters of Seth Rich who were chased down &amp; killed to keep them silent. They were 7 hours away in Myrtle Beach but were murdered around that time.
            </p>
            <p>
             They fit all the categories. SEIU , Clinton campaign etc. I have mentioned this other places but it has yet to catch on. Please Start a seperate thread with this information to start the research.

            If a silencer was used, then the "official" story that the Police responded to the gunshots is another lie.

            Yes TPTB are involved. Most people do not know D.C. Police are actually under the President of the United States command per executive order when he pulls it.

            TL;DR - But thought I would straighten out a few things:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Why was a pistol left in a vehicle?  Rifles get locked in vehicles, but it is protocol not to ever leave your service weapon anywhere but on your side or nightstand;
           </p>
           <p>
            2) The FBI does NOT issue suppressors for pistols.  In fact, I'd be shocked if any law enforcement entity issued them for a handgun.  It is possible that one may be issued for use on a SWAT/CAT/HRT team, but those would be for a 5.56 or .30 cal rifle.  But again, those are rarely, if ever, left unattended.  Lastly, even if there were a suppressor for a rifle in the vehicle, it would not work on a .40 caliber (Glock 22) handgun.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) I'm not sold on that serial number on the Glock either.  I cannot find any record that the 3-letter alpha code used by Glock ever employed RYE.  It doesn't really matter.  Just more BS.

            He takes screenshots then erases or changes the 'official' ones? Maybe they caught Seth that way?
            <em>
             Edit to add

            then he sends ppl shared images..while using the official schedule to hide his actions. Which give fake Alibis backed up by fellow criminals.

            FBI agents were originally issued 10mm Flocks before they switched to .40 mm. They aren't issued Glocks with threaded barrels. Currently, they are trying to get the 9 mm approved for purchase.

            Rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic will have no effect. The ships taking on water fast and she's going down no matter what you do. It's time to head to the life boats.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's a commotion up in the bow and the first class purser appears struggling a bit as he walks up hill headed aft. He trundles through a crowd of steerage class with little regard for their feelings and getting more frustrated by their presence with each step. He's heading aft in a hurry with as many life jackets as he can carry. He's followed by a pack of very well dressed men sans life jackets in bowler hats with wives in toe clad in acres of Mink fur. Frustrated the purser yells:
            <s>
             "Women and children first
            </s>
            "Make way for the 1%. I say make way there. God damn it make way! Make way you heathens. Make way. Screw you and your brood of urchins."
           </p>
           <p>
            "But I thought
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vp--AlWBrU">
             the captain
            </a>
            said women and children first. Why can't we go with you?", asked a little urchin named Billy.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Why? Because fuck you that's why Billy. Now scram kid. Get lost.". The purser and the 1% kept walking aft and uphill toward a string of 3 lifeboats the ship's deck hands were busily getting ready to drop to the 34 degree water below.

                That may be true but I'll guarantee there are no Limousine Liberals participating in this investigation. It's their belief system that is about to get deep sixed and that makes their blood boil.

            In Monday's Hagmann report, Liz Croken mentioned that Donna Brazil was the one who told the Seth Rich investigator to stand down, but this is probably old news by now. Hard to keep up.

            It's the union of "Property service workers."
From the Site:
"We work primarily as cleaners, property maintenance workers, doormen, security officers, window cleaners, building engineers, and school and food service workers. But our ranks include railroad and factory workers as well."
           </p>
           <p>
            "We work for private employers, the public sector, and companies receiving government contracts. We work in office, apartment, and government buildings; airports and shopping malls; public schools, colleges, and universities; stadiums, theaters, museums, and country clubs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prominent sites where we work include the Empire State Building, Broadway theaters, and the 9/11 Memorial and Museum; the PATH train system connecting New York and New Jersey; the home stadiums of the New York Yankees and Mets, the New Jersey Devils, the Brooklyn Nets, and the Pittsburgh Pirates and Steelers; Philadelphia’s Franklin Institute; the Connecticut Capitol; and the U.S. State Department, CIA, and Pentagon in Washington."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Our union includes the full breadth of America today. We are a diverse group in every way. We come from dozens of countries all over the world – and from families with long histories in the U.S. But we share the American Dream, a commitment to making life better for working families, and a fundamental respect for the dignity of all people.

            Silencers are highly controlled and there should be a paperwork trail on any legal ones.  I know buyers must register them, and I believe manufacturers do as well.  Its also illegal to cross state borders with them unless you get BATFE approval first.  They are illegal in 8 states and DC.  I suspect a 'shot spotter' would still pick up a silenced pistol, as they do not make the shot 'noiseless' like in movies, but bring the sound down from as loud as a rock concert (hearing damage) to as loud as a jet taking off (minor/no hearing damage).
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, anyone could easily make one from readily-found materials, and order a threaded pistol barrel.  But, theres always a chance that will fail, dunno if pros would go that route.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its extremely difficult to holster a pistol with a silencer, too long.  I cant think of any LEOs that would use a silenced pistol, only some .mil.  More likely they would use a silenced rifle.

               He leaked information which saved the world from Hillary's tyranny. Every person on the planet has directly or indirectly benefited, in a positive way, from Seth's life. And yes, that means you owe a huge thanks to Seth. Even people of extremely low intelligence, such as yourself, have hugely benefited, for the better, from Seth's life.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are few people on this world have have benefited the entire planet. It's comical when someone such as yourself screech yet will never have any positive impact on anyone's life in any meaningful, measurably way. I mean that, it actualy is funny. It's like a retarded child screaming and pointing that everyone else is retarded. No one can think of you as anything other than a screaming, retarded, child with a poopie diaper.

               So there, there. Shhhshshshs.... It's okay. I'm sure someone will be by shortly to help you change clothes. If you're good, you might even get jello. Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Ohhh...you made a poopie in your pants. No, don't put that in your mouth. No, no, stop eating that...

               I don't share donkey's antisemetic POV, but he's probably at least right in that just bc Seth rich got offed, it doesn't mean he was on the right side. Even the bad guys have factions. Not to mention, all I see from this Seth rich stuff is people no longer looking into links that deal explicitly with pg including silsby, NCMEC, Clinton foundation, etc. which tells me it's a false lead. :/ if you think anyone gives a crap about govt officials killing a kid, you're wrong. And even if they did care, it ends there, with murder. Not to the traffick and murder and God knows what else of children.

                It has nothing to do with his death. It has to do with the fact he leaked damaging information which saved the world from Hillary's tyranny. It's irrelevant which "side" he's on. The only thing which matters is that everyone on the planet literally benefited from his life.

            Take these anon posts with a grain of salt. An insider pushing the researchers when he supposedly already knows all the information. Meanwhile there is still no fbi director to do anything about it.

            Thanka for posting this. I cant make heads or tails of how to use 4chan. I started looking in the four local DC SEIU chapters yesterday.  Anon had said earlier to look into SEIU events around time of Seth's death. SEIU events in July 2016 are either well camoflauged or scrubbed from website. Other months of 2016 there, but I couldnt find July. Someone with more skill than me may can find them.

             That's brilliant, this has to be looked into. Can you post the site you were looking on, listing the SEIU events?  It's strange that July has no events when other months have.

              I looked on their site. I looked on Downtown DC site. I googled
             </p>
             <p>
              "SEIU"+"EVENTS"+"Washington DC"+"July 2016"
             </p>
             <p>
              And every other version of that I could think of. Doesnt mean its not there, but I could not find it. I found events for other chapters in other places, but not for 32BJ

            I've noticed that there are no entries for either July 9 or July 10. I really hope this doesn't mean that they've already seen this coming and scrubbed the account before we got the lead. Perhaps there's something leading up to the 10th that might relate?

                   Back to July 7 was in Brooklyn, July 6 shows no location on tweets but pictures suggest Atlantic City same for July 5.

                   Pics from July 2 suggest she was at Edgewater near Chesapeake Bay, tweet has no location tag.

            If a silencer was used then the "shotspotter" explanation for why the police were on the scene so quickly would seem to contradict this.

             A silenced 9mm still produces about 125-130db.  Its basically just enough to get below the 'permanent damage' threshold for a one-time noise.  Still pretty loud and distinctive.

              Even when a silencer is used, there is still an audible noise. I haven't looked at Shotspotter tech recently, but if the gun fired close enough to at least one of the microphones (you need three to vector to a location) then theoretically it should pick something up. For a "job" of this magnitude, we have to assume more than one shooter was armed. If Seth took off running, my money is on more than one shooter firing a weapon. Even trained LEO have a very difficult time hitting just a non-moving target at as close as 10 feet with a handgun, especially under duress. Add to this scenario, a moving target, high stress, darkness. I'll bet the two shots were placed by one gun, and that or the other gun had a silencer on it. The gun used by the shooter who missed may be the source of the slugs that haven't been recovered yet, if there are any, and THAT's the gun they're claiming was stolen.

                There has been talk that he was still alive for about 8 hrs. If that is true then how can they report time of death as0557 hours?  This is perplexing to me.  It just does not add up for me.  Someone has gotten the story wrong or they are downright lying.

             Do you mean the update thread?  If not, no... maybe someone knows.  I'll ask in the OP.

            From looking at the 32BJ's Wikipedia, we see that Hector Figueroa has been the president since 2012. Here is his page on the 32BJ website:
            <a href="http://www.seiu32bj.org/members/hector-figueroa/">
             http://www.seiu32bj.org/members/hector-figueroa/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also 12 other "officers" listed on the right side of his article. None of them look familiar to me, but perhaps one or more of them show up in the WikiLeaks releases.

             After glossing over all the 34BJ officers on that page, only one really stood out: Jaime Contreras
             <a href="http://www.seiu32bj.org/members/jaime-contreras/">
              http://www.seiu32bj.org/members/jaime-contreras/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             He's the head of the 32BJ's Capital Area District, which has over 17,000 members. He's the only one that appeared to be near the DC area, while most of the others were in NYC or NJ. He also has 3 years of military experience in the Navy.

            Thinking the FBI guns contained a silencer. Need to FOIA.  DC Police for report on theft from FBI vehicle.
This report should be at D.C. Police as well as the FBI DC office. FOIA both.

              I have reached out to some in the past with FOIA when I wanted more details (usually though the best thing to do is just send them an email or call them up, they have departments to deal with requests from the public/media).
             </p>
             <p>
              Try contacting the DC police:

             <p>
              The info to contact the detectives is on the flier. You can start there to get the information you seek, I am sure they have an email address as well (can find it if you like).
             </p>
             <p>
              Approach it as they are seeking assistance, you want to offer some, strike up dialog with them (I would suggest not calling them and saying you want to prove hillary shot him and such, make an inquiry).

             Also remember "home-brew" silencers work very, very well. And can be adapted into a wide variety of firearms.

             Threaded barrels can be switched in less than 30 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
             Getting a connection between the threaded barrel and a standard Empty Oil Filter is easy and cheap.

             Standard empty oil filters have the same ballistics as real silencers. As well as the same silencing performance.

              If they swap barrels, the ballistics wouldn't match. If the ballistics don't match, the idea that reporting the weapons stolen would provide for a cover up is null and void.

             It's not listed in the FBI stolen weapons report:

            <p>
             However, it does appear that the Glock-22 is compatible with suppressors. Perhaps looking into the police reports might turn one up, as you've suggested.

              It is not compatible with a suppressor unless you have a threaded barrel.  That is NOT FBI issue.

              , it's a Glock 22 with/without a Osprey (manufacturer) suppressor being fired. All you need is a threaded barrel for the silencer to attach to and you're good to go.

                Yeah, those states and a few others are complete bullshit. It seemed like there was a battle between NY, MA, and CA over which could have the shittiest gun laws. I think Cali is in the lead currently, things have chilled out a bit since Trump is in office.

                You're correct but FBI agents aren't issued Glocks with threaded barrels. The barrel would need swapped which would change the ballistics.

               Glock 22, it's a model not caliber. G22 is in .40 sw if you follow the suppressor idea, it's not a great choice... But it would work.

               "22" is the model of the missing Glock, not the caliber. It was a .40 caliber Glock-22 and we don't yet know whether or not it was used to shoot Seth.

              The image provided in the link is not compatible with a suppressor. The barrel would protrude approximately 3/4 of an inch past the slide.
             </p>
             <p>
              Additionally, fbi issued weapons are not produced with barrels compatible with suppressor.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only other option would be that they stole the weapon and swapped the barrel. Swapping barrels can be done in a very short amount of time but would change the rifling and thus the round wouldn't match an FBI issued weapon.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the ballistics don't match, the theory that the FBI is trying to cover their tracks becomes void.
             </p>
             <p>
              In conclusion, either the ballistics match an FBI issued weapon or a suppressor was used. You won't have both.

                Suppressor don't silence a shot. Most people who run suppressor will also use sub sonic ammo to help reduce the noise butt it will never be silent. A .22 with 60gr rounds out of a suppressed rifle is about as quiet as you're going to get. The .40 cal round is a horrible round for a suppressed weapon but it can be done.
               </p>
               <p>
                To answer your question, a suppressed .40 cal pistol will still have a noticeable sound to it. Truth is, I'm not quite sure how the shot detectors work or the range that they can detect a shot but I'm going to assume that the creators of the shot detector programmed them to detect the report of a suppressed weapon. I can't confirm that but that would be my guess.
               </p>
               <p>
                The other option is that a suppressor wasn't used. If a shot detector was what notified the police, I would venture to say that a suppressor wasn't used.

              Yes.. That is definitely possible with Glock. Also possible that some of the equipment was not mentioned. I know a person on the ground to go check at FBI &amp; DC for reports.

               Is it proved that the FBI stolen weapons are involved in Seth's murder? to me this feels like disinfo or unrelated.

                Not proven except the report of the weapons stolen from FBI is proven. Occurred short distance away. FBI would have cameras, sensors, alarms on car. Very difficult to break in and in fact not allowed to leave these weapons inside vehicle except in a locked rack,
               </p>
               <p>
                To have an unsolved murder with gunshots and a theft of these types of weapons around the same time it would normally be broadcasted.Was a BOL made? Why would the FBI not immediately take over the case? That would be protocol?

                 It sounds like we at least need to dismiss those agents.  If the worst case is true it couldn't happen without their help and at least that's one crum of recourse.  They killed a guy who already leaked.  His death had no immediate value to them.  If we can get them to pay at all they may not do it again.  If we make them really pay they may not have the ability.  If we make them pay none, they will do it over and over again.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dismissing those agents sounds like a priority while it's one thing in our grasp.

              You know, praise is very rare these days, well criticism is not. I am feeling good about myself now, and I am not going to let you discourage me.

                Your being trolled..
               </p>
               <p>
                Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist!
               </p>
               <p>
                1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility.
               </p>
               <p>
                2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well.
               </p>
               <p>
                3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason.
               </p>
               <p>
                4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength.
               </p>
               <p>
                5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do.
               </p>
               <p>
                6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of 'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial.

                Who the hell cares? Let someone with one day in the field feel good about it, all the energy we waste telling so-and-so they didn't earn it yet is energy we're not putting toward solving the problem we're all here to solve. The pettiest of petty kind of talk to get into.

                Maybe some people think I contribute to a little, maybe some think I contribute a lot. All I am saying is that his posting was directed to all of us here, not only to those that have been here for 2 years. His comments made me feel really proud about myself and excited. I am not claiming that he was talking only to me. The last thing we need is to discourage one another or to question who has done the most or the least work here.

                 Hey, the most important thing really is which team you're on. With all the misdirection and deceit and gaslighting going on about us the main thing is staying united in what we believe in. No point in dividing us from the inside and bringing down the entire investigation - plus the fact that we're growing in numbers should be a positive to people, not a negative.
