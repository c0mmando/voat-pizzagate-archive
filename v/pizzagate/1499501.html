<p>This is what I said </p>
<p>Hello Rabbi, thank you for taking the time to read my email. I came across some information and was wondering if you could disprove it. Everything appears to be factually sourced. Could you please help me understand this? I am considering abandoning the Jewish faith.</p>
<p>&quot; First of all you must understand that there are people here that would rather suppress this information and will try to discredit this post, however please note that nobody will be able to disprove the sourced facts I\'ve presented.</p>
<p>It\'s not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It\'s not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It\'s no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I\'m making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.</p>
<p>Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.</p>
<p>The Finders Cult</p>
<p>Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here\'s some information I\'ve compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/Amalek101/1232436">https://voat.co/v/Amalek101/1232436</a></p>
<p>I\'ve identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who\'s behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.</p>
<p>Here\'s the first Satanic band called Coven.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)</a></p>
<p>They\'re also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.</p>
<p><a href="http://sli.mg/senxlZ">http://sli.mg/senxlZ</a></p>
<p>Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.</p>
<p>Bill Traut Jewishhttp://wikivisually.com/lang-de/wiki/Bill_Traut</p>
<p>Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.</p>
<p>&quot;The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called &quot;Satanic Mass&quot; (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as &quot;the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio&quot;).&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)</a></p>
<p>So now I\'ve just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn\'t surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.</p>
<p>I\'m still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what\'s up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.</p>
<p>The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.</p>
<p>I\'m not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.</p>
<p>&quot; You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm</a></p>
<p>Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.</p>
<p>Now here\'s a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.</p>
<p><a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/</a></p>
<p>She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it\'s common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.</p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at their lyrics now. What they\'re describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don\'t forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.</p>
<p>Jewish Blood Libelhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel</p>
<p>&quot; Infants\' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. &quot;</p>
<p>Malchus is a servant to a Jewish high priest.</p>
<p><a href="http://genius.com/albums/Coven/Witchcraft-destroys-minds-reaps-souls">http://genius.com/albums/Coven/Witchcraft-destroys-minds-reaps-souls</a></p>
<p>&quot; In the book of Gideon I have read That the hoarde of evil is not dead In this place where Satan is said to dwell He leads his legions through the depths of Hell&quot;</p>
<p>Gideon was the son of Joash, leader of the Israelites, he won a decisive victory over a Midianite army despite a vast numerical disadvantage, leading a troop of 300 \'valiant\' men.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon</a></p>
<p>&quot; Beelzebub, the prince, is second in line Astaroth, the duke, is drunk with wine Lucifer, the prime minister, handles affairs General Satanachia firmly stares&quot;</p>
<p>All those demons are from the Hebrew bible.</p>
<p>This whole song describes Jewish Satanism. Remember, this was written by a Jew.</p>
<p><a href="http://genius.com/Coven-satanic-mass-lyrics">http://genius.com/Coven-satanic-mass-lyrics</a></p>
<p>Judaism is Satanism. It\'s not a coincidence that all the primary elites busted in paedophile rings are Jews. Epstein has a sacrificial alter on his private paedophile Island.</p>
<p>Anybody claiming that Judaism and Satanism are unrelated is a shill looking out for Jewish interest.</p>
<p>Judaism is Satanism. &quot;</p>
<p>This information was posted in a forum which was discussing the details surrounding  the possible  discovery of a  paedophile ring.  Either this is some top quality sophistry or it\'s accurate information , because I haven\'t been able to disprove any of these claims, and neither have any of my Jewish friends. I\'m hoping you could maybe debunk these claims.  </p>
<p>Thanks &quot;</p>
<p>And here\'s what the Rabbi said. </p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/Pe2pjm">https://sli.mg/Pe2pjm</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/LaUWHE">https://sli.mg/LaUWHE</a></p>
<p>His answer was basically &quot; don\'t think about that stuff&quot;.  The Rabbi wasn\'t able to disprove a single piece of information. </p>
<p>Here\'s what I replied with. </p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/oycWCv">https://sli.mg/oycWCv</a></p>
<p>I emailed this question to about 30 Rabbis and I\'ll combine to post their answers.</p>
<p>I posted information that mod Phobos_mothership didn\'t approve of. </p>
<p>This is what he said. </p>
<p>&quot; Post links and reliable sources backing up your claims and support the fact that this is related to pizzagate, and I will stop deleting these posts. But since you probably can\'t, I probably won\'t.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952</a></p>
<p>So then I posted this and factually sourced ever single claim. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop</a></p>
<p>Then he used this excuse instead. </p>
<p>&quot; This is not a Satanism investigation subverse. Read the rules&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971</a></p>
<p>&quot;That is not what I said. I said prove a direct link between ANY of this bullshit and PIZZAGATE. THIS IS NOT A SATANIST INVESTIGATING SUB.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059</a></p>
<p>So at first he said he was censoring me because I wasn\'t sourcing my claims, and then after I source everything he says that Pizza isn\'t about Satanism, which we all know is bullshit. </p>
<p>He\'s deleting other people\'s comments as well. </p>
<p>&quot; my bad, comment was deleted in error as I was deleting the post (its been a crazy day, if you look at the modlog for removals)&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989</a></p>
<p>And this next comment explains his mentality. </p>
<p>&quot; the burden of proof is on you, shillfuck&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277080">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277080</a></p>
<p>This is the mods attempting to control the narrative. They\'re the gatekeepers.  Funny how his first excuse was that it was wasn\'t sourced, then he says Satanism has nothing to do with child sacrifice and pedophila. </p>
<p>This is fucking disgusting. </p>
<p>Btw, I\'m fairly certain that he\'s the other mod KingKong. </p>
<p>I going to start running the mod\'s comments through a speech analysis program to identify patterns and figure out which mods are using alts to pose as different mods. </p>
<p>This subverse is compromised and I\'m going to expose everything. I won\'t give up.</p>',

           And here's what the Rabbi said.

          <p>
           His answer was basically " don't think about that stuff".  The Rabbi wasn't able to disprove a single piece of information.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here's what I replied with.

           I emailed this question to about 30 Rabbis and I'll combine to post their answers.
          </p>
          <p>
           I posted information that mod Phobos_mothership didn't approve of.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is what he said.
          </p>
          <p>
           " Post links and reliable sources backing up your claims and support the fact that this is related to pizzagate, and I will stop deleting these posts. But since you probably can't, I probably won't."
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           So then I posted this and factually sourced ever single claim.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Then he used this excuse instead.
          </p>
          <p>
           " This is not a Satanism investigation subverse. Read the rules"
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           "That is not what I said. I said prove a direct link between ANY of this bullshit and PIZZAGATE. THIS IS NOT A SATANIST INVESTIGATING SUB."
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           So at first he said he was censoring me because I wasn't sourcing my claims, and then after I source everything he says that Pizza isn't about Satanism, which we all know is bullshit.
          </p>
          <p>
           He's deleting other people's comments as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           " my bad, comment was deleted in error as I was deleting the post (its been a crazy day, if you look at the modlog for removals)"
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           And this next comment explains his mentality.
          </p>
          <p>
           " the burden of proof is on you, shillfuck"
          </p>

          <p>
           This is the mods attempting to control the narrative. They're the gatekeepers.  Funny how his first excuse was that it was wasn't sourced, then he says Satanism has nothing to do with child sacrifice and pedophila.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is fucking disgusting.
          </p>
          <p>
           Btw, I'm fairly certain that he's the other mod KingKong.
          </p>
          <p>
           I going to start running the mod's comments through a speech analysis program to identify patterns and figure out which mods are using alts to pose as different mods.
          </p>
          <p>
           This subverse is compromised and I'm going to expose everything. I won't give up.
