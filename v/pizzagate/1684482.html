<p>I find that due to our lifelong conditioning to presume there to be no connection between paedophilia and power that there are some building blocks that need to be in place to break through the membrane of disbelief, or else people can tend to fail to see the implications and significance of the evidence before their eyes in <a href="http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-pedophile-code-words-podesta/">Podesta’s emails</a> and Alefantis’ Instagram.</p>
<p>I also find the occult / <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1583327">Satanic</a> aspect a barrier to initial red-pilling. It is an important aspect to eventually come to grips with in a full understanding of the phenomenon, but it only pervades and represents a faction of the diversity within the Paedophile community. I therefore de-emphasise examining this aspect with newcomers.</p>
<p>Remember, what’s important is what’s most effective, we are wise to be selective in the truths we emphasise. Once you have someone believing and concerned about the extent of human trafficking and its correlation with power, they will then see/find/accept the occult aspect of their own accord.</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY</p>
<p>I find #Pizzagate is increasingly problematic and #Pedogate is broader, unencumbered by MSM faux debunking, and seems to be the term already used within Intelligence agencies. </p>
<p>I also find conversations less strained, ugly and painful when using the term Human Trafficking (deferring to the Donald’s wisdom here). Referring to yourself as a ‘Child Protection Advocate’ rather than a ‘pizzagate investigator’ also tends to be met with more respect and deference. It makes you seem like a one-man NGO rather than a guy-in-his-moms-basement.</p>
<p>THE POSSIBILITY</p>
<p>If a newcomer regards ‘Pizzagate’ to be part of our constellation of conspiracy theories, we may contend that amongst all possible conspiracy theories this one – the idea that there is a paedophile ring at the uppermost echelons of our society’s power structure - is most credible.</p>
<p>This is because it requires absolutely no alteration or extension of the laws of physics, nature and our understanding of the world to be true. Flat earth, aliens travelling beyond light speed/ through other dimensions to reach us, etc. all defy or expand upon our existential understanding.</p>
<p>What is supernatural about paedophilia? Nothing. What’s new about rich people getting away with crimes poor people don’t? Nothing. If you or I put top secret emails on an unsecured domestic internet connection and then deleted those emails whilst under a subpoena to present them, is there any prospect whatsoever that you or I would avoid a jail sentence? Virtually none.</p>
<p>Ok, so we have established it is a possibility. Now let’s move to</p>
<p>THE PROBABILITY</p>
<p>Researchers who have plumbed the depths of public information surrounding the prospect of the Podestas and the Clintons being involved in child trafficking and abuse appreciate that these suspects are simply the most recent in a long line of scandals, evidence and cover-ups which suggest that a long-established evolving network continues to evade justice.</p>
<p>Hold in consideration that the wider network of clients and accomplices of multiple prior scandals have never been bought to trial. Appreciate that, sequentially from the early 1980’s, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux">DuTroux</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/20/1400-suspects-operation-hydrant-politician-and-celebrity-child-sex-abuse-inquiry">Jimmy Saville</a>, Larry King, Franklin cover-up, Jefferey <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">Epstein</a>, Senator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ZTFVLuvdw">Nancy Schaefer</a>, Laura Silsby, and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert#Criminal_prosecution_and_child_sexual_abuse"> Dennis Hastert</a> cases, we have scenarios where one individual (usually the ‘procurer’ of sex abuse victims) is ‘hung out to dry’. This individual serves some time but the entire network of enablers and clientele has continued ‘on the loose’ to perpetuate and expand the illicit activities. 
This in and of itself should be cause for considerable public concern even in the total absence of new revelations by Wikileaks that the Podesta brothers and Clinton camps may be involved.</p>
<p>One could well speculate on the correlation between these successive failures of justice / fulsome investigation and the alarming increase in the size and scale of paedophile ring busts that have been occurring. In the 1980’s, a paedophile ring bust in excess of 10 people would have been a shocking anomaly. In today’s world we had 380 arrests with 400 children taken to safety (Canada 2014), and 430 arrests with 30 taken to safety (California Feb 2017). We might also mention the 80 <a href="http://yournewswire.com/clinton-norway-pedo-ring/">Norwegian arrests </a>in Nov 2016 with 150 Terabytes of child abuse data. Even in high definition, at an average half-hour 1GB video, we are discussing potentially 150 000 incidences of child rape/abuse, including even torture and homicide. The advent of the internet does not, I argue, explain this growth. It explains their evolving methods, but why would communication technology be an agency in human sexual perversion? Did the invention of the telephone cause a rise in Perjury?</p>
<p>THE PROBABILITY, THE UTILITY, &amp; DYNAMICS OF GROWTH</p>
<p>To newcomers, it may seem inexplicable that such depravity seems to be ‘over-represented’ in the world’s most powerful people. Why? Why Paedophilia? This is to misunderstand the motivation and utility of collaborative child abuse.</p>
<p>If rape is about power, not sex, then organised paedophilia is about ultimate power. Not over the children – that part is easy – but over one’s accomplices. The fear of exposure is a binding contract that enables criminals to overcome lesser fears of wrongdoing in the service of their fellow accomplices – whether to destroy speculation/exposure/adversaries, or to advance their position in power structures.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most critical realisation to accept in order to appreciate the magnitude of the human trafficking issue is that those who participate in it are not random, solo aberrations who manage to connect and collaborate, but rather that it is a depraved network that benefits – and thus deliberately and orchestratedly seeks to expand as a network. Paedophilia is simply and factually the most powerful method of control and coercion in maintaining and strengthening a criminal syndicate and the grip on various levers of power.</p>
<p>Old rich boy’s clubs have long used sexual depravity to enforce loyalty to those desirous of holding the levers of power. We also know that modern ‘Secret Service’ programs have reinforced this dynamic by wilfully cultivating paedophile rings in operations designed to ‘compromise’ anyone of power or influence – to either find or create dirt on people. These sting operations used to involve extra marital affairs or homosexuality, but since these activities lost their social scandalousness, the Intelligence agencies opted for the unthinkable next step. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ4TjAplXjU&amp;t=84s">Media disinclination</a> to show the links and associations between the increasingly frequent and sizeable paedophile ring busts prevents justice, and delayed justice means that more and more 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation victims become paedophiles, whilst their depraved progenitors remain at large to create yet more minions. And with every passing year, the members of this circle-of-perversity seep into every possible position of power -especially such positions concerning the safety of children and the evasion of justice - until the day will come where no man or woman of decent standing will be able to compete successfully for any position of influence without being pitted against the debauched, who are willing to engage in any and every other category of crime to avoid exposure. And those creatures will prevail in vying for those positions even when of lesser talent and experience because the powerful paedophile cult will always select one of their own above a meritorious but uncompromised candidate.
There is a certain depraved logic and a certainty behind the mechanics of growth of a Paedophile mafia once it gets started. </p>
<p>Paedophilia is not just regarded as the most depraved crime by decent people, it is ALSO THE MOST VIRULENT. If you are the victim of a burglary, for example, it is unlikely that this experience will turn you into a burglar. Similarly if you are assaulted, defrauded, raped or a victim of any other crime. But if you are inappropriately sexualised before your time, if your innocence is revoked by someone with far greater power and no genuine regard for you, it is not uncommon for that experience to make you grow up to be a similar predator.</p>
<p>When a paedophile mafia infiltrates the halls of power it will grow in the shadows until all social institutions - especially as refers to justice and the safety of children - are destroyed and perverted to the opposite of their stated cause.
Paedophilia is therefore the crucible for the destruction of a civilization itself, perversion with an inevitability of Biblical themes. As it destroys the artificial social mechanisms of justice, the time is approaching where we may have no recourse but to temporarily revert to our foundation as mammals to find and enact natural justice.
It is therefore imperative, not just for the children but for any hope of a Humanist civilization itself that this phenomenon is exposed, understood, destroyed, and that society takes remedial corrective sociological steps to prevent its re-emergence.</p>

It is therefore imperative, not just for the children but for any hope of a Humanist civilization itself that this phenomenon is exposed, understood, destroyed, and that society takes remedial corrective sociological steps to prevent its re-emergence.

            great stuff. Being able to sidestep any political party implications helps out as well. Love the point about power... that's definitely the main thing. it's not a bunch a people with a predisposition to being sexually attracted to babies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another point is how the collective quality of child development is really one of the most important factors in determining the quality of humanities growth!! Fix the children and we fix our future

            ''I also find the occult / Satanic aspect a barrier to initial red-pilling. It is an important aspect to eventually come to grips with in a full understanding of the phenomenon, but it only pervades and represents a faction of the diversity within the Paedophile community. I therefore de-emphasise examining this aspect with newcomers."
Yes I would have to agree. Bringing this up to people that are not red pilled is very difficult and could scare them off. I absolutely believe this exists but it is very difficult to accept. MkULtra Monarch programming may be another one that shouldn't be addressed in the beginning. That will earn you a tin foil hat even though it is true is as well
