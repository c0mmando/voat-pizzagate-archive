            His first 3 back in November were ok, by 2 weeks after Trumps election Seaman started crying about his health, and then he started shilling for 'goldmoney.com', obviously by that time youtube.com had halted his monetization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Listen folks 95% of us here don't get paid for this shit, Seaman's in it for the money and nothing more. He hasn't added value for more than a month, and google ( owner of YouTube.com ) has every right to ban his ass for blatant advertising of goldmoney.com, even Alex Jones sell's shit, but its like his t-shirts and shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the pizzagate mods have shit a hard-on for seaman, then put a bitcoin collection bucket on the site so that whiners can support whiners.

            Seaman &amp; MILO are fag's, faggotry is a gateway to pedophilia; Why are Jewish gay boys in charge of normalizing pedophilia on
