<p>So, this story begins with the Moaist famine of 1959-1961 where 36 Million people died (~1/20).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine</a></p>
<p>Let that number sink in and then begin to think of what a whole country turned Donner Party ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Party">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Party</a> ) would look like (OK, the Donner Party was closer to ~1/2 but you get the idea).</p>
<p>Now, doing some mild research, yes cannibalism can be born from population control and necessity <a href="https://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/2016/05/13/the-eat-is-on-cannibalism-and-sexual-cannibalism-revisited/">https://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/2016/05/13/the-eat-is-on-cannibalism-and-sexual-cannibalism-revisited/</a> but it can also be addictive <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2157431/Is-America-addicted-cannibalism-Expert-says-psychological-disorder-causes-desire-eat-human-flesh.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2157431/Is-America-addicted-cannibalism-Expert-says-psychological-disorder-causes-desire-eat-human-flesh.html</a></p>
<p>So, when there is a large population of people who survive by eating people, what do you do?  You create laws and try to stop them (unless you are China, in which case you make them part of the communist party (see link in next paragraph)).  But, like all good crimes, there becomes a markets and traditions.  You can see this reflected today in fun stories like <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/china-denies-shipping-marinated-human-8011122">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/china-denies-shipping-marinated-human-8011122</a> (which this one may not be true, but it\'s the Chinese government stating this (so totally trust-able)) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNv-dIP6GNA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNv-dIP6GNA</a></p>

<p><em>Among the most startling revelations in its 13,000 pages is the cannibalism it documents.

An article <a href="http://naxalwatch.blogspot.com/search/label/Cannibalism">http://naxalwatch.blogspot.com/search/label/Cannibalism</a> describes how in 2007 a case of Maoist\'s (though not Chinese) eating a man, in India, they thought was an informant for the police.

<p>Funny enough, we have a president who was a part of the Weather Underground Organization in Chicago (O\'bumer) which came from into being during the Vietnam War <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Weather_Underground">http://www.conservapedia.com/Weather_Underground</a> and may have used those tactics.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is just a thought as to one method of Cannibalism moving into the US in such strength, and how it got to the top of our republic.

             Holy Shit, so much untold in that story.  Wonder if he joined in?  Maybe tried what it was like later.  Or just saw it as a new technique to blackmail loyalty out of people.  ???  Good catch though.
