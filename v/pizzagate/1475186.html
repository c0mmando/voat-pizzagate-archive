<p>Monday, White House counselor John Podesta told a conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that “national security is not the only space” where technological change is “challenging traditional conceptions of privacy.” He cited “a revolution in the way that information about our purchases, our conversations, our social networks, our movements, and even our physical identities are collected, stored, analyzed and used.” Ex-NSA Official Warns Tech Firms: Stop Spying, March 5, 2014

<p>Q     Mr.  Podesta,  or  Secretary Daley, is the catalyst for this the
situation  that  happened  with  the  White  House  computer last year, and
several  infiltration  situations  with  some  of  the  federal  government
computers last year, as well?
MR. PODESTA:  Well, I wouldn\'t describe that as the catalyst for this.
I  think  we\'ve  been working on this for some time, and have -- as I think
Dick  noted,  this  has been going on in a kind of serious formulation as a
policy for several years, and precedes the situation, which was resolved --
with  the  hacker  at the White House -- with an arrest, that occurred last
year.  WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING, January 7, 2000
