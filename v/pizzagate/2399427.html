<p>Related to Pizzagate because Q\'s Feb. 12 post which centered on<a href="https://qcodefag.github.io/data/images/cf3df150312daf57e78936f983fbc527f2e058c6b13e40d90607face2f873184.jpg"> the image</a> of Bill Clinton posing with Kim Sung Il in NK on a rug with two white flowers has sent Pizzagate researchers on fresh investigations into the hideous possibility of people being farmed in slave gardens as &quot;crops&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://qcodefag.github.io">Q</a> asked the question: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coincidence the Matrix (movie) grew people as a crop, used for energy, and controlled their mind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SYMBOLISM OF FLOWERS ON RUG</strong></p>
<p>Q asked, &quot;What are they sitting on?&quot; Both President Clinton and Kim Sung Il were sitting on chairs set upon two white flowers. These flowers are white magnolias, the national flower of North Korea. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in3sDFS6X08">In this instructive video</a>, it states that Kim Sung Il renamed them &quot;mokran&quot; which means &quot;orchid blooming in tree&quot;. It glowingly describes how</p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Kim Il Sung and Chairman Kim Jong Il saw that many Mokran(Magnolia) trees were planted so that Mokran(Magnolia) could bloom over the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we are becoming increasingly aware that all is not well in North Korea, and that, as <a href="https://voat.co/user/darkknight111">@darkknight111</a> discussed today, there <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2398957">are multiple reports</a> of human trafficking and a booming sex trade of women and children in NK, we might very well wonder if &quot;Mokran&quot; indicates something completely harmless and wonderful, or if &quot;Mokran&quot; could be code for human farms in North Korea, the symbol of which would be the white magnolia tree?</p>
<p><strong>LINK TO MOKRAN ENERGY COMPLEX IN IRAN?</strong></p>
<p>With <a href="https://qcodefag.github.io">Q\'s hint</a> a few minutes after the NK photo was posted that, as shown in the movie Matrix, bad actors &quot;grew people as a crop, used for energy&quot;, the recent establishment of an enormous new &quot;energy complex&quot; in Iran called MOKRAN, may not be coincidental. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mokran.ir/default/lang/En">http://www.mokran.ir/default/lang/En</a></p>
<p>It would seem there are numerous energy companies developing this strategically important coastal area: solar, gas, petrochemical, etc. Let\'s hope &quot;people energy farms&quot; aren\'t part of this. I can\'t even believe I\'m saying it, but is it just a coincidence that the flowers on the rug which Q directed our attention to are called &quot;Mokran&quot; and then the discussion leads to &quot;slave gardens&quot; and &quot;people used for energy&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>FAMOUS JACKSON WHITE MAGNOLIA TREE CUT DOWN AFTER CHRISTMAS</strong></p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn\'t mention one other connection with white magnolia which has been in the news. On Dec. 26, 2017, while the First Family was on vacation at Mar-a-Lago, the historic but ailing white magnolia tree on the south side of the White House was severely cut back on orders by Melania Trump.</p>
<p>This iconic tree which is featured on the back of the $20 bill, was planted by Andrew Jackson as a tribute to his wife who died after his election and has been in the background of many historic occasions. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/26/politics/white-house-jackson-magnolia-south-facade/index.html">This CNN article</a> features a strange image of Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton sharing a moment in front of the Jackson Magnolia on the occasion of Hillary\'s first tour of the White House: <a href="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171225155143-magnolia---1-exlarge-169.jpg">https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171225155143-magnolia---1-exlarge-169.jpg</a></p>
<p>It\'s been suggested that Melania had the tree taken down as part of <a href="https://www.infowars.com/melania-trump-had-obama-demons-exorcised-from-white-house/">the extensive exorcism and spiritual purging</a> of the White House. In fact, Q mysteriously announced on Dec. 19, a week before the tree\'s removal, that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SATAN has left the WH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could the removal of the Jackson Magnolia have been a symbolic gesture that the exorcism was complete? The tree was so large it covered the windows of the Presidential bedroom and the dining room and was an intimate part of life in the residence. Laura Bush considered it such an important feature of life in the White House she commissioned a set of china commemorating the tree: <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2009/01/images/20090107-1_p010709sc-0260-515h.jpg">https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2009/01/images/20090107-1_p010709sc-0260-515h.jpg</a></p>
<p>There is a smaller plate with a butterfly, bee and dragonfly: <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2009/01/images/20090107-1_p010709sc-0291-540v.html">https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2009/01/images/20090107-1_p010709sc-0291-540v.html</a></p>
<p>Chelsea Clinton <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/chelsea-clinton-thanks-melania-trump-for-preserving-part-of-the-magnolia-tree/article/2644455">thanked</a> Melania for preserving part of the tree:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thank you to all the Chief Horticulturists and everyone from the National Park Service who have taken care of the beautiful grounds of the <a href="https://voat.co/user/WhiteHouse">@WhiteHouse</a> over the years,” tweeted Clinton, who grew up in the White House during her father Bill Clinton\'s two terms in office. “Thank you <a href="https://voat.co/user/FLOTUS">@FLOTUS</a> for preserving part of a tree I &amp; so many have treasured.”</p>

<p>Of course, this may all be perfectly coincidental and a nothing-burger, but the timing does seem significant.</p>',

             OMG.  I had forgotten about the G Okeefe paintings!  Good on you for that.  So very obvious to those that are woke.  I also agree there is something to this Magnolia Mystery.  What will pan out I don't know but yes,
