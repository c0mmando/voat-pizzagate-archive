            This explains why fakenews media is pushing so hard on removing Trump.  Now, they know  that he knows all about their adoption/child abuse schemes.  I guess no one told them that he was given a heads up about comey wiretapping the trump tower.  They are so stupid, they will strangle themselves spinning around so fast.

             A Russian-American lobbyist says he attended a June 2016 meeting with President Donald Trump’s son, marking another shift in the account of a discussion that was billed as part of a Russian government effort to help the Republican’s White House campaign.

             Rinat Akhmetshin confirmed his participation to The Associated Press on Friday. Akhmetshin has been reported to have ties to Russian intelligence agencies, a characterization he dismisses as a “smear campaign.” He told the AP he served in the Soviet military in a unit that was part of counterintelligence but was never formally trained as a spy.

             Trump Jr.  Kushner, Manafort were all in that meeting.   Which takes us to the top of the Trump campaign and his family.  Who else could be so important they wouldn't name them?

             Flynn?   Flynn is already known to all over this, story would people choose to leave out the name of Flynn?

             I can think of only three folks who get bombshell headlines if we found out they were in this meeting.  Bannon, Ivanka and the President.

            So a couple of Soros paid agents tried to infliltrate Trump for 2 reasons:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              to convince him the channels to bring in Russian orphans should be reopened so the Clinton cabal pedophiles could get their hands on Russian children.  They were hoping DJ would be a pedophile and accept the recommendation.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Comey was hoping to get some dirt on that and anything else, that is why he let her in and let her stay in the country.  Also it gave comey a reason to have trump towers bugged.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
          </p>
