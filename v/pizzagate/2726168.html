<p><strong>Chicago Parish Cuts Up, Burns Rainbow Flag</strong></p>
<p>LGBT flag once hung over sanctuary of gay parish, displayed at Cdl. Bernardin\'s Mass</p>
<p>Parishioners of Resurrection Parish in Chicago, Illinois, held a rainbow flag-burning event last week, cutting up and setting on fire an LGBT flag that once hung in the sanctuary at the parish\'s first Mass. The event was originally scheduled for Sept. 29, the Feast of St. Michael and the Archangels, but the Chicago archdiocese — heeding complaints by gay activists — called the pastor, Fr. Paul John Kalchik, and ordered him not to hold the event. A handful of parishioners took things into their own hands and decided they would burn the flag themselves. </p>
<p>Kalchik is a victim of homosexual rape and abuse, once at the age of 11 and again at age 19. He has been pastor of Resurrection Parish for 11 years. He issued a heartfelt plea to Pope Francis in an open letter calling for an end to clerical cover-up. His strongly worded articles and homilies calling for reform in the Church, in particular denouncing the homosexual predation of clerics, has drawn down the ire of Cdl. Blase Cupich and the Chicago archdiocese, who have threatened to remove his priestly faculties and derail his priestly career. </p>
<p>Here, one parishioner explains the significance of the rainbow flag burned at the parish, which used to hang in the sanctuary, including at the 1991 inaugural Mass presided over by Cdl. Joseph Bernardin.</p>
<p><strong>The Burning of the Banner</strong></p>
<p>It is important to understand why the rainbow cross banner that hung in Resurrection Church when it was formed in 1991 has been burned. This was no regular rainbow flag, but a banner merging the Cross with the rainbow. It was not innocent. It was a signal that this parish would the new &quot;gay&quot; parish, as Fr. Daniel Montalbano\'s previous church, St. Sebastian, home to gay Masses, had burned down. </p>
<p>One of our deacons complained loudly about this banner and what it represented, but those complaints fell on deaf ears. Father Montalbano was a great friend of Cdl. Joseph Bernardin and one of the founders of AGLO, Archdiocesan Gay and Lesbian Outreach. This banner cost $1,000, in a parish whose collection each week was struggling to hit $4,000.</p>
<p>Longtime parishioners and deacons have given accounts of the gay Masses that were held in the basement of the rectory, and the wild all-male parties in the parish house. The real story of Fr. Montalbano\'s death in 1997, at the age of only 50, is too sordid to be detailed on paper. In cleaning out the rectory, many things, including vestments that were used in the hidden Masses, were taken to Fr. Paul\'s family farm and burned there. </p>
<p>Somehow, the rainbow banner was tucked away, but recently found. It is visible in the pictures of the 1991 Mass with Cdl. Bernardin and Fr. Montalbano. Also shown is the parish\'s first Easter Candle, which is curiously sporting a rainbow, too.</p>
<p>No one in this parish, especially our pastor, hates people who have a same-sex attraction. And, in spite of comments by many bishops and even the Pope, the Catechism of the Catholic Church has not changed, nor has scientific research proven that anyone has a gene that makes them born gay. The Church teaches that sex outside of marriage is sinful, and that sex between two people of the same sex is always sinful. </p>
<p>Our Church welcomes all people and we are all sinners, but it does not welcome sin; it welcomes conversion. Jesus says to &quot;pick up your cross&quot;; same-sex attraction is a difficult cross, indeed. Father Paul simply calls us to holiness, as he is supposed to do as a priest.</p>
<p>Father Paul was asked not to go through with a public burning of the rainbow banner, as complaints were heard from the gay community, and those complaints never fall on deaf ears in today\'s culture. Therefore, the burning was carried out privately, by a few parishioners. Our prayer service on Sept. 29, the Feast of the Archangels, will be centered on offering our pledges of prayer, fasting and abstinence to the Lord in reparation for the sexual abuse that has gone on and been covered up for so long. </p>
<p>It is a shame that he\'s been told his faculties as a priest might be taken away. It\'s a shame that we have taken calls from foul-mouthed people who wish him harm. It\'s a shame he has to start sentences, &quot;If something happens to me ... .&quot;</p>
<p>We hope that Fr. Paul will be allowed to continue to pastor at Resurrection. As a victim himself, he has a heart for people who are hurting, lonely or need any kind of special help. He says most of each week\'s 13 Masses, and virtually every wedding, funeral and quinceañera. He leads the Rosary twice a week and prays at an abortion clinic every Saturday morning. He is on the Priests Advisory Board for the Respect Life Office. He says Mass at the Women\'s Center. He supports a local outreach to immigrants. He teaches both RCIA and Catechism classes. He has three regular Communion calls each week but sometimes does more. He keeps this church and its grounds looking beautiful. He fixes and builds things to save money. He truly shows his faith through works. So, to quote the archdiocesan ad for vocations: &quot;Who will fill these shoes?&quot; </p>

             I totally agree, but It's hard to know what to do in this situation.  I suppose they are hoping to keep their church alive, fully knowing the head is evil.  What to do for if you do not give it will kill one of the few parishes that is going in the right direction, with it's head a victim courageous enough to confront the evil monster.  It's a hard to know what to do.  I have not donated to a church for over 25 years for the very reason you mention.  If we do not help those few that are good, well then the whole of the church will go down.  This is their hope.  No, it may not seem legit, but they are trying to hold on as best they can.

             Yes, but it is the ones that have hijacked the community that we must expose.  They don't care about the gay community.  They have another agenda entirely.  They want to corrupt and mess with Our Children's minds and normalize pedophilia.

            its obvious that there are Churches that have lost there way
           </p>
           <p>
            The Catholic Churches are the ones getting hit the hardest at this time and is by all means not the only religious entity abusing children
           </p>
           <p>
            The Pope has made it clear, he doesnt want to deal with this issue
           </p>
           <p>
            and when he does do something, he defrocks them and sends them on their merry way to abuse more children
           </p>
           <p>
            I applaud Fr Paul John Kalchik for speaking out
           </p>
           <p>
            the people of not just  the Catholic Church, but from everywhere need to stand behind this Father and any others who speak against this behavior and drain all religous swamps
           </p>
           <p>
            So many children and the Pope does nothing

             I will put it simply that the pope is trying to kill the RCC.  He has allowed the Lavender Mafia to takeover the Vatican and many parishes across the globe.  The Evil Cabal wants to kill off All Religion.  The devil is at work.  Here is Michael the Archangel's Prayer to keep the devil away, written by Pope Leo XIII who was going through exactly what we are at this time in history.  Say it everyday and read who shortened the prayer.  Hmm.  No matter what religion or your faith this will work for you.  Read it and you will see how powerful it is.  Amazing.

             How billionaire George Soros is trying to hijack the Catholic Church for his progressive agenda
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The large sum of money billionaire George Soros put up to influence Pope Francis’ U.S. visit last fall before a presidential election year and to push the American bishops toward support for radical “social justice causes” was not the first time the leftist financier has used his wealth to try and negatively affect the Catholic Church.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soros paid $650,000 in April 2015 to fund an initiative meant to shape the Pope’s U.S. visit to "shift national paradigms and priorities in the run-up to the 2016 presidential campaign," emails revealed via WikiLeaks show. Among those priorities is inserting his supposed humanitarian nose in other entities’ business to promote his leftward-leaning causes, including population control, abortion, euthanasia, and homosexual “marriage.”
            </p>
            <p>
             But Soros was also paying two leftist organiations to work to get “buy-in of individual bishops” who could be counted upon to show more public support of “economic and racial justice messages” and also secure a collection of bishops “who are aligned with the Pope.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Part of Soros’ plan, according to the leaked document, was for one of his grantee groups to help plan the third
             <strong>
              World Meeting of Popular Movements

             at the invitation of Pope Francis. The Vatican organizes the conference to “partner with social movements and organizations.”

            <p>
             An initiative of Pope Francis, the World Meeting of Popular Movements’ (WMPM) purpose is to create an “encounter” between Church leadership and grassroots organizations working to address the “economy of exclusion and inequality” (Joy of the Gospel, nos. 53-54) by working for structural changes that promote social, economic and racial justice.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Baumann opened the discussion by speaking about some of the experiences that influenced his decision to create PICO. The period during which Baumann was beginning his training as a Jesuit priest was one of change—a decade that included the civil rights movement, the feminist movement, the anti-war movement, and the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II). After his first year of theological training was over, Baumann was assigned to the field in Chicago, where he encountered
             <strong>
              Saul Alinsky
             </strong>
             , the man regarded as the father of modern community organizing.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Saul Alinksy was one of the people who delivered a workshop for us, and he was a fascinating person. The way he could describe the importance of how to make democracy work in our communities and the importance of bringing people together was remarkable,” Baumann said. “So with that experience, with the workshops that Alinsky gave, we were given placements. And my field placement was under the direction of Tom Gaudette, who was an Alinsky lieutenant. Guadette was really helpful in being a mentor to me over the years.

             I have said all along that the reason why we have had problems with putting these people away is that there are so many rat lines like in the Mafia.  They have a cast of thousands that are involved with Soros and SJW  and so on and so on.  This is connected to this and that.  But ultimately a lot of it is that Soros and the Vatican are working together to kill the RCC.  Flooding it with gays and pedophiles is the plan.  Of course, Soros and the Clintons are connected and YES the Clintons are connected to Hasim Thaki PM of Kosovo and he is being investigated for arms, drug and trafficking and organ harvesting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is my post on Thaki and Organ Harvesting  and his Clinton connections.  Joe Biden also invited him to the White House.  It all connects.

            Aside from the twisted, blasphemous details surrounding this, I deeply ache each time the rainbow is brought up. This is God's rainbow, a sign He made as a covenant between Himself &amp; the earth He created. (See Genesis 9:13)
All these sickening revelations people are uncovering &amp; sharing are helping to draw a line in the sand between good versus evil. Although righteously enraged, I'm thankful that things are becoming less blurred. God gives us each free will &amp; each day we can choose good or evil; plain &amp; simple. However, not one of us know the remaining number of each of our days. 
Thank you,

             I truly appreciate your kind words.  I too am angered by what they have done.  Total switcheroos on many things and they have turned the beauty of God into something dirty.  I have not gone to Church for years, but have not lost my faith.  This has only emboldened me.   It has only been strengthened. +

             100% agree with you. I can't bear to live if this will be the norm. I went to a soccer game on the weekend to see my 11 year old niece play in the grand final. The opposing team had two male trannies. One was the goalie and one was the striker. Guess which team won. I brought up the subject but was instantly made  to feel wrong for doing so. My blood boiled with anger for the rest of the day.  :(

             I can understand losing patience.  It burns me up too.  I totally agree.  I have nothing against their lifestyle but the gay priests taking over in the parishes is abominable.  There is talk that there are many many gays now in the priesthood.  Some wild percentage.  I have heard anywhere fro 30 to 60% and they have pretty much taken over the Vatican, but they are getting push back.  Exactly, there are only TWO SEXES.  They would like to create tranny as another one.  SICK.  Keep your hands off of Our Children.

              I believe that there are people who are born gay and I have no problem with adults deciding that this is what they choose to do. However, the damage done to our children through sexual abuse by adults is evil.

               Yes!  I agree.  And yes, there are many from both groups gay and hetero that abuse Our Children.  They are all monsters, imo.  I don't care who they are or what sex or furries or what. They come in all different stripes.

             I can bet much of his death has been scrubbed or it's on page 200. lol.  I too believe it is immoral in that the Church teachings say it is.  If you don't like it don't become a priest.  Get out and stop poisoning the Church and its Religious Teachings.  Also the are evil in that it is excessive sex and sometimes they end up erasing someone, if you know what I mean.  Bernardine was a monster from things I have read.  Can you imagine what went on in the Mansion, sex parties galore.

            Really important info. The gay agenda has taken over and no one can even speak out about it without a media firestorm raining down on whoever made the remark. But, I mean, it's getting ridiculous, especially with the transgender nonsense. Have you looked at Serena Williams lately? Come one! She's a dude, but I guess no one is allowed to even openly discuss it and

            I don't care if someone decides to change their gender ... I do not. But I do object to the farce of a man squeezing into a tennis dress and dominating as a woman. It's not fair, it's not right, and yet, there it is. 
And in the priesthood? The introduction of this element has taken debauchery to new levels of perversion.

             I am totally convinced Serena is a man as well.  My husband smirks, he does not get it.  WOW.  He is a man and he doesn't see it.  This last ad they keep blasting over the airwaves day and night, well, It has even strengthened my feelings.  Most of the pregnancy pictures are fake now, yes.  Laughable really.  Yes, the children come from Haiti, and where Madonna and Angelina get theirs.

             Yes, well the priests.  The Lavender Mafia has taken over the Vatican and has spread it's tentacles into the rectories in America, and actually all over the world.

            It is important to understand why the rainbow cross banner that hung in Resurrection Church when it was formed in 1991 has been burned. This was no regular rainbow flag, but a banner merging the Cross with the rainbow. It was not innocent. It was a signal that this parish would the new "gay" parish, as Fr. Daniel Montalbano's previous church, St. Sebastian, home to gay Masses, had burned down.

            Merging the Cross with the Rainbow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Longtime parishioners and deacons have given accounts of the gay Masses that were held in the basement of the rectory, and the wild all-male parties in the parish house. The real story of Fr. Montalbano's death in 1997, at the age of only 50, is too sordid to be detailed on paper. In cleaning out the rectory, many things, including vestments that were used in the hidden Masses, were taken to Fr. Paul's family farm and burned there.
           </p>

            Too sordid to put on paper.

              “The whole church became a dance floor, even the altar area,” kath.net reported. “There the dancer took the Gospel in his hand, stepped almost naked to the ambo, and lolled suggestively in front of the altar.”
             </p>
             <p>
              There could be more of this going on than we think.   So sickening.

                Oh God.  So sick and sad.  It is getting worse by the minute.  They have been allowed to have their gay parties etc. and have no fear because hey, the holy father is all in favor.  Beyond Sick and Disgusting!!!   The DM does a good job on these articles.

                I know!  I can't believe it. The old expression, It's gone to the dogs.  I hate to say it that it will have to get extremely worse for people to get into the streets.  Let's hope the protest is HUGE.

               carmencita i'm glad there is somebody around here with a mind like a computer like yours. My mind used to hold all these details but over the last twenty years it just all runs together in my head. You have a mind for details like a steel trap.
