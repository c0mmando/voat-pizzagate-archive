<p>A Russian nuclear executive, whose company was the target of an FBI investigation and who admitted to corrupt payments to influence the awarding of contracts with the Russian state-owned nuclear energy corporation, paid millions of dollars in consulting fees to an American firm in 2009 and 2010 to lobby the U.S. regulatory agencies and assist the Russian\'s who were then attempting to acquire twenty percent of American uranium, according to court documents, a former FBI informant and extensive interviews with law enforcement sources.</p>
<p>Roughly $3 million in payments from 2009 to 2010 were made to APCO Worldwide Inc., which is described on their website as the second largest lobbying firm in the United States. The firm also provided in kind pro-bono services to Bill Clinton\'s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, services they begin 2007, according to APCO officials who spoke with Circa and press releases from the company. It was during the same time that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was part of the Obama administration board that would eventually approve the sale of the U.S. uranium to Russia.</p>

            Why do you think this is more boom?  The article doesn't even seem allege APCO did anything wrong.  It did not challenge this statement from APCO
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             APCO Worldwide Inc. said in a statement to Circa, "APCO was not involved on any aspect of Uranium One, or the CFIUS process relating to it. APCO Worldwide undertook activities on behalf of Tenex in 2010 and 2011 relating to civil nuclear cooperation, which APCO properly disclosed in detail at the time in public filings. Separately, since 2007-2008, APCO provided services in kind to the Clinton Global Initiative. APCO’s work for Tenex and APCO’s work for the Clinton Global Initiative were separate and unconnected, publicly documented from the outset, and fully consistent with all regulations and US law."
            </p>
            <p>
             APCO also told Circa in the statement that "Milkerin was not involved in APCO's contract with Tenex and APCO did not have any relationship with him."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This just seems to be standard lobbying and if they declared properly, there's no issue.  Did I miss something?  This is the closest they get to even making any sort of allegation?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             An informant who aided the FBI with their four year investigation into the money laundering and kickbacks an Tenex said he had conversations with Grigoriev about APCO contract.

            They also paid The Podesta Group.....that is a big fuc*ing problem for the obvious reasons but Johnny boy was In Obama whitehouse as well as "counselor" and there are many articles about Tony sliding right up close. As they took money from every government known to man to lobby. Saudi Arabia, Russia....
