<blockquote>
<p>SIR Jimmy Savile could help fix it for a former Edinburgh factory worker to become Scotland\'s first woman saint in over 800 years. The Vatican is to finally examine an apparently \'miraculous\' cure of the veteran TV star, who believes his life was saved by Margaret Sinclair when he was just one year old. <strong>A report on the DJ has lain in a vault in Rome since his case was first reported back in the Thirties. But now the Pope has ordered it to be looked at with a view to speeding up Margaret Sinclair\'s canonisation cause</strong>. A Vatican spokesman said: &quot;The Pope is personally aware of Margaret Sinclair and believes she is a very holy woman. He is deeply moved by her simple faith and is keen to see her cause moved forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Canonisation is a lengthy process, sometimes taking hundreds of years, but Pope John Paul II, who has created more saints than any previous pontiff, has been keen to accelerate the process. It is known that he wants Mother Teresa canonised by the Millennium. Sir Jimmy said he would be \'delighted\' if his case led to Margaret Sinclair\'s sainthood. &quot;If this Pope has canonised more people than any other, then let\'s get a move on.&quot; &quot;Margaret has always been a special friend to me. I was in Edinburgh a few weeks ago and I stopped by to pray at her grave,&quot; he said. Sir Jimmy , a devout Catholic, was just one year old in 1926 - the year after Margaret Sinclair died - when he became seriously ill with a fever. <strong>But he believes he was cured after his mother prayed to the Edinburgh woman who died in a London convent when she was just 25.</strong></p>
<p>The last Scottish female saint was St Margaret of Scotland, in the 13th century.</p>

            , I'm going to have to remove this per Rule 3. We require accurate, factual submissions, especially headlines. This headline states Sinclair was promoted for sainthood because she saved a pedophile, as part of a pedophile ring. That is not what the articles you linked to say: she was dead and he was one year old and certainly not yet a pedo. Also, his cure is not the reason she was being promoted -- by her religious order, not the Vatican -- she was being promoted due to her exceptional life. Several medically documented miraculous cures post mortem are required before someone can be beatified and then canonized. Your headline is totally inaccurate and pushing a false narrative.

            Trying to Save the Life of a Heinous  Criminal Child Rapist is a Blasphemous Act.  The Vatican is  the House of $atan.  Saville used to go into the Hospital at night as well, to visit the children.  And it was not to bring them Hot Cocoa.

             Carmencita, Saville was a one-year-old infant at the time, not a Heinous Criminal and she was no longer on this earth. Also, Catholics believe the whole point of the Crucifixion was to free even the worst criminals from sin, so that would make Jesus a blasphemer. That same human logic is what got him convicted by the Sanhedrin.

              I must admit I misread it at first, and got confused, but the fact that there was a connection in the life of Seville and the pope, there is something strange about the pope feeling he must canonize a woman that saved the life of a pedophile of such massive proportions.  She may have done something good when Saville was a baby but being he defiled so many children, I can't believe it was a good deed done by the pope.  I believe he was on to what Jimmy was doing even though it did not come out until after his death.

               But that all happened before Saville was exposed. Pope John Paul II was dead by then. The article quoted was from almost a decade ago.
