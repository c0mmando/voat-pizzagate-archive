            If you want to get back at the WaPo, stop doing business with it's owner (Jeff Bezos): stop buying things at amazon, seek other alternatives for where you are purchasing from.. if possibly purchase things physically at an independent store.. 
The less we support economically Bezos, the better!!

             If it took him all month to write the tweet-It wouldn't make a difference. Destroying John Podesta Is Trumps Job. Obviously others as well, But we all hate podesta the most-I'd Be inclined to argue that trump feels the same way.   Never Do I claim to know what moves trump should make
             <sub>
              And by that i mean-I claim to know every move he should make
             </sub>
             But his next move should be a simple Tweet saying;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "@johnpedesta You are my job,skippy" 
Yes-even with the incorrect spelling.
             </p>
            </blockquote>

             <strong>
              Side Note:
             </strong>
             I will pay 100 dollars to the person who can make me understand the mindset/thought process of john Podesta and CO.
             <strong>
              I don't mean the mindset of fucking and selling kids, (assuming he fucks em too?), Selling state secrets, toppiling Nations, Corrupting every person in power.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             As fucked as is it to say,
             <em>
              I totally understand that mindset
             </em>
             . What I don't understand Is how John podesta, Hillary, fucking CNN, can't just accept that their best chance at surviving this, Is to go away. Just fucking go away. Or start sucking trumps dick. There is  no Third door that benefits them. Never has there been a single example of this cunt opening his mouth, and saying something that helps.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm at the point where I'm contemplating the notion that Trump really is the most evil dictator we've ever seen and that all these people we believe to be evil, are actually all put in place to grow trumps support.
            </p>
            <p>
             To clarify, I don't believe that in the slightest..... I'm just saying that makes more sense than these retards opening their mouths and making everything worse on a daily basis....I mean, This pathetic fuck had the ear of 2 presidents(almost a third).... And why. I mean, Putting evil aside, Isn't there someone smarter that could have done what skippy has done over the years?  Why fucking skippy? Because by all accounts-He's a god damn child fucking retard.

              First off, totally get your point and i feel your disgust. These are seriously sick fucks

              I think they know they are enraging and waking up some people right of centre. But they are playing to their base. The delusionoids who they are trying to whip up into a #TrumpRussia frenzy. Essentially they know the longer time goes by, the more control Trump will get, the more their power structure will unravel, the more secrets will spill, the more the public will tire and get irritated by the incessant noise of anti-Trump hysteria... they are running out of time. So some of it is desperation, some of it is desperately trying to turn up the temperature hoping something will stick and they can bring down Trump or create a civil war (they will lose).
             </p>
             <p>
              Essentially Podesta is forced into a kamikaze attack, for sitting back and doing nothing is not an option. Thats how i see it. And yes his tweets come across as desperate. I think he is bricking it.

              My take on it, and I could be wrong, is that the elites are trying to end capitalism &amp; end sovereign nations... to get a one world government, a communistic open society that they can rule over... and all of us minions can all be "equally" poor &amp; reliant on them - for everything.  This is why Marxism has taken over our society - from schools indoctrinating our kids, to Hollywood &amp; MSM distorting our reality &amp; promoting degeneracy, to feminism &amp; the welfare state ruining our traditional family values, to the open borders / "refugees" bringing in thousands of third worlders to collapse our system, our way of life.  The thought police, the Fed controlling our money, the fascists that call themselves anti-fascists.... labeling everyone a racist Nazi that doesn't tow the line.... it is all meant to destabilize the free world.  They are indoctrinating our kids that guns are bad, so in 30-40 years they can easily out law them without a fight - and if they get our guns, we will be done - our freedom will be lost forever.  This is why the likes of Soros &amp; the Rothschilds are funding all this chaos.  If the entire world is in utter chaos, they can gain more control over everyone.
             </p>
             <p>
              The "elites" that are in power are corruptible because power &amp; control are addictive.. they want more, and their overlords are promising more &amp; more - and they think that THEY will stay elites in the NWO, but they are just being used as pawns and will either be killed or just be a nobody like us after they're usefulness is done - the Useful Idiots.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have had that thought about Trump too, that all this is a rouse to gain him support - it does make perfect sense.... but I am going to keep on believing that he is the true outsider, he is beholden to no one except the American people.  He doesn't have to answer to Qtar or the Saudis - he can make decisions &amp; deals based on our interests.... not the highest bidder.  And skippy is their because he was blackmail-able from the beginning.... he knows all the secrets now (and if he was smart he would have a kill switch - is that the only reason he is still alive??).  They need dirtbags like him because they have dirt on him to hold over his head, they have complete control over him.

               True, Skippy and company are not speaking to us, he is speaking to his base. 
He doesn't care if you think his words have a deleterious effect. This is agit propaganda to keep the anti trump ferver going.  Perception deception.

               Everyone from birth has been programmed to embody a specific ideology. All the controllers do nOw is pull the strings of said ideology.  This is what the Spider-Man Elsa programming is about.

                Dude. Do you know anyone, who knows someone that would fall into john podesta's base?   Unless you just mean people who are well aware of the real podesta, yet have to defend/support him? Because if by base we mean; People that have never met him, but support him because they are actually under the impression he's a good guy,... Then I gotta say it'd fall between 7 and 0. A maximum of 7 people fit into the latter category, Possibly zero.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you're considering his base to be anyone who HAS to support him, then I gotta say this still hurts him.
               </p>

                I mean dude. Coming full circle here....you're applying waay too much rationale in your thought process.

               <p>
                There is no benefit to his tweets, and if there is one, It's sure as fuck not going to be that clear cut and rational.

He's not losing any support, but you know that even some of the most precious of snowflakes are reaching their breaking point.... Or at least some reluctant hillary supporters.

               It makes sense because the actual situation make no sense.  The only way to make sense of this nonsense, is to realize that it doesn't make sense to assume things need make sense.  It all makes sense once you realize nothing makes sense. We were brought up thinking that's how things work... Things just make sense... If they didn't make sense, then they wouldn't be. 
The craziness that's been unfolding on regular basis, Doesn't make sense... So it Shouldn't be. It shouldn't be happening, because it doesn't make sense... but its happening.
              </p>
              <p>
               Make sense?
              </p>
              <p>
               No but seriously...
               <strong>
                I should have been more clear about my 100 dollar offer.
               </strong>
               I understand the agenda behind the elites, I understand what they want to happen, and how the majority of the population are irrelevant to them, as long as they don't pose a danger.
              </p>
              <p>
               But they are failing miserably at every step of the way. What absurd tactic has furthered their agenda? Recently I mean?  For example, How could john podesta type out that tweet, Hit send... And Carry on business as usual. How does he think typing that will help him. Further more, why do any of his cohorts allow it?  Every time he says something retarded.... It has the full support of the people above him, Or he would not be allowed to tweet it. So is there a method to this madness?  Are they scuffing at Trumps 4d Chess skils because they are playing 6d?
              </p>
              <p>
               Or was this world actually run by retards? I don't care how smart you are in any given subject. You're a god damn retard if you do or say the things John podesta has done/said in the last year. You can't even apply the " They are just narcissistic sociopaths"  I mean, I'd imagine Sociopaths traits dominate Narcissistic traits... So you think by now they'd have to start changing tactics after every fail.... But they don't.
              </p>
              <p>
               Admittedly, A lot of their tactics have worked.  I guess I'm specifically talking about the people saying stupid things(JP).  I mean, this isn't being covered by every news outlet 24/7, and the majority of the population doesn't care.  But honestly, we are a lot to blame for that. We've made a lot of mistakes that could still be revised, but unfortunately that doesn't look like it will happen anytime soon.

                Have you considered that perhaps there is a far larger event happening before us and as long as we're entertained and absorbed by this madness charade, the thing which we should really be concerned about is taking place and they know that the time is upon us and by the time it's all said and done, what's happening now will not matter a bit.

                That's what I've been thinking since the election recounts and it has chilled my blood. I don't know where to look to find the real concern, but I know what's on stage right now, however tremendous it is to me, isn't it.

                I know exactly what you mean, and it is frustrating to those of us that do pay attention &amp; aren't programed like the masses are.   A majority of America is more concerned about the Kardashians than actually knowing and understanding what is going on in this world.

                of Yeri Bezmenov he explains how the KGB worked to destabilize &amp; demoralize our nation.  At ~5:00 he talks about ideological subversion and how even putting facts right in front of someone that is brainwashed, they can not see it.  The majority of our country is brainwashed and have been since they were kids - they can not be saved from this - they are "contaminated".  Skippy can tweet whatever he wants and the brainwashed will just see it as a poor victim of mean old Trump.

                And to add to it, those of us that do see through the b.s. are labeled wacko conspiracy nuts.  And TPTB's crimes are so horrific and unbelievable that what we say does sound crazy.  It is so much easier to go through life taking the blue pill with your blinders on, just living your routine.  It is much harder to actually think for yourself and realize what is really going on beyond our puppet government - realize that there is a much darker force trying to slowly end our freedom, end our way of life.... but the longer the masses ignore it, the easier it will be for them to take it over completely.
